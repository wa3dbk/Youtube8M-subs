00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.220
 why 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.390
 and everything you leave waste 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.690
 in the musical theme of a help from the 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.690
 spas 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.440
 mainly that I'm going to make a 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.090
 pigeon lights guitar and we're going to 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.680
 put a few doilies so that they 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.840
 see very nice and we will reuse them 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.719
 you already know how to take care of the planet 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:45.920
 energy and good with a little love with 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:49.840
 a touch nothing is idyllic, I'm going to 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.840
 look here because if you're alone 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.610
 It will not be lost, well, if we go 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.350
 to make a garland of ado by the 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.329
 war gives to adorn exactly with 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.670
 a few of blonda and it's very simple 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.470
 of doing them we are only going to reuse 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.869
 an extension of lights of which 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.420
 we have lots of these dates 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.180
 Christmas and good I chose it white 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.390
 but we have garlands 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.729
 varied colors intermittent or 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.460
 Fixed intermittent and the only thing we're going 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.600
 to use are the paper doilies that 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.160
 are available in any store 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.619
 pastry is already in the stationery is 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.990
 get and nothing better if we want 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.479
 use our lace as well as this one what 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.420
 The only thing we have to do is cut it 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.500
 with a pair of scissors we are going to make a cut 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.500
 in between 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.550
 it is perforated 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.920
 and the only thing we are going to do is 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.560
 insert it in the spotlights and it's not going to 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.720
 fall because the lace holds 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.340
 stops along with the focus and here what 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.250
 we can wrinkle if we want to give a 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.570
 little bit more texture for the time that 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.490
 is hanging also has a little bit of 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.860
 texture now well also if we want 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.160
 use it for a romantic weekend 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.410
 to decorate the house to conquer 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.410
 the good couple can cut it in 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:10.280
 exact heart shape to conquer 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.850
 to the couple to the couple I said is you 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:19.070
 You are my partner but like the Comanche 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:20.180
 really not good but the couple of 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.210
 partner 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.430
 Rodriguez on the shore, we cut a 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.340
 heart and heart good too 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.770
 obviously we have to cut it in 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.770
 medium 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.620
 to be able to insert our focus 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.650
 and then we can have our war 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.590
 give to erase yes that appears then 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.680
 so we have left as a Hawaiian skirt 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.310
 also, but well, we finish this 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.540
 section 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.540
 I'm waiting for t
