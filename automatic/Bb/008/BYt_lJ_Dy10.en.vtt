00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
like some kind of a tape that covers the

two<00:00:47.430> e<00:00:47.460> match<00:00:47.760> wire<00:00:48.770> you<00:00:49.770> can<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.190> says<00:00:51.320> 0.5

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
two e match wire you can see it says 0.5

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.209 
two e match wire you can see it says 0.5
color<00:00:53.579> torch<00:00:53.879> green<00:00:54.410> that's<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.710> particular

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
color torch green that's this particular

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.729 
color torch green that's this particular
one<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.670> 0.5<00:00:57.030> meter<00:00:57.480> initially<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.379> thought<00:00:58.620> it

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
one the 0.5 meter initially I thought it

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.250 
one the 0.5 meter initially I thought it
was<00:00:58.859> how<00:00:59.010> long<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.730> match<00:00:59.940> was<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.480> was<00:01:00.780> wrong

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
was how long the a match was I was wrong

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.410 
was how long the a match was I was wrong
it<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.500> height<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> flame<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.850> 0.5

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
it is the height of the flame so 0.5

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.060 
it is the height of the flame so 0.5
meters<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.049> they're<00:01:07.500> saying<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:07.890> going<00:01:08.010> to

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
meters so they're saying it's going to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.969 
meters so they're saying it's going to
be<00:01:08.750> 18<00:01:09.750> inches<00:01:10.049> tall<00:01:10.400> about<00:01:11.400> half<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.729> meter<00:01:12.979> and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
be 18 inches tall about half a meter and

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.580 
be 18 inches tall about half a meter and
it<00:01:14.270> sounds<00:01:15.270> pretty<00:01:15.509> accurate<00:01:15.990> when<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.200> did<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
it sounds pretty accurate when I did the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.980 
it sounds pretty accurate when I did the
video<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.570> estimated<00:01:18.570> them<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.810> be

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
video of the one I estimated them to be

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.859 
video of the one I estimated them to be
about<00:01:19.200> two<00:01:19.500> feet<00:01:19.710> tall<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.369> uh<00:01:20.509> pretty<00:01:21.509> close

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
about two feet tall so uh pretty close

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.730 
about two feet tall so uh pretty close
18<00:01:22.680> inches<00:01:23.009> 2<00:01:23.820> feet<00:01:24.979> this<00:01:25.979> one's<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.280> green<00:01:26.520> one

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
18 inches 2 feet this one's a green one

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.350 
18 inches 2 feet this one's a green one
they<00:01:28.740> come<00:01:28.950> green<00:01:29.280> blue<00:01:30.000> yellow<00:01:30.450> purple<00:01:31.170> red

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
they come green blue yellow purple red

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.120 
they come green blue yellow purple red
there<00:01:33.360> may<00:01:33.479> be<00:01:33.509> other<00:01:33.810> colors<00:01:34.049> I'm<00:01:34.470> not<00:01:34.650> sure<00:01:34.860> I

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
there may be other colors I'm not sure I

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.890 
there may be other colors I'm not sure I
only<00:01:35.490> got<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.970> green<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.450> blue<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.869> yellow

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
only got the green the blue the yellow

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.120 
only got the green the blue the yellow
and<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.409> purple<00:01:38.119> I<00:01:39.560> was<00:01:40.560> real<00:01:40.740> happy<00:01:40.860> with

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
and the purple I was real happy with

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.270 
and the purple I was real happy with
them<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.400> did<00:01:41.790> test<00:01:42.270> them<00:01:42.450> out<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.189> you<00:01:44.189> know

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
them I did test them out and you know

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.800 
them I did test them out and you know
it's<00:01:44.430> instant<00:01:44.880> ignition<00:01:44.970> with<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> match

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
it's instant ignition with the match

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.690 
it's instant ignition with the match
that<00:01:46.140> having<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.470> pre<00:01:46.740> matched<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.310> really

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
that having it pre matched is really

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.630 
that having it pre matched is really
really<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.970> nice<00:01:48.240> feature<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:50.280> don't<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.549> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
really a nice feature you don't have to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.030 
really a nice feature you don't have to
mess<00:01:50.820> around<00:01:50.970> with<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> fuse<00:01:51.540> or<00:01:51.710> delay<00:01:52.710> times

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.140 
basically some kind of a certification
saying<00:02:19.320> that<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.710> know<00:02:19.890> what<00:02:20.760> you're<00:02:20.910> doing

saying that you know what you're doing
with<00:02:21.240> fireworks<00:02:21.950> basically<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.040> what<00:02:23.190> it

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
with fireworks basically is what it

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.150 
with fireworks basically is what it
sounds<00:02:23.580> like<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:24.090> don't<00:02:24.930> know<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:26.040> know

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
sounds like I don't know you know

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.590 
sounds like I don't know you know
exactly<00:02:26.310> what<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.820> have<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.060> have<00:02:27.090> but

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
exactly what you have to have but

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.090 
exactly what you have to have but
apparently<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.470> don't<00:02:28.650> have<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.890> have<00:02:29.010> the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
apparently you don't have to have the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.890 
apparently you don't have to have the
type<00:02:29.280> 54<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:29.940> have<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.150> have<00:02:30.240> some<00:02:30.510> kind<00:02:30.690> of<00:02:30.780> a

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
lot of places that sell them I guess

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.780 
lot of places that sell them I guess

certainly there's not nearly as

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.900 
certainly there's not nearly as
difficult<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.959> get<00:02:52.140> which<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:52.980> great<00:02:53.430> because

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
difficult to get which is great because

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.240 
difficult to get which is great because
there<00:02:54.240> are<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.330> really<00:02:54.630> really<00:02:54.870> nice<00:02:55.020> thing<00:02:55.470> to
