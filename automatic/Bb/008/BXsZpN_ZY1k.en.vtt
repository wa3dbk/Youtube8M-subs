 Any number of well by cooking method is to much

 As much as possible Does it know what Well in a sense com that 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:22.710
 Yes where you want to use something fresh 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:25.330
 I bought that fish through the basic Arou Numazu market 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.150

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:33.650
 It is after Well vegetables 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:37.159
 The vegetables are local vegetables and then various things from the whole country then 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.989

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.989
 Yes I use Yes 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:55.400
 Originally there was a part that I came from when I was young 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:04:00.620
 Conversely , when it comes to this year and you think about it with a sense of doing nothing 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.970
 I wonder if I do I mean Tsu 's not the rational Well I'd might be far-fetched a little 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:10.620
 Even that double six 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:14.400
 The morning terms of performance when compared with the latest type of club car Yeah I am a child does Mase that taste 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:19.650
 In some cases, I sometimes don't have fy 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:23.840
 It is part iron not that this kind of force money to say so is but I have a place Tteyuu 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:29.620
 The attraction of the part that is not rational there is someone full of pen drawings 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.620
 I is for the See you feel that kind of charm 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:38.339
 I would still taste Well I put might Schiesser in a Tari's also atmosphere if 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.619
 For what 

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:44.189
 It But I might bouquet or I may sound Tteyuu Well 10,000 thousands by Well thought how 

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:49.409
 I want 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:51.539
 Of copper say where the decision say so say whether or not there is worth paying money in against what 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.840
 Is that what you mean? 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.090
 Jaguar 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:00.910
 The say people choose is 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:05.110
 Canaan it is that's the best though but I of course called me the specs it Toka performance after all 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:10.810
 It does not mean using the money for it because there is no story in it and bought a 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:15.080
 In I guess a place Tteyuu something from if they were satisfied if we are satisfied it can not be obtained anymore 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:19.880
 On this day I Would not you still have reasonable in my case 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:24.260
 It is priceless to say that it is an overspec part or more 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:27.650
 Because I think that it is worth not being able to change to money if it is a part 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.070
 Even if it's a little expensive 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:35.060
 It feels like 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:39.680
 I feel that the old people have something new in their place, but it is also strange 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:41.030
