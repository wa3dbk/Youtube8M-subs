Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:05.009
Today we’re going to show you how to change
the drain hose on your dishwasher.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.469
It’s a really easy job; all you’re going
to need is a quarter in nut driver, and a

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:10.469
5/16ths nut driver.

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.799
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.780
Now the best way to do this repair is with
the dishwasher pulled out of the cabinet;

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.980
so you will need to unattach the mounting
tabs on the top of the dishwasher that fasten

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.480
to the bottom of your countertop.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.890
You’ll also need to remove the lower access
panel to gain access to your electrical connection

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:43.150
and to your inlet water connection; you’ll
need to make sure that that is turned off.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:53.380
Just remove the two quarter inch hex-head
screws that hold that access panel in place;

00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:02.720
just tilt it forward and let it rotate out
of place.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:10.280
We now have access to the electrical inlet
connection, the drain hose, the inlet water

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.740
hose, disconnect what you need to do there,
and then pull the dishwasher out of the cabinet.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.880
Now that we’ve disconnected the utilities
to the dishwasher and pulled it out of the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.130
cabinet, the easiest way to do the repair
is to lay it on its back and that gives us

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.790
access to the component on the bottom.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.850
Now that we have access to the drain hose,
remove the clamp that holds it to the pump;

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:41.340
it’s held in place with a 5/16ths clamp,
loosen that, slide it down onto the elbow

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.549
of the drain hose; then work it off of the
outlet of the pump, remove the clamp for use

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:58.869
on the new hose, and making sure that we have
something to catch any water that may be remaining

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.689
in that tube we’ll pull it the rest of the
way through the cabinets, or however it is

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.869
held in your installation.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.349
Before we install the new drain hose we’ll
make sure we trim the end of the new one off

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.819
the same fitting size as was used on the original.

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.620
Then we can discard that old hose.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:33.879
We’ll route that through any openings in
the cabinet that you need to; pull it through

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:58.349
the right-hand side of the dishwasher, slide
the clamp over it; we’ll slide the clamp

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:09.450
over the end of the fitting, rotate that onto
the outlet of the pump.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:26.189
Make sure the clamp is in the proper position;
tighten that 5/16ths screw.

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:31.219
Make sure the drain hose is snapped into the
clip on the side of the tub and that it goes

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:37.249
to the height of the top of the dishwasher
tub before it exits to the drain.

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:45.340
Now we’re ready to put the dishwasher back
in place, reinstall the kick plate, our electrical

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.040
supply, and our inlet water supply.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.329
Now the access panel has a couple of elongated
holes on the top edge that will engage the

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.550
plastic pins that stick down from the bottom
of the tub.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:08.999
So we have to carefully rotate that up into
position, engage those two tabs, and we’ll

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:40.260
reinstall the quarter inch screws, and 
our repair is complete.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.980
Told you it was an easy job.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.280
Thanks for watching, and good luck with your
repair.
