00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.620
 very good to all and welcome from 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.870
 new to guarantees on this occasion 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.510
 I bring a tutorial news or as 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.180
 you want to call about the emblems of 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.119
 call of duty cash advance warfare is worth and 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.070
 I fixed myself and I was reading out there that 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.410
 every time you pass prestige the 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.600
 Emblems that you have created for yours 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.270
 business card are lost are deleted 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.559
 you do not know why and you do not know if 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.670
 they will solve with the new 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.370
 update that you are going to get 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.920
 game or not however I have found 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.930
 a way to recover the emblems and 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.770
 not having to do them again is a 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.290
 real pain in the ass 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.690
 alright let's go we're going right now down 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.550
 on the right you will have a succession of 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.260
 images of what it would be like in the 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.290
 application of the mobile tool 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.000
 you download them and enter it in 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.630
 that application you have an editor of 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.100
 emblems 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.780
 to obviously edit the emblems or 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.670
 to make them directly on the mobile 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.270
 you can make emblems from the mobile is 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.490
 a little common because it 's very there but 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.460
 good 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.759
 what are we going to recover our 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.610
 emblems vouchers enter the editor of 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.200
 emblems and there you will have two parts 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.270
 Differentiated vouchers 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.979
 you will have the tab of active emblems 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.840
 which will be elevated to the player in 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.020
 the government declared 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.210
 and my gallery well in my gallery should 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.250
 appear the emblem with the emblems that 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.619
 you have created in the console that is not 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.990
 they should have deleted it from there if not 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.689
 exist you have to go out and enter several 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.670
 times of the application or edit a 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.829
 blank space and then go back 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.530
 so that until it leaves minoves it went out to 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.209
 the first one but I was testing was 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.369
 touching a little bit and at the end 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:03.570
 the batman emblem ended 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.150
 it's worth once 3 my gallery 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.160
 click on the emblem to 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.619
 edit it several will exit the interface 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.750
 edition and what you have to do is 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.100
 move the emblem a little towards the 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.230
 left to the right or what 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.080
 you want or move it and then go back to 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.740
 original site and save the options 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.420
 up on the right and you apply 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.800
 to the player when it applies when 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.690
 when you give him 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.430
 will tell you that if you want to overwrite it 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.580
 If you change in the emblem and in 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.800
 theory once that happens that should be put 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.540
 the emblem on the emblems tab 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.010
 assets in the emblem part of 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.939
 player 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.799
 but the same process goes out and comes in and 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.569
 edited through the emblem until 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.390
 you go up there is worth once what 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:59.010
 you have up there in player emblem 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.770
 you give him and he will leave you to leave an emblem and 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.320
 save emblems of ages to save 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.810
 and in theory you should not have it again 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.790
 back on the console if it does not come to the 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.680
 first in the multiplayer come out and 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.160
 enter the game or leave and enter the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.590
 Multiplayer is worth it until it comes out 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.550
 the only way I've found of 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.440
 recover the emblems and not have to 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.350
 to do them again and nothing I hope you 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.270
 serve 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.100
 do not vote and see you in the 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.100
 next chapter of the chao guide
