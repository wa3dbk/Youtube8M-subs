00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
display and other than that every speck

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.289 
display and other than that every speck
is<00:01:23.280> same<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.270> original<00:01:24.509> z1<00:01:25.729> so<00:01:26.729> also<00:01:27.090> we

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
is same as the original z1 so also we

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.289 
is same as the original z1 so also we
have<00:01:27.479> 4.3<00:01:27.990> inch<00:01:28.170> screen<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.799> z1s<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
have 4.3 inch screen on the z1s so the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.929 
have 4.3 inch screen on the z1s so the
LG<00:01:30.630> g2<00:01:30.780> mini<00:01:31.110> might<00:01:31.530> be<00:01:31.770> smaller<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.280> size<00:01:32.490> but
