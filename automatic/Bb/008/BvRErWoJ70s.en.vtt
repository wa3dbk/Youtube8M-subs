00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.259
 he was battered but he could 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.360
 play 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.160
 andrej woronin despite lighter 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.200
 thigh problems against that 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.630
 table closing light mÃ¶nchengladbach in 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:22.339
 the Berlin startelf and after 28 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:24.470
 minutes set in scene seventh 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.689
 many in the second half of the season 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.210
 loan from the pool with another 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.859
 argument for aspirations in berlin too 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.440
 hold and it was not a turn off we did 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.840
 the brilliant bastos he or always 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.470
 becomes more important and then he does that 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.300
 clever but it was an assignment error 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.810
 First, let's stop each one 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.610
 character 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.410
 here play the deep and then pay attention 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.660
 she's supposed to be terry right with the 13 of the 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.970
 is there and where is he now that is gone 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.080
 and where is the profession too and 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:58.840
 protection class tor 1 0 not undeserved too 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.840
 this time for the hertha 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:08.080
 44 minute because it's over somehow 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.090
 then there comes 20 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.710
 the handling of his first 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.870
 Bundesliga goals for over two years 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.590
 often written off already there 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:20.530
 since 96 already in the club of the o how 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.630
 they call him there it came too late then they 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.380
 are not good on the defensive again 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.080
 Hans Meyer had five years earlier 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.729
 the hertha saved from descent now 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.220
 prefer to be at old place of action 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.070
 stunned in the face of the 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.000
 but his great celebration took place 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.940
 obviously in his 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.590
 Cabin addressing the right words the 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.020
 eleven from the lower Rhine now clearly 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.229
 more structured and dedicated in theirs 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.229
 efforts 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.320
 the Berlin trembling came so slowly 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.020
 hardly to develop and very much 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.530
 moral at gladbach marie no foul 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.350
 marin foul question mark in any case 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.909
 elfmeter said peter gagelmann and if 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.530
 he friedrich where can you go that 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.929
 also only understand we have another 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.450
 Perspective and showing it was more 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.819
 as questionable because marienfeld here directly 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.370
 in the man friedrich moved back so 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.450
 also a little luck for gladbach 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.190
 really against drobny who had already 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.290
 Two eleven held in the Bundesliga 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.680
 but not this time and that was something 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:28.599
 from earned only two to one the 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.390
 leadership for hertha bsc berlin was 45 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.340
 been superior for many minutes and device 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.099
 still right at the end 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.269
 under pressure on fall best counter chances 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.430
 remained unused 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.459
 torture here demonstrated by valeri 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.040
 domovchiyski as the final whistle sounded and 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:49.470
 hertha bsc still lay ahead breathed 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.470
 Nearly 50,000 people at the same time 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.990
 my first time clear that he has 22 goals 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.820
 made and then against gladbach one 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.590
 second half played so badly too 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.040
 many opportunities leave too many opportunities 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.090
 let go and I have to say two 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.770
 days time we were lucky 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.350
 that we still won the game 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.780
 the berlin audience cheered the 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.430
 Return to the top of the table and from 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.710
 the general celebration mood after the 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.420
 ninth home win in series could be 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.050
 Finally, the routiniers in the team 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.050
 infect 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.330
 I said the fans we try 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.610
 at least for the next twelve 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.950
 play eight to win 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.090
 A little tip from us and if we 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.020
 we'll make it to the top 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.020
 there
