00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319 
in freedom of expression even when we

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.670 
in freedom of expression even when we
don't<00:04:56.409> agree<00:04:56.650> with<00:04:56.770> what's<00:04:57.129> being<00:04:57.280> expressed

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.420 
don't agree with what's being expressed
and<00:04:59.680> so<00:05:00.490> I<00:05:00.940> think<00:05:01.389> that<00:05:01.870> Poland<00:05:02.620> has<00:05:02.650> navigated

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
and so I think that Poland has navigated

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.839 
and so I think that Poland has navigated
that<00:05:03.759> process<00:05:04.300> as<00:05:04.509> well<00:05:04.720> as<00:05:04.930> any<00:05:05.080> country<00:05:05.849> in
