 She's on the wrong track. 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.780
 time they just want to assert the 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.130
 Traffic laws at times, right? 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.370
 If it was all the time, they would not 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.360
 could move against 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.360

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.110

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.910
 then you will climb right here in the 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.910
 avenue at the roundabout on the left 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.670

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.240
 Hurry, let's go slow. 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.510

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.510
 let's go slow 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.840
 we will slightly change our 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.060
 way to help her 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.530
 At this time we help, but we lose. 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.530

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.160

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.160

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.699
 the athlete was able to keep 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:20.750
 It's hard to see help slow 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.750
 slowly slowly slowly 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.610
