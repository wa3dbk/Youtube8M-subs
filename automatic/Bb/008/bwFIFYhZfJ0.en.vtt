00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:05.680
 the new free device in use from the outside a normal vehicle with 

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:09.219
 The commander Schneider goes to the place of action but the case is loud 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.950
 It has a camera all around it on the roof, delivering live images of the camera 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.200
 Directions and from the accident place directly in the control center from there Christel 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.800
 Tailor supplied with all the important information and that every month everyone knows 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.390
 that sell + Voss like that 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.099
 from 15 can 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.779
 but sense trapped vehicle going on today so many vehicles too 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.350
 move terrain visited here at this vehicle 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.440
 These are not fitted with a normal rescuer scissors for star adjustment 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.400
 be able to walk 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.660
 There are records of vehicle types that show the fire department exactly where 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.760
 which zones how can I open my car? 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.170
 these cards 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.170
 "We are not asked to drive in a fire truck that is 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.600
 Vehicle drives to the accident site the control center already has some 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.500
 Vehicles will then send these rescue cards online 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.230
 on the vehicle on the savior has its many at Suzuki it concerns here 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.120
 this make this type 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.690
 and here you can get a rescue scissor 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.620
 but this is just one of many examples of how the Firestone will be in the future 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.190
 Use can help 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.030
 now it is so that we see exactly where we stand 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.909
 after the vehicle has the most up-to-date plans independent whether the one before or 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.060
 One such spahn is whether the some for good database is a rescue rope form for 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.090
 a form of the people the vehicle 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.800
 Bouwman notes on dealing with any dangerous animal here 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.940
 For example, the Ross Sea both places not in Laer spiders 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.730
 Women poison snakes would still be on offer 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.320
 Warhol is from the acts of the ConLife only sporadically in a command vehicle 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.030
 a memory with a laptop for example and someday that is 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.120
 Hard drive follows the next problem is always we have noticed 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.070
 mostly always the data we did not use then we have 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.040
 can not place an envoy around both operation 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.620
 Bouwman at us in a volunteer before but build up and the hidden one 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.620
 System develops that keeps us free and we can 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.440
 only the information the eyes are absolutely up to date and we get br 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.649
 which when put play harsh 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.709
 In turbo we are using this technology we can do the data 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.379
 inform 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.559
 and all thanks to this shoebox of great litter 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:22.680
 How fits in any vehicle and meets all the special requirements of 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:24.849
 rescuers 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.940
 We have been here in the car and the Mubaraks are blocked 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.510
 So a diamond technology the tip has been modified for use 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.850
 that means that it is hardened so it will be the Pinot special 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.060
 Conditions of use adapted only it has to endure very very much 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.400
 System can not be found in the living room where it is, but it must be in the car 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.510
 The temperature fluctuations can last up to 80 degrees in the summer 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.290
 Minus 20 -30 degrees in winter, of course, it must also endure that the car 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.140
 It drives very fast on the road and jerks but it has to 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.600
 Of course, too, and that has been a special share of pushing 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.440
 but winding it has to endure this madness voltage fluctuations because they 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.410
 have to imagine his car today has voltage fluctuations range of 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.330
 Over 30 percent of this can be done by the system and it is also capable and 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.220
 that was the development of the bank's control of the entire on-board electronics 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.210
 increasingly, that means switching off that is no longer necessary and still 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.110
 to maintain what is absolutely necessary as well as the blue light the 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.539
 Camera or by leaving us 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.619
 Thanks to BMW, the first free scout was realized 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:23.529
 and be tested under real conditions 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:27.669
 The technology can be used in any rescue vehicle 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.669
 In future, for example, the location of comrades should be possible and 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:35.309
 although a good chief of operations has to cope with genetic engineering 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:38.309
 a certain enthusiasm can not be avoided 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:41.510
 this case build up sports and 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.920
 Such an amount of time that is us plus precious minutes in one 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.109
 Access in a dangerous situation 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.109
 but allows but have 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:52.929
 IZ 

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:57.249
 SZ also graces our access because we just need more information 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:00.679
 hope without being thrown with all sorts of information now 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:05.209
 Rousseau Feder counterproductive value so I do not say I do not want to just 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.689
 Do not give it up anymore because it's wonderful to get in the car 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:12.409
 Cordoba the volunteer fire department and the control center place here you are in 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.319
 GerÃ¤tehaus Wars has long had all rides via live stream 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:21.629
 Dr AR schedule in the multimedia formats recorded so you are always the agony 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:26.089
 Bonn and again unloaded the current data now needed 

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:27.289
 The Brussels very nice feeling
