OS pores again so let's take a look at
how<00:05:21.490> this<00:05:21.700> plays<00:05:22.030> out<00:05:22.240> in<00:05:22.420> a<00:05:22.510> nursery<00:05:22.900> let's

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
how this plays out in a nursery let's

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.800 
how this plays out in a nursery let's
start<00:05:23.890> down<00:05:24.010> here<00:05:24.070> with<00:05:24.310> a<00:05:24.460> plant<00:05:24.820> with<00:05:25.090> foliar

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
start down here with a plant with foliar

under<00:05:28.870> moist<00:05:29.230> conditions<00:05:29.830> sporangia<00:05:30.610> are

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
under moist conditions sporangia are

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.000 
under moist conditions sporangia are
produced<00:05:32.110> on<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.680> leaf<00:05:32.890> surface<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:35.010> these

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
produced on the leaf surface and these

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.690 
produced on the leaf surface and these
sporangia<00:05:36.550> then<00:05:36.970> can<00:05:37.300> become<00:05:37.450> detached<00:05:38.080> and

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
sporangia then can become detached and

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.300 
sporangia then can become detached and
either<00:05:39.700> be<00:05:39.880> blown<00:05:40.210> or<00:05:40.650> splashed<00:05:41.650> on<00:05:42.010> to
