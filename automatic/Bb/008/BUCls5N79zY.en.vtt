end up with one of these and then you'll

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:25.099 
end up with one of these and then you'll
get<00:02:21.599> one<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:23.400> will<00:02:23.700> be<00:02:24.389> able<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.749> fire

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109

get one that will be able to fire
streamlines<00:02:26.629> just<00:02:27.629> fine<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.590> if<00:02:29.129> you<00:02:29.280> don't

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
streamlines just fine so if you don't

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.979 
streamlines just fine so if you don't

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
of the unity system there was a trigger

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.849 
of the unity system there was a trigger
on<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.409> Titan<00:03:01.769> that<00:03:02.340> will<00:03:02.489> fire<00:03:03.139> by<00:03:04.139> pressing

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
on the Titan that will fire by pressing

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.209 
on the Titan that will fire by pressing
this<00:03:05.010> in<00:03:05.219> from<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.030> trigger<00:03:06.329> on<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.659> Titan<00:03:07.019> and

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:07.219 
this in from a trigger on the Titan and

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.849 
this in from a trigger on the Titan and
it<00:03:08.219> still<00:03:08.629> fires<00:03:09.629> the<00:03:09.900> blaster<00:03:10.319> which<00:03:10.500> is<00:03:10.650> I

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
it still fires the blaster which is I

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.129 
it still fires the blaster which is I
thought<00:03:11.400> was<00:03:11.549> pretty<00:03:11.609> interesting<00:03:12.139> this

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139

the modding edge of this as you can see

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.499 
the modding edge of this as you can see
it's<00:03:32.189> got<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.370> single<00:03:32.609> tactical<00:03:33.180> rail<00:03:33.329> on<00:03:33.479> the
