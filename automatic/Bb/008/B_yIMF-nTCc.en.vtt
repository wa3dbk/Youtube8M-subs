look at the camera there and just show
it<00:01:32.930> you'll<00:01:33.930> see<00:01:34.110> how<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.290> sort<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.680> line<00:01:34.920> will

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
it you'll see how the sort of line will

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.660 
it you'll see how the sort of line will
open<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.210> close<00:01:36.619> as<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.799> closed<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.400> that's

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
open and close as the closed and that's

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.590 
open and close as the closed and that's
the<00:01:38.790> open<00:01:39.060> position<00:01:40.909> because<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.090> tractor

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the open position because this tractor

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.740 
the open position because this tractor
had<00:01:43.140> what's<00:01:43.770> called<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.130> starting<00:01:44.610> handle<00:01:44.970> you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
had what's called a starting handle you

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.260 
had what's called a starting handle you
never<00:01:45.960> use<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.439> start<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.979> except<00:01:47.880> unless

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
never use it to start it except unless

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.929 
never use it to start it except unless
you<00:01:48.479> pulled<00:01:48.780> out<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:51.240> particular<00:01:52.939> valve

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
you pulled out this particular valve

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.520 
you pulled out this particular valve
lift<00:01:54.270> up<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.780> will<00:01:54.869> know<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.140> nut<00:01:55.320> on<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
lift up you will know this nut on the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.109 
lift up you will know this nut on the
back<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.009> pull<00:01:56.159> out<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.490> valve<00:01:56.700> lifter

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
back and you pull out this valve lifter

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.850 
back and you pull out this valve lifter
you<00:01:57.659> pull<00:01:57.840> out<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.079> valve<00:01:58.290> before<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.680> meant

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
you pull out the valve before that meant

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.319 
you pull out the valve before that meant
