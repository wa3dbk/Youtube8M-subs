and a lot of times you know really have
total<00:01:03.830> control<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:04.460> it<00:01:04.729> takes<00:01:04.909> a<00:01:05.030> little

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
total control and so it takes a little

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.300 
total control and so it takes a little
getting<00:01:05.239> used<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:05.720> after<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:06.530> start<00:01:07.010> to<00:01:07.100> trust

coming<00:01:44.960> out<00:01:45.050> to<00:01:45.230> watch<00:01:45.290> them<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:46.190> audience

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
coming out to watch them the audience

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.040 
coming out to watch them the audience
seems<00:01:46.729> really<00:01:47.000> receptive<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:47.750> coed

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
seems really receptive to the coed

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.900 
seems really receptive to the coed
dances<00:01:48.500> even<00:01:48.770> more<00:01:48.950> than<00:01:49.160> when<00:01:49.370> the<00:01:49.640> dance

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
dances even more than when the dance

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.580 
dances even more than when the dance
team<00:01:50.120> just<00:01:50.330> performs<00:01:50.750> with<00:01:50.900> just<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.290> girls

team just performs with just the girls
and<00:01:51.860> I<00:01:51.979> think<00:01:52.160> people<00:01:52.310> like<00:01:52.580> to<00:01:52.700> see<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.000> trick

and I think people like to see the trick

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.630 
and I think people like to see the trick
to<00:01:53.570> do<00:01:53.720> some<00:01:53.900> of<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.110> crazy<00:01:54.920> stunts<00:01:55.370> where<00:01:55.520> we

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
to do some of the crazy stunts where we

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.620 
to do some of the crazy stunts where we
look<00:01:55.790> like<00:01:55.910> we're<00:01:56.030> going<00:01:56.150> to<00:01:56.210> drop<00:01:56.420> our

look like we're going to drop our

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.050 
look like we're going to drop our
partners<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:57.650> we<00:01:57.740> don't<00:01:57.920> they<00:01:58.430> kind<00:01:58.820> of<00:01:58.880> gas

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
partners and we don't they kind of gas

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.770

a<00:02:02.810> permanent<00:02:03.320> coed<00:02:03.770> dance<00:02:04.040> team<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.550> think<00:02:05.000> it

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
a permanent coed dance team I think it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.060

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
I don't know I think part of the thrill

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.560 
I don't know I think part of the thrill
of<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.400> crow<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:25.670> dance<00:02:25.970> team<00:02:26.209> is<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:26.450> it's

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
of the crow I dance team is that it's

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.790
