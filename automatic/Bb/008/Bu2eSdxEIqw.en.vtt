00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
you guys let me don't even know if I'm

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
saying that right but it's the stuff you

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.979 
saying that right but it's the stuff you
get<00:03:55.099> from<00:03:55.160> Walmart<00:03:55.760> that<00:03:55.970> you<00:03:56.390> see<00:03:56.569> a<00:03:56.599> lot<00:03:56.840> in

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
get from Walmart that you see a lot in

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.570 
get from Walmart that you see a lot in
the<00:03:57.020> do-it-yourself<00:03:57.770> videos

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
the do-it-yourself videos

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.339 
the do-it-yourself videos
I<00:03:58.610> think<00:03:59.120> it's<00:03:59.270> called<00:03:59.510> Mod<00:03:59.750> Podge<00:04:00.080> or

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
I think it's called Mod Podge or

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.530 
I think it's called Mod Podge or
something<00:04:00.680> like<00:04:00.800> that<00:04:00.860> I'm<00:04:01.640> thinking<00:04:02.300> of

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
something like that I'm thinking of

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.110 
something like that I'm thinking of
getting<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:03.080> Mod<00:04:03.290> Podge<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:04.040> going<00:04:04.459> over

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
getting the Mod Podge and going over

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.390 
getting the Mod Podge and going over
this<00:04:05.630> with<00:04:05.930> it<00:04:06.080> to<00:04:06.110> smooth<00:04:06.620> out<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.190> case

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
this with it to smooth out the case

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.790 
this with it to smooth out the case
because<00:04:08.230> you<00:04:09.230> hear<00:04:09.470> that<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.840> that<00:04:12.650> is

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
because you hear that and that is

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.350 
because you hear that and that is
exactly<00:04:12.950> what<00:04:13.400> it<00:04:13.550> feels<00:04:13.819> like<00:04:13.940> that

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
exactly what it feels like that

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.470 
exactly what it feels like that
grittiness<00:04:14.840> is<00:04:15.230> exactly<00:04:15.920> what<00:04:16.790> it<00:04:16.940> feels<00:04:17.299> like

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480
