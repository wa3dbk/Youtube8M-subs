that<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.240> my<00:01:24.390> first<00:01:24.570> answer<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.020> go<00:01:25.590> ahead<00:01:25.710> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
that so my first answer is go ahead and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.289 
that so my first answer is go ahead and
do<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> way<00:01:26.310> you're<00:01:26.430> doing<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.820> but<00:01:27.119> just

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
do it the way you're doing it but just

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.210 
do it the way you're doing it but just
take<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> pressure<00:01:27.960> off<00:01:28.140> because<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.799> think

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
take the pressure off because I think

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.219 
take the pressure off because I think
especially<00:01:29.790> for<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> move<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.720> if<00:01:31.140> you

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
especially for a move like that if you

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.350 
especially for a move like that if you
just<00:01:31.439> relax<00:01:31.619> about<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.790> understand<00:01:33.240> that

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
just relax about it and understand that

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.730 
just relax about it and understand that
it's<00:01:33.479> not<00:01:33.570> supposed<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.990> feel<00:01:34.259> particularly

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
it's not supposed to feel particularly

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.039 
it's not supposed to feel particularly
awesome<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:35.909> going<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.299> over<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.810> fast

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
awesome it's going to be over so fast

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.780 
awesome it's going to be over so fast
and<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.500> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.650> feel<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.040> natural<00:01:38.189> anyway

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
and it's going to feel so natural anyway

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.330 
and it's going to feel so natural anyway
because<00:01:39.720> those<00:01:40.110> actions<00:01:40.530> are<00:01:40.680> ingrained<00:01:41.070> in

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
because those actions are ingrained in

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.580 
because those actions are ingrained in
the<00:01:41.460> course<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.970> your<00:01:42.030> natural<00:01:42.409> behavior<00:01:43.409> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the course of your natural behavior and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.050 
the course of your natural behavior and
more<00:01:43.770> importantly<00:01:44.189> because<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.850> don't<00:01:45.000> have

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
more importantly because you don't have

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
more importantly because you don't have
any<00:01:45.329> guilt<00:01:45.750> about<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.229> because<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.590> know<00:01:46.740> it's

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
any guilt about it because you know it's

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.170 
any guilt about it because you know it's
okay<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.369> not<00:01:47.430> supposed<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.880> be<00:01:47.939> one<00:01:48.119> of

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
okay it's not supposed to be one of

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.490 
okay it's not supposed to be one of
those<00:01:48.240> things<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.570> feels<00:01:48.840> awesome<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.290> do

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
those things that feels awesome to do

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.230 
those things that feels awesome to do
and<00:01:49.799> as<00:01:50.340> you'll<00:01:50.490> see<00:01:50.640> I've<00:01:50.729> done<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.030> four

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
and as you'll see I've done it like four

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.960 
and as you'll see I've done it like four
times<00:01:51.270> here<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:52.170> feels<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.250> looks<00:01:53.310> actually

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
times here it feels and looks actually

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.910 
times here it feels and looks actually
just<00:01:54.420> fine<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:54.960> from<00:01:55.320> my<00:01:55.350> own<00:01:55.619> perspective

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
just fine so from my own perspective

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.709 
just fine so from my own perspective
that<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> method<00:01:56.939> hasn't<00:01:57.270> really<00:01:57.540> been<00:01:57.659> a

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
that a method hasn't really been a

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.719 
that a method hasn't really been a
bummer<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.229> me<00:01:58.290> for<00:01:58.890> many<00:01:58.979> many<00:01:59.189> years<00:01:59.340> since

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
bummer for me for many many years since

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.429 
bummer for me for many many years since
I<00:01:59.850> just<00:02:00.060> got<00:02:00.180> over<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.570> decided<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.020> do<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.320> that

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
I just got over it decided to do it that

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.830 
I just got over it decided to do it that
way<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.100> relax<00:02:02.520> about<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.909> now<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.570> said

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
way and relax about it now that said

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.450 
way and relax about it now that said
there<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.200> another<00:02:04.530> method<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.219> use

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
there is another method you can use

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.190 
there is another method you can use
which<00:02:05.790> takes<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.600> little<00:02:06.719> bit<00:02:06.840> more<00:02:07.020> practice

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
which takes a little bit more practice

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.080 
which takes a little bit more practice
takes<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.829> little<00:02:07.979> bit<00:02:08.099> more<00:02:08.250> sensitivity<00:02:08.729> and

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
takes a little bit more sensitivity and

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.760 
takes a little bit more sensitivity and
it's<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:09.660> those<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.200> who<00:02:10.500> are<00:02:10.530> interested

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
it's for those of you who are interested

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.250 
it's for those of you who are interested
in<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> creek

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
in the creek

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.800 
in the creek
leasing<00:02:12.530> your<00:02:13.069> awareness<00:02:13.640> with<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.510> deck<00:02:14.780> of

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
leasing your awareness with the deck of

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.920 
leasing your awareness with the deck of
cards<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.530> so<00:02:16.099> it<00:02:16.610> this<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.180> an<00:02:17.269> exercise<00:02:17.689> for

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
cards and so it this is an exercise for

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.360 
cards and so it this is an exercise for
you<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.049> work<00:02:18.230> on<00:02:18.409> and<00:02:18.590> think<00:02:18.739> about<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:19.129> and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
you to work on and think about that and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.250 
you to work on and think about that and
hopefully<00:02:19.700> learn<00:02:19.939> another<00:02:20.329> method<00:02:20.720> for

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
hopefully learn another method for

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.440 
hopefully learn another method for
answering<00:02:21.680> Scott's<00:02:21.980> question<00:02:22.459> so<00:02:23.000> when<00:02:23.299> your

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
answering Scott's question so when your

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.069 
answering Scott's question so when your
right<00:02:23.750> thumb<00:02:24.730> break<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:26.000> held<00:02:26.840> right<00:02:27.049> here

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
right thumb break is held right here

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.660 
right thumb break is held right here
when<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.709> come<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.010> take<00:02:28.129> the<00:02:28.280> cards<00:02:28.519> from

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
when you come and take the cards from

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.670 
when you come and take the cards from
the<00:02:28.790> side<00:02:29.000> in<00:02:29.299> a<00:02:29.450> real<00:02:29.599> natural<00:02:29.810> position<00:02:30.440> just

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
the side in a real natural position just

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.979 
the side in a real natural position just
around<00:02:30.890> right<00:02:31.190> around<00:02:31.519> there<00:02:32.000> normally

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
around right around there normally

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.770 
around right around there normally
people<00:02:33.019> have<00:02:33.620> their<00:02:33.829> awareness<00:02:34.099> on<00:02:35.000> those<00:02:35.299> two

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
people have their awareness on those two

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.330 
people have their awareness on those two
sides<00:02:36.079> of<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.349> packet<00:02:36.739> on<00:02:36.950> those<00:02:37.129> two

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
sides of the packet on those two

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.800 
sides of the packet on those two
different<00:02:37.670> packets<00:02:38.000> right<00:02:38.269> there<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.659> there

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
different packets right there and there

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.869 
different packets right there and there
so<00:02:39.470> what<00:02:39.620> I<00:02:39.650> would<00:02:39.769> suggest<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:40.489> Scott<00:02:40.730> is

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.220 
so what I would suggest to you Scott is
go<00:02:41.000> ahead<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.359> put<00:02:41.540> your<00:02:41.569> awareness<00:02:41.959> in

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
go ahead and put your awareness in

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.800 
go ahead and put your awareness in
between<00:02:42.709> those<00:02:43.040> two<00:02:43.280> spots<00:02:43.430> in<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:44.030> middle<00:02:44.060> so

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
between those two spots in the middle so

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.780 
between those two spots in the middle so
imagine<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.530> fleshy<00:02:45.799> part<00:02:45.980> of<00:02:46.459> your<00:02:46.609> thumb

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
imagine the fleshy part of your thumb

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.940 
imagine the fleshy part of your thumb
that<00:02:46.940> takes<00:02:47.180> that<00:02:47.359> brake<00:02:47.690> is<00:02:47.930> like<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.620> little

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
that takes that brake is like a little

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.319 
that takes that brake is like a little
bit<00:02:49.069> of<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.250> needle<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:49.760> put<00:02:50.090> your<00:02:50.209> entire

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
bit of a needle and put your entire

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.839 
bit of a needle and put your entire
awareness<00:02:51.079> your<00:02:51.230> entire<00:02:51.500> mind<00:02:51.889> and<00:02:52.280> your

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
awareness your entire mind and your

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.369 
awareness your entire mind and your
focus<00:02:53.090> in<00:02:53.629> between<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.590> almost<00:02:55.159> treat<00:02:56.379> your
