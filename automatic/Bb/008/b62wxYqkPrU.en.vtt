before<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.450> after<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.839> install<00:00:16.170> here<00:00:16.379> the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
before and after you install here the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.930 
before and after you install here the
top<00:00:16.740> things<00:00:17.010> we<00:00:17.160> think<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.460> need<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.609> do<00:00:17.789> with

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
top things we think you need to do with

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.120 
top things we think you need to do with
your<00:00:18.060> new<00:00:18.210> graphics<00:00:18.810> card<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.410> would<00:00:19.740> say<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
your new graphics card I would say the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.980 
your new graphics card I would say the
first<00:00:20.340> thing<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.029> install<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.960> properly

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
first thing is to install it properly

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.320 
first thing is to install it properly
and<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.189> ensure<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.519> has<00:00:23.580> plenty<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.060> breathing

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
and to ensure it has plenty of breathing

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.150 
and to ensure it has plenty of breathing
room<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:25.170> means<00:00:25.439> just<00:00:25.650> checking<00:00:25.980> out<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
room this means just checking out the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.200 
room this means just checking out the
inside<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.460> your<00:00:26.550> case<00:00:26.670> making<00:00:26.970> sure<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.150> got

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
inside of your case making sure you got

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.679 
inside of your case making sure you got
the<00:00:27.330> right<00:00:27.449> room

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
the right room

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.380 
the right room
do<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.529> right<00:00:28.710> thing<00:00:29.070> as<00:00:29.340> far<00:00:29.400> as<00:00:29.609> selecting

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
do the right thing as far as selecting

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.209 
do the right thing as far as selecting
what<00:00:30.539> slot<00:00:30.869> you're<00:00:31.050> going<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.230> use<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:32.009> in

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
what slot you're going to use and in

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.150 
what slot you're going to use and in
terms<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.690> yes<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:34.050> love<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.410> big<00:00:34.590> box<00:00:34.860> when<00:00:35.070> it

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
terms of yes I love the big box when it

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.920 
terms of yes I love the big box when it
comes<00:00:35.340> out<00:00:35.520> like<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.510> not<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
comes out like this this is not the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.020 
comes out like this this is not the
right<00:00:37.110> thing<00:00:37.170> no<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.219> here's<00:00:38.489> an<00:00:38.610> example<00:00:38.850> of

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
right thing no but here's an example of

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.069 
right thing no but here's an example of
a<00:00:39.090> system<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.390> could<00:00:39.719> use<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> little

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
a system that could use a little

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.799 
a system that could use a little
cleaning<00:00:40.500> actually<00:00:40.980> I'm<00:00:41.070> seeing<00:00:41.370> dust<00:00:42.300> coated

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
cleaning actually I'm seeing dust coated

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.290 
cleaning actually I'm seeing dust coated
filters<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.440> things<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.829> also<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
filters and things like that also the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.360 
filters and things like that also the
CPU<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.050> also<00:00:46.320> getting<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.590> little<00:00:46.710> filled<00:00:47.129> with

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
CPU is also getting a little filled with

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.310 
CPU is also getting a little filled with
stuff<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.180> hellish<00:00:48.539> rat's<00:00:48.809> nest<00:00:48.960> of

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
stuff but the hellish rat's nest of

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.770 
stuff but the hellish rat's nest of
cables<00:00:49.739> yeah<00:00:50.039> if<00:00:50.430> there<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> time<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.570> do<00:00:51.750> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
cables yeah if there is a time to do a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.299 
cables yeah if there is a time to do a
little<00:00:51.960> spring<00:00:52.320> cleaning<00:00:52.350> inside<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> PC

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
little spring cleaning inside the PC

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.830 
little spring cleaning inside the PC
it's<00:00:53.430> before<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.000> drop<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.539> brand<00:00:54.750> new

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
it's before you drop in a brand new

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.900 
it's before you drop in a brand new
graphics<00:00:55.350> card<00:00:55.379> because<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.730> hottest

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
graphics card because one of the hottest

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.310 
graphics card because one of the hottest
parts<00:00:57.329> are<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.570> put<00:00:57.690> into<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.899> PC<00:00:58.140> case

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
parts are going to put into a PC case

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.840 
parts are going to put into a PC case
it's<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.590> be<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.859> GPU<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.609> it's<00:00:59.699> good

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
it's going to be that GPU and it's good

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.240 
it's going to be that GPU and it's good
to<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:00.449> only<00:01:00.629> good<00:01:00.750> airflow<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.770> you

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
to have not only good airflow but you

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.889 
to have not only good airflow but you
usually<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:02.609> more<00:01:02.820> than<00:01:02.940> one<00:01:03.120> slot<00:01:03.449> option

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
usually have more than one slot option

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:04.820 
usually have more than one slot option
in<00:01:03.989> terms<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.350> where<00:01:04.470> you're<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.739> put

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
in terms of where you're going to put

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.380 
in terms of where you're going to put
the<00:01:04.920> graphics<00:01:05.250> card<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.549> maybe<00:01:05.790> slot<00:01:06.119> number

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the graphics card so maybe slot number

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.969 
the graphics card so maybe slot number
one's<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.720> place<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.140> put<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.409> right<00:01:07.770> next

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
one's not the place to put it right next

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.039 
one's not the place to put it right next
to<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.220> GPU<00:01:08.580> or<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> CPU<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.750> case<00:01:09.900> in

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
to the GPU or the CPU in this case in

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.120 
to the GPU or the CPU in this case in
this<00:01:10.110> case<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.409> got<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> little<00:01:10.680> bit<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.979> room

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
this case you got a little bit of room

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.800 
this case you got a little bit of room
around<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.369> whole<00:01:11.520> thing<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:12.060> not<00:01:12.270> you

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
around the whole thing but if not you

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.210 
around the whole thing but if not you
have<00:01:12.930> other<00:01:13.080> options<00:01:13.260> too<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.799> terms<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.070> where

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
have other options too in terms of where

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.499 
have other options too in terms of where
it<00:01:14.310> goes<00:01:14.460> make<00:01:14.820> sure<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> power<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.390> connected

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
it goes make sure the power is connected

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.840 
it goes make sure the power is connected
to<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> car<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.380> last<00:01:16.650> time<00:01:16.979> before<00:01:17.790> you

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
to the car in one last time before you

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.550 
to the car in one last time before you
button<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.150> case<00:01:18.299> up<00:01:18.509> make<00:01:18.720> sure<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.960> card<00:01:19.320> is

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
button the case up make sure the card is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.410 
button the case up make sure the card is
completely<00:01:20.130> seated<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> pins

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
completely seated so that the pins

aren't crossed and it is locked in place
that<00:01:23.549> way<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.729> are<00:01:23.909> good<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.330> go<00:01:24.509> before<00:01:24.900> you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
that way you are good to go before you

it'll run on that side of things if you

something like that you're going to know
pretty<00:04:49.480> quickly<00:04:49.690> and<00:04:50.050> hopefully<00:04:50.470> there's<00:04:50.650> a

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.550 
GPU if it's not being cooled properly
but<00:04:55.300> if<00:04:55.540> you<00:04:55.720> want<00:04:55.870> max<00:04:56.050> temperature<00:04:56.410> that's

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
but if you want max temperature that's

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.110 
but if you want max temperature that's
the<00:04:56.710> way<00:04:56.800> to<00:04:56.860> go<00:04:57.040> yeah<00:04:57.580> and<00:04:57.610> if<00:04:57.850> you<00:04:57.910> wanted<00:04:58.060> to

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
the way to go yeah and if you wanted to

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.310 
the way to go yeah and if you wanted to
talk<00:04:58.330> about<00:04:58.450> some<00:04:58.690> of<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:58.840> issues<00:04:59.200> with
