00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
so you can see that we're not worried

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.350 
so you can see that we're not worried
about<00:00:44.010> winning<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.460> but<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.000> trying<00:00:45.270> to

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
about winning this but just trying to

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.860 
about winning this but just trying to
you<00:00:45.420> know<00:00:45.450> it

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
you know it

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.990 
you know it
get<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> point<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.670> where<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
get to the point so this is where the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.700 
get to the point so this is where the
task<00:00:48.210> order<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.260> guess<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.500> this

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
task order is so you can guess that this

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.319 
task order is so you can guess that this
is<00:00:49.770> where<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.070> wanna<00:00:50.219> play<00:00:50.280> your<00:00:50.430> match<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.270> we

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
is where you wanna play your match so we

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.360 
is where you wanna play your match so we
write<00:00:51.570> down<00:00:51.750> here<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.050> then<00:00:52.170> stop<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:53.309> stop

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
write down here and then stop just stop

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.340 
write down here and then stop just stop
on<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> tennis<00:00:54.120> court<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.600> you'll<00:00:55.199> be

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
on the tennis court and you'll be

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.080 
on the tennis court and you'll be
teleported<00:00:55.890> into<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.370> match<00:00:56.750> against<00:00:57.750> a

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
teleported into a match against a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.090 
teleported into a match against a
penguin<00:01:00.090> with<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.780> penguin<00:01:01.199> referee<00:01:01.530> that

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
penguin with a penguin referee that

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.810 
penguin with a penguin referee that
seems<00:01:02.340> fair

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
seems fair

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.770 
seems fair
so<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> trick<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.110> one<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:05.780> you're

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
so the trick with this one is you're

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.969 
so the trick with this one is you're
gonna<00:01:06.840> hit<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.049> thing<00:01:07.290> back<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.799> hit<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
gonna hit the thing back you can hit the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.859 
gonna hit the thing back you can hit the
ball<00:01:08.100> back<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.299> want<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> hit<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> ball

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
ball back so you want to hit the ball

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.420 
ball back so you want to hit the ball
back<00:01:10.140> like<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.619> won't<00:01:10.770> push<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.040> or

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
back like so you won't push a or

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.600 
back like so you won't push a or
whatever<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:11.880> X<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.659> don't<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:13.430> before<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
whatever it is X I don't know before the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.640 
whatever it is X I don't know before the
ball<00:01:14.790> gets<00:01:14.939> G<00:01:15.240> or<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.170> gonna<00:01:16.259> happen<00:01:16.470> like

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
ball gets G or it's gonna happen like

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.420 
ball gets G or it's gonna happen like
that<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.810> if<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.170> push<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:20.100> ball<00:01:20.310> is

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
that and if you just push it the ball is

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.130 
that and if you just push it the ball is
gonna<00:01:20.549> go<00:01:20.700> exactly<00:01:21.180> back<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> penguin

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
gonna go exactly back to the penguin

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.260 
gonna go exactly back to the penguin
here's<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.500> magnet<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.909> want<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> push

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
here's like a magnet so you want to push

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.570 
here's like a magnet so you want to push
a<00:01:24.420> direction<00:01:25.020> left<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.500> right<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.979> waiting<00:01:26.520> on

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
a direction left or right of waiting on

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.130 
a direction left or right of waiting on
the<00:01:26.640> ball<00:01:26.790> guys<00:01:26.970> say<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.299> push<00:01:27.479> left<00:01:27.750> when<00:01:28.020> we

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the ball guys say we push left when we

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.460 
the ball guys say we push left when we
hit<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:29.040> vulgar<00:01:29.369> left<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.110> if<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.140> go

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
hit it and a vulgar left and if we go

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.620 
hit it and a vulgar left and if we go
again<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.280> get<00:01:32.430> left<00:01:32.670> it'll<00:01:33.299> go<00:01:33.390> over<00:01:33.570> it

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
again if we get left it'll go over it

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.300 
again if we get left it'll go over it
again<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.409> beat<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.770> he's<00:01:34.950> really

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
again so you can beat in he's really

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.130 
again so you can beat in he's really
easy<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.610> beat<00:01:35.759> once<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.810> pushing

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
easy to beat once you know that pushing

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.870 
easy to beat once you know that pushing
the<00:01:37.259> directions<00:01:37.770> causes<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.369> happen<00:01:38.549> so

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the directions causes that to happen so

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.730 
the directions causes that to happen so
