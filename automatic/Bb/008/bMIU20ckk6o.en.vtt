you think I could make if there's a

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.890 
you think I could make if there's a
another<00:03:05.970> block<00:03:06.269> you<00:03:06.420> think<00:03:06.599> i<00:03:06.630> could<00:03:06.750> use

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
another block you think i could use

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.839 
another block you think i could use
instead<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.290> glowstone<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.040> would<00:03:08.130> blend

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
instead of glowstone that it would blend

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.150 
instead of glowstone that it would blend
a<00:03:09.030> little<00:03:09.060> better<00:03:09.450> or<00:03:10.040> just<00:03:11.900> whatever<00:03:13.160> so

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
a little better or just whatever so

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.360 
a little better or just whatever so
