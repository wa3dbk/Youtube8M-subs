obviously you come in with with some

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.060 
obviously you come in with with some
sort<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.820> nervousness<00:01:30.509> when<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.439> work<00:01:31.650> with<00:01:31.680> a

sort of nervousness when you work with a

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.060 
sort of nervousness when you work with a
new<00:01:32.280> lot<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.640> people<00:01:33.170> but<00:01:34.170> most<00:01:34.439> importantly<00:01:34.979> I

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
new lot of people but most importantly I

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.359 
new lot of people but most importantly I
think<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:36.950> that<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> amount<00:01:38.250> of

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
think it is that that the amount of

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.539 
think it is that that the amount of
experience<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:39.180> via<00:01:39.750> has<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> film<00:01:41.070> in

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
experience that via has a film in

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.040 
experience that via has a film in
filmmaking

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
filmmaking

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.920 
filmmaking
for<00:01:44.040> me<00:01:44.160> it<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.370> an<00:01:44.490> education<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:45.450> understand

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
for me it is an education to understand

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.440 
for me it is an education to understand
how<00:01:46.080> systems<00:01:46.530> work<00:01:46.620> because<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.760> re<00:01:48.000> propping

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
how systems work because we re propping

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.570 
how systems work because we re propping
our<00:01:48.630> industry<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:50.130> think<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.370> would<00:01:50.460> be<00:01:50.550> a

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
our industry and I think it would be a

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.560 
our industry and I think it would be a
valuable<00:01:51.060> contribution<00:01:52.220> be<00:01:53.220> at<00:01:53.310> india<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:54.420> be

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
valuable contribution be at india or be

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.320 
valuable contribution be at india or be
at<00:01:54.630> any<00:01:54.810> part<00:01:55.080> of<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.290> world<00:01:55.320> where<00:01:56.090> films<00:01:57.090> are

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
at any part of the world where films are

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.560 
at any part of the world where films are
a<00:01:57.360> trend<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.460> i<00:01:59.460> think<00:01:59.820> it's<00:01:59.970> so<00:02:00.210> convenient

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
a trend and i think it's so convenient

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.900 
a trend and i think it's so convenient
that<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:01.080> neighboring<00:02:01.650> country<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.190> where<00:02:02.760> it

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
that a neighboring country is where it

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:03.890 
that a neighboring country is where it
has<00:02:03.000> been<00:02:03.030> happening<00:02:03.480> for<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> hundred<00:02:03.810> years

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
has been happening for a hundred years

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.630 
has been happening for a hundred years
they've<00:02:04.230> mastered<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.860> craft<00:02:04.980> to<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.370> extent

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
