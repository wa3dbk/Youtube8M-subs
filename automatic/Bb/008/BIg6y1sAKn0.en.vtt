00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.750
 it was ripped off with the right foot of 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.850
 victory against the last champion what 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.730
 feelings left you this sporty and 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.129
 I think that outside 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.039
 it's a feeling because to start with the 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.599
 right foot does not do any and more 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.800
 with the champion has been good I think that 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.060
 we are very happy for the good 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.820
 boot we had and well let's hope 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.660
 continue like this on this good path 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.340
 imagined when the 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.660
 preseason that flew a lot from 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.000
 some central marker that could 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.220
 to come to this you imagined being 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.110
 is the owner and have this start of 2015 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.579
 and the truth is that I did not imagine it 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.039
 but good 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.750
 as you know this is football and that's what 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.399
 the preseason so that everyone will be 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.780
 instead in the preseason and the 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.760
 matches 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.469
 this decree hang friendly has been 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.730
 good thanks to god for winning me a 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.250
 place and good now it's time to continue 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.500
 taking advantage of you said you asked 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.600
 something especially the technician in this 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.670
 range in which you have given the chance has 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.769
 talked about something in particular with him and by 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.050
 another side you know that more than ever you have 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.239
 what to show and match match 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.600
 not that healthy competition and much in your 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.399
 Market Stall 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.560
 I still think that I do not think what he says to me 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.940
 always ok to all the players that you 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.470
 gives the confidence and now I'm going to have to 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.180
 answer on the court so good 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.460
 I'm always trying to do better 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.929
 that fire and good and current the group and if 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.600
 I can not good touch out there 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:21.940
 meanwhile it will not always be to help 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.380
 the group inside if they touch me they say that 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.330
 it's hard that it's not the place but more 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.979
 difficult to keep the simple if you 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.960
 which is like a permanent exam here 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.580
 from now on that we continue we think that all 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.640
 the parties in the exam in practice 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.380
 anywhere has been good 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.659
 you have to work every day always 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.090
 to stay one and good and to try 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.440
 it's always the same or better and project 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.990
 we have in the things that one does 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.940
 Personally, how do you feel about 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.310
 the idea that the technician seems to have 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.259
 try to leave below when you can 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.390
 of course when space how do you 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.660
 You feel bossed in that sense but as 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.280
 I feel good out there good touch nothing else 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.540
 You get used to that rate and I think that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.979
 Now we have been doing good and good 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.570
 we hope to continue like this until the end of 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.869
 championship but I feel good we 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.830
 it costs to leave from below yeimar 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.380
 mainly you men who 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.929
 make up the last line if at the beginning 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.180
 It costs a bit but I already called 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.010
 you're working I think I'm already 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.390
 it is incorporated but at the beginning 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.070
 it costs but so far I think what 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.500
 encouraged by doing well you can counter well 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.730
 we went out playing this much but good 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.930
 let's hope to do it now against nothing 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.730
 against tiger 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.500
 do you think that for Saturday they will have 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.780
 a greater obligation than they had 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.430
 on Friday considering that juande 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.620
 local and I think the approval the 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.600
 we always have to play and good but 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.190
 more here that we are local so 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.330
 it's good to go out and win and all to 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.310
 propose but 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.440
 as a party that we did enter like this 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.720
 we have to do the same as the other point that 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.610
 you have to leave it here at home from outside 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.230
 It gives the feeling that you play a lot 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.630
 limit when you go to the man mark to 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.880
 good man felt like that is your way 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.190
 you risk a lot I think I think it 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.780
 he way I play I think I always like 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.510
 always be a rose with the front 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.910
 and so be it outside it looks so good I think that 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.160
 something else but it's always in my form 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.770
 that play is always crashing and that 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.570
 forward I feel for good because 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.020
 have reference to that does not like to 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.390
 front and if you do not like to look for the 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.920
 another path then for you is better 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.510
 that the rival always has some 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.700
 reference in the area is that you can play 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.800
 close your if I have no problems and rival 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.530
 it came out or stays inside but always 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.860
 I have to be close by so as not to 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.380
 have frights and in this case like you 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.780
 toco billiton will touch you moon in this 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.300
 case you have seen it especially in your 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.460
 I pass by you but I have seen it and 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.140
 good apart 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.090
 out there did not have begin to the central 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.090
 but he is at home and in his house 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.140
 always when you feel like 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.960
 instead he will always want to do 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.760
 something good touches is awake and for not 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.760
 have startles with Chinese
