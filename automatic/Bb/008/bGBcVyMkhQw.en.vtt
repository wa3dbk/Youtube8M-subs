okay<00:02:13.920> now<00:02:14.370> one<00:02:14.850> thing<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:15.210> have<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.390> say<00:02:15.540> as<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
okay now one thing I have to say as a

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.400 
okay now one thing I have to say as a
reservation<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.930> have<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.290> be

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
reservation is that you have to be

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.050 
reservation is that you have to be
careful<00:02:19.590> when<00:02:20.010> you're<00:02:20.190> using<00:02:20.250> your<00:02:20.670> sharpies

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
careful when you're using your sharpies

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.470 
careful when you're using your sharpies
because<00:02:22.010> even<00:02:23.010> though<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.640> acrylic<00:02:24.030> paint<00:02:24.270> is

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
because even though the acrylic paint is

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.080 
because even though the acrylic paint is
dried<00:02:24.930> off<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.620> will<00:02:25.890> start<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.370> become<00:02:26.610> active

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
dried off it will start to become active

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.750 
dried off it will start to become active
again<00:02:27.150> because<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:28.170> water<00:02:28.920> inside<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.459> ink

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
again because the water inside the ink

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.580 
again because the water inside the ink
of<00:02:30.000> your<00:02:30.240> sharpies<00:02:30.660> will<00:02:30.840> reactivate<00:02:31.320> the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
of your sharpies will reactivate the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.780 
of your sharpies will reactivate the
paint<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:33.090> will<00:02:33.330> begin<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.750> get<00:02:34.790> some

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
paint and so you will begin to get some

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.330 
paint and so you will begin to get some
paint<00:02:36.330> inside<00:02:36.900> your<00:02:37.110> sharpie<00:02:37.440> which<00:02:38.100> is

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
paint inside your sharpie which is

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.920 
paint inside your sharpie which is
pretty<00:02:38.640> much<00:02:38.820> going<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.060> render<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.480> tip<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.720> a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
pretty much going to render the tip of a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.050 
pretty much going to render the tip of a
useless<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:40.950> if<00:02:41.280> you're<00:02:41.400> going<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.640> do<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.940> this

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
useless so if you're going to do it this

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.510 
useless so if you're going to do it this
way<00:02:42.410> just<00:02:43.410> be<00:02:43.530> careful<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.010> be<00:02:44.100> prepared<00:02:44.459> for

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
way just be careful and be prepared for

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.070 
way just be careful and be prepared for
that<00:02:44.790> or<00:02:45.060> have<00:02:45.600> extra<00:02:45.989> markers<00:02:46.380> if<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:48.080> have

that or have extra markers if you have

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.640 
that or have extra markers if you have
to<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.590> fluence<00:02:49.890> in<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.130> mean<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:50.580> so<00:02:51.650> there's
