have said wheel here now it's got a slow

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.250 
have said wheel here now it's got a slow
puncture<00:01:58.000> which<00:01:59.000> means<00:01:59.210> it<00:01:59.300> goes<00:01:59.450> down<00:01:59.660> over<00:01:59.690> a

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
puncture which means it goes down over a

tight however what we've done here you
see<00:02:48.080> is<00:02:48.410> we're<00:02:48.620> put<00:02:48.740> in<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.920> third<00:02:49.070> one<00:02:49.250> in

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
see is we're put in the third one in

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.550 
see is we're put in the third one in
it's<00:02:49.820> got<00:02:49.970> enough<00:02:50.270> of<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.510> tire<00:02:50.720> over<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.350> rim

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
it's got enough of the tire over the rim

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.490 
it's got enough of the tire over the rim
that<00:02:52.160> it's<00:02:52.310> easy<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:52.910> just<00:02:53.450> move<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.320> tie

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
that it's easy to just move the tie

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.150 
that it's easy to just move the tie
leave<00:02:54.680> around<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.130> rim<00:02:56.380> releasing<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.980> rest

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
leave around the rim releasing the rest

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.030 
leave around the rim releasing the rest
of<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.370> time<00:02:58.580> be<00:02:58.790> careful<00:02:59.180> pass<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.600> valve

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.070 

and<00:03:04.040> there<00:03:04.250> we<00:03:04.340> go<00:03:04.460> so<00:03:05.300> now<00:03:05.330> our<00:03:05.480> tire<00:03:05.870> is

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
and there we go so now our tire is

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.370 
and there we go so now our tire is
released<00:03:07.480> it's<00:03:08.480> now<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.660> simple<00:03:08.960> matter<00:03:09.230> of

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
released it's now a simple matter of

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.020 
released it's now a simple matter of
pulling<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:10.120> tube<00:03:11.120> out<00:03:12.430> at<00:03:13.430> this<00:03:13.580> stage<00:03:13.820> here

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
pulling the tube out at this stage here

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.390 
pulling the tube out at this stage here
pull<00:03:14.270> it<00:03:14.300> out<00:03:14.480> to<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:14.780> valve<00:03:16.300> lift<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.450> tire

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
pull it out to the valve lift the tire

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.620 
pull it out to the valve lift the tire
and<00:03:19.400> you<00:03:19.459> can<00:03:19.640> just<00:03:19.790> take<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.060> tube<00:03:20.270> out<00:03:20.390> like

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
and you can just take the tube out like

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.690 
and you can just take the tube out like
so<00:03:21.070> now<00:03:22.070> one<00:03:22.220> thing<00:03:22.340> I<00:03:22.430> would<00:03:22.550> heartily

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
so now one thing I would heartily

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.330 
so now one thing I would heartily
recommend<00:03:22.940> you<00:03:23.390> do<00:03:23.890> depending<00:03:24.890> where<00:03:25.070> you<00:03:25.160> are

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
recommend you do depending where you are

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.160 
recommend you do depending where you are
is<00:03:26.410> very<00:03:27.410> gingerly<00:03:28.010> run<00:03:28.970> your<00:03:29.120> fingers<00:03:29.690> around

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
is very gingerly run your fingers around

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.610 
is very gingerly run your fingers around
the<00:03:30.500> inside<00:03:31.130> of<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.640> tire<00:03:31.880> like<00:03:32.600> this<00:03:32.780> okay

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
the inside of the tire like this okay

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.710 
the inside of the tire like this okay
now<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.550> reason<00:03:34.640> for<00:03:35.000> doing<00:03:35.060> this<00:03:35.390> is<00:03:35.570> if

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
now the reason for doing this is if

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.710 
now the reason for doing this is if
you've<00:03:35.840> got<00:03:36.110> any<00:03:36.320> sharp<00:03:36.590> objects<00:03:37.459> or<00:03:38.030> glass<00:03:38.390> or

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
you've got any sharp objects or glass or

you've got any sharp objects or glass or
anything<00:03:38.870> similar<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:40.310> you<00:03:40.700> should<00:03:40.970> feel<00:03:41.330> it

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
anything similar it you should feel it

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.360 
anything similar it you should feel it
if<00:03:41.660> it's<00:03:41.989> caused<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.350> puncture<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:42.830> should

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
if it's caused the puncture you should

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.860 
if it's caused the puncture you should
feel<00:03:43.670> it<00:03:43.850> on<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.060> inside<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.510> tube

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
feel it on the inside the tube

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.290 
feel it on the inside the tube
and<00:03:44.959> I<00:03:45.080> say<00:03:45.350> gingerly<00:03:45.860> because<00:03:46.160> if<00:03:47.030> it's<00:03:47.209> a

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
and I say gingerly because if it's a

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.810 
and I say gingerly because if it's a
particularly<00:03:47.660> sharp<00:03:48.470> thorn<00:03:48.980> if<00:03:49.519> you<00:03:49.640> do<00:03:49.730> it

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
particularly sharp thorn if you do it

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.790 
particularly sharp thorn if you do it
too<00:03:50.000> fast<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.660> will<00:03:50.780> stick<00:03:51.080> into<00:03:51.350> your<00:03:51.470> finger

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
too fast it will stick into your finger

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.640 
too fast it will stick into your finger
and<00:03:52.400> will<00:03:52.519> chop<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.850> top<00:03:52.970> of<00:03:53.090> your<00:03:53.209> fingers<00:03:53.650> so

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.100 
you will see cuts and abrasions and you
may<00:04:11.930> even<00:04:12.170> see<00:04:12.320> debris<00:04:12.739> or<00:04:13.370> small<00:04:14.060> parts<00:04:14.540> that

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
may even see debris or small parts that

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.259 
may even see debris or small parts that
are<00:04:15.200> actually<00:04:15.470> still<00:04:15.650> stuck<00:04:15.890> in<00:04:16.040> the<00:04:16.130> time<00:04:16.310> now

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
are actually still stuck in the time now

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.460 
are actually still stuck in the time now
it's<00:04:17.419> obviously<00:04:17.660> critical<00:04:18.049> at<00:04:18.140> this<00:04:18.260> stage

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
it's obviously critical at this stage

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.430 
it's obviously critical at this stage
that<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:18.769> remove<00:04:19.660> anything<00:04:20.660> sharp<00:04:21.020> that<00:04:21.289> is

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
that you remove anything sharp that is

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.350 
that you remove anything sharp that is
in<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.830> tire<00:04:22.010> whether<00:04:22.760> it<00:04:22.940> be<00:04:23.060> a<00:04:23.090> piece<00:04:23.240> of

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
in the tire whether it be a piece of

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.620 
in the tire whether it be a piece of
glass

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
glass

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.600 
glass
so<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.810> thorn<00:04:24.200> whatever<00:04:24.980> once<00:04:25.190> caused<00:04:25.400> the

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
so a thorn whatever once caused the

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.390 
so a thorn whatever once caused the
problem<00:04:26.500> otherwise<00:04:27.500> as<00:04:27.740> soon<00:04:27.950> as<00:04:28.070> you<00:04:28.160> put<00:04:28.310> the

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
problem otherwise as soon as you put the

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.010 
problem otherwise as soon as you put the
new<00:04:28.520> tube<00:04:28.760> in<00:04:28.970> it<00:04:29.180> would<00:04:29.450> just<00:04:29.660> puncture<00:04:29.990> a

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
new tube in it would just puncture a

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.330 
new tube in it would just puncture a
gate<00:04:30.370> so<00:04:31.570> if<00:04:32.570> you've<00:04:32.900> done<00:04:33.110> that<00:04:33.140> that's<00:04:34.070> fine

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
gate so if you've done that that's fine

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.540 
gate so if you've done that that's fine
if<00:04:34.610> you've<00:04:35.390> got<00:04:35.630> time<00:04:35.960> it's<00:04:36.440> worth<00:04:36.800> re-inflate

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
if you've got time it's worth re-inflate

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.900 
if you've got time it's worth re-inflate
in<00:04:37.820> your<00:04:37.970> tube<00:04:39.160> to<00:04:40.160> see<00:04:40.370> where<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.730> hole<00:04:40.880> is

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
in your tube to see where the hole is

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.140 
in your tube to see where the hole is
and<00:04:41.570> you<00:04:41.750> can<00:04:41.900> sometimes<00:04:42.260> locate<00:04:42.880> where<00:04:43.880> it<00:04:44.030> is

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
and you can sometimes locate where it is

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.970 
and you can sometimes locate where it is
on<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:45.380> tire<00:04:45.920> by<00:04:47.140> offering<00:04:48.140> the<00:04:48.410> tube<00:04:48.650> up<00:04:48.830> to

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
on the tire by offering the tube up to

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.270 
on the tire by offering the tube up to
the<00:04:49.100> valve<00:04:50.170> and<00:04:51.170> seeing<00:04:51.950> where<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.130> hole<00:04:52.250> is

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
the valve and seeing where the hole is

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.250 
the valve and seeing where the hole is
on<00:04:52.520> YouTube<00:04:52.850> and<00:04:53.180> that<00:04:53.690> will<00:04:53.810> indicate<00:04:53.960> where

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
on YouTube and that will indicate where

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.520 
on YouTube and that will indicate where
your<00:04:54.380> problem<00:04:54.650> is<00:04:54.740> on<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:54.950> time

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
your problem is on the time

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.720 
your problem is on the time
there<00:04:57.530> are<00:04:57.650> many<00:04:57.770> occasions<00:04:58.070> where<00:04:58.520> what

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
there are many occasions where what

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.210 
there are many occasions where what
Evers<00:04:58.940> calls<00:04:59.180> your<00:04:59.360> puncture<00:04:59.720> goes<00:05:00.230> in<00:05:00.500> causes

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
Evers calls your puncture goes in causes

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.420 
Evers calls your puncture goes in causes
the<00:05:01.310> puncture<00:05:01.700> and<00:05:02.210> pops<00:05:02.720> straight<00:05:02.990> out<00:05:03.140> again

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
the puncture and pops straight out again

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.040 
the puncture and pops straight out again
so<00:05:04.430> don't<00:05:04.850> be<00:05:05.000> too<00:05:05.180> alarmed<00:05:05.300> if<00:05:05.630> you<00:05:05.690> can't

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
so don't be too alarmed if you can't

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.750 
so don't be too alarmed if you can't
immediately<00:05:06.680> find<00:05:06.860> anything<00:05:07.220> within<00:05:07.550> the

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
immediately find anything within the

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.300 
immediately find anything within the
tube<00:05:08.440> okay<00:05:09.440> so<00:05:09.500> we're<00:05:09.710> now<00:05:09.800> going<00:05:09.950> to<00:05:10.010> replace

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
tube okay so we're now going to replace

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.590 
tube okay so we're now going to replace
that<00:05:10.490> we're<00:05:10.790> going<00:05:10.880> to<00:05:10.970> put<00:05:11.060> a<00:05:11.090> new<00:05:11.240> tube<00:05:11.450> in

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
that we're going to put a new tube in

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.680 
that we're going to put a new tube in
there<00:05:11.750> so<00:05:12.650> we<00:05:13.370> have<00:05:13.520> our<00:05:13.670> new<00:05:13.910> tube<00:05:14.210> and<00:05:14.450> we've

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
there so we have our new tube and we've

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:21.480 
there so we have our new tube and we've
partially<00:05:15.320> inflated<00:05:15.590> it<00:05:16.720> so<00:05:18.700> tech<00:05:19.700> trapped<00:05:19.970> on

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
partially inflated it so tech trapped on

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.770 
partially inflated it so tech trapped on
push<00:05:22.490> on<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:22.700> valve<00:05:25.360> one<00:05:26.360> or<00:05:26.480> two<00:05:26.600> pumps

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
push on the valve one or two pumps

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.680 
push on the valve one or two pumps
hardly<00:05:27.260> any<00:05:27.440> pressure<00:05:28.000> it's<00:05:29.000> really<00:05:29.390> just<00:05:29.600> to

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
hardly any pressure it's really just to

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.560 
hardly any pressure it's really just to
get<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:29.930> shape<00:05:30.670> don't<00:05:31.670> pump<00:05:31.970> it<00:05:32.090> up<00:05:32.180> too<00:05:32.330> hard

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
get the shape don't pump it up too hard

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.400 
get the shape don't pump it up too hard
because<00:05:33.140> it<00:05:33.380> will<00:05:33.530> not<00:05:33.860> fit<00:05:34.190> inside<00:05:35.350> there<00:05:36.350> we

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
because it will not fit inside there we

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.340 
because it will not fit inside there we
go<00:05:36.530> pop<00:05:36.920> it<00:05:37.040> in<00:05:37.160> the<00:05:37.250> valve<00:05:37.840> pop<00:05:38.840> the<00:05:38.960> tire<00:05:39.140> over

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
go pop it in the valve pop the tire over

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
go pop it in the valve pop the tire over
and<00:05:39.710> then<00:05:40.690> very<00:05:41.690> simple<00:05:43.090> feed<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:44.540> tube<00:05:45.370> into

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
and then very simple feed the tube into

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.450 
and then very simple feed the tube into
the<00:05:46.850> tire<00:05:47.290> it's<00:05:48.290> easy<00:05:48.530> to<00:05:48.800> do<00:05:48.920> this<00:05:49.100> with<00:05:49.310> your

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
the tire it's easy to do this with your

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:56.410 
the tire it's easy to do this with your
thumbs<00:05:54.340> and<00:05:55.340> if<00:05:55.550> you<00:05:55.640> haven't<00:05:55.790> over<00:05:56.120> inflated

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.420 
thumbs and if you haven't over inflated

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.770 
thumbs and if you haven't over inflated
it<00:05:56.660> it<00:05:56.780> should<00:05:56.930> sit<00:05:57.110> just<00:05:57.290> nicely<00:05:58.510> now<00:05:59.510> what<00:05:59.660> to

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
it it should sit just nicely now what to

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.520 
it it should sit just nicely now what to
do<00:06:00.520> if<00:06:01.520> you<00:06:01.580> see<00:06:01.760> here<00:06:01.970> that<00:06:02.150> the<00:06:02.330> the<00:06:03.110> tube<00:06:03.350> is

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
do if you see here that the the tube is

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.350 
do if you see here that the the tube is
sitting<00:06:03.860> outside<00:06:04.070> the<00:06:04.400> rim<00:06:04.580> we<00:06:04.970> need<00:06:05.120> to<00:06:05.240> get

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
sitting outside the rim we need to get

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.570 
sitting outside the rim we need to get
it<00:06:05.450> to<00:06:05.570> sit<00:06:05.750> into<00:06:05.930> the<00:06:06.110> rim<00:06:06.260> so<00:06:06.500> like<00:06:07.280> you<00:06:07.400> say

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
it to sit into the rim so like you say

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.070 
it to sit into the rim so like you say
work<00:06:07.850> your<00:06:08.000> way<00:06:08.060> around<00:06:08.390> don't<00:06:08.570> put<00:06:08.780> the<00:06:08.870> tire

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
work your way around don't put the tire

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.020 
work your way around don't put the tire
over<00:06:09.110> into<00:06:09.710> the<00:06:09.800> rim<00:06:09.950> all<00:06:10.250> we're<00:06:10.670> doing<00:06:10.850> here

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
over into the rim all we're doing here

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.210 
over into the rim all we're doing here
is<00:06:11.240> just<00:06:11.270> putting<00:06:11.630> the<00:06:12.050> tube<00:06:12.320> just<00:06:12.590> popping

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
is just putting the tube just popping

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.060 
is just putting the tube just popping
the<00:06:13.280> tube<00:06:13.490> over<00:06:13.960> into<00:06:14.960> the<00:06:15.080> rim<00:06:15.230> to<00:06:15.740> make<00:06:15.920> life

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
the tube over into the rim to make life

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:22.120 
the tube over into the rim to make life
easier<00:06:19.420> okay<00:06:20.420> this<00:06:20.690> stage<00:06:20.900> you<00:06:21.140> deflate<00:06:22.070> that

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
easier okay this stage you deflate that

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.490 
easier okay this stage you deflate that
set<00:06:22.490> small<00:06:22.880> part

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:34.170 

okay<00:06:29.440> flip<00:06:30.440> the<00:06:30.620> tire<00:06:30.770> over<00:06:30.830> into<00:06:31.460> the<00:06:32.410> rim

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
okay flip the tire over into the rim

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.640 
okay flip the tire over into the rim
once<00:06:35.180> you've<00:06:35.330> got<00:06:35.540> about<00:06:36.050> a<00:06:36.110> third<00:06:36.440> of<00:06:36.590> the

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
once you've got about a third of the

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.790 
once you've got about a third of the
wheel<00:06:36.800> done<00:06:37.300> take<00:06:38.300> the<00:06:38.420> valve<00:06:38.630> and<00:06:38.900> push<00:06:39.530> it<00:06:39.680> up

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
wheel done take the valve and push it up

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.490 
wheel done take the valve and push it up
into<00:06:40.040> the<00:06:40.400> tire<00:06:40.630> this<00:06:41.630> means<00:06:41.930> that<00:06:42.110> it<00:06:42.230> doesn't

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
into the tire this means that it doesn't

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.050 
into the tire this means that it doesn't
get<00:06:42.590> sandwiched<00:06:43.040> between<00:06:43.160> the<00:06:43.550> tire<00:06:43.760> and<00:06:43.790> the

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
get sandwiched between the tire and the

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.260 
get sandwiched between the tire and the
rim<00:06:44.710> then<00:06:45.710> all<00:06:45.830> we<00:06:45.920> do<00:06:46.070> is<00:06:46.310> work<00:06:46.940> our<00:06:47.150> way

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
rim then all we do is work our way

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.290 
rim then all we do is work our way
around<00:06:48.820> turn<00:06:49.820> the<00:06:49.940> wheel

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.820 

now<00:06:53.300> if<00:06:53.450> you<00:06:53.600> can<00:06:53.810> do<00:06:53.960> this<00:06:54.170> part<00:06:54.380> without

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
now if you can do this part without

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.570 
now if you can do this part without
using<00:06:55.160> tire<00:06:55.340> levers<00:06:55.700> it's<00:06:56.300> a<00:06:56.510> great<00:06:56.750> help<00:06:57.580> and

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:58.580 
using tire levers it's a great help and

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.890 
using tire levers it's a great help and
you<00:06:58.670> can<00:06:58.790> see<00:06:58.940> I've<00:06:59.060> actually<00:06:59.210> pop<00:06:59.600> that<00:06:59.750> on

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
you can see I've actually pop that on

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.590 
you can see I've actually pop that on
without<00:07:00.530> using<00:07:00.800> tire<00:07:00.950> levers<00:07:01.330> sometimes<00:07:02.330> it

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:02.600 
without using tire levers sometimes it

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.960 
without using tire levers sometimes it
is<00:07:02.870> practically<00:07:03.530> impossible<00:07:04.040> to<00:07:04.520> actually

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:04.970 
is practically impossible to actually

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.270 
is practically impossible to actually
get<00:07:05.630> that<00:07:05.870> part<00:07:06.140> done<00:07:06.200> without<00:07:06.500> tire<00:07:06.890> levers

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 
get that part done without tire levers

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.180 
get that part done without tire levers
so<00:07:07.370> do<00:07:07.550> use<00:07:07.790> them<00:07:08.000> but<00:07:08.120> do<00:07:08.360> use<00:07:08.660> them<00:07:08.840> digitally

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.190 
so do use them but do use them digitally

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:15.190 
so do use them but do use them digitally
please<00:07:10.190> don't<00:07:10.640> use<00:07:10.910> spoons<00:07:12.430> bits<00:07:13.430> of<00:07:13.670> wood<00:07:14.200> or

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:15.200 
please don't use spoons bits of wood or

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.050 
please don't use spoons bits of wood or
anything<00:07:15.590> other<00:07:15.890> than<00:07:16.160> a<00:07:16.280> plastic<00:07:16.460> tire<00:07:16.850> lever

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.060 
anything other than a plastic tire lever

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:24.130 
anything other than a plastic tire lever
and<00:07:17.620> then<00:07:18.620> simply<00:07:20.530> attach<00:07:21.530> your<00:07:21.740> pump<00:07:21.950> and<00:07:23.140> we
