a<00:00:09.360> Whirlpool<00:00:10.200> dryer<00:00:10.530> this<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.040> GE<00:00:11.429> dryer<00:00:12.240> a

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
a Whirlpool dryer this is a GE dryer a

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.140 
a Whirlpool dryer this is a GE dryer a
little<00:00:13.740> bit<00:00:13.889> different<00:00:14.370> but<00:00:14.519> the

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
little bit different but the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.580 
little bit different but the
troubleshooting<00:00:15.839> you'll<00:00:16.020> see<00:00:16.230> if<00:00:16.379> you've

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
troubleshooting you'll see if you've

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.890 
troubleshooting you'll see if you've
watched<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.070> as<00:00:17.220> binax<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.820> exactly<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.660> same

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
watched it as binax is exactly the same

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.160 
watched it as binax is exactly the same
it's<00:00:19.710> just<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.039> few<00:00:20.279> little<00:00:20.670> extra<00:00:21.600> things<00:00:21.869> in

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
it's just a few little extra things in

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.330 
it's just a few little extra things in
this<00:00:22.320> one<00:00:24.920> so<00:00:25.920> what<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.340> need<00:00:27.980> you<00:00:28.980> need<00:00:29.010> a

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
this one so what you need you need a

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.959 
this one so what you need you need a
multimeter<00:00:31.099> and<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.279> need<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> pair<00:00:32.940> of

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
multimeter and you need a pair of

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.400 
multimeter and you need a pair of
needlenose<00:00:33.390> pliers

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
needlenose pliers

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.160 
needlenose pliers
if<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.550> don't<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.880> multimeter<00:00:36.450> an<00:00:36.930> ohm

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
if you don't have a multimeter an ohm

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.959 
if you don't have a multimeter an ohm
meter

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
meter

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.660 
meter
you<00:00:38.969> can<00:00:39.180> either<00:00:39.450> really<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:40.079> check<00:00:40.290> with

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
you can either really just check with

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.990 
you can either really just check with
resistance<00:00:41.670> or<00:00:41.910> continuity<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:46.399> set<00:00:47.399> my<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.760> for

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
resistance or continuity I set my in for

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.959 
resistance or continuity I set my in for
continuity<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.280> got<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> beat<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:50.879> it

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
continuity and I just got a beat so it

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.700 
continuity and I just got a beat so it
makes<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.239> really<00:00:51.420> easy<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.870> know<00:00:52.230> if<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.559> got

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
makes it really easy to know if you got

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.619 
makes it really easy to know if you got
it<00:00:52.770> right<00:00:53.070> or<00:00:53.100> not<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.640> we'll<00:00:56.789> start<00:00:57.120> off<00:00:57.329> up

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
it right or not so we'll start off up

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.790 
it right or not so we'll start off up
here

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.040 

and<00:01:03.980> this<00:01:04.520> one<00:01:04.760> here<00:01:05.210> with<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:05.540> two<00:01:05.780> wires

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
and this one here with the two wires

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.540 
and this one here with the two wires
going<00:01:06.470> to<00:01:06.620> it<00:01:06.770> is<00:01:06.980> going<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.190> be<00:01:07.280> our<00:01:07.400> high

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
going to it is going to be our high

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.840 
going to it is going to be our high
limit<00:01:07.940> thermostat<00:01:08.440> now<00:01:09.440> you'll<00:01:09.620> notice<00:01:09.890> it's

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
limit thermostat now you'll notice it's

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.130 
limit thermostat now you'll notice it's
a<00:01:10.880> little<00:01:10.910> hard<00:01:11.270> to<00:01:11.360> see<00:01:11.660> in<00:01:11.690> this<00:01:11.900> video

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
a little hard to see in this video

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.760 
a little hard to see in this video
there's<00:01:12.710> one<00:01:13.640> below<00:01:13.850> it<00:01:14.210> with<00:01:14.360> four<00:01:14.720> wires<00:01:15.050> and

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
there's one below it with four wires and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.030 
there's one below it with four wires and
that's<00:01:16.400> an<00:01:16.580> operating<00:01:17.210> thermostat<00:01:18.040> unlikely

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
that's an operating thermostat unlikely

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.690 
that's an operating thermostat unlikely
that<00:01:19.250> that<00:01:19.490> went<00:01:19.810> but<00:01:20.810> we'll<00:01:20.960> check<00:01:21.290> all<00:01:21.700> of

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
that that went but we'll check all of

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.400 
that that went but we'll check all of
them<00:01:23.180> anyway<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:23.900> when<00:01:24.020> you're<00:01:24.140> checking

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
them anyway and when you're checking

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.230 
them anyway and when you're checking
this<00:01:24.650> operating<00:01:25.160> thermostat

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
this operating thermostat

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.830 
this operating thermostat
you'll<00:01:26.780> notice<00:01:27.050> it<00:01:27.410> two<00:01:27.830> of<00:01:27.980> the<00:01:28.070> wires

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
you'll notice it two of the wires

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.260 
you'll notice it two of the wires
further<00:01:29.840> spread<00:01:30.410> further<00:01:30.680> apart<00:01:31.190> than<00:01:31.580> two<00:01:32.150> of

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
further spread further apart than two of

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.300 
further spread further apart than two of
the<00:01:32.390> others<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:33.560> only<00:01:33.710> ones<00:01:33.980> you're<00:01:34.100> going<00:01:34.220> to

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
the others the only ones you're going to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.130 
the others the only ones you're going to
check<00:01:34.490> are<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.790> two<00:01:34.970> further<00:01:35.300> apart<00:01:35.840> for

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
check are the two further apart for

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.890 
check are the two further apart for
continuity<00:01:36.650> the<00:01:37.640> two<00:01:37.820> closer<00:01:38.120> together<00:01:38.420> don't

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
continuity the two closer together don't

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.240 
continuity the two closer together don't
worry<00:01:39.110> about<00:01:39.260> it<00:01:39.910> so<00:01:41.530> so<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.619> way<00:01:42.650> we<00:01:42.920> do<00:01:43.070> this

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
worry about it so so the way we do this

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.280 
worry about it so so the way we do this
is<00:01:43.310> we<00:01:43.610> always<00:01:43.790> pull<00:01:44.210> one<00:01:44.479> wire<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:45.110> use

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
is we always pull one wire and use

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.380 
is we always pull one wire and use
needle<00:01:45.710> nose<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.250> don't<00:01:46.430> ruin<00:01:47.090> the

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
needle nose so you don't ruin the

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.540 
needle nose so you don't ruin the
terminal<00:01:47.960> pull<00:01:48.650> and<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:49.220> have<00:01:49.369> your

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
terminal pull and you have your

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.240 
terminal pull and you have your
multimeter<00:01:50.060> set<00:01:50.950> for<00:01:51.950> continuity<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:55.070> then

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
multimeter set for continuity and then

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:04.540 
multimeter set for continuity and then
you<00:01:55.340> just<00:01:55.550> come<00:01:55.760> on<00:02:02.500> we<00:02:03.500> got<00:02:03.619> continuity<00:02:04.340> there

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
you just come on we got continuity there

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:12.610 
you just come on we got continuity there
so<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.630> one<00:02:05.810> is<00:02:05.960> good<00:02:11.110> now<00:02:12.110> this<00:02:12.320> is<00:02:12.470> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
so that one is good now this is the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.500 
so that one is good now this is the
operating<00:02:13.280> one<00:02:13.460> here<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.090> we're<00:02:14.240> just<00:02:14.270> going

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
operating one here so we're just going

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.840 
operating one here so we're just going
to<00:02:14.600> pull<00:02:15.010> one<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.130> them<00:02:16.280> outside<00:02:16.820> wire<00:02:17.510> top<00:02:18.850> you

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
to pull one of them outside wire top you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.710 
to pull one of them outside wire top you
won't<00:02:19.970> worry<00:02:20.210> about<00:02:20.300> those<00:02:20.660> two<00:02:21.350> middle<00:02:21.590> ones

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.560 

we<00:02:26.720> got<00:02:26.870> continuity<00:02:27.590> there<00:02:27.830> also<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:29.210> that<00:02:29.240> one

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
we got continuity there also so that one

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.220 
we got continuity there also so that one
is<00:02:29.690> good<00:02:29.930> too<00:02:31.090> if<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.180> get<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.360> GE<00:02:32.900> or<00:02:33.200> a

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
is good too if you get a GE or a

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.050 
is good too if you get a GE or a

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
Hotpoint or an RCA something like that

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.780 
Hotpoint or an RCA something like that
it's<00:02:38.060> unlikely<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:40.190> operating

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
it's unlikely that the operating

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.000 
it's unlikely that the operating
thermostats<00:02:41.569> go<00:02:41.870> which<00:02:42.140> usually<00:02:42.350> this<00:02:42.770> high

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
thermostats go which usually this high

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.270 
thermostats go which usually this high
limit<00:02:43.430> or<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.670> thermal<00:02:44.030> fuse<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.920> here's

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
limit or the thermal fuse and here's

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.940 
limit or the thermal fuse and here's
another<00:02:46.520> one<00:02:46.760> down<00:02:46.910> lower

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:09.350 

so<00:02:53.849> again<00:02:54.260> pull<00:02:55.260> one<00:02:55.560> wire<00:03:08.209> you<00:03:09.209> got

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
so again pull one wire you got

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.460 
so again pull one wire you got
continuity<00:03:10.080> there<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:10.620> it's<00:03:10.770> good<00:03:15.440> okay<00:03:16.440> and

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
continuity there so it's good okay and

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.410 
continuity there so it's good okay and
the<00:03:16.650> final<00:03:16.830> thermostat<00:03:17.520> is<00:03:17.670> located<00:03:18.270> up<00:03:18.390> here

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
the final thermostat is located up here

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.270 
the final thermostat is located up here
on<00:03:18.780> this<00:03:18.900> blower<00:03:19.200> wheel<00:03:19.500> assembly<00:03:20.069> in<00:03:20.190> the

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
on this blower wheel assembly in the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.250 
on this blower wheel assembly in the
trade<00:03:20.519> here<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:20.970> this<00:03:21.060> is<00:03:21.209> another<00:03:21.510> operating

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
trade here and this is another operating

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:30.080 
trade here and this is another operating
thermostat<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:25.440> again<00:03:28.550> and<00:03:29.550> I<00:03:29.850> don't<00:03:30.030> know

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
thermostat and again and I don't know

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.430 
thermostat and again and I don't know
how<00:03:30.209> well<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.540> can<00:03:30.569> see<00:03:30.900> this<00:03:31.019> in<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.319> video

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
how well you can see this in the video

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.949 
how well you can see this in the video
but<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.130> two<00:03:32.340> outside<00:03:32.940> wires<00:03:33.299> have<00:03:33.660> spread

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
but the two outside wires have spread

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.800 
but the two outside wires have spread
further<00:03:34.230> apart<00:03:34.769> than<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.610> 2nr<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.510> we<00:03:36.630> only

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
further apart than the 2nr so we only

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:48.860 
further apart than the 2nr so we only
want<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.140> check<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.560> outer<00:03:38.190> wires<00:03:47.390> remove<00:03:48.390> one

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
want to check the outer wires remove one

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:56.960 
want to check the outer wires remove one
wire<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.970> we<00:03:54.120> got<00:03:54.269> continuity<00:03:54.959> there<00:03:55.970> so

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
wire and we got continuity there so

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.920 
wire and we got continuity there so
that's<00:03:57.180> good<00:03:59.209> okay<00:04:00.209> so<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.480> next<00:04:00.600> thing<00:04:00.840> we

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
that's good okay so the next thing we

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.960 
that's good okay so the next thing we
want<00:04:01.109> to<00:04:01.170> do<00:04:01.320> is<00:04:01.470> on<00:04:01.709> this<00:04:01.920> burner<00:04:02.220> tube<00:04:02.579> here

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
want to do is on this burner tube here

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.490 
want to do is on this burner tube here
this<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.239> where<00:04:03.390> your<00:04:03.510> burner<00:04:03.720> assembly<00:04:03.930> goes

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
this is where your burner assembly goes

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.759 
this is where your burner assembly goes
in<00:04:04.739> your<00:04:04.890> igniter<00:04:05.310> is<00:04:05.519> down<00:04:05.730> underneath<00:04:06.120> and

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
in your igniter is down underneath and

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.900 
in your igniter is down underneath and
this<00:04:07.769> is<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.100> radiant<00:04:08.609> sensor<00:04:09.150> heat<00:04:09.510> sensor

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
this is the radiant sensor heat sensor

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.330 
this is the radiant sensor heat sensor
flame<00:04:11.910> sensor<00:04:12.480> there's<00:04:12.810> several<00:04:13.590> names<00:04:13.950> for

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
flame sensor there's several names for

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.020 
flame sensor there's several names for
it<00:04:15.560> what<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.769> does<00:04:17.010> is<00:04:17.220> it<00:04:17.370> detects<00:04:17.760> heat

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
it what that does is it detects heat

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.880 
it what that does is it detects heat
from<00:04:18.650> your<00:04:19.650> igniter<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.930> it<00:04:21.930> opens<00:04:22.380> up<00:04:22.560> the

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
from your igniter and it opens up the

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.950 
from your igniter and it opens up the
dryer<00:04:23.220> coils<00:04:23.880> located<00:04:26.240> they're<00:04:27.240> located<00:04:27.840> up

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
dryer coils located they're located up

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.390 
dryer coils located they're located up
here<00:04:28.200> in<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.470> front<00:04:29.450> so<00:04:30.450> what<00:04:30.720> we<00:04:30.840> want<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.140> do

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
here in the front so what we want to do

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:40.860 
here in the front so what we want to do
is<00:04:32.400> just<00:04:32.640> pull<00:04:32.910> one<00:04:32.940> wire

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.110 

and<00:04:41.870> that's<00:04:42.259> got<00:04:42.470> continuity<00:04:43.190> so<00:04:43.370> this<00:04:43.580> one<00:04:43.879> is

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
and that's got continuity so this one is

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.930 
and that's got continuity so this one is
also<00:04:44.479> good<00:04:44.960> flame<00:04:45.949> sensor<00:04:46.430> and<00:04:46.610> everything

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
also good flame sensor and everything

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.990

looks<00:04:47.210> good<00:04:47.509> so<00:04:47.810> your<00:04:48.800> igniter<00:04:49.190> is<00:04:49.430> located

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
looks good so your igniter is located

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.610 
looks good so your igniter is located
down<00:04:50.180> here<00:04:50.240> now<00:04:50.750> you<00:04:50.810> want<00:04:51.169> to<00:04:51.229> know<00:04:51.289> if<00:04:51.470> that's

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
down here now you want to know if that's

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.850 
down here now you want to know if that's
glowing<00:04:52.250> or<00:04:52.430> not<00:04:53.139> then<00:04:54.139> you<00:04:54.169> need<00:04:54.680> this

off it won't come back on once these
warm<00:06:21.349> up<00:06:21.789> there<00:06:22.789> they<00:06:23.569> seem<00:06:23.900> to<00:06:24.110> fail<00:06:24.409> there<00:06:25.310> is

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
warm up there they seem to fail there is

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.129 
warm up there they seem to fail there is
a<00:06:25.490> resistance<00:06:26.180> check<00:06:26.509> you<00:06:26.659> can<00:06:26.810> put<00:06:26.990> your<00:06:27.110> own

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
a resistance check you can put your own

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.830 
a resistance check you can put your own
meter<00:06:27.529> on<00:06:27.800> here<00:06:28.279> and<00:06:28.880> you<00:06:28.940> can<00:06:29.120> refer<00:06:29.240> to<00:06:29.690> your

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
meter on here and you can refer to your

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.999 
meter on here and you can refer to your
texture<00:06:30.380> and<00:06:30.620> we'll<00:06:30.710> give<00:06:30.860> you<00:06:30.979> a

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
texture and we'll give you a

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:34.209 
texture and we'll give you a
specification<00:06:32.139> but<00:06:33.139> I<00:06:33.169> found<00:06:33.560> quite<00:06:33.830> a<00:06:33.949> few

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:34.219 
specification but I found quite a few

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:37.570 
specification but I found quite a few
times<00:06:34.430> that<00:06:34.880> they'll<00:06:35.210> test<00:06:35.630> good<00:06:36.219> as<00:06:37.219> soon<00:06:37.430> as

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
times that they'll test good as soon as

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.459 
times that they'll test good as soon as
the<00:06:37.699> dryer<00:06:37.940> starts<00:06:38.419> running<00:06:38.900> ten<00:06:39.169> minutes

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:39.469 
the dryer starts running ten minutes

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:42.070 
the dryer starts running ten minutes
into<00:06:39.680> it<00:06:40.009> they<00:06:40.159> fail<00:06:40.490> they<00:06:40.729> stop<00:06:41.000> stop<00:06:41.539> opening

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
into it they fail they stop stop opening

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.640 
into it they fail they stop stop opening
so<00:06:42.770> if<00:06:42.860> your<00:06:43.009> igniter<00:06:43.370> is<00:06:43.580> glowing<00:06:43.880> and<00:06:44.650> you're

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
so if your igniter is glowing and you're

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.010 
so if your igniter is glowing and you're
not<00:06:45.770> getting<00:06:46.009> gas<00:06:46.400> in<00:06:46.729> there<00:06:47.060> the<00:06:47.479> problem<00:06:47.870> is

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
not getting gas in there the problem is

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.829 
not getting gas in there the problem is
in<00:06:48.199> these<00:06:48.380> dryer<00:06:48.680> coils<00:06:49.219> here<00:06:49.520> in<00:06:50.479> really

00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:50.839 
in these dryer coils here in really

in these dryer coils here in really
that's<00:06:51.020> all<00:06:51.169> there<00:06:51.380> is<00:06:51.469> to<00:06:51.740> troubleshooting

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
that's all there is to troubleshooting

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:58.660 
that's all there is to troubleshooting
a<00:06:53.180> gas<00:06:53.540> dryer<00:06:55.180> thanks<00:06:56.180> for<00:06:56.300> watching
