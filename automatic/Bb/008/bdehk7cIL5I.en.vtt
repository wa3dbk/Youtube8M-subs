weeks 8 to 12 weeks I can't remember

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.440 
weeks 8 to 12 weeks I can't remember
which<00:02:53.690> one<00:02:53.750> but<00:02:54.410> then<00:02:54.620> you'd<00:02:54.800> have<00:02:55.239> you<00:02:56.239> went

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
which one but then you'd have you went

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.240 
which one but then you'd have you went
yeah<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:56.810> then<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:57.019> have<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.500> deal<00:02:57.830> owed<00:02:58.010> week

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
yeah and then you have a deal owed week

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.190 
yeah and then you have a deal owed week
where<00:02:58.489> you<00:02:58.549> just<00:02:58.670> took<00:02:58.849> the<00:02:59.030> week<00:02:59.180> off<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.690> his

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
where you just took the week off and his

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.800 
where you just took the week off and his
theory<00:03:00.530> was<00:03:00.680> that<00:03:00.890> if<00:03:01.849> you<00:03:02.000> take<00:03:02.209> off<00:03:02.420> between

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
theory was that if you take off between

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.559 
theory was that if you take off between
nine<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:03.709> twelve<00:03:04.250> days<00:03:04.580> nine<00:03:04.880> days<00:03:05.180> is<00:03:05.420> the

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
nine and twelve days nine days is the

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.110 
nine and twelve days nine days is the
sweet<00:03:05.840> spot<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.440> will<00:03:07.250> not<00:03:07.459> lose<00:03:07.910> any

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
sweet spot you will not lose any

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.360 
sweet spot you will not lose any
strength<00:03:08.720> or<00:03:08.959> lean<00:03:09.260> mass<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.769> most<00:03:10.010> you'll<00:03:10.190> do

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
strength or lean mass the most you'll do

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.000 
strength or lean mass the most you'll do
is<00:03:10.640> lose<00:03:11.269> some<00:03:11.480> water<00:03:11.780> weight<00:03:12.110> because<00:03:12.890> your

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
is lose some water weight because your

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.339 
is lose some water weight because your
body<00:03:13.250> will<00:03:13.459> drain<00:03:13.760> its<00:03:13.940> glycogen<00:03:14.450> stores<00:03:14.780> your

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
body will drain its glycogen stores your

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.080 
body will drain its glycogen stores your
intra<00:03:15.650> material<00:03:16.069> glycogen<00:03:16.459> will<00:03:16.670> be<00:03:16.790> depleted

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
intra material glycogen will be depleted

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.500 
intra material glycogen will be depleted
thus<00:03:18.310> that's<00:03:19.310> what<00:03:19.579> Haycock<00:03:19.970> recommended

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
thus that's what Haycock recommended

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.690 
thus that's what Haycock recommended
