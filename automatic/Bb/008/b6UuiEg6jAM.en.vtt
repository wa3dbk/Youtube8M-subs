00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.530 

from<00:02:20.920> wheels<00:02:21.189> because<00:02:22.150> those<00:02:22.330> are<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.450> little

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
from wheels because those are a little

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.910 
from wheels because those are a little
bit<00:02:22.689> dirtier<00:02:22.989> so<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.319> guys<00:02:23.470> can<00:02:23.650> see<00:02:23.799> how<00:02:23.860> that

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
I did on this one wheel because they

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.370 
I did on this one wheel because they
they<00:05:50.150> can<00:05:50.240> get<00:05:50.360> completely<00:05:50.750> clean

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.420

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
may have to use two applications so this

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.180 
may have to use two applications so this
is<00:06:00.229> mine<00:06:00.440> second<00:06:01.039> application

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190
