00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.780
 Do you see training or very good staff? 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.910
 is saying that pa did not was the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.860
 talk about it so I liked the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.770
 texture is cool but the amount of 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.160
 effect then has 127 111 or a team 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.829
 for each parent each 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.480
 things are very quiet 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:32.989
 I think it's time to release a 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:36.059
 monster was an evil everton another one 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.950
 boat in its location to the Pope 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.170
 he manages to destroy all life 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.190
 and has legs to lift 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.140
 decreased 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.460
 they can do it because people 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:55.170
 address the warnings to the sound of the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.890
 school fan is paralyzed legs 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.630
 of genius 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.630
 I hope to make Angola 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.440
 it's time for hot but rolled and touch screen 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.590
 screen will be the tiger saber-tooth 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.590
 spinning sun 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.300
 the aft already gave to extract the subject of this 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.790
 block 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.800
 all because the lions gate announced the 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.800
 new power rangers series long 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.479
 the long one will bring a new vision to mythology 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.100
 of rangers information on the staff and 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.960
 cast among other things not yet 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.910
 have been disclosed but may be 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.350
 Quiet because we here of the cinema qat 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.210
 we are watching and any new 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.930
 information we will take you out of 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.880
 House 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.880
 The Power Rangers series is in the air for more 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.460
 of 20 years and in that time we grew and 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.950
 we lose interest in the series but always 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.960
 A longing is worth remembering. 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.179
 so prepare yourself because now is the time 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.179
 to go back in time with the power rangers 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.620
 the hood 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.880
 in the air for the first time in August 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.890
 1993 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.360
 the series is a blatant copy the version 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.100
 Japanese that the river sit juries though 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.470
 the story is simple two astronauts 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.020
 opens a capsule and mars and releases the 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.970
 intergalactic witch rita repulsa 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.500
 who does not waste time and runs to attack 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.200
 the planet earth is where the organs and their 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.660
 assistant alpha 5 teleport 15 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.820
 unmanageable unbearable humans 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.690
 according to his own words the drug 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.730
 flamengo then enter on the scene 10 11 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.280
 and trini and kimberly than with their 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.740
 residents and currencies of power become the 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.440
 power rangers a group of super heroes 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.050
 with high technology equipment and 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.680
 who own eyes giant vehicles 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.680
 combat 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.890
 but the best is not always the eyes 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.230
 was that time of the series in which the 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.450
 monster was giant and it was time to 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.290
 join the eyes and become a 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.290
 mega luck 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.540
 some episodes are striking as 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.650
 that the rangers find the 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.650
 ninja turtles left to enjoy 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.319
 At first they were five 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.200
 but rita repulsa creates the green rangers 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.120
 bewitching teenager take that later 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.950
 some time gets good wine and goes to 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.950
 the team becoming network bank 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.450
 of course we must not forget that the 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.440
 series was not only made with villains 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.110
 alien 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.870
 after all the group of heroes is adolescent and 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.990
 this time there are always the 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.760
 fill everyone here is not different 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:43.080
 book sco were responsible for 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:46.020
 to torment the life of the people in school was 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.600
 that who is here where risk 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.490
 Let's show everyone that it's in Tacna. 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.400
 music 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.050
 in 1995 the producers came to the 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.000
 conclusion that the little screens were 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.610
 getting too small for the rangers 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.610
 and decided to take the gang to the movies 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:13.010
 Jorge calls change 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.530
 the movie until it's cool taking the fact 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:19.540
 that the eyes were made in animation 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:24.050
 3d is to kill anyone childhood 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.940
 because the success of power rangers was 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.250
 so much that the series stays in the air until 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.030
 today in a much less popular version than the 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.550
 first 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.560
 finally a pity for today's children 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:42.320
 who did not have the opportunity to 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:44.450
 tv and scream time to cheat gave to kill 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.950
