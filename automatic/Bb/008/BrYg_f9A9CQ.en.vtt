engine<00:00:10.530> which<00:00:10.710> we<00:00:10.860> have<00:00:10.980> built<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.550> uses<00:00:11.880> the

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
engine which we have built that uses the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.450 
engine which we have built that uses the
waste<00:00:12.179> heat<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.570> produce<00:00:12.719> work<00:00:13.370> for<00:00:14.370> our

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
waste heat to produce work for our

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.980 
waste heat to produce work for our
design<00:00:14.759> we<00:00:14.969> chose<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.360> build<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.599> Stirling

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
design we chose to build a Stirling

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.779 
design we chose to build a Stirling
engine<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.470> use<00:00:16.619> copper<00:00:16.980> coils<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.400> collect<00:00:17.699> a

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
engine and use copper coils to collect a

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.170 
engine and use copper coils to collect a
wasted<00:00:18.180> heat<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.660> pressure<00:00:18.900> vessel<00:00:19.170> a

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
pressure produced inside of this vessel

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.840 
pressure produced inside of this vessel
causes<00:00:39.470> the<00:00:39.560> piston<00:00:39.890> to<00:00:39.980> rise<00:00:40.190> which<00:00:40.520> causes

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
causes the piston to rise which causes

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.080 
causes the piston to rise which causes
the<00:00:40.970> crankshaft<00:00:41.420> to<00:00:41.600> turn<00:00:41.810> as<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:43.640> crankshaft

turns it also moves the connecting arm

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.350 
turns it also moves the connecting arm
which<00:00:46.010> pushes<00:00:46.310> cold<00:00:46.670> air<00:00:46.820> into<00:00:47.060> the<00:00:47.090> pressure

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
which pushes cold air into the pressure

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.060 
which pushes cold air into the pressure
vessel<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:47.960> causes<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.620> piston<00:00:48.950> to<00:00:49.040> move

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
vessel and causes the piston to move

and<00:01:37.560> we've<00:01:37.859> experimented<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.700> lots<00:01:39.060> of

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
and we've experimented with lots of

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.169 
and we've experimented with lots of
different<00:01:39.539> ideas<00:01:40.369> we're<00:01:41.369> now<00:01:41.459> considering

actually<00:01:42.599> rebuilding<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> idea<00:01:43.979> because

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
actually rebuilding the idea because

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.139 
actually rebuilding the idea because
it's<00:01:45.060> generally<00:01:45.659> not<00:01:45.689> turning<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.670> I<00:01:47.670> think

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
it's generally not turning and I think

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.639 
it's generally not turning and I think
we're<00:01:48.299> going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.689> pull<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.929> original

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
we're going to have to pull the original

one-half<00:02:21.770> inch<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.700> quarter<00:02:23.420> inch<00:02:23.920> here<00:02:24.920> is

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
one-half inch to a quarter inch here is

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.050 
one-half inch to a quarter inch here is
basically<00:02:25.390> reduced<00:02:26.390> in<00:02:26.540> trouble<00:02:26.960> and<00:02:28.060> to

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
basically reduced in trouble and to

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.710 
basically reduced in trouble and to
shape<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.930> size<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.740> king<00:02:31.570> so<00:02:32.570> that

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
shape it to the size of the king so that

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.270 
shape it to the size of the king so that
it's<00:02:32.840> easier<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.290> fit<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.710> we<00:02:33.770> can<00:02:33.920> just<00:02:34.040> apply

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
it's easier to fit and we can just apply

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.430 
it's easier to fit and we can just apply
the<00:02:34.420> UC<00:02:35.420> or<00:02:35.990> bottom

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
the UC or bottom

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.960 
the UC or bottom
basically<00:02:39.190> right<00:02:39.340> now<00:02:39.460> yeah<00:02:39.640> we're<00:02:39.820> just

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
basically right now yeah we're just

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.400 
basically right now yeah we're just
working<00:02:40.180> out<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.540> edges<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:40.960> that<00:02:40.990> that

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
working out the edges so that that

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:54.040 
working out the edges so that that
perfectly<00:02:41.830> smooth<00:02:42.190> up<00:02:42.460> against<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.000> can

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.370 

and<00:02:55.400> was<00:02:56.400> we<00:02:56.550> drilled<00:02:56.820> up<00:02:57.090> one<00:02:57.840> quarter<00:02:58.200> inch

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
and was we drilled up one quarter inch

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.940 
and was we drilled up one quarter inch
hole<00:02:58.650> into<00:02:59.130> one<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.460> the<00:02:59.670> arms<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:01.020> make<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.620> hole

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
hole into one of the arms to make a hole

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.620 
hole into one of the arms to make a hole
for<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.340> air<00:03:02.460> to<00:03:02.490> go<00:03:02.700> through<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.240> elbow

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
for the air to go through to the elbow

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.050 
for the air to go through to the elbow
and<00:03:03.930> then<00:03:04.530> we<00:03:04.710> drilled<00:03:05.070> up<00:03:05.310> what<00:03:06.180> was<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:08.060> 336

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
and then we drilled up what was it 336

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.930 
and then we drilled up what was it 336
sized<00:03:09.930> hole<00:03:09.960> in<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:11.010> top<00:03:11.190> of<00:03:11.250> each<00:03:11.610> of<00:03:11.820> these

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
sized hole in the top of each of these

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.760
