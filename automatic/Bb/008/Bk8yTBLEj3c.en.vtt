you could also use your finger supports

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.560 
you could also use your finger supports
touch<00:00:31.520> so<00:00:32.520> now<00:00:32.669> if<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.090> have<00:00:33.270> another

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
touch so now if I have another

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.290 
touch so now if I have another
application<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:34.860> example<00:00:35.309> let's<00:00:35.730> open<00:00:35.969> up

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
application so for example let's open up

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.590 
application so for example let's open up
Microsoft<00:00:36.870> edge<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.920> browser<00:00:38.160> here<00:00:38.600> same

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
Microsoft edge the browser here same

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.270 
Microsoft edge the browser here same
thing<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.930> could<00:00:40.079> drag<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.469> title<00:00:40.829> bar<00:00:41.040> I'm

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
thing you could drag the title bar I'm

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.760 
thing you could drag the title bar I'm
going<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> move<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.390> left<00:00:42.750> side<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.590> now

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
going to move it to the left side so now

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.190 
going to move it to the left side so now
Microsoft<00:00:44.640> edge<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.360> snapped<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> left

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
Microsoft edge is snapped to the left

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.080 
Microsoft edge is snapped to the left
side<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.710> screen<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.219> now<00:00:47.309> snap<00:00:47.820> assist

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
side of the screen and now snap assist

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.750 
side of the screen and now snap assist
shows<00:00:49.079> up<00:00:49.350> showing<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.280> rest<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
one of them do you want to snap so let

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.709 
one of them do you want to snap so let
me<00:00:55.350> go<00:00:55.500> ahead<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.920> tap<00:00:56.340> Twiddy<00:00:57.120> 'im<00:00:57.300> which<00:00:57.570> is

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
me go ahead and tap Twiddy 'im which is

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.119 
me go ahead and tap Twiddy 'im which is
a<00:00:57.750> Twitter<00:00:58.289> application

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
a Twitter application

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.799 
a Twitter application
it<00:00:59.190> could<00:00:59.309> also<00:00:59.460> change<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.030> size<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.629> this

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
it could also change the size of this

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.290 
it could also change the size of this
window<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.640> there's<00:01:03.030> also

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
window just like that there's also

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.920 
window just like that there's also
another<00:01:03.539> trick<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.260> Windows<00:01:05.040> 10<00:01:05.689> what<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:06.810> you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
another trick for Windows 10 what if you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.039 
another trick for Windows 10 what if you
want<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.439> snap<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.939> lower<00:01:09.240> right<00:01:09.720> or

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
want to snap it on the lower right or

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.800 
want to snap it on the lower right or
top<00:01:10.830> right<00:01:11.159> corner<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.820> quadrants

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
top right corner so you have quadrants

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.230 
top right corner so you have quadrants
here<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.590> snap<00:01:14.280> these<00:01:14.640> windows<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
here that you can snap these windows to

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.539 
here that you can snap these windows to
so<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.630> example<00:01:16.049> let<00:01:16.290> me<00:01:16.409> snap<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
so for example let me snap this to the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.350 
so for example let me snap this to the
lower<00:01:17.990> right<00:01:18.990> corner<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:20.460> there<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.880> go<00:01:21.030> lower

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
lower right corner so there you go lower

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.020 
lower right corner so there you go lower
right<00:01:21.659> corner<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> windows<00:01:22.439> store<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:23.640> snap

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
right corner the windows store is snap

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.719 
right corner the windows store is snap
in<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.869> corner<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:25.740> snap<00:01:26.130> assist<00:01:26.310> is

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
in that corner so now snap assist is

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.940 
in that corner so now snap assist is
going<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.090> show<00:01:27.270> me<00:01:27.299> file<00:01:27.869> explorer<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.650> three

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
going to show me file explorer and three

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.890 
going to show me file explorer and three
dium<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.850> top<00:01:30.030> right<00:01:30.270> corner<00:01:30.420> which<00:01:30.750> one

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
dium on the top right corner which one

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.569 
dium on the top right corner which one
do<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.079> want<00:01:31.320> let's<00:01:31.500> go<00:01:31.710> ahead<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:32.100> file

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
do I want let's go ahead with file

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.609 
do I want let's go ahead with file
explorer<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.570> far<00:01:33.810> I've<00:01:33.930> shown<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.140> snapping

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
explorer so far I've shown you snapping

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.469 
explorer so far I've shown you snapping
these<00:01:34.740> windows<00:01:35.220> with<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.670> finger<00:01:36.030> or<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
these windows with the finger or the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.690 
these windows with the finger or the
mouse<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.170> could<00:01:37.320> also<00:01:37.560> snap<00:01:38.070> with<00:01:38.430> your

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
mouse but you could also snap with your

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.520 
mouse but you could also snap with your
keyboard<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.450> for<00:01:39.630> example<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.140> windows

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
keyboard so for example have the windows

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.710 
keyboard so for example have the windows
central<00:01:40.950> page<00:01:41.159> here<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.939> snap<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.509> the
