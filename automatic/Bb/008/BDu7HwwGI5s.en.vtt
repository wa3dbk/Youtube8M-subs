00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
to play them because I only wrote the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.000 
to play them because I only wrote the
melody<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.430> tab<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.510> staff<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.800> wrote

chord<00:00:26.250> shapes<00:00:26.520> so<00:00:27.270> I<00:00:27.570> did<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.260> avoid

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
chord shapes so I did that to avoid

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:42.200 
chord shapes so I did that to avoid
people<00:00:29.820> playing<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:40.880> to<00:00:41.880> me<00:00:42.030> that's

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
people playing like this to me that's

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.299 
people playing like this to me that's
not<00:00:42.450> really<00:00:42.750> chord<00:00:42.960> analogy<00:00:43.350> what<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.160> have

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
not really chord analogy what you have

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.010 
not really chord analogy what you have
to<00:00:44.460> do<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.670> learn<00:00:44.880> the<00:00:45.059> melody<00:00:45.239> very<00:00:45.510> well

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
played riff mcli and then learn to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.270 
played riff mcli and then learn to
accompany<00:00:48.390> accompany<00:00:49.290> yourself<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.950> doesn't

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
accompany accompany yourself it doesn't

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.959

have<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.880> be<00:00:51.030> chord<00:00:52.130> melody<00:00:53.130> you<00:00:53.670> don't<00:00:53.880> have

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
have to be chord melody you don't have

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.180 
have to be chord melody you don't have
to<00:00:54.090> chunk<00:00:54.390> chunk<00:00:54.540> chunk<00:00:54.630> all<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> time<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.710> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
to chunk chunk chunk all the time so you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.790 
to chunk chunk chunk all the time so you
have<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.489> learn<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> melody<00:00:57.300> first<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.260> then

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
have to learn the melody first and then

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.020 
have to learn the melody first and then
you'll<00:00:58.950> figure<00:00:59.100> out<00:00:59.219> chord<00:00:59.550> shapes<00:00:59.790> later

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
you'll figure out chord shapes later

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.270 
you'll figure out chord shapes later
that's<00:01:00.870> why<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.140> put<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> chord<00:01:01.829> shapes<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
that's why I put the chord shapes on the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.789 
that's why I put the chord shapes on the
website<00:01:02.610> above<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.239> staff<00:01:03.510> above<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> tabs
