00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
I love it I love this book because it's

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.690 
I love it I love this book because it's
based<00:00:42.480> on<00:00:42.719> giving<00:00:43.290> rather<00:00:43.950> than<00:00:44.280> receiving

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
based on giving rather than receiving

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.490 
based on giving rather than receiving
and<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.329> what<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.480> did<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> sad<00:00:46.170> little<00:00:46.350> tree

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and so what I did is a sad little tree

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.170 
and so what I did is a sad little tree
in<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> middle<00:00:47.039> kind<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.430> represents<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
in the middle kind of represents the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.910 
in the middle kind of represents the
giving<00:00:48.510> tree<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.870> gives<00:00:49.050> his<00:00:49.289> leaves<00:00:49.620> leaves

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
giving tree that gives his leaves leaves

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.490 
giving tree that gives his leaves leaves
and<00:00:50.280> his<00:00:50.370> branches<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.030> his<00:00:51.149> fruit<00:00:51.480> that's<00:00:52.260> on

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
and his branches and his fruit that's on

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.959 
and his branches and his fruit that's on
the<00:00:52.680> giving<00:00:52.980> tree<00:00:53.160> there's<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.399> leaf<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:53.850> each

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
the giving tree there's a leaf for each

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.119 
the giving tree there's a leaf for each
child<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:55.230> what<00:00:55.410> they<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.710> do<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:55.980> they<00:00:56.010> can

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
child and what they can do is they can

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.819 
child and what they can do is they can
take<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.730> leaf<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.840> back<00:00:58.050> they<00:00:58.620> can

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
take a leaf and on the back they can

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.170 
take a leaf and on the back they can
write<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.489> something<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.850> they<00:01:00.149> can

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
write what is something that they can

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.479 
write what is something that they can
give<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:01.020> everybody<00:01:01.710> has<00:01:02.010> something<00:01:02.309> to

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
give because everybody has something to

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.060 
give because everybody has something to
give<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.180> sometimes<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.140> really<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.650> better

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
give and sometimes it really is better

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.609 
give and sometimes it really is better
to<00:01:05.369> give<00:01:05.670> rather<00:01:06.060> than<00:01:06.330> receive<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.049> so

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
to give rather than receive and so

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.679 
to give rather than receive and so
that's<00:01:08.520> gonna<00:01:08.700> kind<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> loose<00:01:09.450> theme

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
that's gonna kind of be the loose theme

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.240 
that's gonna kind of be the loose theme
around<00:01:09.900> Anouk<00:01:10.380> doubles<00:01:10.710> as<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.830> centerpiece

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
around Anouk doubles as the centerpiece

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.010 
around Anouk doubles as the centerpiece
doubles<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> centerpiece<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.600> then<00:01:12.659> what<00:01:12.990> I

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
doubles as a centerpiece and then what I

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.140 
doubles as a centerpiece and then what I
did<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> plates<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.220> decided<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.970> make

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
did for the plates is I decided to make

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.850 
did for the plates is I decided to make
them<00:01:15.270> custom<00:01:15.780> plates<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.170> I've<00:01:16.290> done<00:01:16.500> stuff

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
them custom plates and I've done stuff

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.679 
them custom plates and I've done stuff
similar<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.580> before<00:01:17.759> they're<00:01:18.479> just

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
similar to this before they're just

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.530 
similar to this before they're just
basic<00:01:19.080> glass<00:01:19.380> plates<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.189> then<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.970> cut

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
basic glass plates and then I just cut

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.780 
basic glass plates and then I just cut
out<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> circle<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.220> scrapbook<00:01:23.220> paper<00:01:23.460> and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
out a circle of a scrapbook paper and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.780 
out a circle of a scrapbook paper and
put<00:01:24.240> their<00:01:24.420> names<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.200> then<00:01:25.580> paste<00:01:26.580> it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
put their names on it and then paste it

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.950 
put their names on it and then paste it
it<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> bottom<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.570> will<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.810> come

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
it to the bottom and it will just come

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.770 
it to the bottom and it will just come
off<00:01:28.140> with<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.530> hot<00:01:29.100> water<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.210> sink

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
off with like hot water in in the sink

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.210 
off with like hot water in in the sink
so<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.020> comes<00:01:31.110> off<00:01:31.259> really<00:01:31.470> easily<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.890> each

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
so it comes off really easily and each

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.800 
so it comes off really easily and each
