easier<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.750> bend<00:02:43.930> for<00:02:44.230> those<00:02:45.010> few<00:02:45.250> more

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
easier to bend for those few more

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.390 
easier to bend for those few more
moments<00:02:45.580> right<00:02:46.150> uh<00:02:47.819> she's<00:02:48.819> quickly<00:02:50.400> fastening

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
moments right uh she's quickly fastening

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.550 
moments right uh she's quickly fastening
the<00:02:51.580> other<00:02:52.470> rib<00:02:53.470> here<00:02:53.739> yeah<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:55.630> I<00:02:56.320> think<00:02:56.380> you

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
the other rib here yeah and I think you

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.220 
the other rib here yeah and I think you
mentioned<00:02:56.769> they<00:02:57.040> can<00:02:57.190> be<00:02:57.310> centered<00:02:57.760> exactly

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
mentioned they can be centered exactly

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.280 
mentioned they can be centered exactly
in<00:02:59.230> place<00:02:59.470> more<00:02:59.829> precisely<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.780> go<00:03:01.780> over<00:03:02.140> all

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
in place more precisely you go over all

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.020 
in place more precisely you go over all
the<00:03:02.560> make<00:03:02.799> sure<00:03:03.010> they're<00:03:03.220> just<00:03:03.700> in<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:03.940> right

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
the make sure they're just in the right

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.210 
the make sure they're just in the right
spot<00:03:04.090> so<00:03:04.750> we<00:03:04.840> have<00:03:04.930> an<00:03:05.049> even<00:03:05.320> bottom<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:08.220> must

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
spot so we have an even bottom I must

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.599 
spot so we have an even bottom I must
across<00:03:09.640> very<00:03:09.940> quite<00:03:10.180> amazing

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
across very quite amazing

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:22.140 
across very quite amazing
you<00:03:12.609> must<00:03:12.820> have<00:03:12.970> hands<00:03:13.329> of<00:03:13.450> Steel<00:03:21.150> bending

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
you must have hands of Steel bending

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.090 
you must have hands of Steel bending
wood<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:25.390> that<00:03:25.540> just<00:03:25.780> keeps<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.769> in<00:03:26.890> place<00:03:27.069> of

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
wood and that just keeps it in place of

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.140 
wood and that just keeps it in place of
me<00:03:27.400> temporarily<00:03:27.970> I<00:03:28.180> guess<00:03:29.850> now<00:03:30.850> I<00:03:30.880> guess<00:03:31.120> you

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
me temporarily I guess now I guess you

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.880
