00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.360 
from all around the world how do I catch
more<00:00:05.640> steelhead<00:00:06.379> now<00:00:07.379> we<00:00:07.770> know<00:00:07.890> steelhead

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
more steelhead now we know steelhead

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.549 
more steelhead now we know steelhead
return<00:00:08.730> in<00:00:09.059> winter<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:09.990> summer<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.469> the

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
return in winter and summer in the

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.440 
return in winter and summer in the
freshwater<00:00:11.099> systems<00:00:11.639> rivers<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.179> streams

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
freshwater systems rivers and streams

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.180 
freshwater systems rivers and streams
and<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:12.809> on<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.380> thing<00:00:13.559> about<00:00:13.590> steelhead

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
and so on the thing about steelhead

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.980 
and so on the thing about steelhead
though<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.490> their<00:00:14.849> environments<00:00:15.540> constantly

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
though is their environments constantly

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.320 
though is their environments constantly
changing<00:00:16.440> weather<00:00:16.740> yeah<00:00:17.520> cloud<00:00:17.789> cover<00:00:18.090> one

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
changing weather yeah cloud cover one

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.150 
changing weather yeah cloud cover one
day<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.570> have<00:00:18.900> higher<00:00:19.199> water<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.740> next<00:00:19.920> day

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
day you have higher water the next day

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160 
day you have higher water the next day
and<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.490> on<00:00:20.699> what<00:00:21.180> I'm<00:00:21.300> getting<00:00:21.660> at<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.840> their

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
and so on what I'm getting at is their

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.990 
and so on what I'm getting at is their
environments<00:00:22.800> constantly<00:00:23.369> changing<00:00:23.850> and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
environments constantly changing and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.810 
environments constantly changing and
that<00:00:24.539> change<00:00:24.869> affects<00:00:25.470> how<00:00:26.099> steelhead<00:00:26.550> react

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
that change affects how steelhead react

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.660 
that change affects how steelhead react
to<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> fly<00:00:27.269> what<00:00:28.230> we<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.650> control<00:00:29.070> though<00:00:29.310> when

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
to a fly what we can control though when

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.060 
to a fly what we can control though when
we're<00:00:29.880> still<00:00:30.240> heading<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.869> swing<00:00:31.260> or<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
we're still heading on the swing or the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.020 
we're still heading on the swing or the
two<00:00:32.309> handed<00:00:32.640> rod<00:00:32.690> are<00:00:33.690> three<00:00:33.989> things<00:00:35.030> there's

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
two handed rod are three things there's

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.180 
two handed rod are three things there's
really<00:00:36.149> only<00:00:36.270> three<00:00:36.649> variables<00:00:37.649> within<00:00:37.860> fly

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
really only three variables within fly

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.190 
really only three variables within fly
choice<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.910> size<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> fly<00:00:39.570> whether<00:00:39.989> it's

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
choice the size of the fly whether it's

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.650 
choice the size of the fly whether it's
a<00:00:40.260> small<00:00:40.500> fly<00:00:40.829> or<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> big<00:00:41.370> fly<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:42.360> get<00:00:42.510> to

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
a small fly or a big fly you get to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.450 
a small fly or a big fly you get to
control<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.140> I'll<00:00:43.590> give<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.950> hint<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
control that I'll give you a hint the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.029 
control that I'll give you a hint the
waters<00:00:44.850> clear<00:00:45.450> fish<00:00:45.989> are<00:00:46.200> spooky<00:00:46.559> probably

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
waters clear fish are spooky probably

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.160 
waters clear fish are spooky probably
want<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.309> fishing<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.700> smaller<00:00:48.000> fly<00:00:48.329> flip<00:00:49.050> it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
want to be fishing a smaller fly flip it

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.080 
want to be fishing a smaller fly flip it
the<00:00:49.260> other<00:00:49.289> way<00:00:49.620> cold<00:00:50.070> water<00:00:50.430> fish<00:00:50.789> are<00:00:50.969> maybe

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the other way cold water fish are maybe

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.729 
the other way cold water fish are maybe
a<00:00:51.210> little<00:00:51.420> lethargic<00:00:51.600> or<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> waters<00:00:52.559> off

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
a little lethargic or the waters off

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.910 
a little lethargic or the waters off
color<00:00:53.039> maybe<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.699> larger<00:00:54.090> fly<00:00:54.530> let's<00:00:55.530> go<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
color maybe a larger fly let's go to the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.670 
color maybe a larger fly let's go to the
second<00:00:56.309> variable<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.300> flies<00:00:57.539> which<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
second variable in flies which is the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.819 
second variable in flies which is the
shade<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> fly<00:01:00.140> hmm<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.440> also<00:01:01.559> call

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
shade of the fly hmm you can also call

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.619 
shade of the fly hmm you can also call
that<00:01:02.010> color<00:01:02.190> but<00:01:02.760> whether<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.180> light<00:01:03.359> fly

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
that color but whether it's a light fly

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.780 
that color but whether it's a light fly
or<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> colored<00:01:04.290> fly<00:01:04.530> or<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.769> dark<00:01:05.070> fly<00:01:05.339> that

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
or a colored fly or a dark fly that

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.240 
or a colored fly or a dark fly that
plays<00:01:06.090> into<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> same<00:01:06.750> variables<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.890> water

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
plays into the same variables in water

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.760 
plays into the same variables in water
conditions<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:08.970> well<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.540> lighter<00:01:10.140> fly<00:01:10.470> or<00:01:10.619> more

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
conditions as well a lighter fly or more

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.800 
conditions as well a lighter fly or more
neutrally<00:01:11.250> colored<00:01:11.580> fly<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.119> best<00:01:12.479> when<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
neutrally colored fly is best when the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.510 
neutrally colored fly is best when the
water<00:01:13.020> super<00:01:13.500> clear<00:01:13.770> don't<00:01:14.100> want<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.340> spook

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520

water super clear don't want to spook
the<00:01:14.670> fish<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.390> maybe<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.659> brightly<00:01:16.229> colored

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
fly or a darker colored fly is better

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.260 
fly or a darker colored fly is better
when<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.470> water<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> little<00:01:19.920> chalky<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
gives it a bigger profile so the fish

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.280
