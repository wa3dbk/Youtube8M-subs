00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
also thinking of doing series I've got a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.150 
also thinking of doing series I've got a
few<00:00:45.989> different<00:00:46.020> ideas<00:00:46.379> for<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.039> I'm<00:00:47.129> not

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
few different ideas for that but I'm not

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.200 
few different ideas for that but I'm not
sure<00:00:47.280> what<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.670> gonna<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.879> yet

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
sure what it's gonna be yet

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.830 
sure what it's gonna be yet
but<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> want<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.230> focus<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.620> making<00:00:49.739> better

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
but I want to focus on making better

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.060 
but I want to focus on making better
videos<00:00:51.840> because<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.500> haven't<00:00:52.620> had<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.800> lot<00:00:52.949> of

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
videos because I haven't had a lot of

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
videos because I haven't had a lot of
time<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.460> actually<00:00:53.820> invest<00:00:55.010> into<00:00:56.010> making<00:00:56.309> more

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
time to actually invest into making more

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.150 
time to actually invest into making more
animations<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:57.989> hopefully<00:00:58.739> I'll<00:00:58.859> get<00:00:59.010> more

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
animations but hopefully I'll get more

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.299 
animations but hopefully I'll get more
time<00:00:59.399> soon<00:00:59.840> to<00:01:00.840> make<00:01:01.079> better<00:01:01.320> things<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.070> yeah

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
time soon to make better things and yeah

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.609 
time soon to make better things and yeah
all<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.149> stuff<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:04.140> am<00:01:04.260> gonna<00:01:04.470> be<00:01:04.589> making

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
all that stuff and I am gonna be making

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.940 
all that stuff and I am gonna be making
more<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.189> these<00:01:06.200> but<00:01:07.200> they're<00:01:07.560> probably<00:01:07.710> gonna

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
more of these but they're probably gonna

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.690 
more of these but they're probably gonna
be<00:01:08.070> pretty<00:01:08.130> scarce<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.970> when<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.600> do<00:01:09.689> they<00:01:09.900> make

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
be pretty scarce and when I do they make

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.820 
be pretty scarce and when I do they make
the<00:01:11.700> ones<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.090> make<00:01:12.390> will<00:01:12.600> probably<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.290> go

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the ones I do make will probably not go

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.260 
the ones I do make will probably not go
up<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.280> channel<00:01:14.580> they'll<00:01:14.820> probably<00:01:15.000> go

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
up on this channel they'll probably go

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.910 
up on this channel they'll probably go
on<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> channel<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.470> person<00:01:16.799> I'm
