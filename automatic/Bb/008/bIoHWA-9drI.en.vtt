 today is not in espresso powder and is 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.170
 dust tell me what time yes because I 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.850
 many years ago I started 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.920
 as I have the hair is extremely 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.590
 greasy then in those occasions that no 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.869
 I had time to wash my hair with 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.080
 the reason why it was then then I 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:17.380
 I would throw that spray and leave your hair 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.649
 as finished washing what I do not 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.869
 knew then was that 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:28.420
 probably that the clay of full 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.450
 toxic chemicals we do there 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.580
 today's is natural and powder that is 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.500
 different because we are then 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.310
 also conserving our environment 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.259
 ambient 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.679

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.890

 it looks beautiful so let's start 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.440
 the first ingredient that you will use 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.380
 is a spoonful of coconut oil that 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.330
 will provide natural ingredients that 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.970
 they are going to help our hair with 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.190
 growth and with its brightness the second 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.740
 ingredient is a spoonful of honey that 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.950
 It has many vitamins and minerals that 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.440
 They will help your hair and it is also the 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.720
 responsible for giving it that shine that 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.840
 you're looking for what you 're going to mix well and 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.690

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.330
 minutes giving you a soft massage and 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.730
 cough in the head to reduce fatigue 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:32.209
 mentally and then you're going to swallow it 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.030
 the second recipe is a dry shampoo 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.480
 Well this dry shampoo which 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.030
 it really does is absorb that fat 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.060
 of the scalp firstly 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.610
 will use 2 tablespoons of aaron root 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.549

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.650
 virus two tablespoons of baking 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:56.420

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.519
 ingredients well and then we enter it 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:12.319
 in this container this container what it is is 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.230
 a salt shaker is because it's so much easier 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:19.430
 to apply it on the scalp as well 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.310
 that you will apply it and with the yolks of
