00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.710
 Minions' peculiar sense of humor 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.559
 the cartoon is voiced by the directors themselves 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.600
 projects perkov n and kris early caffin 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.520
 said that before the dubbing he 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.800
 decided to test and show how 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.960
 about should be the speech of minions 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.360

 Well now you yourself will voice them 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.280
 for making speech minions caffeine 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.600
 used words from multiple languages 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.570
 french indian english 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.189
 spanish italian and others in these 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.710
 in words you can also guess the name 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.720
 different dishes for example the phrase is the name 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.299
 Indian Chicken Dishes 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.610
 to perceive these phrases was easier 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.320
 in each scene now and then slips 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.950
 some clear and ordinary people 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.950
 the words 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.620
 in the second part of the ugly i'm angry 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.360
 the minions were purple 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.220
 curious purple and yellow 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.659

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.360
 color spectrum 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.000
 so, we have a good symbolism 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.950
 minions are completely thought but evil is the opposite 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.470
 could boast luxuriant hair 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.660
 even though they were moving a little scary but 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.360
 still looked funny and by the way 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.340
 about evil minions in cartoons looney tyunz 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.590

 muck after which turns into evil and 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.420
 gloomy exactly this technique used 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.130
 in the second part of the ugly I'm one of 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.899
