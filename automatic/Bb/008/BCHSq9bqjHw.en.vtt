00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.550 
phone maybe like a novelty foam like
it's<00:02:32.700> not<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.180> was<00:02:33.299> not<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.540> plastic<00:02:34.019> or

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
it's not it was not a plastic or

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.920 
it's not it was not a plastic or
obviously<00:02:35.220> metal<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:35.879> it's<00:02:36.330> not<00:02:36.450> gonna<00:02:36.840> be

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
obviously metal so it's not gonna be

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.839 
obviously metal so it's not gonna be
separate<00:02:37.530> links<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.010> stuff<00:02:38.340> like<00:02:38.519> that<00:02:38.700> it's

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.030 
just that that face that angry face you
can<00:02:55.530> put<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:55.829> with<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.160> ice<00:02:56.400> straight<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:58.040> the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
can put it with the ice straight and the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.920 
can put it with the ice straight and the
same<00:02:59.310> thing<00:02:59.640> with<00:02:59.819> the<00:03:00.000> with<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.390> normal<00:03:00.720> face

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930

if we go by the figma status I think it

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.100 
if we go by the figma status I think it
will<00:05:07.370> but<00:05:08.370> I'm<00:05:08.490> not<00:05:08.610> sure<00:05:08.819> another<00:05:09.690> thing<00:05:09.960> that

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
will but I'm not sure another thing that

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.600 
will but I'm not sure another thing that
this<00:05:10.289> one<00:05:10.500> has<00:05:10.710> that<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:10.949> figma<00:05:11.219> doesn't<00:05:11.490> have

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
this one has that the figma doesn't have

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.610 
this one has that the figma doesn't have
is<00:05:11.759> actual<00:05:12.180> accessories<00:05:12.810> you<00:05:12.960> know<00:05:13.080> that's

is actual accessories you know that's
something<00:05:13.860> that<00:05:14.159> I<00:05:14.190> think<00:05:14.460> lacked<00:05:15.060> from<00:05:15.419> the

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
something that I think lacked from the
