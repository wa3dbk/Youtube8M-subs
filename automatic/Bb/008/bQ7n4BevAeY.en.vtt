00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
brand-new pickup system which is the a

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.000 
brand-new pickup system which is the a

acoustic resonance transducer
preamplifier<00:01:08.950> system<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:09.670> it's<00:01:10.150> a

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
preamplifier system and it's a

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.820 
preamplifier system and it's a
revolutionary<00:01:10.840> new<00:01:11.080> system<00:01:11.110> for<00:01:11.680> them

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
revolutionary new system for them

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.950 
revolutionary new system for them
because<00:01:12.160> it<00:01:12.310> tries<00:01:12.550> to<00:01:12.580> recreate<00:01:13.270> a<00:01:13.510> more

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
because it tries to recreate a more

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.530 
because it tries to recreate a more
natural<00:01:14.410> sounding<00:01:14.830> acoustic<00:01:15.430> so<00:01:16.119> let's<00:01:16.330> take

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
natural sounding acoustic so let's take

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.969 
natural sounding acoustic so let's take
a<00:01:16.570> look<00:01:16.810> at<00:01:16.900> what<00:01:17.020> this<00:01:17.110> pickup<00:01:17.440> can<00:01:17.619> do<00:01:17.770> and

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
a look at what this pickup can do and

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.530 
a look at what this pickup can do and
let's<00:01:18.430> hear<00:01:18.550> what<00:01:18.670> this<00:01:18.760> guitar<00:01:19.119> can<00:01:19.270> do<00:01:19.390> as

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
let's hear what this guitar can do as

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.870 
let's hear what this guitar can do as
well<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.770> let's<00:01:20.920> talk<00:01:21.070> about<00:01:21.130> Yamahas<00:01:21.850> new

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
well so let's talk about Yamahas new

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.030 
well so let's talk about Yamahas new
secret<00:01:22.420> weapon<00:01:22.750> which<00:01:23.229> is<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.560> yamaha

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
secret weapon which is the yamaha

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.090 
secret weapon which is the yamaha
acoustic<00:01:24.700> resonance<00:01:25.540> transducer<00:01:26.290> pickup

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
acoustic resonance transducer pickup

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.310 
acoustic resonance transducer pickup
system<00:01:27.340> which<00:01:27.640> consists<00:01:28.330> of<00:01:28.420> four<00:01:28.780> contact

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
system which consists of four contact

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.200 
system which consists of four contact
pickups<00:01:29.710> which<00:01:30.490> are<00:01:30.670> mounted<00:01:30.820> on<00:01:31.090> the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
pickups which are mounted on the

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.410 
pickups which are mounted on the
underside<00:01:31.660> of<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:31.960> soundboard<00:01:33.420> basically

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
underside of the soundboard basically

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.330 
underside of the soundboard basically
it's<00:01:34.600> a<00:01:34.690> three-way<00:01:35.080> system<00:01:35.530> we<00:01:35.800> have<00:01:35.979> a<00:01:36.009> pair

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
it's a three-way system we have a pair

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.669 
it's a three-way system we have a pair
of<00:01:36.369> transducers<00:01:37.150> which<00:01:37.360> are<00:01:37.570> just<00:01:38.020> underneath

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
of transducers which are just underneath

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.430 
of transducers which are just underneath
the<00:01:38.950> bridge<00:01:39.360> roughly<00:01:40.360> around<00:01:40.479> this<00:01:40.810> area<00:01:41.110> and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
the bridge roughly around this area and

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.630 
the bridge roughly around this area and
then<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.550> have<00:01:43.050> two<00:01:44.050> sub<00:01:44.530> pickups<00:01:45.009> which<00:01:45.460> are

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
then you have two sub pickups which are

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.279 
then you have two sub pickups which are
also<00:01:45.789> transducers<00:01:46.539> which<00:01:46.660> are<00:01:46.780> mounted<00:01:46.899> under

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
also transducers which are mounted under

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.830 
also transducers which are mounted under
the<00:01:47.440> top<00:01:47.679> right<00:01:48.490> about<00:01:48.759> here<00:01:49.179> on<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.450> treble

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
the top right about here on the treble

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.800 
the top right about here on the treble
side<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.410> right<00:01:50.890> about<00:01:51.160> here<00:01:51.220> on<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:52.600> bass

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
side and right about here on the bass

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.969 
side and right about here on the bass
side<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:54.149> let<00:01:55.149> me<00:01:55.240> talk<00:01:55.479> about<00:01:55.509> how<00:01:56.319> these<00:01:56.649> are

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
side and let me talk about how these are

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.850 
side and let me talk about how these are
all<00:01:57.009> working<00:01:57.640> together<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:59.229> idea<00:01:59.560> of<00:01:59.679> using

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
all working together the idea of using

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.950 
all working together the idea of using
for<00:02:00.280> contact<00:02:00.729> pickups<00:02:01.119> under<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.509> soundboard

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
for contact pickups under the soundboard

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.510 
for contact pickups under the soundboard
is<00:02:02.170> that<00:02:02.319> they<00:02:02.440> dramatically<00:02:03.130> reduce

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
is that they dramatically reduce

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.969 
is that they dramatically reduce
feedback<00:02:04.240> while<00:02:04.960> preserving<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.740> natural

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
feedback while preserving the natural

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.270 
feedback while preserving the natural
and<00:02:06.550> rich<00:02:06.819> tone<00:02:07.179> of<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.750> acoustic<00:02:08.319> so<00:02:09.009> the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
and rich tone of the acoustic so the

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.790 
and rich tone of the acoustic so the
main<00:02:09.490> pair<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:10.179> transducers<00:02:11.080> are<00:02:11.290> controlled

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
main pair of transducers are controlled

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.670 
main pair of transducers are controlled
via<00:02:12.100> this<00:02:12.910> master<00:02:13.480> volume<00:02:13.720> knob<00:02:13.930> now<00:02:14.410> these

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
via this master volume knob now these

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.340 
via this master volume knob now these
are<00:02:14.920> always<00:02:15.130> on<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.569> course<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:17.020> control

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
are always on and of course you control

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.050 
are always on and of course you control
the<00:02:17.500> overall<00:02:17.830> volume<00:02:18.040> level<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.730> acoustic

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
the overall volume level of the acoustic

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.410 
the overall volume level of the acoustic
with<00:02:19.270> this<00:02:19.660> knob<00:02:20.080> as<00:02:20.410> well<00:02:20.620> now<00:02:21.459> over<00:02:22.180> here<00:02:22.300> we

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
with this knob as well now over here we

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.600 
with this knob as well now over here we
have<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.569> 3<00:02:22.780> band<00:02:22.990> EQ<00:02:23.350> which<00:02:23.620> increases<00:02:24.459> all<00:02:24.580> the

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
have a 3 band EQ which increases all the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.430 
have a 3 band EQ which increases all the
