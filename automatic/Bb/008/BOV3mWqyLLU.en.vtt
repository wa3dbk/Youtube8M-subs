00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.529
 put it inside the house I think this stuff 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:28.569
 stay clear 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.569
 enough foot this footprint another goal 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.579
 I do not think so 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.960

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.250
 great heart 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.280

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.649
 space 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.170

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.119
 support tables 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.640
 in the same direction the thump on tv 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.729
 and places the secondary part if passes the main 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.630
 the main pieces will have more things to become will be the pieces 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.149
 minor licensing plow space will give an image 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.170
 in another space 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.049

 is long search for that decoration continues and always on trend 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.450
 and with its own style 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.450
 at the time of buying from among excitement 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.780
 and this should be controlled but especially when it is a 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.510
 like this 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.630
 be controlled in the afternoon. 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.640
 has to give declaration and the creativity then exists of the area nunes macedo 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.780
 decoration of the interesting places of the sofa for example the client he has 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.380
 one single he could have an inter couch in the state 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.520
 She works at home that he could do to save money. 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.969

 and this is 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.910
 is a plant practically a German ecological consciousness of the 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.039
 reform until you are not going to buy another 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:15.270
 practically dry without the product 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.690
 and if the change is in the tissue 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.900
 remember that some coverings such as showgirl and print are eternal 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.180
 and when the decor goes to the wall what to do 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.070
 optimistic pictures plus one question 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.289
 What does danusa do? 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:33.739

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:47.889
 then customer he can opt for a white color and put a detail as a 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:53.079
 mirror as the frame or simply put a different color on the wall and 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.150
 this too 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.730
 is enough 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.370
 financially speaking 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.909
 it is very common to do 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.909
