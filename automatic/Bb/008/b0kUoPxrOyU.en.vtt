Akane's<00:01:16.090> me<00:01:16.270> um<00:01:16.509> I'm<00:01:17.320> sure<00:01:17.350> like<00:01:17.829> halfway

Akane's me um I'm sure like halfway

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.460 
Akane's me um I'm sure like halfway
through<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.909> experience<00:01:19.750> like<00:01:19.960> my<00:01:20.200> hair<00:01:20.439> is

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
through the experience like my hair is

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.969 
through the experience like my hair is
completely<00:01:21.990> saturated<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.409> from<00:01:23.740> here

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
completely saturated and from here

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.850 
completely saturated and from here
because<00:01:24.640> it's<00:01:24.820> kind<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.119> bad<00:01:25.270> lighting<00:01:25.860> my

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
because it's kind of bad lighting my

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.389 
because it's kind of bad lighting my
hair<00:01:27.040> looks<00:01:27.250> Brown<00:01:27.520> but<00:01:27.880> it's<00:01:28.030> not<00:01:28.360> it's<00:01:28.750> just

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
hair looks Brown but it's not it's just

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.100 
hair looks Brown but it's not it's just
white<00:01:30.399> and<00:01:30.640> like<00:01:31.030> your<00:01:31.210> haircut<00:01:31.570> looks<00:01:31.600> darker

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
white and like your haircut looks darker

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.029 
white and like your haircut looks darker
when<00:01:32.259> it's<00:01:32.380> wet<00:01:32.530> so<00:01:32.890> I<00:01:33.450> hear<00:01:34.450> all<00:01:34.780> my<00:01:35.170> hair<00:01:35.799> is

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
when it's wet so I hear all my hair is

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.700 
when it's wet so I hear all my hair is
completely<00:01:38.189> wet<00:01:39.509> okay<00:01:40.509> so<00:01:40.570> if<00:01:41.409> you<00:01:41.530> think

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
completely wet okay so if you think

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.399 
completely wet okay so if you think
about<00:01:41.799> it<00:01:42.130> I<00:01:42.340> can<00:01:42.670> kind<00:01:42.909> of<00:01:42.970> be<00:01:43.030> your<00:01:43.659> books

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
about it I can kind of be your books

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.200 
about it I can kind of be your books
case<00:01:44.649> scenario<00:01:45.039> you<00:01:45.280> don't<00:01:45.610> have<00:01:45.820> a<00:01:45.850> friend

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
case scenario you don't have a friend

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.240 
case scenario you don't have a friend
come<00:01:46.509> with<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.289> to<00:01:47.679> tie<00:01:47.830> your<00:01:47.890> hair<00:01:47.979> which

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
come with you and to tie your hair which

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.399 
come with you and to tie your hair which
is<00:01:48.280> probably<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.670> best<00:01:48.990> way<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.020> do<00:01:50.289> it

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
is probably the best way to do it

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:51.840 
is probably the best way to do it
because<00:01:50.560> they<00:01:51.009> can<00:01:51.220> make<00:01:51.399> sure<00:01:51.610> to<00:01:51.640> get

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
because they can make sure to get

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.219 
because they can make sure to get
everything<00:01:52.299> like<00:01:52.450> I<00:01:52.600> think<00:01:52.959> I've<00:01:53.080> got

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
everything like I think I've got

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.940 
everything like I think I've got
everything<00:01:53.649> but<00:01:53.950> probably<00:01:54.729> not<00:01:54.819> the<00:01:54.940> best<00:01:55.950> and

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
everything but probably not the best and

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.740 
everything but probably not the best and
you<00:01:57.490> know<00:01:57.520> obviously<00:01:58.119> if<00:01:58.330> you<00:01:58.420> don't<00:01:58.600> have

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
you know obviously if you don't have

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.830 
you know obviously if you don't have
hydrogen<00:01:59.140> peroxide<00:01:59.319> I<00:02:00.069> mean<00:02:00.549> and<00:02:01.330> then<00:02:01.479> say<00:02:01.690> is

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
hydrogen peroxide I mean and then say is

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.870 
hydrogen peroxide I mean and then say is
if<00:02:02.080> you<00:02:02.170> don't<00:02:02.259> have<00:02:02.380> a<00:02:02.500> dying<00:02:03.039> cat<00:02:03.310> than<00:02:03.490> using

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
if you don't have a dying cat than using

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.539 
if you don't have a dying cat than using
hydrogen<00:02:04.270> peroxide<00:02:04.479> so<00:02:05.049> if<00:02:05.920> it<00:02:06.100> goes<00:02:06.250> wrong

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
hydrogen peroxide so if it goes wrong

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.059 
hydrogen peroxide so if it goes wrong
then<00:02:07.179> you<00:02:07.720> can<00:02:07.899> look<00:02:08.019> at<00:02:08.170> me<00:02:08.319> and<00:02:08.530> say<00:02:08.739> oh<00:02:09.009> I

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
then you can look at me and say oh I

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.590 
then you can look at me and say oh I
don't<00:02:09.310> want<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.549> be<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.759> Kristin<00:02:10.179> her<00:02:10.360> hair<00:02:10.509> is

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
really junky

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.270 
really junky
okay<00:02:12.730> so<00:02:12.790> we'll<00:02:13.510> wait<00:02:13.840> thirty<00:02:14.260> minutes<00:02:14.709> and

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
makes it like a little bit translucent

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.819 
makes it like a little bit translucent
like<00:02:39.400> like<00:02:40.239> when<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.540> was<00:02:40.690> done<00:02:40.900> like<00:02:41.140> obviously

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829

you<00:02:42.370> can't<00:02:42.640> really<00:02:42.820> tell<00:02:43.090> because<00:02:43.269> they<00:02:43.450> know

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
you can't really tell because they know

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.910 
you can't really tell because they know
it's<00:02:43.750> just<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.170> web<00:02:44.680> camera<00:02:45.180> but<00:02:46.709> my<00:02:47.709> hair

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
it's just a web camera but my hair

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.069 
it's just a web camera but my hair
didn't<00:02:48.250> really<00:02:48.459> look<00:02:48.609> any<00:02:48.819> better<00:02:49.209> than<00:02:49.810> when

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
didn't really look any better than when

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:56.849 
didn't really look any better than when
it<00:02:50.200> did<00:02:50.410> um<00:02:51.010> before<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.910> started<00:02:52.769> like<00:02:53.769> I<00:02:55.859> even

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
it did um before I started like I even

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.309 
it did um before I started like I even
went<00:02:57.069> to<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.280> extreme<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.090> like<00:02:58.450> if<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:59.139> if

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
went to the extreme and like if you if

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.050 
went to the extreme and like if you if
you<00:02:59.470> search<00:02:59.680> anywhere<00:03:00.130> it<00:03:00.310> tells<00:03:00.549> you<00:03:00.760> that

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
you search anywhere it tells you that

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.789 
you search anywhere it tells you that
you're<00:03:01.239> supposed<00:03:01.569> to<00:03:01.690> do<00:03:01.870> one<00:03:02.739> part<00:03:03.160> um

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
you're supposed to do one part um

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.559 
you're supposed to do one part um
hydrogen<00:03:05.799> peroxide<00:03:05.980> in<00:03:06.609> another<00:03:06.970> part<00:03:07.299> water

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
hydrogen peroxide in another part water

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.930 
hydrogen peroxide in another part water
and<00:03:07.720> put<00:03:08.109> them<00:03:08.200> together<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:08.769> use<00:03:09.310> straight

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
and put them together I use straight

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.199 
and put them together I use straight
hydrogen<00:03:10.660> peroxide<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.560> if<00:03:12.340> that's<00:03:12.549> stronger

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
hydrogen peroxide and if that's stronger

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.059 
hydrogen peroxide and if that's stronger
and<00:03:13.480> it<00:03:13.660> really<00:03:13.840> didn't<00:03:14.139> show<00:03:14.170> your<00:03:14.470> results

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
and it really didn't show your results

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.449 
and it really didn't show your results
then<00:03:16.410> doesn't<00:03:17.410> really<00:03:17.530> do<00:03:17.680> much<00:03:17.859> for<00:03:18.130> you<00:03:18.250> I

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
then doesn't really do much for you I

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.000 
then doesn't really do much for you I
mean<00:03:18.700> like<00:03:19.209> I<00:03:19.420> guess<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.049> cool<00:03:20.290> thing<00:03:20.530> is<00:03:20.560> is

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
mean like I guess the cool thing is is

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.150 
mean like I guess the cool thing is is
that<00:03:21.220> um<00:03:22.019> it<00:03:23.019> kind<00:03:23.290> of<00:03:23.350> made<00:03:23.500> my<00:03:23.680> hair<00:03:23.919> look<00:03:23.949> a

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
that um it kind of made my hair look a

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160 
that um it kind of made my hair look a
little<00:03:24.340> bit<00:03:24.519> brighter<00:03:24.760> but<00:03:25.209> by<00:03:25.630> no<00:03:25.690> me

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
little bit brighter but by no me

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.160 
little bit brighter but by no me
instead<00:03:26.440> turn<00:03:26.830> my<00:03:27.520> brown<00:03:27.819> hair<00:03:28.270> blonde
