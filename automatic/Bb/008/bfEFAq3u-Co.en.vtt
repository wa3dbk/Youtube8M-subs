 seller rewards of more than one 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.019
 million 500 thousand rubles I had 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:57.950
 published only 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.490

 that he has a few new bird conditions 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.659
 which this game will remain for a long time in 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.659
 each player's memory of November 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.060
 the first thing that strikes antipenko 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.140
 incredibly beautiful graphics office 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.410
 will be one of the main advantages 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.270
 games 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.340
 Beijing using normal growth 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.650

 providing models here 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.200
 of this document 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.200

 in any case, we are also completely 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.350
 remade module managers do not change 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.869
 waste with a new disc 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.670
 fraudulent shaders here 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.630
 It turned out the most realistic picture 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.649
 will give from ever created in history 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.649
 contract 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.409
 study parties witch we used 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:06.590
 fully updated system 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.069
 dialogue in which the dynamic 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.709
 the camera takes you right in the thick of things and 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.669
 plot development depends only on you 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.259
 you better stay with one 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:18.799
 princess in any other 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.329
 circumstances I would be left alone 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.629
 very important besides i have a penny 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.039

 6 she said she loves me 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.829
 he also abandoned the world in 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.530
 which actions citizens produce 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.590
 no impression on other characters 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.519
 in the world of the witcher 2 your behavior will cause 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.859
 various reactions on the spot aggressive 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.569

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.239
 country of god 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.849
 this one was such a step 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.849
 I can't believe my eyes 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:58.409
 five 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.409
 Italian songs will live their 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.449
 own life fulfill your goals and 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.689
 tasks in many ways sometimes not 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.479
 quite unpleasant in the course of events 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.559
 can not be your true friends and 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:12.559
 salutes of the enemy 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:14.919
 corporal 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.569
 yes so 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.509
 your squads is a bunch of sailors clown with but 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:20.989
 task must be completed on request 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.389
 anyway with pizza as well as attacks 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.729
 the first goal of this step forward 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.029
 take the piano to the tomatoes from 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:31.909
 dropped off 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.909
 preferably never get 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:48.959
 system finishing off well 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.849
 Proven first seen where 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.180
 it was also better after which the battle 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.040
 become even more dynamic 300 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.419
 megawatts and the fact that they should be more 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.769
 Total 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.999
 doroshenko physics will be used 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:04.669
 havov engine that adds diversity 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.669
 brilliance to your attacks yourself 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:17.650
 2 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.660
 while the system is trying to be and also 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.410
 Stanislavsky which will raise and 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.360
 without that bloody battles battles on 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.110
 new level he makes more 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.699
 energetic exciting and 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.729
 memorable
