00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
want to pick up Owen this is when I

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.820 
want to pick up Owen this is when I

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
actually got my pay below which was one

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.320 
actually got my pay below which was one
of<00:05:47.919> my<00:05:48.009> favorite<00:05:48.339> killstreaks<00:05:48.759> from<00:05:49.060> modern

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
of my favorite killstreaks from modern

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.209 
of my favorite killstreaks from modern
warfare<00:05:49.449> 3<00:05:49.599> and<00:05:50.110> I<00:05:50.560> think<00:05:50.710> this<00:05:50.770> is<00:05:50.860> one<00:05:51.039> of<00:05:51.069> the

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:51.219 
warfare 3 and I think this is one of the

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:52.649 
warfare 3 and I think this is one of the
first<00:05:51.400> times<00:05:51.520> that<00:05:51.669> I<00:05:51.759> got<00:05:51.969> it<00:05:52.120> unfortunately

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659 
first times that I got it unfortunately

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:53.909 
first times that I got it unfortunately
it's<00:05:52.839> so<00:05:53.050> late<00:05:53.259> in<00:05:53.349> the<00:05:53.439> game<00:05:53.589> that<00:05:53.650> doesn't

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
it's so late in the game that doesn't

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.249 
it's so late in the game that doesn't
really<00:05:54.069> have<00:05:54.250> any<00:05:54.370> time<00:05:54.550> to<00:05:54.699> do<00:05:54.879> anything

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 
really have any time to do anything

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:57.719 
really have any time to do anything
because<00:05:56.259> they<00:05:56.500> did<00:05:56.650> hire<00:05:56.949> it<00:05:57.159> to<00:05:57.310> a<00:05:57.339> 12

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
because they did hire it to a 12

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.339 
because they did hire it to a 12
killstreak<00:05:58.210> instead<00:05:58.479> of<00:05:58.569> a<00:05:58.629> 9<00:05:58.839> kill<00:05:59.080> streak

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
killstreak instead of a 9 kill streak

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:00.899 
killstreak instead of a 9 kill streak
maybe<00:05:59.949> I'll<00:06:00.099> start<00:06:00.339> maybe<00:06:00.550> I'll<00:06:00.699> talk<00:06:00.879> a

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:00.909 
maybe I'll start maybe I'll talk a

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:03.570 
maybe I'll start maybe I'll talk a
little<00:06:01.210> bit<00:06:01.449> more<00:06:01.599> about<00:06:01.889> the<00:06:02.889> game<00:06:03.099> in<00:06:03.250> my

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
little bit more about the game in my

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.070 
little bit more about the game in my
next<00:06:03.789> commentary<00:06:04.300> we'll<00:06:04.449> see<00:06:04.599> how<00:06:04.779> we'll<00:06:04.960> see

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
next commentary we'll see how we'll see

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.170 
next commentary we'll see how we'll see
how<00:06:05.199> how<00:06:05.830> much<00:06:06.189> I<00:06:06.310> can<00:06:06.460> talk<00:06:06.639> about<00:06:06.789> the<00:06:07.000> game

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
how how much I can talk about the game

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.059
