rough<00:00:55.750> from<00:00:56.050> rusting<00:00:56.530> not<00:00:57.100> that<00:00:57.250> I<00:00:57.280> would

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
rough from rusting not that I would

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.670 
rough from rusting not that I would
think<00:00:58.420> they<00:00:58.600> would<00:00:58.870> have<00:00:59.050> much<00:00:59.290> of<00:00:59.410> a<00:00:59.470> problem

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
think they would have much of a problem

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.670 
think they would have much of a problem
with<00:00:59.950> that<00:01:00.100> and<00:01:00.310> then<00:01:00.430> even<00:01:00.610> if<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:01.000> did<00:01:01.680> that's

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
with that and then even if it did that's

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.280 
with that and then even if it did that's
why<00:01:02.890> I<00:01:02.920> sharpen<00:01:03.430> things<00:01:03.610> better<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.900> keep<00:01:05.080> them

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
why I sharpen things better to keep them

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.340 
why I sharpen things better to keep them
from<00:01:05.979> rusting<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:07.210> great<00:01:07.450> thing<00:01:07.690> about<00:01:07.720> it<00:01:08.140> is

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
from rusting the great thing about it is

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.440 
from rusting the great thing about it is
if<00:01:08.770> you<00:01:09.160> look<00:01:09.430> at<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:10.420> head<00:01:11.380> of<00:01:11.560> this<00:01:11.740> thing

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
if you look at the head of this thing

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.230 
if you look at the head of this thing
it's<00:01:13.450> in<00:01:14.110> a<00:01:14.229> really<00:01:14.650> nice<00:01:14.890> thin<00:01:15.400> wedge<00:01:15.910> shape

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
it's in a really nice thin wedge shape

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.700 
it's in a really nice thin wedge shape
so<00:01:16.509> it's<00:01:16.660> really<00:01:17.080> gonna<00:01:17.470> be<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:19.000> bummer<00:01:19.390> for

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
so it's really gonna be just bummer for

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.340 
so it's really gonna be just bummer for
splitting<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.820> because<00:01:22.360> there<00:01:22.540> is<00:01:22.570> no<00:01:22.750> pole

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
splitting and because there is no pole

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.090 
splitting and because there is no pole
on<00:01:23.650> it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
on it

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.160 
on it
there's<00:01:24.729> no<00:01:24.910> item<00:01:25.570> large<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:27.369> can<00:01:28.300> really<00:01:28.600> have

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
there's no item large I can really have

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.280 
there's no item large I can really have
no<00:01:30.130> fear<00:01:30.430> when<00:01:30.640> it<00:01:30.729> comes<00:01:30.940> to<00:01:31.290> hammering

no fear when it comes to hammering

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.990 
no fear when it comes to hammering
things<00:01:32.590> that<00:01:32.830> are<00:01:32.920> hard<00:01:33.130> which<00:01:33.340> is<00:01:33.369> important

this<00:02:49.180> thing<00:02:49.440> on<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:51.220> other<00:02:51.370> hand<00:02:53.220> because<00:02:54.220> it

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
this thing on the other hand because it

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.040 
this thing on the other hand because it
is<00:02:54.550> one<00:02:54.880> solid<00:02:55.150> piece<00:02:55.360> of<00:02:55.510> steel

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.720 

I<00:02:59.600> it<00:03:00.600> has<00:03:00.870> difficulties<00:03:01.800> if<00:03:02.100> you're<00:03:02.250> going<00:03:02.460> to

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
I it has difficulties if you're going to

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.150 
I it has difficulties if you're going to
throw<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.150> if<00:03:03.360> you're<00:03:03.600> going<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.900> be<00:03:04.140> using<00:03:04.500> it

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
throw it if you're going to be using it

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.330 
throw it if you're going to be using it
as<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.090> self-defense<00:03:06.930> or<00:03:07.320> throwing<00:03:07.620> implement

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
as a self-defense or throwing implement

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.110 
as a self-defense or throwing implement
I<00:03:09.620> think<00:03:10.620> you'd<00:03:10.710> be<00:03:10.830> better<00:03:11.070> off<00:03:11.190> sued<00:03:11.820> with

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
I think you'd be better off sued with

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.520 
I think you'd be better off sued with
something<00:03:12.480> that's<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.750> wood<00:03:12.960> handle<00:03:13.200> for

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
something that's a wood handle for

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.199 
something that's a wood handle for
throwing

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
throwing

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.259 
throwing
not<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:16.049> say<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.409> this<00:03:16.590> couldn't<00:03:17.099> grow<00:03:17.400> but

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
not to say that this couldn't grow but

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.750 
not to say that this couldn't grow but
the<00:03:18.540> weight<00:03:18.780> would<00:03:19.170> be<00:03:19.280> different<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.489> you

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
the weight would be different and you

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.750 
the weight would be different and you
would<00:03:20.909> have<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.150> adjust<00:03:21.720> accordingly

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
would have to adjust accordingly

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.059 
would have to adjust accordingly
outside<00:03:24.599> of<00:03:24.629> that<00:03:24.870> it's<00:03:24.950> pretty<00:03:26.330> darn<00:03:27.330> sturdy

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.510 

I've<00:03:31.610> heard

I've heard
I<00:03:34.110> haven't<00:03:35.110> really<00:03:35.320> heard<00:03:35.650> of<00:03:35.830> one<00:03:36.070> of<00:03:36.100> these

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
I haven't really heard of one of these

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.080

breaking per se I've only heard of one

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.600 
breaking per se I've only heard of one
breaking<00:03:40.630> but<00:03:40.960> I'm<00:03:41.590> wondering<00:03:41.920> if<00:03:42.220> there<00:03:42.430> was

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
breaking but I'm wondering if there was

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.410 
breaking but I'm wondering if there was
enough

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
enough

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.380

this little loop of blank line here just

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.650 
this little loop of blank line here just
to<00:04:03.890> ensure<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.400> it<00:04:04.790> doesn't<00:04:05.150> come<00:04:05.270> flying

out of my hand

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.370 
out of my hand
because<00:04:07.880> sometimes<00:04:08.330> when<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.780> a<00:04:08.810> claw<00:04:09.140> or

because sometimes when to a claw or

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.870 
because sometimes when to a claw or
things<00:04:09.620> like<00:04:09.920> well<00:04:10.220> clobber<00:04:10.820> things<00:04:11.320> so

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
things like well clobber things so

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.220 
things like well clobber things so
sometimes<00:04:13.880> my<00:04:14.090> arm<00:04:14.300> moves<00:04:14.540> faster<00:04:15.080> and

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
sometimes my arm moves faster and

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.580 
sometimes my arm moves faster and
stronger<00:04:15.440> than<00:04:15.770> my<00:04:15.890> hand<00:04:16.160> does<00:04:16.459> so<00:04:17.150> it'd<00:04:18.109> be<00:04:18.380> a

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
stronger than my hand does so it'd be a

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.949 
stronger than my hand does so it'd be a
good<00:04:18.890> thing<00:04:18.950> to<00:04:19.370> have<00:04:19.579> a<00:04:19.609> lanyard<00:04:20.030> on<00:04:20.420> it<00:04:20.660> so<00:04:20.930> I

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
good thing to have a lanyard on it so I

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.620 
good thing to have a lanyard on it so I
don't<00:04:21.320> have<00:04:21.680> this<00:04:21.950> thing<00:04:22.010> flying<00:04:22.520> towards<00:04:23.390> my

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630

don't have this thing flying towards my
camp<00:04:24.970> that<00:04:25.970> wouldn't<00:04:26.390> be<00:04:26.510> good

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
camp that wouldn't be good

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.520 
camp that wouldn't be good
and<00:04:28.160> end<00:04:29.030> up<00:04:29.210> hitting<00:04:29.390> something<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:30.170> didn't

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530
