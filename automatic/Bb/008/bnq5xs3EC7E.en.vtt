 [Music] 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.250
 good guys 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.860
 I come with a lot of urgency because 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.080
 We are going to attend the live birth of 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.720
 a few rabbits that have called me 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.890
 to attend so I think the 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.960
 images that await us are 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.740
 spectacular and I want me to 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.740
 come join 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:35.410
 and is about to give birth we know 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.300
 because well we have already seen for this 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.100
 female more times and more specifically 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.560
 this female always stops 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.810
 more or less at 30 days then it has already 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.180
 completed 30 days and now we have seen 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.820
 that begins to have contractions 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.860
 so I hope we do not have to 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.379
 be holding too much time and that 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.730
 give birth soon see it good now 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.340
 we already begin to see the contractions 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.780
 Look, we'll start to see what's 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.309
 contractions are you screaming a 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.690
 little is complaining because it is 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.520
 normal in all births there is always 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.160
 a little pain 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.620
 as a general rule and I recommend that 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.420
 you do not touch do not manipulate them 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.190
 because they feel much more 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.170
 enjoy when they are alone and when they are 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.180
 calm this we just do it 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.670
 because we want to show you what the 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.799
 delivery of a rabbit 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.799
 it is very fast look you have seen 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.250
 here we have the puppy we are going to leave 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.590
 that reaches everything looks at the first 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.550
 Puppy breaths true 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.800
 seems to have contractions again 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.990
 look here the other puppy is about 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.330
 you see him look at another puppy with his 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.690
 placenta 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.620
 very well 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.880
 we are going to put them here 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.880
 very good dwarfs 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.180
 now the placenta is eating 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.159
 this we have already explained in other 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.640
 videos they eat the placenta for 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.320
 remove all the remains is normal there 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.420
 to let them eat the placenta 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.940
 placenta is very rich in protein is very 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.890
 rich in hemoglobin and is completely 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.840
 This is normal for all mothers of 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.400
 mammals eat the placenta to 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.400
 remove all the remains of the nest 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.440
 very well let's see if he has any 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.440
 problem 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.050
 very well 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.060
 very well 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.060
 Well, there are four of them 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.650

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.400

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.109

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:07.210

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:09.700
 go to this and we have helped him a little 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.690

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.790
 birth canal 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.890

 how a rabbit is born 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.340

 leave because it is complicating us a 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.810
 Little childbirth is missing three more 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.330
 puppies and we see that they all 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.860
 they are clogging then maybe 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.080

 that are very exclusive really 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.090

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.200
