our visual aids tools because in your
brain<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.930> have<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> reservoir<00:00:43.680> over<00:00:44.430> here<00:00:44.820> in

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
brain you have a reservoir over here in

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.869 
brain you have a reservoir over here in
your<00:00:45.539> brain<00:00:45.750> that's<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.890> hold<00:00:47.010> up<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.399> 15

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
your brain that's going to hold up to 15

your brain that's going to hold up to 15
visual<00:00:48.629> items<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:50.100> they're<00:00:50.309> sitting

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
visual items it's just they're sitting

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.090 
visual items it's just they're sitting
in<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.969> reservoir<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.170> when<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.680> brain<00:00:52.920> is

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
in a reservoir so that when you brain is

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.910 
in a reservoir so that when you brain is
processing<00:00:53.370> visual<00:00:54.110> things<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.649> throwing

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
processing visual things and throwing

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.010 
processing visual things and throwing
something<00:00:56.250> away<00:00:56.420> it<00:00:57.420> calls<00:00:57.660> into<00:00:57.780> this

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
something away it calls into this

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.779 
something away it calls into this
reservoir<00:00:58.500> over<00:00:59.160> here<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.430> pulls<00:00:59.640> out

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
reservoir over here and pulls out

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.150 
reservoir over here and pulls out
another<00:00:59.850> one<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.750> says<00:01:01.379> maybe<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:01.980> going

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
another one and says maybe this is going

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160 
another one and says maybe this is going
to<00:01:02.219> be<00:01:02.340> better<00:01:02.579> than<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.940> last<00:01:02.969> one<00:01:03.480> maybe<00:01:04.049> I

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
to be better than the last one maybe I

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.530 
to be better than the last one maybe I
should<00:01:04.439> remember<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.890> one<00:01:05.400> instead<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
should remember this one instead of the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.510 
should remember this one instead of the
one<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.049> guy<00:01:07.290> was<00:01:07.500> trying<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.799> show<00:01:08.490> me

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
one that that guy was trying to show me

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.310 
one that that guy was trying to show me
before<00:01:09.030> alright<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:11.600> we've<00:01:12.600> better<00:01:12.810> remember

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
before alright so we've better remember

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.770 
before alright so we've better remember
this<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.860> all<00:01:14.270> scientifically<00:01:15.270> proven

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
this this is all scientifically proven

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.990 
this this is all scientifically proven
fact<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.470> why<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> world<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:17.670> haven't

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
fact and why in the world we haven't

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.359 
fact and why in the world we haven't
taken<00:01:18.119> advantage<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.259> past<00:01:19.500> well

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
taken advantage of it in the past well

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.370 
taken advantage of it in the past well
it's<00:01:21.030> far<00:01:21.270> beyond<00:01:21.600> me<00:01:22.700> now<00:01:23.700> who's<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.090> most

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
it's far beyond me now who's the most

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.109 
it's far beyond me now who's the most
important<00:01:25.380> part<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.799> pot<00:01:26.009> probably<00:01:26.580> it's

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
important part of this pot probably it's

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.050 
important part of this pot probably it's
the<00:01:27.299> fact<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:28.080> told<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:29.060> when

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the fact that I just told you that when

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.940 
the fact that I just told you that when
I<00:01:30.090> say<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> last<00:01:30.570> word<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.229> stop<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.619> getting

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
I say the last word you stop the getting

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.420 
I say the last word you stop the getting
out<00:01:32.100> immediately<00:01:32.689> however<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.960> brain<00:01:34.430> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
out immediately however the brain the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.700 
out immediately however the brain the
brain<00:01:35.579> might<00:01:35.939> have<00:01:36.030> seen<00:01:36.240> something<00:01:36.409> has<00:01:37.409> what

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
brain might have seen something has what

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.310 
brain might have seen something has what
they<00:01:37.740> call<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:38.070> trace<00:01:38.460> duration<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.750> at<00:01:40.170> least

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
they call a trace duration of at least

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.920 
they call a trace duration of at least
four<00:01:40.680> seconds<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.310> another<00:01:41.909> words<00:01:42.119> when<00:01:42.899> you

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
four seconds in another words when you

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.590 
four seconds in another words when you
see<00:01:43.290> something<00:01:43.590> your<00:01:44.369> brain<00:01:44.549> holds<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.420> it

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
see something your brain holds on to it

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.539 
see something your brain holds on to it
for<00:01:46.140> at<00:01:46.200> least<00:01:46.320> four<00:01:46.619> seconds<00:01:47.100> longer<00:01:47.340> than

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
for at least four seconds longer than

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.420 
for at least four seconds longer than
after<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.030> look<00:01:48.119> away<00:01:48.299> from<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:50.250> you

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
after you look away from it and you

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.660 
after you look away from it and you
wonder<00:01:50.670> why<00:01:51.020> now<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.079> wonder<00:01:52.530> why<00:01:52.890> people

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
wonder why now you wonder why people

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.840 
wonder why now you wonder why people
remember<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.979> what<00:01:55.979> they<00:01:56.310> remember

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
remember of what they remember

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.539 
remember of what they remember
eighty-six<00:01:57.570> percent<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:58.140> seen<00:01:58.409> because<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
eighty-six percent is seen because the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.480 
eighty-six percent is seen because the
brain<00:01:59.880> wants<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.810> way<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.250> brain

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
brain wants it that way and the brain

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.569 
brain wants it that way and the brain
controls<00:02:02.729> everything<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:03.960> do<00:02:04.200> right<00:02:04.890> and

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
controls everything that we do right and

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.270 
controls everything that we do right and
that's<00:02:05.759> just<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.060> way<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:07.619> what

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
again what we talked about today

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.860 
again what we talked about today
we're<00:02:13.680> going<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.890> get<00:02:14.010> on<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.430> next<00:02:14.880> aspect

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
we're going to get on to the next aspect

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.860 
we're going to get on to the next aspect
of<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:16.380> memory<00:02:17.040> process<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.510> getting

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
of this memory process and getting

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.750 
of this memory process and getting
people<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.290> remember<00:02:19.470> what<00:02:19.890> we<00:02:20.070> want<00:02:20.370> them<00:02:20.580> to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
people to remember what we want them to

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.000 
people to remember what we want them to
remember<00:02:20.940> by<00:02:21.750> looking<00:02:22.170> at<00:02:22.290> what<00:02:22.350> we're<00:02:22.860> going

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
remember by looking at what we're going

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.390 
remember by looking at what we're going
to<00:02:23.100> stop<00:02:23.310> looking<00:02:23.490> at<00:02:23.820> attention<00:02:24.420> spans

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
to stop looking at attention spans

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.010 
to stop looking at attention spans
because<00:02:26.400> if<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:26.700> really<00:02:27.210> really<00:02:27.390> never<00:02:27.780> win

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
because if you really really never win

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.540 
because if you really really never win
when<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.500> really<00:02:28.830> want<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.070> learn<00:02:29.220> something
