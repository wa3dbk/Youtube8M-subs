for GG just did a really good job of

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.959 
for GG just did a really good job of
locking<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.469> map<00:00:10.620> down<00:00:10.889> I<00:00:11.160> wouldn't<00:00:11.700> say<00:00:11.820> it's

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
locking the map down I wouldn't say it's

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.339 
locking the map down I wouldn't say it's
completely<00:00:12.450> turn<00:00:12.630> favorite<00:00:12.990> let<00:00:13.110> me<00:00:13.200> actually

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
completely turn favorite let me actually

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.839 
completely turn favorite let me actually
see<00:00:13.590> if<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.740> can<00:00:13.860> pull<00:00:13.980> up<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.160> statistics<00:00:14.730> in

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
see if I can pull up the statistics in

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.430 
see if I can pull up the statistics in
the<00:00:14.940> meantime<00:00:15.089> actually<00:00:15.509> on<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.990> map<00:00:16.199> I

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
the meantime actually on that map I

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.580 
the meantime actually on that map I
believe<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.640> okay<00:00:18.300> chicken<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.869> protoss<00:00:19.260> vs

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
believe it okay chicken and protoss vs

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.050 
believe it okay chicken and protoss vs
terran<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:20.010> hasn't<00:00:20.340> been<00:00:20.400> played<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> lot<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.000> it

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
terran it hasn't been played a lot so it

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.420 
terran it hasn't been played a lot so it
looks<00:00:21.180> like<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.510> about<00:00:22.140> even<00:00:22.859> actually<00:00:23.310> as

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
looks like it's about even actually as

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.089 
looks like it's about even actually as
far<00:00:23.699> as<00:00:23.820> window<00:00:24.150> loss<00:00:24.300> ratio<00:00:24.689> on<00:00:24.810> there<00:00:25.099> any

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
far as window loss ratio on there any

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.620 
far as window loss ratio on there any
way<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.400> going<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.550> be<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:26.699> Team<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.269> I

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
way this is going to be on Team it and I

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.939 
way this is going to be on Team it and I
think<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.019> really<00:00:28.260> hard<00:00:28.500> for<00:00:28.619> terran

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
think this is really hard for terran

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.470 
think this is really hard for terran
players<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.340> expect<00:00:29.670> he'll<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.029> take<00:00:30.179> down<00:00:30.330> this

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
players I expect he'll to take down this

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.269 
players I expect he'll to take down this
match<00:00:30.689> once<00:00:30.900> again<00:00:31.080> sorry<00:00:31.199> if<00:00:31.349> there's<00:00:31.500> any<00:00:31.679> I

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
match once again sorry if there's any I

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.530 
match once again sorry if there's any I
think<00:00:32.790> there's<00:00:32.969> actually<00:00:33.210> kind<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.420> that

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
think there's actually kind of that

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.299 
think there's actually kind of that
you'll<00:00:33.660> get<00:00:33.809> up<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.739> background<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.190> it

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
you'll get up the background on it

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.010 
you'll get up the background on it
that's<00:00:35.460> my<00:00:35.579> fan<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.300> hot<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.870> San

up for some cheese he's sending out a
really<00:00:40.050> early<00:00:40.170> probe<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.100> all<00:00:41.219> say<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.430> don't

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520

is tia met and honestly he could cheese

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
is tia met and honestly he could cheese
bring<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.780> probe<00:00:45.960> up<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> upper

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
out there's the bunker finally I think

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.199 
out there's the bunker finally I think
that<00:03:43.799> could<00:03:43.889> have<00:03:44.010> been<00:03:44.099> put<00:03:44.790> down<00:03:44.819> a<00:03:44.940> lot

that could have been put down a lot
earlier<00:03:45.389> I<00:03:45.630> think<00:03:45.690> it<00:03:45.959> would<00:03:46.109> have<00:03:46.200> been<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.349> lot

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
earlier I think it would have been a lot

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.680 
earlier I think it would have been a lot
better<00:03:46.829> for<00:03:47.099> Gigi<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:47.579> put<00:03:47.760> down<00:03:47.880> that<00:03:48.120> bug
