00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.570
 with the laying will get swept across the door in a room corner 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.190
 as a trend situation interjection floor and dry has been right already one 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.099
 plastic film flat in the room 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.230
 they plan to band always enforces expansion joints 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.880
 They do not use wood or plastic with a thickness of ten to 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.179
 15 millimeters must have 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.289
 The wedges are placed on the wall. Now they can be the first one 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.439
 Insert element into the room Acton push it up to the file 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.150
 The essential elements are easy to use with a jigsaw film 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.030
 to cut 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.850
 move the cropped element by trial and error 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.140
 and do not control it in its intended place 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.460
 ca 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.800
 Like the adhesive catholic, the manufacturer supplies special attachments 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.870
 put them on the cut off Catholic top on screws 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.950
 to bind dust and ensure the adhesion of the adhesive measure the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.010
 Knute edges of the elementa in front 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.260
 With a brush that goes quickly from the hand Voigt 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.740
 so 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.200
 Piquet stuff can now be made with the help of a Catholic private school 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.670
 knew to the minute knew 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.090
 Minute should be completely covered with private 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.570
 Now insert the flat jubilation of plastic into the groove of the 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.960
 Westernmost Steam 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.140
 the following element can then simply be inserted 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.750
 Floodlight Hide IV Fabric samples from the joints Red 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.800
 that follows the next element 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.800
 Slowly set it down to avoid damage 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.600
 the times of emergency measure them again on the spot 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:19.340
 Thanks to the special ThÃ¼le, the adhesive application succeeds without problem and 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.339
 automatically covers all the courage 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:33.539
 that put them again flat reins in the groove always two at the short and 3 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:35.769
 on a long AlemÃ¡n side 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.150
 then insert the following elements until the glue comes out of the vogue 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.829
 Do not forget to keep Sky in a gap to the wall 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:58.779
 can Mainburg 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:00.989
 now again minutes before Hesse 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.749
 Apply deep fabric 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.749
 and use flat hills 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.590
 the straps on the long side always at the junction of two 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:14.169
 Place elements 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:17.169
 Domo 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:22.809
 when designing the elementa, there must be no joint offset of at least 20 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:24.789
 Centimeters are scheduled 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:27.809
 Under no circumstances should Kreuz Fugen arise 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.809
 Step by step, the entire area is occupied 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.919
 Vienna is 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.829
 after about twelve hours 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.939
 Perfect would be resigned and they can survive the dried glue 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.139
 repel with a spatula 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:48.189
 Do you want to later flow Hackett or carpet onto it 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.919
 You must prime the screed plates first when floating 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.239
 Prefabricated parquet or laminate is not necessary 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.549
 Now they insert a wreath of stripes into the joint 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.239
 tracks shell transfers from the ground to the turn 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.189
 so that the finished laid flat rate 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.039
 do not worry 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:09.549
 Now you can start laying the flooring you want
