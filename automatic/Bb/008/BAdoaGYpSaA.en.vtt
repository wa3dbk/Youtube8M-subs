00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:08.060
GUEST: So this is a late 2000, I forget when
exactly I got it, 2007-ish, flat-screen TV.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.990
It's a Toshiba LCD and I believe it's, honestly
I think it's about 32-inches, I forget exactly

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.240
what the size was when I bought it.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.240
APPRAISER: Very cool.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.870
I mean, what did you pay for it originally?

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.690
GUEST: I would ballpark it probably around
$500 or $600 at the time, open box.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.950
APPRAISER: Okay, got it.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.560
In terms of date, the great thing about contemporary
electronics is that they're really good about

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.990
marking their products.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.930
So we here of course have the brand of Toshiba,
which is a well known, desirable brand.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.399
But even more so interesting is on the back,
all televisions have a manufacture date.

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.109
So this is manufactured in 2008, so early
21st century is what we're looking at.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.559
The liquid-crystals, let's say, is interesting
because it's a wonderful technology, where

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.909
the liquid crystal really was a revolution
when it first came out.

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:58.600
And it's concept of when we charge a liquid
crystal with electricity it can do different

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.600
things.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.469
And it went from, you know, simple watches
where we had black and white all the way to,

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.220
you know, full color televisions.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.450
Does it still work?

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.450
That's a good question.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.460
GUEST: The last time I plugged it in was about
six months ago.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.460
And it did work.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.950
I don't have the remote anymore.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.140
I don't know how much that affects the value.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.140
APPRAISER: Okay.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.680
Have connections for Playstation or Xbox?

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.170
GUEST: I have a connection for Xbox.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.670
So, yeah, I do have that.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.670
APPRAISER: HDMI?

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.670
GUEST: Two in.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.689
APPRAISER: Two, that's nice.

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.689
GUEST: Yeah.

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:27.920
Is that rare for 2008, to have two?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.780
APPRAISER: No.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.890
In terms of value, it's tricky, because the
real value in television and in electronics

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.130
in general come with firsts.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.130
You know, if this was the first 32-inch off
the assembly line, or the first model, or

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.479
even a prototype, it might have some traction
with collectors.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.549
GUEST: Is there any way to find out if this
was the first TV off the assembly line?

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.520
APPRAISER: It would require a bit of research,
but based on your description of how it was

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.570
acquired, open box, in a shop, I got a feeling
it's one of many off an assembly line.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.570
GUEST: Okay.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.710
APPRAISER: Ultimately you have to understand
this, in the world, age and value have no

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.710
correlation.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.910
You know, you can buy a fantastic 2,000 year
old cameo ring from the Greek and Roman period

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.660
for a couple thousand bucks versus a Harry
Winston diamond for, you know, $50,000.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.070
So there's no real reason that someone would
hang on to this for any information purpose

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.630
or any technological purpose.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.630
It'd be more for a memory of my first TV or
a TV that I got very early in my career kind

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.640
of thing.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.690
It's unlikely to be an icon down the road
because it's very similar to other ones of

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.300
it's type.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.360
Big supply, limited demand.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.480
We basically have a nice used TV.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.480
GUEST: Gotcha.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.530
APPRAISER: So, in terms of value, realistically,
with all the stuff we mentioned, we're probably

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.030
looking at maybe a hundred bucks.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.620
GUEST: Hundred bucks?

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.140
That is legitimately much more than I was
expecting.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.160
So thank you very much.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.160
That's very exciting.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.162
APPRAISER: Outstanding.
