of the hatchlings has gone down by a bit

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.850 
of the hatchlings has gone down by a bit
I<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> video<00:00:46.950> at<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.850> end<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.860> clip

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
I have a video at the end of this clip

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.479 
I have a video at the end of this clip
of<00:00:50.430> me<00:00:51.500> selling<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.890> auction<00:00:53.129> house

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
of me selling it on the auction house

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.200 
of me selling it on the auction house
and<00:00:53.760> i<00:00:54.390> believe<00:00:54.809> i<00:00:55.050> sold<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:56.210> seven

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
and i believe i sold it for seven

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.979 
and i believe i sold it for seven
hundred<00:00:57.420> gold<00:00:58.109> i<00:00:58.620> think<00:00:59.180> so<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.420> price<00:01:00.660> went

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
hundred gold i think so the price went

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.160 
hundred gold i think so the price went
down<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.230> bit<00:01:01.969> but<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.300> still<00:01:03.510> yeah<00:01:03.899> it's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
down a bit but it's still yeah it's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.990 
down a bit but it's still yeah it's
still<00:01:04.409> good<00:01:04.650> money<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.100> guess<00:01:07.729> nearly<00:01:08.729> at<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
still good money I guess nearly at the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.490 
still good money I guess nearly at the
end<00:01:09.150> here<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.909> I<00:01:11.909> did<00:01:12.150> get<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.780> hatchling<00:01:13.320> am

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
end here and I did get the hatchling am

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.580 
end here and I did get the hatchling am
I<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.460> first<00:01:14.729> run<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.180> did<00:01:16.170> get<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
I this is the first run I did get the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.920 
I this is the first run I did get the
hatchling<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.130> will<00:01:17.340> jump<00:01:17.970> down<00:01:18.240> off<00:01:18.540> from<00:01:18.780> this

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
hatchling I will jump down off from this

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.609 
hatchling I will jump down off from this
cliff<00:01:20.030> we<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:23.960> gonna<00:01:24.960> speed<00:01:25.290> up<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.530> video

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
cliff we and gonna speed up the video

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.300 
cliff we and gonna speed up the video
bit<00:01:26.030> because<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.420> loading<00:01:28.110> takes<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.740> long

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
bit because the loading takes a long

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.789 
bit because the loading takes a long
time<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.630> don't<00:01:30.780> want<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.140> see<00:01:31.290> me

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
time and you don't want to see me

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.660 
time and you don't want to see me
loading<00:01:32.220> crystals<00:01:32.869> just<00:01:33.869> too<00:01:34.020> long<00:01:37.159> now<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
loading crystals just too long now the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.710 
loading crystals just too long now the
drop<00:01:38.970> rate<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.770> this<00:01:40.770> hatchling<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.720> not

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
drop rate of this hatchling is not

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.380 
drop rate of this hatchling is not
really<00:01:43.200> not<00:01:43.920> really<00:01:43.979> big<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:44.610> one<00:01:44.820> percent<00:01:45.270> i

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
really not really big it's one percent i

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.889 
really not really big it's one percent i
think<00:01:45.770> but<00:01:46.790> there<00:01:47.790> are<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> lot<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.270> mops<00:01:48.750> in

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
think but there are a lot of mops in

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.410 
think but there are a lot of mops in
here<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:50.100> chance<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:51.030> will<00:01:51.149> loot

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
here so the chance that you will loot

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.209 
here so the chance that you will loot
one<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:52.340> pretty<00:01:53.340> high<00:01:53.990> um<00:01:54.990> what<00:01:55.710> else<00:01:55.890> do<00:01:56.070> want

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
one is pretty high um what else do want

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.499 
one is pretty high um what else do want
to<00:01:56.310> say<00:01:56.460> oh<00:01:56.490> yeah<00:01:56.729> there's<00:01:57.000> another<00:01:57.240> hatch

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
to say oh yeah there's another hatch

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.959 
to say oh yeah there's another hatch
thing<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.200> get<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.759> it's<00:01:59.759> from<00:01:59.939> a

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
thing that you can get and it's from a

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.899 
thing that you can get and it's from a
mop<00:02:00.299> called<00:02:00.810> tech<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.619> leaper<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:02.610> that's

mop called tech the leaper now that's

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.030 
mop called tech the leaper now that's
nothing<00:02:03.299> while<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.719> caverns<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.500> just<00:02:04.860> in

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
nothing while in caverns is just in

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.910 
nothing while in caverns is just in
appearance<00:02:05.490> but<00:02:05.610> i<00:02:06.619> might<00:02:07.619> make<00:02:07.890> another

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
appearance but i might make another

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.100 
appearance but i might make another
video<00:02:08.369> about<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.940> there<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.390> actually<00:02:09.569> and
