the<00:01:48.509> frame<00:01:48.750> after<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.649> take<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.280> same

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the frame after that take the same

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.700 
the frame after that take the same
process<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.210> editing<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.780> repeat<00:01:52.200> again<00:01:52.649> and
