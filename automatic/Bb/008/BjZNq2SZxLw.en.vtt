in<00:01:22.409> terms<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.040> foldability<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.270> was

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
in terms of just foldability now I was

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.969 
in terms of just foldability now I was
going<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.900> take<00:01:25.020> some<00:01:25.140> photos<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.680> show<00:01:25.830> off

some of the stuff this guy can do but I

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.130 
some of the stuff this guy can do but I
can't<00:01:29.100> be<00:01:29.189> bothered<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.810> you're<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:30.960> gonna

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.600 
can't be bothered so you're just gonna
have<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.350> imagine<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.950> guy<00:01:32.130> standing<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
have to imagine this guy standing on the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.219 
have to imagine this guy standing on the
ground<00:01:32.820> sort<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.180> doing<00:01:33.509> service<00:01:33.810> skinning

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
ground sort of doing service skinning

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.420 
ground sort of doing service skinning
motion<00:01:34.560> as<00:01:35.960> he's<00:01:36.960> fighting<00:01:37.500> something<00:01:37.860> but

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
motion as he's fighting something but

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.100 
motion as he's fighting something but
every<00:01:38.700> single<00:01:38.850> connection<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.479> ball<00:01:39.689> jointed

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
every single connection is ball jointed

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.620 
every single connection is ball jointed
so<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.350> get<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> really<00:01:40.950> good<00:01:41.340> range<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:42.090> motion

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
so you get a really good range of motion

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.910 
so you get a really good range of motion
in<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.079> guy<00:01:43.280> excellent<00:01:44.280> really<00:01:44.790> excellent

in this guy excellent really excellent
when<00:01:46.920> your<00:01:47.070> Triceratops<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.909> scratch

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
when your Triceratops can scratch

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.730 
when your Triceratops can scratch
himself<00:01:48.479> behind<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.869> Year<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.380> have<00:01:49.500> done

you<00:02:08.280> may<00:02:08.520> notice<00:02:08.820> there<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.000> last<00:02:09.300> vertebrae

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
you may notice there that last vertebrae

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.480 
you may notice there that last vertebrae
right<00:02:10.110> up<00:02:10.260> against<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.619> pelvis<00:02:10.950> that's

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
right up against the pelvis that's

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.530 
right up against the pelvis that's
because<00:02:11.790> when<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.970> was<00:02:12.060> putting<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.420> guy

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
because when I was putting this guy

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.020 
because when I was putting this guy
together<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:13.350> ball<00:02:14.040> joint<00:02:14.340> on<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.700> pelvis

together the ball joint on the pelvis

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.290 
together the ball joint on the pelvis
snapped<00:02:15.480> off<00:02:15.720> into<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:17.370> vertebra<00:02:17.910> at<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.180> end

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
snapped off into the vertebra at the end

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.500 
snapped off into the vertebra at the end
of<00:02:18.390> spinal<00:02:18.750> column<00:02:20.000> basically<00:02:21.000> meaning<00:02:21.420> at

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.370 
the time that I couldn't put this guy
together<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.480> vertebrae<00:02:24.870> which<00:02:25.110> as<00:02:25.260> you

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
together so that vertebrae which as you

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.790 
together so that vertebrae which as you
can<00:02:25.410> see<00:02:25.620> doesn't<00:02:25.830> have<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:27.060> extra<00:02:27.650> points<00:02:28.650> at

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
can see doesn't have the extra points at

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.870 
can see doesn't have the extra points at
the<00:02:28.920> top<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.430> actually<00:02:29.880> from<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.330> neck<00:02:31.880> i've

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
super glued it on and it acts as a good

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.320 
super glued it on and it acts as a good
support<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:38.370> make<00:02:38.520> sure<00:02:38.550> i<00:02:38.700> still<00:02:38.970> have<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.150> good

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
support to make sure i still have a good

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.140 
guy a monthly decent recommendation he's
not<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.530> must-have<00:03:41.040> by<00:03:41.280> any<00:03:41.459> stretch<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:41.880> mean

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
not a must-have by any stretch of mean

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.680 
not a must-have by any stretch of mean
but<00:03:42.510> it's<00:03:43.140> a<00:03:43.260> nice<00:03:43.440> introduction<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.190> line

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
but it's a nice introduction to the line

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.120 
but it's a nice introduction to the line
you<00:03:45.690> can<00:03:45.810> get<00:03:45.959> smaller<00:03:46.260> figures<00:03:46.650> like<00:03:46.830> a

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
you can get smaller figures like a

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.790 
you can get smaller figures like a
raptor<00:03:47.550> and<00:03:47.820> a<00:03:47.910> Ceratosaurus<00:03:48.540> if<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:49.500> really

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
raptor and a Ceratosaurus if you really

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.090 
raptor and a Ceratosaurus if you really
want<00:03:49.950> just<00:03:50.250> like<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.730> cheap<00:03:51.030> introduction

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
want just like a cheap introduction

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.340 
want just like a cheap introduction
that'll<00:03:53.100> give<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.370> feel<00:03:53.610> but<00:03:53.850> I<00:03:54.209> I<00:03:54.540> would<00:03:55.050> go

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
that'll give you a feel but I I would go

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.320 
that'll give you a feel but I I would go
for<00:03:55.530> one<00:03:55.650> of<00:03:55.739> these<00:03:55.800> bigger<00:03:56.040> ones<00:03:56.300> there's<00:03:57.300> a

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
for one of these bigger ones there's a

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.850 
for one of these bigger ones there's a
bit<00:03:57.480> more<00:03:57.660> I<00:03:59.030> think<00:04:00.030> they<00:04:00.090> have<00:04:00.180> more<00:04:00.300> presence

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
bit more I think they have more presence

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.370 
bit more I think they have more presence
then<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:02.190> smaller<00:04:02.430> ones<00:04:02.670> do<00:04:02.850> so<00:04:03.630> even<00:04:04.050> if<00:04:04.290> you

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
then the smaller ones do so even if you

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.530 
then the smaller ones do so even if you
come<00:04:04.680> away<00:04:04.769> with<00:04:05.010> just<00:04:05.670> saying<00:04:05.910> lines<00:04:06.269> after

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
come away with just saying lines after

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.240 
come away with just saying lines after
me<00:04:06.810> you'd<00:04:07.019> least<00:04:07.230> have<00:04:07.410> one<00:04:07.560> really<00:04:07.950> solid

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
me you'd least have one really solid

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.880 
me you'd least have one really solid
display<00:04:08.700> bees
