resident Perl presentation today's

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.060 
resident Perl presentation today's
presentation<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.630> what<00:00:09.960> am<00:00:10.230> I<00:00:10.410> missing<00:00:10.470> on<00:00:11.040> a

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
presentation is what am I missing on a

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.829 
presentation is what am I missing on a
non-contrast<00:00:11.940> CT<00:00:12.499> so<00:00:13.499> as<00:00:13.860> we<00:00:14.759> all<00:00:14.879> know<00:00:15.089> many

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
non-contrast CT so as we all know many

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.060 
non-contrast CT so as we all know many
patients<00:00:16.230> are<00:00:16.260> being<00:00:16.379> imaged<00:00:16.800> with<00:00:16.920> a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
patients are being imaged with a

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.680 
patients are being imaged with a
non-contrast<00:00:17.730> CT<00:00:17.820> particularly<00:00:18.600> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
non-contrast CT particularly the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.720 
non-contrast CT particularly the
emergency<00:00:19.170> department<00:00:19.680> when<00:00:20.250> they<00:00:20.370> present

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
emergency department when they present

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.980 
emergency department when they present
with<00:00:20.820> flank<00:00:21.180> pain<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.630> there's<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.810> concern

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
with flank pain and there's a concern

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.590 
with flank pain and there's a concern
for<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.440> renal<00:00:22.650> calculus<00:00:23.160> very<00:00:23.970> good<00:00:24.120> study<00:00:24.390> for

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
for a renal calculus very good study for

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.590 
for a renal calculus very good study for
renal<00:00:24.780> calculus<00:00:25.290> and<00:00:25.860> it<00:00:26.370> it's<00:00:27.120> but<00:00:27.480> it's

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
renal calculus and it it's but it's

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.450 
renal calculus and it it's but it's
really<00:00:27.840> important<00:00:28.290> to<00:00:28.350> recognize<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:29.280> this

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
really important to recognize that this

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.060 
really important to recognize that this
is<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:30.060> scan<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.960> should<00:00:31.260> be<00:00:31.410> reserved<00:00:31.800> for

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
is a scan that should be reserved for

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.500 
is a scan that should be reserved for
patients<00:00:32.279> with<00:00:33.739> really<00:00:34.739> high<00:00:35.640> suspicion<00:00:36.239> for

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
patients with really high suspicion for

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.630 
patients with really high suspicion for
a<00:00:36.539> renal<00:00:36.780> stone<00:00:37.019> real<00:00:37.320> renal<00:00:37.649> colic<00:00:37.859> which<00:00:38.460> is

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
a renal stone real renal colic which is

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.220 
a renal stone real renal colic which is
colicky<00:00:39.030> pain<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.780> presence<00:00:40.140> of

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
colicky pain and the presence of

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.770 
colicky pain and the presence of
hematuria<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.760> really<00:00:42.059> should<00:00:42.359> not<00:00:42.390> be

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
hematuria and it really should not be

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.750 
hematuria and it really should not be
performed<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.499> patients<00:00:44.219> with<00:00:44.339> generalized

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
performed in patients with generalized

performed in patients with generalized
abdominal<00:00:45.030> pain<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.989> may<00:00:46.079> be<00:00:46.140> localized<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
abdominal pain that may be localized to

abdominal pain that may be localized to
the<00:00:46.859> right<00:00:47.010> or<00:00:47.129> left<00:00:47.309> side<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:48.149> reason<00:00:48.539> that

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
the right or left side the reason that

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.119 
the right or left side the reason that
this<00:00:48.749> is<00:00:48.809> gaining<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.230> much<00:00:49.289> popularity<00:00:49.829> is

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
this is gaining so much popularity is

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.189 
this is gaining so much popularity is
that<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.579> super<00:00:50.969> fast<00:00:51.239> scan<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.839> patients

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
that it's a super fast scan the patients

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.569 
that it's a super fast scan the patients
don't<00:00:52.289> even<00:00:52.440> get<00:00:52.679> oral<00:00:52.829> contrast<00:00:53.339> they<00:00:53.429> don't

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
don't even get oral contrast they don't

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.979 
don't even get oral contrast they don't
get<00:00:53.670> IV<00:00:53.909> contrast<00:00:54.149> they<00:00:54.539> just<00:00:54.719> get<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
get IV contrast they just get in the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.139 
get IV contrast they just get in the
scanner<00:00:55.229> and<00:00:55.350> they're<00:00:55.530> done<00:00:55.679> and<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.249> am

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
scanner and they're done and I am

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.540 
scanner and they're done and I am
concerned<00:00:57.659> that<00:00:57.780> some<00:00:58.280> physicians<00:00:59.280> get<00:00:59.519> a

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
concerned that some physicians get a

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.340 
concerned that some physicians get a
false<00:00:59.850> sense<00:01:00.089> of<00:01:00.179> security<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.780> we've<00:01:01.109> ruled

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
false sense of security that we've ruled

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.290 
false sense of security that we've ruled
out<00:01:01.499> other<00:01:01.710> important<00:01:02.249> pathology<00:01:02.760> when<00:01:02.999> we<00:01:03.120> do

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
out other important pathology when we do

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.570 
out other important pathology when we do
this<00:01:03.449> non<00:01:03.659> contrast<00:01:04.140> study<00:01:04.470> which<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.370> just

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
this non contrast study which is just

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.340 
this non contrast study which is just
not<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.909> case<00:01:05.940> you<00:01:06.810> may<00:01:07.020> pick<00:01:07.200> up

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
not the case you may pick up

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.039 
not the case you may pick up
appendicitis<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.310> may<00:01:08.430> pick<00:01:08.610> up<00:01:08.869> some<00:01:09.869> sort

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
appendicitis you may pick up some sort

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.749 
appendicitis you may pick up some sort
of<00:01:10.110> enter<00:01:10.320> itis<00:01:10.590> or<00:01:10.770> colitis<00:01:11.219> on<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> scan

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
of enter itis or colitis on the scan

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.330 
of enter itis or colitis on the scan
even<00:01:12.119> without<00:01:12.210> IV<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.869> oral<00:01:12.930> contrast<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:14.100> if

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
even without IV and oral contrast but if

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.550 
even without IV and oral contrast but if
there's<00:01:14.579> a<00:01:14.640> if<00:01:15.479> there's<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.840> possibility<00:01:16.320> of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
there's a if there's a possibility of

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.319 
there's a if there's a possibility of
other<00:01:16.829> pathology<00:01:17.490> particularly

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
other pathology particularly

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.959 
other pathology particularly
appendicitis<00:01:18.689> or<00:01:19.200> or<00:01:19.649> any<00:01:20.100> kind<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.430> vascular

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
appendicitis or or any kind of vascular

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.480 
appendicitis or or any kind of vascular
abnormality<00:01:21.799> you<00:01:22.799> really<00:01:23.009> should<00:01:23.159> be<00:01:23.250> giving

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
abnormality you really should be giving

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.580 
abnormality you really should be giving
IV<00:01:23.789> contrast<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.479> some<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.840> some<00:01:24.990> cases<00:01:25.229> oral

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
IV contrast and some in some cases oral

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.069 
IV contrast and some in some cases oral
contrast<00:01:26.039> so<00:01:26.159> let's<00:01:26.369> go<00:01:26.549> through<00:01:26.909> some<00:01:27.149> of<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
contrast so let's go through some of the

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.499 
contrast so let's go through some of the
things<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.590> miss<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.310> non<00:01:30.030> contrast

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
things that we miss on the non contrast

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.440 
things that we miss on the non contrast
study<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:31.229> within<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> kidney<00:01:32.039> alone<00:01:32.450> okay

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
study just within the kidney alone okay

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.270 
study just within the kidney alone okay
here's<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> first<00:01:34.350> case<00:01:34.740> patient<00:01:35.070> came<00:01:35.159> in

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
here's the first case patient came in

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.420 
here's the first case patient came in
with<00:01:35.310> flank<00:01:35.700> pain<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.710> we<00:01:37.710> see<00:01:37.859> a<00:01:37.890> small<00:01:38.189> stone

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
with flank pain and we see a small stone

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.279 
with flank pain and we see a small stone
in<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:38.789> kidney<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:39.990> stopped

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
in the right kidney and if we stopped

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.920 
in the right kidney and if we stopped
here<00:01:40.619> its<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.189> if<00:01:41.399> this<00:01:41.759> was<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.420> end<00:01:42.810> of

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
here its if we if this was the end of

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.660 
here its if we if this was the end of
the<00:01:43.020> study<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.469> would<00:01:43.619> say<00:01:43.829> well<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.250> pain<00:01:44.460> was

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the study we would say well the pain was

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.510 
the study we would say well the pain was
caused<00:01:44.939> by<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.600> small<00:01:45.990> renal<00:01:46.409> calculus<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.399> in

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
caused by a small renal calculus but in

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.999

look at

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.339 
look at
case<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.849> can<00:02:18.030> see<00:02:18.299> that<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.629> aneurysm<00:02:19.260> is

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
case you can see that this aneurysm is

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.960 
case you can see that this aneurysm is
coming<00:02:19.650> off<00:02:19.769> of<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:20.069> artery<00:02:20.430> it's<00:02:20.610> not<00:02:20.760> even

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
coming off of the artery it's not even

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.970 
coming off of the artery it's not even
arising<00:02:21.450> from<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.720> kidney<00:02:22.049> so<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.560> shouldn't

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
arising from the kidney so you shouldn't

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.920 
arising from the kidney so you shouldn't
even<00:02:23.370> suspect<00:02:23.909> this<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.360> cyst<00:02:24.629> you<00:02:24.780> should

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
even suspect this is a cyst you should

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.809 
even suspect this is a cyst you should
be<00:02:25.019> concerned<00:02:25.319> that<00:02:25.500> it's<00:02:25.650> an<00:02:25.739> aneurysm<00:02:26.010> but

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
be concerned that it's an aneurysm but

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.490 
be concerned that it's an aneurysm but
really<00:02:27.120> definitively<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.810> diagnosis<00:02:28.349> is

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
really definitively the diagnosis is

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.080 
really definitively the diagnosis is
made<00:02:28.530> with<00:02:28.830> IV<00:02:29.099> contrast<00:02:29.549> you<00:02:29.640> see<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.909> is<00:02:30.060> a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
made with IV contrast you see this is a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.630 
made with IV contrast you see this is a
large<00:02:30.480> enhancing<00:02:31.080> aneurysm<00:02:34.129> next<00:02:35.129> case

can see that the patient has

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.190 
can see that the patient has
pyelonephritis<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:12.209> pyelonephritis<00:03:12.569> is

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
pyelonephritis so pyelonephritis is

in the emergency department it's one of

the most common things to mimic a renal
stone<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.670> course<00:03:21.299> it's<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.540> diagnosis<00:03:22.079> that

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
should be made by your analysis but

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
should be made by your analysis but
occasionally<00:03:25.290> we're<00:03:25.500> making<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.829> diagnosis

occasionally we're making the diagnosis

kidney<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.290> enlarged<00:03:31.620> but<00:03:32.069> you<00:03:32.190> may<00:03:32.370> see

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
kidney is enlarged but you may see

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.159 
kidney is enlarged but you may see
absolutely<00:03:33.030> nothing<00:03:33.419> and<00:03:33.540> it's<00:03:33.660> only<00:03:33.840> after

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
absolutely nothing and it's only after

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.780 
absolutely nothing and it's only after
you<00:03:34.290> give<00:03:34.440> contrast<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.310> see<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.579> bands

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
you give contrast and you see the bands

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.490 
you give contrast and you see the bands
of<00:03:36.000> decreased<00:03:36.359> enhancement<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.349> can

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
of decreased enhancement that you can

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.729 
of decreased enhancement that you can
make<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.769> diagnosis<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.400> pyelonephritis

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
make the diagnosis of pyelonephritis

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.930 
make the diagnosis of pyelonephritis
again<00:03:40.739> I<00:03:40.769> want<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.040> emphasize<00:03:41.099> that<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.819> do

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
again I want to emphasize that you do

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.690 
again I want to emphasize that you do
not<00:03:42.060> need<00:03:42.389> CT<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.930> make<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.200> diagnosis<00:03:43.799> but<00:03:44.430> in

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
not need CT to make the diagnosis but in

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.610 
not need CT to make the diagnosis but in
some<00:03:45.000> cases<00:03:45.359> who<00:03:45.599> patients<00:03:46.290> will<00:03:46.379> be<00:03:46.440> having

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
some cases who patients will be having

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.680 
some cases who patients will be having
abdominal<00:03:46.829> pain<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.669> this<00:03:48.060> turns<00:03:48.329> out<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.660> be

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
abdominal pain and this turns out to be

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.119 
abdominal pain and this turns out to be
the<00:03:48.870> cause<00:03:49.079> that<00:03:49.319> it<00:03:49.410> wasn't<00:03:49.560> initially

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
the cause that it wasn't initially

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.539 
the cause that it wasn't initially
suspected<00:03:51.290> here's<00:03:52.290> another<00:03:52.470> patient<00:03:52.739> with

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
suspected here's another patient with

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.939 
suspected here's another patient with
flank<00:03:54.150> pain<00:03:54.389> and<00:03:54.599> hematuria<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.620> kidneys

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
flank pain and hematuria the kidneys

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.650 
flank pain and hematuria the kidneys
look<00:03:56.040> normal<00:03:56.430> on<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.639> non-contrast<00:03:57.299> scan

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
look normal on the non-contrast scan

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.839 
look normal on the non-contrast scan
after<00:03:58.530> we<00:03:58.620> give<00:03:58.769> contrast<00:03:59.340> we<00:03:59.489> can<00:03:59.519> see<00:03:59.699> that

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
after we give contrast we can see that

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.030 
after we give contrast we can see that
the<00:03:59.970> patient<00:04:00.150> has<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.510> renal<00:04:00.959> infarct<00:04:01.500> this<00:04:01.919> is

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
the patient has a renal infarct this is

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.680 
the patient has a renal infarct this is
another<00:04:02.280> entity<00:04:02.609> that<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.299> will<00:04:03.569> not

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
another entity that you will not

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.580 
another entity that you will not
identify<00:04:03.870> without<00:04:04.470> contrast<00:04:04.889> administration

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
identify without contrast administration

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.750 
identify without contrast administration
okay<00:04:07.590> one<00:04:07.799> more<00:04:08.010> this<00:04:08.099> is<00:04:08.160> a<00:04:08.280> very<00:04:08.519> interesting

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
okay one more this is a very interesting

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.789 
okay one more this is a very interesting
case<00:04:09.060> here's<00:04:09.299> a<00:04:09.389> patient<00:04:09.840> who's<00:04:10.260> having<00:04:10.470> flank

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
case here's a patient who's having flank

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.379 
case here's a patient who's having flank
pain<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.129> there<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.310> a<00:04:11.340> small<00:04:11.730> stone<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.060> the

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
pain and there is a small stone in the

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.449 
pain and there is a small stone in the
right<00:04:12.540> kidney<00:04:12.840> very<00:04:13.169> tiny<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.680> look<00:04:14.280> at<00:04:14.400> the

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
right kidney very tiny and look at the

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.750 
right kidney very tiny and look at the
right<00:04:14.579> your<00:04:14.790> top<00:04:15.780> right<00:04:15.810> image<00:04:16.349> the<00:04:17.130> ureter<00:04:17.579> is

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
right your top right image the ureter is

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.279 
right your top right image the ureter is
completely<00:04:18.299> normal<00:04:18.419> in<00:04:18.660> caliber<00:04:19.109> on

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
completely normal in caliber on

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.080 
completely normal in caliber on
non-contrast<00:04:19.949> CT<00:04:20.039> the<00:04:20.340> patient<00:04:20.699> has<00:04:20.820> para

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
non-contrast CT the patient has para

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.460 
non-contrast CT the patient has para
pelvic<00:04:21.479> cysts<00:04:21.750> that's<00:04:21.930> not<00:04:22.079> hydronephrosis

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
pelvic cysts that's not hydronephrosis

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.550 
pelvic cysts that's not hydronephrosis
and<00:04:23.099> so<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.599> assessment<00:04:25.199> here<00:04:25.349> is<00:04:25.469> that

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
and so the assessment here is that

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.080 
and so the assessment here is that
there's<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.800> tiny<00:04:26.039> non<00:04:26.310> obstructing<00:04:26.820> stone

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
there's a tiny non obstructing stone

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.620 
there's a tiny non obstructing stone
within<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.630> kidney<00:04:28.020> no<00:04:28.680> no<00:04:29.099> hydronephrosis

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
within the kidney no no hydronephrosis

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.570 
within the kidney no no hydronephrosis
the<00:04:30.690> patient<00:04:31.110> was<00:04:31.200> imaged<00:04:31.650> with<00:04:31.800> IV<00:04:32.130> contrast

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
the patient was imaged with IV contrast

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.950 
the patient was imaged with IV contrast
not<00:04:32.760> because<00:04:33.000> of<00:04:33.120> this<00:04:33.270> but<00:04:33.570> because<00:04:33.690> there

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
not because of this but because there

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.330 
not because of this but because there
was<00:04:34.050> actually<00:04:34.350> also<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.680> mass<00:04:34.920> within<00:04:35.190> the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
was actually also a mass within the

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.280 
was actually also a mass within the
mesentery<00:04:35.850> and<00:04:36.090> we<00:04:36.450> wanted<00:04:36.660> to<00:04:36.810> characterize

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
mesentery and we wanted to characterize

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.830 
mesentery and we wanted to characterize
it<00:04:37.320> further<00:04:37.470> and<00:04:37.920> after<00:04:38.880> we<00:04:38.970> gave<00:04:39.150> IV<00:04:39.570> contrast

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
it further and after we gave IV contrast

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.960 
it further and after we gave IV contrast
you<00:04:40.380> can<00:04:40.500> see<00:04:40.680> differential<00:04:41.250> enhancement<00:04:41.850> of

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
you can see differential enhancement of

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.880 
you can see differential enhancement of
the<00:04:42.210> right<00:04:42.390> and<00:04:42.600> left<00:04:42.660> kidneys<00:04:43.230> the<00:04:43.650> right

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
the right and left kidneys the right

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.220 
the right and left kidneys the right
kidney<00:04:44.160> is<00:04:44.370> delayed<00:04:44.820> again<00:04:45.540> there's<00:04:46.140> no

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
kidney is delayed again there's no

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.190 
kidney is delayed again there's no
hydronephrosis<00:04:46.620> but<00:04:47.610> when<00:04:48.600> we<00:04:48.660> image<00:04:49.080> the

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
hydronephrosis but when we image the

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.420 
hydronephrosis but when we image the
bladder<00:04:49.380> we<00:04:49.590> can<00:04:49.710> see<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:49.980> there's<00:04:50.130> a<00:04:50.190> mass

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
bladder we can see that there's a mass

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.340 
bladder we can see that there's a mass
at<00:04:50.790> the<00:04:51.000> right<00:04:51.150> ureteral<00:04:51.570> vesicle<00:04:51.930> junction

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
at the right ureteral vesicle junction

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.470 
at the right ureteral vesicle junction
in<00:04:52.500> this<00:04:52.860> case<00:04:53.070> this<00:04:53.250> is<00:04:53.400> a<00:04:53.460> hematoma<00:04:54.000> due<00:04:54.270> to<00:04:54.450> a

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
in this case this is a hematoma due to a

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.130 
in this case this is a hematoma due to a
recently<00:04:54.900> passed<00:04:55.110> stone<00:04:55.470> but<00:04:56.190> really<00:04:57.150> a<00:04:57.180> great

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
recently passed stone but really a great

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.140 
recently passed stone but really a great
example<00:04:58.320> underscoring<00:04:59.250> the<00:04:59.640> importance<00:05:00.060> of

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
example underscoring the importance of

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.360 
example underscoring the importance of
IV<00:05:00.360> contrast<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:01.230> identifying<00:05:01.740> even<00:05:02.130> mild

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
IV contrast and identifying even mild

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.000 
IV contrast and identifying even mild
cases<00:05:02.700> of<00:05:02.850> obstruction<00:05:03.600> so<00:05:04.320> really<00:05:04.830> the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
cases of obstruction so really the

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.040 
cases of obstruction so really the
caveat<00:05:05.430> is<00:05:05.460> not<00:05:05.760> that<00:05:05.940> all<00:05:06.150> patients<00:05:06.630> need<00:05:06.810> IV

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
caveat is not that all patients need IV

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.620 
caveat is not that all patients need IV
contrast<00:05:07.260> but<00:05:07.920> in<00:05:08.040> patients<00:05:08.520> with<00:05:08.640> a<00:05:08.940> high

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
contrast but in patients with a high

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.510 
contrast but in patients with a high
suspicion<00:05:10.140> for<00:05:10.530> renal<00:05:10.770> pathology<00:05:10.920> with

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
suspicion for renal pathology with

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.690 
suspicion for renal pathology with
severe<00:05:12.140> hematuria<00:05:13.140> and<00:05:13.410> colicky<00:05:14.190> flank<00:05:14.460> pain

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
severe hematuria and colicky flank pain
