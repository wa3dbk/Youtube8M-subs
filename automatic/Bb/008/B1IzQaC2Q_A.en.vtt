that's<00:02:32.409> the<00:02:32.560> engine<00:02:32.950> because<00:02:33.219> although<00:02:33.549> it

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
that's the engine because although it

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.610 
that's the engine because although it
does<00:02:33.879> work<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.390> is<00:02:34.540> boring<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.319> have<00:02:35.500> been

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
does work it is boring and I have been

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.580 
does work it is boring and I have been
on<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.739> quest<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.459> find<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.849> better<00:02:37.150> faster<00:02:38.109> cool

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
never been in a DeLorean because I feel

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.910 
never been in a DeLorean because I feel
like<00:04:45.240> I'm<00:04:45.420> in<00:04:45.540> a<00:04:45.570> Formula<00:04:46.020> one<00:04:46.230> seat<00:04:46.560> right<00:04:46.770> now

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
prototype and therefore does not have

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.600 
prototype and therefore does not have
air<00:04:51.960> conditioning<00:04:52.470> so<00:04:52.950> this<00:04:53.220> tiny<00:04:53.460> little

it's been a great day and we found a

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.550 
it's been a great day and we found a
functional<00:06:10.979> tuned<00:06:11.700> DeLorean

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
functional tuned DeLorean

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.830 
functional tuned DeLorean
coming<00:06:13.560> up<00:06:13.650> next<00:06:13.830> on<00:06:14.100> drunk<00:06:14.550> we<00:06:14.820> are<00:06:15.120> the<00:06:15.600> Ike's

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
coming up next on drunk we are the Ike's

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.490 
coming up next on drunk we are the Ike's
we're<00:06:16.650> four<00:06:16.950> clicks<00:06:17.310> down<00:06:17.550> from<00:06:17.790> the<00:06:17.850> center

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
we're four clicks down from the center

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.070 
we're four clicks down from the center
so<00:06:19.500> we're<00:06:19.830> less<00:06:20.490> than<00:06:20.520> half<00:06:20.900> we're<00:06:21.900> doing

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
so we're less than half we're doing

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.330 
so we're less than half we're doing
pretty<00:06:22.229> well<00:06:22.350> I<00:06:22.800> can<00:06:23.520> use<00:06:23.610> some<00:06:23.790> pizza<00:06:24.120> though
