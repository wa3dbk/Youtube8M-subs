00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.639
 hello how about here I show you how 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.340
 prepare the sculptural shape for the nail 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.799
 of pyramids we fold in half 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.260
 we cut the little triangular that remains in the 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:21.430
 area of â€‹â€‹the almond and we apply it in the 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.160
 finger this time I will make the pyramid shape 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.619
 but the tip will be spear 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.689
 Now I'm going to apply this acrylic that is 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.150
 of the gipsy collection but in the area of 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.150
 the almond but how is it colored 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.790
 we have to put an acrylic capita 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.630
 glass so you do not paint the nail 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.480
 natural 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.150
 for this nail form we should do the 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.160
 chopped almond now I will use 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.250
 red art drop 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.950
 I'm putting in like in a little cup 25 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.860
 drops of red art by a dropper of 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.770
 monomer 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.050
 this brush that I showed you is special 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.690
 for the art boot 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.269
 I put some stones to identify him 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.060
 It is very necessary that we use one 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.270
 different and just for the drop of 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.940
 art because if we use the normal of 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.659
 we could spot it and smearing 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.319
 they have more set 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.740
 here as they come I put the drop of art of a 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:25.350
 side only to not lose the shape 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.770
 pyramid as well as at the time of 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.799
 encapsulate just like it's from one side and 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.080
 of the other to maintain the form of 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.810
 triangle or pyramid 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.920
 the same says of the two sides since 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.740
 dry removes the form and now we encourage 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.520
 the same way that we encapsulate with the 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.810
 with the file on the side and straight you have to 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.810
 be a straight file 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.540
 to keep the pyramid shape 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.390
 it is very necessary that after filing 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.430
 we polish very well since as the drop of 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.300
 translucent art we do not want it to 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.670
 look at the sweepers 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.560
 now this is an eyeliner from me like this 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:16.770
 I 'm black making some lines 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.069
 without form only with waves 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.999
 on the right side 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.280
 on the left this glue I bought it 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:27.200
 in cupey dotcom and it has been very 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.110
 good 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.250
 I recommend them as it gives the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.800
 opportunity to 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.770
 it does not dry so soon and we can move 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.080
 the stones a little bit the first pebble 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:44.140
 that I put is swarovski bubble 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:49.650
 the following were a swarovski 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:54.190
 crystal crystal number 10 2 number 99 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.460
 and 30 x number 5 but these are aurora 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.000
 Boreal 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.860
 so simple that the design now 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.880
 we apply protein bone so that the gel 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.880
 adhere better 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.490
 we put the gel and remember that as 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.860
 We put drop of art you need to put 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.500
 on the back of the nail that 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.500
 also since it is translucent 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.540
 remember that if you have something quest 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.220
 some video that they would like me 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.160
 do not hesitate to ask me and 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.700
 leave it down in a comment I hope 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.880
 You liked this design, thanks for 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.000
 see my videos and see you next time 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.000
