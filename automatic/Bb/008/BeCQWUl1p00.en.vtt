00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.700 

the<00:00:10.510> first<00:00:10.750> thing<00:00:11.020> we<00:00:11.170> do<00:00:11.350> when<00:00:11.559> we're

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:11.710 
the first thing we do when we're

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.010 
the first thing we do when we're
dividing<00:00:12.130> mixed<00:00:12.280> numbers<00:00:12.430> is<00:00:13.000> to<00:00:13.180> change<00:00:13.510> both

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.020 
dividing mixed numbers is to change both

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.790 
dividing mixed numbers is to change both
mixed<00:00:14.410> numbers<00:00:14.890> into<00:00:15.190> improper<00:00:15.430> fractions<00:00:16.800> so

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
mixed numbers into improper fractions so

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.980 
mixed numbers into improper fractions so
to<00:00:17.860> change<00:00:18.220> 5<00:00:18.490> and<00:00:18.730> 1/4<00:00:19.240> into<00:00:19.599> an<00:00:19.689> improper

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
to change 5 and 1/4 into an improper

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.730 
to change 5 and 1/4 into an improper
fraction

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
fraction

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.300 
fraction
we<00:00:21.250> take<00:00:21.460> our<00:00:21.610> 4<00:00:21.910> multiply<00:00:22.540> it<00:00:22.599> by<00:00:22.840> 5<00:00:23.169> to<00:00:23.710> get<00:00:23.890> 20

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
we take our 4 multiply it by 5 to get 20

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.839 
we take our 4 multiply it by 5 to get 20
at<00:00:24.490> our<00:00:25.119> 1<00:00:25.390> to<00:00:25.630> get<00:00:25.779> 21<00:00:26.169> keep<00:00:27.130> our<00:00:27.310> denominator

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
at our 1 to get 21 keep our denominator

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.630 
at our 1 to get 21 keep our denominator
of<00:00:28.029> 4<00:00:28.360> to<00:00:28.960> get<00:00:29.140> 21<00:00:29.579> fourths<00:00:30.720> for<00:00:31.720> two<00:00:31.869> and<00:00:31.989> 3/8

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
of 4 to get 21 fourths for two and 3/8

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.960 
of 4 to get 21 fourths for two and 3/8
we<00:00:33.640> multiply<00:00:34.090> our<00:00:34.210> 8<00:00:34.510> by<00:00:35.260> our<00:00:35.410> 2<00:00:35.710> to<00:00:35.890> get<00:00:36.040> 16<00:00:36.640> and

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
we multiply our 8 by our 2 to get 16 and

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.889 
we multiply our 8 by our 2 to get 16 and
3<00:00:37.390> to<00:00:37.510> get<00:00:37.630> 19<00:00:38.230> keep<00:00:38.920> our<00:00:39.100> denominator<00:00:39.640> of<00:00:39.820> a<00:00:39.969> to

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
3 to get 19 keep our denominator of a to

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.389 
3 to get 19 keep our denominator of a to
get<00:00:41.079> 19<00:00:41.680> 8<00:00:42.989> now<00:00:43.989> remember<00:00:44.379> there<00:00:44.530> are<00:00:44.620> no<00:00:44.829> real

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399

division<00:00:46.120> in<00:00:47.219> fractions<00:00:48.219> what<00:00:48.489> we<00:00:48.640> have<00:00:48.820> to<00:00:48.969> do

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
division in fractions what we have to do

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.380 
division in fractions what we have to do
is<00:00:49.300> flip<00:00:49.629> the<00:00:49.840> second<00:00:50.350> fraction<00:00:50.410> and<00:00:51.390> then

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
is flip the second fraction and then

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.930 
is flip the second fraction and then
multiply<00:00:52.899> across<00:00:53.199> so<00:00:53.649> 19<00:00:54.129> a<00:00:54.429> swell<00:00:54.789> become<00:00:55.089> 819

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
multiply across so 19 a swell become 819

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
multiply across so 19 a swell become 819
so<00:00:57.940> now<00:00:58.120> we<00:00:58.210> have<00:00:58.539> twenty-one<00:00:59.199> fourths<00:00:59.769> times

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
so now we have twenty-one fourths times

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.590 
so now we have twenty-one fourths times
819<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:03.460> check<00:01:03.699> to<00:01:03.850> see<00:01:03.999> if<00:01:04.089> we<00:01:04.150> can<00:01:04.390> cross

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
819 we check to see if we can cross

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.590 
819 we check to see if we can cross
cancel<00:01:05.260> and<00:01:05.379> in<00:01:05.470> fact<00:01:05.680> we<00:01:05.890> can<00:01:06.390> 4<00:01:07.390> goes<00:01:07.570> into

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
cancel and in fact we can 4 goes into

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.770 
cancel and in fact we can 4 goes into
itself<00:01:08.110> once<00:01:08.460> 4<00:01:09.460> goes<00:01:09.640> into<00:01:09.670> 8<00:01:10.320> 2<00:01:11.320> times<00:01:12.780> 21

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
itself once 4 goes into 8 2 times 21

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.140 
itself once 4 goes into 8 2 times 21
times<00:01:13.930> 2<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:14.860> 42

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.980 

one<00:01:19.150> times<00:01:19.450> 19<00:01:20.080> is<00:01:20.320> a<00:01:20.410> 19<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.730> we<00:01:22.720> get<00:01:22.900> an

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
one times 19 is a 19 and we get an

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.350 
one times 19 is a 19 and we get an
answer<00:01:23.260> of<00:01:24.180> 42<00:01:25.180> 19<00:01:26.670> now<00:01:27.670> most<00:01:27.910> of<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.120> time

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
answer of 42 19 now most of the time

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.740 
answer of 42 19 now most of the time
you're<00:01:28.570> asked<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:30.610> keep<00:01:30.760> your<00:01:30.970> answers<00:01:31.480> in

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
you're asked to keep your answers in

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.690 
you're asked to keep your answers in
mixed<00:01:32.110> number<00:01:32.410> form<00:01:32.770> if<00:01:33.040> you're<00:01:33.160> asked<00:01:33.490> to<00:01:33.580> do

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
mixed number form if you're asked to do

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.630 
mixed number form if you're asked to do
this<00:01:33.940> to<00:01:34.750> change<00:01:34.990> 42<00:01:35.410> 19's<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.310> mixed<00:01:36.610> number

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
this to change 42 19's to a mixed number

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.300 
this to change 42 19's to a mixed number
we<00:01:37.090> ask<00:01:37.270> ourselves<00:01:37.480> how<00:01:37.930> many<00:01:38.110> times<00:01:38.410> does<00:01:38.800> 19

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
we ask ourselves how many times does 19

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.630 
we ask ourselves how many times does 19
go<00:01:39.460> into<00:01:39.700> 42<00:01:40.030> without<00:01:40.990> going<00:01:41.380> over<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:41.980> that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
go into 42 without going over and that

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.850 
go into 42 without going over and that
would<00:01:42.820> be<00:01:43.030> 2<00:01:43.420> times<00:01:43.750> since<00:01:44.680> 19<00:01:45.220> times<00:01:45.520> 2<00:01:45.880> is<00:01:46.180> 38

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
would be 2 times since 19 times 2 is 38

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.840 
would be 2 times since 19 times 2 is 38
there<00:01:47.860> are<00:01:48.010> 4<00:01:48.310> left<00:01:48.550> over<00:01:48.760> to<00:01:49.240> get<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.420> 42<00:01:50.850> so

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
there are 4 left over to get to 42 so

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.070 
there are 4 left over to get to 42 so
our<00:01:52.000> final<00:01:52.330> answer<00:01:52.690> is<00:01:53.230> 2<00:01:53.800> and<00:01:54.570> 4<00:01:56.070> 19
