00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:03.679 

so<00:00:01.199> for<00:00:02.070> this<00:00:02.190> lesson<00:00:02.760> what<00:00:03.240> you<00:00:03.389> need<00:00:03.570> to

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
so for this lesson what you need to

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.610 
so for this lesson what you need to
understand<00:00:04.290> is<00:00:04.650> that<00:00:04.680> iodine<00:00:06.109> when<00:00:07.109> it<00:00:07.259> comes

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
understand is that iodine when it comes

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.680 
understand is that iodine when it comes
into<00:00:07.830> continence<00:00:08.370> as<00:00:08.490> iodine<00:00:08.849> when<00:00:09.360> it<00:00:09.450> comes

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
into continence as iodine when it comes

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.890 
into continence as iodine when it comes
into<00:00:09.900> contact<00:00:10.230> with<00:00:10.559> starch<00:00:11.130> will<00:00:12.000> make<00:00:12.719> a

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
into contact with starch will make a

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.650 
into contact with starch will make a
purple<00:00:13.500> color<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.910> concept<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.450> we're

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
purple color and the concept that we're

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.120 
purple color and the concept that we're
learning<00:00:15.839> here<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.560> about<00:00:17.990> diffusion<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.410> so

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
learning here is about diffusion and so

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.620 
learning here is about diffusion and so
I<00:00:20.160> have<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:22.130> bag<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:24.119> bag<00:00:24.180> is

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
I have a bag and this bag is

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.450 
I have a bag and this bag is
semipermeable<00:00:25.019> which<00:00:25.740> means<00:00:26.010> some<00:00:26.250> things

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
semipermeable which means some things

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.710 
semipermeable which means some things
are<00:00:26.580> going<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.760> be<00:00:26.849> able<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.090> get<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.630> out

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
are going to be able to get in and out

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.330 
are going to be able to get in and out
some<00:00:28.170> things<00:00:28.320> are<00:00:28.500> not<00:00:28.680> going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.070> able<00:00:29.279> to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
some things are not going to be able to

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.019 
some things are not going to be able to
get<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.730> out

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
get in and out

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.420 
get in and out
I<00:00:30.060> already<00:00:30.480> tied<00:00:30.869> off<00:00:31.019> one<00:00:31.199> at<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> edges<00:00:31.769> and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
I already tied off one at the edges and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.310 
I already tied off one at the edges and
I<00:00:32.550> could<00:00:32.700> take<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> mixture<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> starch<00:00:33.960> and

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
I could take a mixture of starch and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.119 
I could take a mixture of starch and
water<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.910> that's<00:00:36.120> what<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.960> here<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.530> I

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
water so that's what is in here and I

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:47.440 
water so that's what is in here and I
could<00:00:38.309> put<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.670> starch<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.239> water<00:00:41.780> into

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.420 

I<00:00:47.620> have<00:00:48.620> a<00:00:48.650> little<00:00:48.830> iodine<00:00:49.370> in<00:00:49.490> this<00:00:49.640> pipette

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
I have a little iodine in this pipette

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.850 
I have a little iodine in this pipette
so<00:00:52.430> I<00:00:52.460> could<00:00:52.670> put<00:00:52.850> this<00:00:53.030> starch<00:00:53.360> in<00:00:53.540> water<00:00:53.860> into

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
so I could put this starch in water into

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:05.350 
so I could put this starch in water into
this<00:00:55.040> um<00:00:55.250> bag<00:00:57.250> and<00:00:59.800> tie<00:01:00.800> it<00:01:00.860> off<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:04.460> once<00:01:05.239> I

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
this um bag and tie it off and once I

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.390 
this um bag and tie it off and once I
tie<00:01:05.570> it<00:01:05.600> off<00:01:05.840> I'd<00:01:06.170> end<00:01:06.380> up<00:01:06.530> with<00:01:06.650> this<00:01:06.770> bag<00:01:07.070> kind

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
tie it off I'd end up with this bag kind

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.330 
tie it off I'd end up with this bag kind
of<00:01:07.550> loose<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:08.450> that<00:01:08.620> I'm<00:01:09.620> not<00:01:09.680> gonna<00:01:09.920> build<00:01:10.190> any

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
of loose so that I'm not gonna build any

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.310 
of loose so that I'm not gonna build any
pressure<00:01:10.670> up<00:01:10.970> so<00:01:11.240> if<00:01:11.360> things<00:01:11.570> want<00:01:11.810> to<00:01:11.900> come<00:01:12.170> in

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
pressure up so if things want to come in

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.490 
pressure up so if things want to come in
they're<00:01:12.620> able<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:13.100> come<00:01:13.400> in<00:01:13.660> I<00:01:14.660> can<00:01:15.110> drop<00:01:15.290> this

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
they're able to come in I can drop this

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.170 
they're able to come in I can drop this
bag<00:01:15.770> into<00:01:16.340> a<00:01:16.370> cup<00:01:16.790> of<00:01:17.030> iodine<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:18.790> you<00:01:19.790> can<00:01:19.970> see

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
bag into a cup of iodine and you can see

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.969 
bag into a cup of iodine and you can see
that<00:01:20.390> when<00:01:20.600> you<00:01:22.000> start<00:01:23.050> iodine<00:01:24.050> and<00:01:24.470> water

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
that when you start iodine and water

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.760 
that when you start iodine and water
makes<00:01:25.880> just<00:01:26.270> kind<00:01:26.750> of<00:01:26.810> this<00:01:26.960> brown<00:01:27.290> colors

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
makes just kind of this brown colors

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.080 
makes just kind of this brown colors
just<00:01:28.100> this<00:01:28.250> apple<00:01:28.670> juicy<00:01:29.259> color<00:01:30.490> so<00:01:31.490> in<00:01:31.910> the

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
just this apple juicy color so in the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.690 
just this apple juicy color so in the
cup<00:01:32.330> I<00:01:32.630> have<00:01:32.810> iodine<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.440> water<00:01:33.650> and<00:01:34.009> in<00:01:34.610> the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
cup I have iodine and water and in the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.380 
cup I have iodine and water and in the
bag

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
bag

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.630 
bag
I<00:01:35.420> have<00:01:36.820> starch<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.290> water<00:01:39.290> when<00:01:40.220> I<00:01:40.250> put<00:01:40.520> the

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
I have starch and water when I put the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.980 
I have starch and water when I put the
bag<00:01:40.820> into<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.360> container

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
bag into the container

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.440 
bag into the container
you'll<00:01:42.649> notice<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.550> bag<00:01:43.759> this<00:01:44.090> has<00:01:44.270> been

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
you'll notice that the bag this has been

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.900 
you'll notice that the bag this has been
sitting<00:01:44.660> in<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.500> container<00:01:45.860> for<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.160> while<00:01:46.310> the

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
sitting in the container for a while the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.900 
sitting in the container for a while the
bag<00:01:47.119> has<00:01:47.390> turned<00:01:47.660> this<00:01:47.899> dark<00:01:48.229> purple<00:01:48.740> color<00:01:48.979> so

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
bag has turned this dark purple color so

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.600 
bag has turned this dark purple color so
what<00:01:50.149> we<00:01:50.270> know<00:01:50.479> is<00:01:50.509> that<00:01:51.440> that<00:01:51.619> iodine<00:01:52.039> moved

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
what we know is that that iodine moved

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.830 
what we know is that that iodine moved
into<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.479> bag<00:01:53.690> because<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:56.330> bag<00:01:56.509> turned

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
into the bag because the bag turned

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.570 
into the bag because the bag turned
purple<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:57.590> when<00:01:58.340> iodine<00:01:58.789> and<00:02:00.100> starch<00:02:01.100> come

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
purple and when iodine and starch come

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.160 
purple and when iodine and starch come
into<00:02:01.759> contact<00:02:01.970> they<00:02:02.360> change<00:02:02.690> that<00:02:02.899> color

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
into contact they change that color

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.400 
into contact they change that color
another<00:02:03.979> way<00:02:04.250> we<00:02:04.399> can<00:02:04.580> show<00:02:04.819> this<00:02:05.060> is<00:02:05.360> if<00:02:06.080> I

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
another way we can show this is if I

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.469 
another way we can show this is if I
take<00:02:06.649> this<00:02:06.890> starch<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.729> drop<00:02:08.000> it<00:02:08.149> into<00:02:08.270> this

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
take this starch and drop it into this

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.850 
take this starch and drop it into this
container<00:02:08.959> what<00:02:09.800> do<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:10.009> think<00:02:10.250> would<00:02:10.399> happen

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
container what do you think would happen

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.610 
container what do you think would happen
and<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:12.920> can<00:02:13.160> see<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.480> starch<00:02:14.840> from

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.789 

this<00:02:18.620> water<00:02:19.720> comes<00:02:20.720> into<00:02:20.900> contact<00:02:21.200> with<00:02:21.560> the

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
this water comes into contact with the

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:27.819 
this water comes into contact with the
iodine<00:02:22.069> and<00:02:22.659> is<00:02:23.659> slowly<00:02:24.170> but<00:02:24.799> surely<00:02:26.620> going<00:02:27.620> to

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
iodine and is slowly but surely going to

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.750 
iodine and is slowly but surely going to
change<00:02:28.129> this<00:02:29.120> beaker<00:02:29.659> or<00:02:29.959> this<00:02:30.230> Cup<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:31.370> same

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
change this beaker or this Cup that same

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.050 
change this beaker or this Cup that same
purple<00:02:32.209> color<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.900> bag<00:02:33.140> did<00:02:33.849> so<00:02:34.849> if<00:02:34.940> you

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
purple color that the bag did so if you

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.809 
purple color that the bag did so if you
have<00:02:35.239> a<00:02:35.269> semipermeable<00:02:35.750> membrane<00:02:36.610> with<00:02:37.610> this

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
have a semipermeable membrane with this

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.979 
have a semipermeable membrane with this
example<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:40.459> can<00:02:40.489> see<00:02:40.730> what<00:02:41.420> was<00:02:41.629> small

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
example you can see what was small

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.780 
example you can see what was small
enough<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.440> pass<00:02:42.650> through<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:43.069> pores<00:02:43.370> and

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
enough to pass through the pores and

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.670 
enough to pass through the pores and
what<00:02:44.390> was<00:02:44.690> not<00:02:44.870> small<00:02:45.260> enough

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
what was not small enough

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.420 
what was not small enough
if<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.540> starch<00:02:47.540> was<00:02:47.840> small<00:02:48.799> enough<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.220> pass

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
if the starch was small enough to pass

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.190 
if the starch was small enough to pass
through<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.790> pores<00:02:50.030> then<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.810> cup<00:02:51.019> would

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
through the pores then the cup would

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.930 
through the pores then the cup would
have<00:02:51.319> changed<00:02:51.560> purple<00:02:52.099> but<00:02:52.549> it<00:02:52.640> couldn't

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
have changed purple but it couldn't

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.809 
have changed purple but it couldn't
leave<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.930> iodine<00:02:54.530> was<00:02:54.920> small<00:02:55.310> enough<00:02:55.579> to

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
leave and the iodine was small enough to

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.119 
leave and the iodine was small enough to
go<00:02:55.940> into<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.389> bag<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:57.079> so<00:02:57.620> that's<00:02:57.799> why<00:02:57.980> we

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
go into the bag and so that's why we

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.900 
go into the bag and so that's why we
have<00:02:58.310> this<00:02:58.519> bag<00:02:59.209> being<00:02:59.480> that<00:02:59.659> color
