00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 Hello, my name is warm 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.790
 Welcome to the few today 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.340
 to the end of a career super stars to 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.099
 a great new signing and 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.400
 Again there is stress in easy going 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.400
 have fun 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.610
 that started the last week with one 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.090
 very sad news for santino 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.640
 Marella has a wwe lifehouse during a wwe 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.689
 show in canada be career end 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.849
 announced 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.460
 the whole is due to his 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.780
 meanwhile third neck injury and 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.610
 There he also said that he unfortunately 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.690
 in his career, not kahla 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.820
 was announced 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.760
 but he still still part of the 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.100
 wwe want to be a manager now 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.350
 or be naughty as a general manager 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.550
 remains to be seen meanwhile that 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.440
 Creative team does not really have a clue 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.000
 what to do with him, he 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.620
 was more of a superstar theme 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.510
 the segments have come closer 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.059
 nevertheless it is very sad that he is now 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.410
 the cobra has to hang on the nail and 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.600
 I think it's a pity too 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.250
 that the wwe is in the list and two 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.440
 Spending no word on it at all 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.509
 The cinema has not lost anymore 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.979
 I could do that in my own 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.899
 opinion in no way 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.570
 but what do you think of santino marella? 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.450
 and write from his career ending 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.160
 I do not mean the comments 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.750
 can suffer are so wischiwaschi things 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.360
 where you just can not say exactly 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.159
 What is now and that's just what 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.780
 What we have with your tank none 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.030
 knows what's going on but in the next 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.990
 days should give it improvements because 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.479
 on the 17th 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.360
 the contract with the bank is under www 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.490
 officially and at the latest then 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.460
 We definitely know what's going on 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.070
 with the punk I passed the video 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.659
 you will not get high until tuesday 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.549
 probably already know more than me 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.649
 Nevertheless, for the current point of view for the 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.780
 People who have not looked at us 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.670
 again the info sting has namely on 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.590
 his official twitter account one 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.439
 small cryptic messages with one 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.549
 wild released just sing in his 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:01.880
 silhouette can be seen and the date 14 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:04.670
 seventh 2014 so the leaks monday so 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.159
 theoretically for many assume 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.810
 that 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.319
 simply lust and the announcement of 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.069
 sting as a pre-order bonus for the www 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.709
 tk fifth game is about or sting 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.810
 if officially returns but what 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.860
 is because now we will be final 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.060
 certainly have seen terror yesterday 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.410
 in addition, for yesterday's edition 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.890
 and taken today 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.940
 Smackdown tapings still ric flair 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.470
 confirmed if that now really 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.360
 or not we will have 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.670
 probably at the time of the upload 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.160
 already know this video 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.500
 In addition, Charles became the daughter 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.569
 by ric flair at the moment nxt women's 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.780
 champions is also for these two 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.910
 shows booked and made alex diess emmys 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.040
 and entry level what I imagine 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.870
 Could it be just the two 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.970
 against each other in a match converts 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.280
 the wwe network a little bit more 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.989
 to promote you sexy on the 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.239
 see wwe network and if you can then 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.390
 just a really good match between 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.700
 samsung and apple at raw and smackdown 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.650
 shows then I can well imagine 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.389
 that in combination with from 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.340
 because of seeing more of the two 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.650
 subscribe that we are in at work and look 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.849
 always nice nxt that's what I think 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.069
 a very good advertising because the 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.450
 both really great superstars 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.980
 But you can be here again 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.209
 say he would probably be over that 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.859
 be smarter than me it can be too 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.780
 that was just a dark match 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.060
 which is a pity, though 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.010
 but we think everything is possible 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.389
 will know what do you think 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.130
 actually before the comeback of ric 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:35.819
 flair and look nothing you write 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.579
 Income then the wm has theirs now 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.680
 Japan tour ended and the last day 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.410
 is the bomb burst because hollow balls 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.079
 and jimmy have a hard time in the hall 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.780
 latest wwe superstar announced 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.450
 and knows recognizes as one of the 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.950
 really good Japanese superstars and 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.780
 I'm really looking forward to them 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.090
 first at nxp and then certainly 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.470
 sometime to see a casual smackdown 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.540
 that will definitely be an extreme 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.129
 Cool thing in general, everything you like 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.720
 just listening to any 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.480
 new commitments or contract 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.129
 offered 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.980
 besides being promising so what 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.230
 Coming soon is very very 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.180
 interesting and then I already have 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.370
 At the beginning, that's deep 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.630
 in the loose because like me last 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.250
 week already said are the 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.900
 superstars very dissatisfied what the 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.280
 payment is currently because stop 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.500
 Nobody really knows what's going on there 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.750
 comes aggravating came now also 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.270
 this is a very, very, very important thing 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.610
 small jack gave the wwe superstars 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.860
 will be proportionately synonymous for the wwe 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.199
 Video games paid for there it was to 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.030
 example so that a superstar 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.729
 in the first quarter of last year 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.740
 still got 70,000 us dollars and 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.260
 in the first quarter of this year only 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.300
 Eleven $ 1700 and that cut 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.250
 is of course extremely big and there was 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.389
 Again, no one won before what 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.460
 Of course , for discrepancies 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.289
 provided for the second quarter of this year 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.530
 even worse for there 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.660
 Only $ 1555 for the 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.860
 paid video games and that's just it 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.780
 of course an extreme 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.639
 worsening of pay and 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.440
 of course, makes for even more negative 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.360
 mood and this is yet to come 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.030
 Another negative point for the 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.910
 Superstars will now pay penalty 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.889
 if you are in public 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.169
 not quite dressed smartly dressed 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.789
 and late in the hall comes for it 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.530
 it should now go penal payments 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.630
 these superstars too 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.280
 must take the whole worry 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.130
 of course for very very negative 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.690
 mood but it does not exist at the end of the 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.820
 tunnels whether the light but bright or 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.090
 You do not know the dark is white at the end 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.000
 this month that is on 31.7 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.300
 aid 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.820
 his company numbers for the second 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.040
 quarter of this year 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.920
 and there you will see how it is 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.290
 now finally ran with the wwe network 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.750
 we like him like the peter 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.160
 after that everything ran in this 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.290
 report and also like the superstars 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.750
 to be paid and that's exactly what it is 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.010
 what you want to know only now and with 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.020
 this thing really stands and falls 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.790
 again a lot because when the numbers but 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.800
 surprisingly better 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.840
 because I think the wwe share 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.490
 go upstairs again if the 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.140
 but pay but were not so rosy 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.120
 I'll think again 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.040
 negative headlines for the wwe in 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.080
 to do all economic section 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.560
 So there you can be curious in any case 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:23.580
 be what published on 31 July there 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:27.200
 will be punctual to wrestlemania 31 in 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.190

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.740

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.780
 There will be his way to Essener ins 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.730
 maine event also described his 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.350
 whole prehistory and his 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.880
 in the beginning also his riesling 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.800
 Career the blood, I always think 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.580
 it gets very interesting 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.290

 In any case, people of you 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.700
 get to know each other 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.220
 oh yes, what do you forget about the lottery? 

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:34.400
 my 2000 subscribers special is 

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.870
 finished and the torn off bad 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.880
 doberan won 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:41.300
 Congratulation, there have 

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.430
 More than 290 people participated in what was general 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.960
 Extremely blatantly speaking thank you 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.320
 all and pity that I did not win 

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.610
 have 

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.290
 but that can not be something for everyone 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.870
 Send but remember I'm straight 

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.430
 in big steps thereby on the 3000 

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.480
 subscriber market and there it will go 

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.480
 certainly a win again 

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.250
 So stay tuned and have a good time 

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.450
 Next time we're going to get in 

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.450
 and create
