00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 conserving seeds and ensuring 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.379
 food for future generations 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.019
 the MaracanaÃº reporter and went to meet the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.300
 largest seed bank in Brazil and the 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.299
 latin america and one of the largest in the world 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.100
 with more than 120,000 thousand samples 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:23.609
 samples of about 600 species 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.529
 stored maize and rice seeds 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.939
 in the global svalbard seed bank 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.520
 in Norway at 20 degrees below zero 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.160
 save these Brazilian species in the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.469
 largest seed bank in the world is 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.059
 food safety guarantee 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.969
 this is an old concern of the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.430
 humanity is embrapa as an institution 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.620
 who works in this area has this 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.140
 mission in our country to preserve these 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.930
 the global seed bank in the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.239
 Norway received 264 samples of maize and 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.070
 540 of rice shipped from Brazil 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.920
 by embrapa 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.989
 the seeds will be stored there 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.450
 for as long as it takes 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.490
 hope that forever and ever 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.670
 preference that they are never used 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.770
 but only if you need 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.270
 they will be there as a guarantee of 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.759
 food of the people 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.369
 in brazil the conservation box 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.310
 is here at Embrapa 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.770
 genetic resources and biotechnology is the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.530
 largest seed bank in the country and 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.140
 Latin America and conserves the seeds 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.960
 20 degrees below zero 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.829
 currently the plant gene bank has 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:42.240
 120,000 samples of about 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.700
 680 species by this laboratory passes 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.329
 whole collection of seeds of the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.460
 country are 50 researchers dedicated to 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.869
 exclusively to the process of 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.420
 storage 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.560
 so the material arrives in small 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.280
 packages 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.229
 the seeds are wounds analyzed and 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.960
 then dehydrated 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.770
 after this process receive a registration 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.330
 origin and are stored in envelopes 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.180
 I have here in mine. 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.129
 hands a sample of 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.379
 son who arrived in 1988, then 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:21.560
 are 24 years shows that this is 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.930
 frozen and with a very good twinning 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.519
 we are evaluating this material 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.769
 when we detect that the material 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.810
 loses some of its viability to people 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.700
 sends a sample of the corn and 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.760
 sorghum in seven ponds is on duty 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.319
 again and return the material with 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.230
 best quality to be again 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.870
 stored a new bank 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.590
 will open 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.150
 in Brasilia with an area of 2 thousand meters 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:52.189
 squares will be able to 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.680
 storing 750,000 seed samples is 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:57.680
 guaranteed food for several generations 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.040
 is one of the largest banks perhaps the largest 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.139
 Latin America is and will allow to 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.480
 that we structure conservation 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.129
 seeds in our country not only 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.129
 seeds that are now in the embrapa also 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:13.639
 of state- owned universities or 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:16.849
 be it our rival beard is the bank 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:19.220
 Brazilian seed is also going to 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:23.199
 touching beyond the seeds will touch also 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.199
 is microorganism the animal cells
