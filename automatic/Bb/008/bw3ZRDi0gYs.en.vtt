yeah there's i think there's about four
locations<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:14.970> suburban<00:03:15.569> stores<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:16.020> you<00:03:16.110> can

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
locations of suburban stores so you can

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260 
locations of suburban stores so you can
go<00:03:16.380> ahead<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.620> go<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.370> different<00:03:17.430> one<00:03:17.880> if<00:03:18.090> it

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
go ahead and go to a different one if it

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.720 
go ahead and go to a different one if it
doesn't<00:03:18.569> work<00:03:18.690> at<00:03:18.840> this<00:03:19.020> one<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.490> that<00:03:20.490> is<00:03:20.610> all
