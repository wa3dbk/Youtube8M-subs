00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
bicycle bicycles here on the table I

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.480 
bicycle bicycles here on the table I
have<00:00:24.720> an<00:00:24.840> engine<00:00:25.230> kit<00:00:25.470> coming<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.189> could

know what is it eight nine ten inches

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.840 
know what is it eight nine ten inches
long<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:10.290> random<00:01:10.740> numbers

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:23.420 

cross<00:01:15.510> it<00:01:15.720> up<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:18.290> at<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.350> X

and<00:01:27.450> tidy<00:01:27.690> like<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.140> tie<00:01:28.440> in<00:01:28.500> somebody<00:01:29.010> up<00:01:29.220> to

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
and tidy like you tie in somebody up to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.350 
and tidy like you tie in somebody up to
lash<00:01:30.450> them<00:01:30.630> down<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.170> railroad<00:01:31.350> tracks<00:01:32.360> so

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
lash them down to the railroad tracks so

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.150 
lash them down to the railroad tracks so
the<00:01:33.480> Train<00:01:33.510> can<00:01:33.750> come<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.350> run<00:01:34.770> their<00:01:34.920> heads

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
the Train can come and run their heads

it<00:04:03.650> might<00:04:03.860> work<00:04:04.010> a<00:04:04.130> little<00:04:04.280> better<00:04:04.460> if<00:04:04.670> I<00:04:04.730> had

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
copper wire instead of aluminum wire but

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.350 
copper wire instead of aluminum wire but
i'm<00:04:08.150> working<00:04:08.360> with<00:04:08.540> what<00:04:08.780> I<00:04:08.810> got<00:04:10.270> finding<00:04:11.270> it

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
i'm working with what I got finding it

i'm working with what I got finding it
ready<00:04:11.540> before<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:12.050> injured<00:04:12.320> kid<00:04:12.530> gets<00:04:12.740> here

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.209 

then<00:04:26.159> let<00:04:27.159> it<00:04:27.189> cool<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:29.560> doesn't<00:04:29.860> take<00:04:29.979> a<00:04:30.009> whole

00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:30.219 
then let it cool it doesn't take a whole

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:40.929 

there's<00:04:37.249> one<00:04:37.519> is<00:04:37.939> done<00:04:39.489> and<00:04:40.489> there's<00:04:40.729> one

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:40.939 
there's one is done and there's one

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:45.189 
there's one is done and there's one
that's<00:04:41.089> not<00:04:41.329> done<00:04:43.359> so<00:04:44.359> that's<00:04:44.509> the<00:04:44.719> idea<00:04:45.019> to

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
that's not done so that's the idea to

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.479 
that's not done so that's the idea to
make<00:04:45.319> them<00:04:45.439> a<00:04:45.469> little<00:04:45.559> bit<00:04:45.799> different<00:04:46.249> we're

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:46.489 
make them a little bit different we're

00:04:46.489 --> 00:04:48.269 
make them a little bit different we're
gonna<00:04:46.699> have<00:04:46.789> to<00:04:46.879> put<00:04:46.999> more<00:04:47.149> solder<00:04:47.449> on<00:04:47.659> that

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:48.279 
gonna have to put more solder on that

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:54.069 
gonna have to put more solder on that
but<00:04:50.469> Allah<00:04:52.059> let's<00:04:53.059> see<00:04:53.239> let's<00:04:53.599> see<00:04:53.659> what's

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:54.079 
but Allah let's see let's see what's

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:58.209 
but Allah let's see let's see what's
happening<00:04:54.439> here<00:04:54.499> we<00:04:55.129> got<00:04:55.249> a<00:04:55.279> big<00:04:55.489> ball<00:04:57.219> it

00:04:58.209 --> 00:04:58.219 
happening here we got a big ball it

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:03.030 
happening here we got a big ball it
didn't<00:04:58.519> need<00:04:58.609> to<00:04:58.669> be<00:04:58.789> there

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.030 

that's<00:05:03.670> about<00:05:03.820> it<00:05:03.880> getting<00:05:04.860> stiffening<00:05:05.860> up

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
that's about it getting stiffening up

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.230 
that's about it getting stiffening up
the<00:05:06.160> spokes<00:05:06.460> we'll<00:05:06.820> see<00:05:06.970> if<00:05:07.090> it<00:05:07.210> works<00:05:07.420> I<00:05:09.240> would

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
the spokes we'll see if it works I would

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.320 
the spokes we'll see if it works I would
take<00:05:10.390> my<00:05:10.510> solder<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:10.960> go<00:05:11.110> now
