00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.270 
really enjoy training used to be quite a
weak<00:00:13.139> point<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.590> over<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.860> last<00:00:13.950> couple<00:00:14.130> of

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
weak point and over the last couple of

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.150 
weak point and over the last couple of
years<00:00:14.340> it's<00:00:14.670> really<00:00:14.700> volumize<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.630> come<00:00:15.870> up

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
years it's really volumize and come up

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.310 
years it's really volumize and come up
so<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.460> like<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.730> see<00:00:18.060> how<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.390> changes<00:00:18.900> happen

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
so I like to see how the changes happen

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.920 
so I like to see how the changes happen
and<00:00:19.470> how<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.650> improve<00:00:20.340> with<00:00:20.520> my<00:00:20.640> chest

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
and how I improve with my chest

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.019 
and how I improve with my chest
today<00:00:22.740> even<00:00:23.100> as<00:00:23.220> your<00:00:23.369> levels<00:00:23.609> are<00:00:23.760> pretty

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
today even as your levels are pretty

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.450 
today even as your levels are pretty
heavy<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> but<00:00:25.199> its<00:00:25.590> power<00:00:25.920> levels<00:00:26.250> are<00:00:26.310> down

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
heavy a but its power levels are down

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.640 
heavy a but its power levels are down
you'll<00:00:27.180> see<00:00:27.359> what<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.570> weights<00:00:27.750> there<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.619> I

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
you'll see what the weights there that I

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.160 
you'll see what the weights there that I
use<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:30.410> my<00:00:31.410> carbohydrates<00:00:32.189> are<00:00:32.730> about<00:00:33.170> 250

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
use and my carbohydrates are about 250

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.900 
use and my carbohydrates are about 250
grams<00:00:34.200> per<00:00:34.800> meal<00:00:35.010> where<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.460> usually<00:00:35.579> about

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
grams per meal where it's usually about

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.990 
grams per meal where it's usually about
500<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:38.010> know<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.610> one<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.910> half

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
500 but you know it's one and a half

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.209 
500 but you know it's one and a half

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
first exercise we did for chest was

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.020 
first exercise we did for chest was
incline<00:00:57.379> dumbbell<00:00:58.379> presses<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.879> is

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
incline dumbbell presses this is

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.910 
incline dumbbell presses this is
basically<00:01:00.600> one<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.960> my<00:01:01.020> favorite<00:01:01.379> movements<00:01:01.770> I

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
basically one of my favorite movements I

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.170 
basically one of my favorite movements I
always<00:01:02.879> prefer<00:01:03.239> doing<00:01:03.449> dumbbells<00:01:05.180> to-to-to

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
always prefer doing dumbbells to-to-to

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.000 
always prefer doing dumbbells to-to-to
barbells<00:01:06.570> purely<00:01:07.080> because<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.409> get<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> better

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
barbells purely because I get a better

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.630 
barbells purely because I get a better
feel<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.299> close<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.010> movement<00:01:11.430> so

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
feel and I can close the the movement so

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.850 
feel and I can close the the movement so
like<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.390> don't<00:01:12.540> really<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.320> don't<00:01:13.710> just

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
like I don't really I just I don't just

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.070 
like I don't really I just I don't just
press<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.430> actually<00:01:15.150> closed<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.689> movement<00:01:15.990> so

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
press I actually closed the movement so

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.050 
press I actually closed the movement so
I<00:01:16.110> make<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.950> dumbbells<00:01:17.490> touch<00:01:17.729> each<00:01:17.880> other

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
I make the dumbbells touch each other

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.810 
I make the dumbbells touch each other
and<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:19.049> feel<00:01:19.200> that's<00:01:19.439> even<00:01:20.250> deeper

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
and I just feel that's even deeper

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.520 
and I just feel that's even deeper
contraction<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.600> feel<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> chest<00:01:22.290> as

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
contraction that I feel in the chest as

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.030 
contraction that I feel in the chest as
we<00:01:22.710> when<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:24.200> barbells<00:01:25.200> if<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.740> don't<00:01:25.890> get

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
we when I do barbells if you don't get

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.060 
we when I do barbells if you don't get
that<00:01:26.220> lost<00:01:26.990> deep<00:01:27.990> deep<00:01:28.229> contraction<00:01:28.590> when<00:01:28.950> you

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
that lost deep deep contraction when you

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.969 
that lost deep deep contraction when you
touch<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> dumbbells<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.720> yeah<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.619> for<00:01:31.860> me

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
touch the dumbbells so yeah this for me

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.160 
touch the dumbbells so yeah this for me
is<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:33.119> bulk<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:35.280> chaste<00:01:35.549> worker

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
is the bulk of the chaste worker

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.920 
is the bulk of the chaste worker
absolutely<00:01:37.170> about<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.799> exercise<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:39.119> do

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
absolutely about this exercise and I do

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.740 
absolutely about this exercise and I do
about<00:01:40.320> probably<00:01:41.159> I'll<00:01:41.939> go<00:01:42.060> buff<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.420> I'll<00:01:42.600> go

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
about probably I'll go buff you I'll go

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.300 
about probably I'll go buff you I'll go
it<00:01:43.229> depends<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.590> how<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> feel<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.159> day

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
it depends on how I feel on the day

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.819 
it depends on how I feel on the day
today<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.640> did<00:01:44.880> about<00:01:45.030> six<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.630> these<00:01:45.720> sets<00:01:45.990> just

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
today I did about six of these sets just

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.760 
today I did about six of these sets just
as<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> warm-up<00:01:47.399> maybe<00:01:47.670> two<00:01:47.880> warm-ups<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.450> then

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
as a warm-up maybe two warm-ups and then

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.940 
as a warm-up maybe two warm-ups and then
for<00:01:49.770> working<00:01:50.189> sets

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
for working sets

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.470 
for working sets
the<00:01:52.950> second<00:01:53.250> exercise<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.760> if<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.940> chest<00:01:54.210> was

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
the second exercise that if a chest was

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.320 
the second exercise that if a chest was
machine<00:01:54.990> press<00:01:55.260> this<00:01:56.070> particular<00:01:56.490> machine<00:01:57.000> to

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
machine press this particular machine to

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.660 
machine press this particular machine to
me<00:01:57.480> is<00:01:57.810> one<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.470> best<00:01:58.650> machines<00:01:59.010> of<00:01:59.190> works

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
me is one of the best machines of works

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.400 
me is one of the best machines of works
you<00:02:00.000> can't<00:02:00.300> really<00:02:00.420> go<00:02:00.600> too<00:02:00.900> heavy<00:02:01.050> on<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
you can't really go too heavy on the

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.100 
you can't really go too heavy on the
machine<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.730> focus<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.450> lot<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
machine but I focus a lot on the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.250 
machine but I focus a lot on the
contraction<00:02:04.680> at<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:04.890> top<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:06.450> know<00:02:06.570> I'm<00:02:06.810> one

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
of those guys that believe that

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.210 
of those guys that believe that
contraction<00:02:09.240> equal<00:02:09.600> striations<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.320> I<00:02:10.649> try

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
contraction equal striations so I try

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.460 
contraction equal striations so I try
and<00:02:11.250> keep<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.730> contraction<00:02:11.880> as<00:02:12.360> as<00:02:12.570> as<00:02:13.110> hard

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
and keep the contraction as as as hard

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.590 
and keep the contraction as as as hard
as<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.710> can<00:02:13.770> for<00:02:14.250> as<00:02:14.310> long<00:02:14.400> as<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.700> can<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.300> then

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
as I can for as long as I can and then

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.230 
as I can for as long as I can and then
give<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.050> good<00:02:16.080> stretch<00:02:16.560> at<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.860> bottom<00:02:17.240> and

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
give it a good stretch at the bottom and

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.120 
give it a good stretch at the bottom and
then<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.660> know<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.230> just<00:02:19.500> one<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.010> the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
then you know this is just one of the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.400 
then you know this is just one of the
exercises<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.850> believe<00:02:21.120> really<00:02:22.080> gets<00:02:22.290> the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
exercises that I believe really gets the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.080 
exercises that I believe really gets the
striations<00:02:23.300> showing<00:02:25.340> third<00:02:26.340> exercise<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.820> did

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
striations showing third exercise I did

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.050 
striations showing third exercise I did
for<00:02:27.360> chest<00:02:27.630> was<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.959> fly<00:02:28.500> press<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:29.010> prefer<00:02:29.940> doing

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.090 
for chest was a fly press I prefer doing
a<00:02:30.209> fly<00:02:30.420> press<00:02:30.750> sometimes<00:02:31.590> I'll<00:02:31.740> do<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.920> normal

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
a fly press sometimes I'll do a normal

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.850 
a fly press sometimes I'll do a normal
fly<00:02:32.459> depending<00:02:32.730> on<00:02:33.030> how<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.150> feel<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:34.110> yeah

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
fly depending on how I feel but yeah

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.120 
fly depending on how I feel but yeah
today<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.310> felt<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.090> little<00:02:36.450> bit<00:02:36.570> heavy<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:37.290> did

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
today this felt a little bit heavy I did

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.880 
today this felt a little bit heavy I did
about<00:02:38.310> six<00:02:38.370> reps<00:02:38.880> on<00:02:39.090> each<00:02:39.240> state<00:02:39.990> but<00:02:40.470> I

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
about six reps on each state but I

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.920 
about six reps on each state but I
really<00:02:41.640> felt<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.910> contraction<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:42.720> really

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
really felt the contraction and I really

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.640 
really felt the contraction and I really
felt<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.200> stretch<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:45.510> was<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.690> good<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.470> was

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
felt the stretch so it was a good it was

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:57.380 
felt the stretch so it was a good it was
a<00:02:46.680> good<00:02:46.860> workout

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.140 

and<00:02:58.860> then<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.980> last<00:03:00.160> exercise<00:03:00.640> was

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
and then the last exercise was

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.500 
and then the last exercise was
crossovers<00:03:02.400> again<00:03:03.400> I<00:03:03.430> believe<00:03:03.880> the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
crossovers again I believe the

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.560 
crossovers again I believe the
crossovers<00:03:05.050> is<00:03:05.820> you<00:03:06.820> know<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.000> focus<00:03:07.420> on<00:03:07.480> the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
crossovers is you know you focus on the

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.930 
crossovers is you know you focus on the
contraction<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.350> when<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.250> fo<00:03:09.460> can<00:03:09.490> you<00:03:09.730> tend

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
contraction and when you fo can you tend

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.250 
contraction and when you fo can you tend
to<00:03:10.000> focus<00:03:10.180> on<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.570> contraction<00:03:11.050> with<00:03:11.170> an

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
to focus on the contraction with an

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.170 
to focus on the contraction with an
exercise<00:03:11.710> I<00:03:11.740> believe<00:03:12.370> if<00:03:12.550> it<00:03:12.730> brings<00:03:12.940> out<00:03:13.090> the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
exercise I believe if it brings out the

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.560 
exercise I believe if it brings out the
striations<00:03:13.690> so<00:03:14.590> yeah<00:03:15.340> really<00:03:15.580> focusing<00:03:16.510> on

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
striations so yeah really focusing on

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.390 
striations so yeah really focusing on
the<00:03:16.660> tension<00:03:17.050> and<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.620> Contra

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
the tension and the and the Contra

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.860 
the tension and the and the Contra
contraction<00:03:19.030> at<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.240> end<00:03:19.360> of<00:03:19.450> them<00:03:19.570> of<00:03:19.780> the

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
contraction at the end of them of the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.860 
contraction at the end of them of the
workout<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.410> a<00:03:20.890> good<00:03:21.130> stretch<00:03:21.640> at<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.540> top<00:03:22.750> of
