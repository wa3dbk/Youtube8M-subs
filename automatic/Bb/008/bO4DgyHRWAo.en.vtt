00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.230
 we are at the seventh generational peak stop 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.180
 for golf that from 1974 to today has 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.369
 always known to change skin without ever 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.930
 betray its satisfactions of 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.330
 driving and reliability have built 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.040
 luck from the first edition of 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:43.989
 giorgetto giugiaro to the current one 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:45.790
 drawn by walter de silva the lines yes 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.250
 they are known to renew over time and have 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.500
 escorted the German through her 38 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.110
 years of history helping her to sell 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.030
 over 29 million copies a number 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.010
 destined to grow from the first 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.900
 of November when the last arrived 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.900
 will enter the volkswagen showrooms 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.410
 but they are not only the harmony of the 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.240
 proportions and the comforting embrace 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.020
 of tradition to convince on the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.240
 new golf 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.340
 if it was possible to play the guide e 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.990
 guess what car is certainly this 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:28.870
 car would be one of the most 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:30.700
 recognizable even with eyes closed two 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.590
 curves and immediately you understand that you have between 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.390
 hands the steering wheel of a golf 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.130
 if you feel any differences 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.830
 compared to the previous ones are 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.080
 probably to be attributed to 100 kg of 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.680
 weight that subtracted from the general task 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.759
 from special steels and from an elaboration 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.100
 intelligent bodywork 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.100
 components benefit pleasure 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.440
 driving especially on 1400 petrol 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.570
 tsi of 140 horses 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.930
 as for diesel we tested 2000 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.720
 tdi 150 horses with 6-speed dsg 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.910
 and the transmission is very balanced 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.979
 deserves as always is more superb 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.869
 flattering imaginable 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.520
 one cannot feel the progressions 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.890
 climbs are commanded with the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.870
 thought so much that the paddles on the steering wheel 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.750
 to switch to the changed regime 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.580
 manual are completely irrelevant if the 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.830
 diesel is ready and reactive is like 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.959
 we said less fun than gasoline 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.090
 pushes first and longer satisfies 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.080
 better any inclinations 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.080
 rider's sport 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.540
 however, road behavior is 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.880
 unexceptionable for both the estate 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.470
 compound enhances on the moving sections 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.240
 because the car communicates big 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.190
 safety and attachment to asphalt 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.350
 without ever resulting 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.240
 tiring the merit is of the new 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.010
 modular platform that will form the base 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.710
 of the future production of the group 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.560
 German also like an extreme 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.910
 noiseless the golf 7 offers as standard on 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.470
 the whole range the differential 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.260
 self-locking than in the version 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.770
 previous was the prerogative of the single 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.770
 adjective 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.430
 the chisel work in search of 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.830
 weight with the improvements 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.900
 made to the engines has resulted obvious 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.800
 consequences on the consumption front e 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.960
 of emissions 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.670
 but don't think it's done 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.340
 economy on the front of the space on board 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.200
 and the security technology 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.180
 especially grown in the 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.060
 external dimensions the car compared 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.580
 present at the 2008 edition cm 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.830
 additional rear passengers and 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.150
 in the trunk and was fitted with 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.060
 state-of-the-art security systems 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.670
 as the fatigue detection that it detects 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.920
 when carelessly driving the 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.320
 multiple anti-collision braking and the 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.720
 system distance adjustment 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.720
 automatic braking already seen in the art 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.500
 on the list of parties from golf vii 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.930
 17,000 euros for the 1200 tsi bluemotion 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.530
 which is the greenest in the range since 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.860
 consumes only 3.2 liters per 100 km e 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:14.010
 grows up to 23 thousand euros of the tsa e 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:19.220
 from 140 horses and 28 thousand and 200 euros 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.220
 of the 2000 tdi dsg of our tests
