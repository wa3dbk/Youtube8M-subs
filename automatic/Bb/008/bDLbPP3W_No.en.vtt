 the book really tells the story 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.350
 video games can not tell the very beginning 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.040

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.709
 with a history of own game for sure 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.600
 draw something new given that 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.780
 the story of the game in Russia is very different 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.200
 from the world history of games as she did 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.910
 it all started 90 and when people in 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.750

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.400
 man even in a mask seems to me 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.770

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.810
