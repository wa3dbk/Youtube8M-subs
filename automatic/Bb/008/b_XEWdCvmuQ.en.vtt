another bar and then F and that's played

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.040 
another bar and then F and that's played
for<00:00:30.900> two<00:00:31.080> bars<00:00:31.340> okay<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.270> whole<00:00:33.420> verse<00:00:33.660> it

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
for two bars okay so the whole verse it

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.880 
for two bars okay so the whole verse it
goes<00:00:34.260> from<00:00:34.530> G<00:00:35.100> C<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.030> F<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:37.320> repeats<00:00:37.680> that

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
goes from G C to F and it repeats that

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.930 
goes from G C to F and it repeats that
four<00:00:38.250> times<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:39.329> that's<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.660> entire<00:00:39.930> verse

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
four times and that's the entire verse

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.160 
four times and that's the entire verse
so<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.120> song<00:00:42.300> wasn't<00:00:42.540> really<00:00:42.899> written<00:00:43.050> for

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
so this song wasn't really written for

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.740 
so this song wasn't really written for

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:06.730 
and see an e-minor then back to F then F
and<00:02:53.120> C<00:02:54.700> then<00:02:55.700> G<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:58.330> minor<00:03:02.260> C<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:04.310> then<00:03:04.490> D

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.480 

okay<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:09.720> for<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.140> chorus<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.890> strum<00:03:11.370> it

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
okay so for the chorus I strum it

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.310 
okay so for the chorus I strum it
differently<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:13.020> a<00:03:13.140> different

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
differently and so it's a different

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.350 
differently and so it's a different
rhythm<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:14.040> if<00:03:14.460> you<00:03:14.580> want<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.820> just<00:03:14.940> watch<00:03:15.120> I'll

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
rhythm so if you want to just watch I'll

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.940 
rhythm so if you want to just watch I'll
play<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.630> really<00:03:15.900> slow<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.590> can<00:03:16.740> just

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
play it really slow and you can just

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:50.250 
play it really slow and you can just
copy<00:03:17.510> my<00:03:18.510> strumming<00:03:18.930> pattern<00:03:19.200> okay
