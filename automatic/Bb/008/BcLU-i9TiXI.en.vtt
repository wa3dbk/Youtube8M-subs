00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
they should have dealt with it then well

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.580 
they should have dealt with it then well
furthermore<00:00:33.750> they<00:00:33.930> should<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.260> dealt<00:00:34.440> with

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
furthermore they should have dealt with

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.220 
furthermore they should have dealt with
it<00:00:34.739> before<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.160> came<00:00:35.340> out<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:36.300> look<00:00:37.020> no
