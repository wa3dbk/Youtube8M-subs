00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 gfr is what we will do with it 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:14.280
 but yes it's done with the pastel is 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:15.480
 makes it a super fashionable especially 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.539
 this summer to have color highlights 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.090
 in transportation funds 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.920
 in fact I always wanted to wash 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.539
 or before pink wicks to embalm 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.590
 but that hair but not our gains 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.570
 it's normal it's still a 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.590
 commitment and so the thing is to 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.000
 do it more just for a day 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.349
 but not even have to go and buy 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.750
 a temporary hair painting 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.770
 it's done with care to write or 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.120
 exceed the dry 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.350
 two things that everyone at the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.059
 wood house in his old type of 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.620
 plastic or in the garage where some 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.809
 share in the hall of jules responds 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.840
 exactly at the docks choosing a 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.730
 slap that for sure I 'm going to take 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.070
 place their rise 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.590
 it's a very good choice I showed the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.760
 steps it's super simple but before goes 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.270
 still protect your sweater with 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.829
 a little towel just to be I 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.170
 have to do some damage so we proceed 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.510
 bit by bit wick not too funny 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.630
 to take it right here a little less than a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.670
 inch to launch firmly 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.340
 we have him noon girl with a little bit 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.780
 of water is what you could cheat there 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.130
 pastel in the water where you will do it 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.560
 with your fingers no you really have to 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.790
 moisten the hair ok with your 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.729
 fingers with my fingers like that where we 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.170
 get ready with a little sorting after that one 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.250
 apply the color really a little 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.250
 as if we are coloring 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.830
 we see eggs once we are 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.380
 satisfied with the color just before 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.299
 the town hall really dries your hair 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.680
 as usual you curl yourself 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.119
 to flatten the hair in fact it's 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.900
 recommended type heat is the 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.490
 evidence 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.320
 the team the facts but what I would have 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.270
 could do it but yes no problem 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.920
 but it's a practice to have a friend 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.450
 to do there nothing in our country my 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.600
 hair is pale enough that hair 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.890
 not his own sweeter on the contrary 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.659
 the more your hair is no less you have 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.220
 need water but you will see but in 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.990
 do we learn the color if the plant 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.060
 does not seem to be doing just add a little 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.860
 little water ok there we can really 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.450
 having fun we can do just one color 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.280
 how can make plain wicks 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.690
 different clan where we can also do 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.149
 cracks crisis in the automobile 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.130

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.090
 or chair make a lot of colors 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.010
 different who have suffered a braid 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.120

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.970
 to doubt why it could be great 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.100

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.769
 results that I invented when I say 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.780
 that I leave the role in my hair 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.730
 but the same reassured to know that it 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.959
