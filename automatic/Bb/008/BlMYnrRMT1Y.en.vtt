00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.380 

you<00:00:49.100> shouldn't<00:00:49.370> try<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:49.610> copy<00:00:49.879> things<00:00:50.180> with

you'll get really weird things happening
to<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.329> bones<00:00:56.540> when<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:57.050> do<00:00:57.199> it<00:00:57.350> make<00:00:58.010> sure

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
to the bones when you do it make sure

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.759 
to the bones when you do it make sure
your<00:00:58.280> bone<00:00:58.460> edit<00:00:58.730> mode<00:00:58.879> is<00:00:58.910> off<00:00:59.680> what<00:01:00.680> I'm

your bone edit mode is off what I'm

your bone edit mode is off what I'm
going<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:00.949> do<00:01:01.129> is<00:01:01.309> now<00:01:01.489> that<00:01:01.640> I've<00:01:01.760> got<00:01:01.940> one

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
going to do is now that I've got one

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.040 
going to do is now that I've got one
chain<00:01:02.539> I<00:01:02.780> can<00:01:03.289> easily<00:01:03.379> copy<00:01:03.769> it<00:01:04.040> over<00:01:04.159> and

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
chain I can easily copy it over and

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
chain I can easily copy it over and
place<00:01:06.050> it<00:01:06.259> the<00:01:07.100> next<00:01:07.280> finger

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
making sure it's rotated and on the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.660 
making sure it's rotated and on the
right<00:01:15.140> axis<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:15.740> following<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:16.220> mesh<00:01:16.490> as

closely as possible getting any of your

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.620 
closely as possible getting any of your
joints<00:01:22.280> wrong<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:22.700> it<00:01:22.790> in<00:01:22.910> a<00:01:23.000> character<00:01:23.420> can

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
joints wrong and it in a character can

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.070 
joints wrong and it in a character can
cause<00:01:23.870> a<00:01:24.229> lot<00:01:24.670> of<00:01:25.670> problems<00:01:26.240> when<00:01:26.720> you<00:01:26.750> start

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
cause a lot of problems when you start

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.040 
cause a lot of problems when you start
to<00:01:27.200> animate<00:01:27.670> I've<00:01:28.670> had<00:01:29.150> people<00:01:29.330> ask<00:01:29.660> me<00:01:29.780> why

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
to animate I've had people ask me why

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.210 
to animate I've had people ask me why
doesn't<00:01:30.350> my<00:01:30.580> rig<00:01:31.580> to<00:01:31.729> form<00:01:32.030> properly<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:34.130> when

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
doesn't my rig to form properly and when

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.859 
doesn't my rig to form properly and when
I<00:01:34.250> look<00:01:34.520> at<00:01:34.700> it<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:34.910> really<00:01:35.000> has<00:01:35.270> nothing<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:35.690> do

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
I look at it it really has nothing to do

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.260 
I look at it it really has nothing to do
with<00:01:36.250> skin<00:01:37.250> or<00:01:37.520> how<00:01:37.640> they've<00:01:37.850> skin<00:01:38.150> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
with skin or how they've skin the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.210 
with skin or how they've skin the
character<00:01:38.690> it<00:01:39.350> has<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:39.650> do<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.950> way<00:01:40.040> that

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
character it has to do the way that

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
character it has to do the way that
they've<00:01:40.340> rigged<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.729> character<00:01:41.090> in<00:01:41.180> the

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
they've rigged the character in the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.960 
they've rigged the character in the
first<00:01:41.450> place<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:42.410> then<00:01:43.009> it<00:01:43.280> just<00:01:43.310> isn't<00:01:43.910> a

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
first place and then it just isn't a

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.680 
first place and then it just isn't a
sound<00:01:44.210> rig<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:49.430> notice<00:01:49.729> once<00:01:49.910> again<00:01:50.210> our<00:01:50.330> nub

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
sound rig you notice once again our nub

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.560 
sound rig you notice once again our nub
bones<00:01:50.960> are<00:01:51.590> becoming<00:01:52.100> misaligned<00:01:55.240> again<00:01:56.240> to

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
bones are becoming misaligned again to

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.210 
bones are becoming misaligned again to
leaving<00:01:56.840> them<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.140> recreated<00:01:57.770> them<00:01:57.920> is<00:01:58.130> a

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
leaving them and recreated them is a

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:16.400 
leaving them and recreated them is a
great<00:01:58.430> way<00:01:58.550> of<00:01:58.580> fixing<00:01:58.820> it

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.860 

so<00:02:17.370> these<00:02:17.490> first<00:02:17.760> three<00:02:18.000> fingers<00:02:18.210> are<00:02:18.510> very

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
so these first three fingers are very

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.930 
so these first three fingers are very
similar<00:02:19.140> in<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.470> way<00:02:19.500> they're<00:02:19.830> done<00:02:22.940> just

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
similar in the way they're done just

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.010 
similar in the way they're done just
making<00:02:24.210> sure<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.450> joints<00:02:24.780> are<00:02:24.870> in<00:02:24.930> the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
making sure the joints are in the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.230 
making sure the joints are in the
correct<00:02:25.140> spot<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.610> they're<00:02:26.730> orientated

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
correct spot and that they're orientated

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.760 
correct spot and that they're orientated
correctly<00:02:29.810> you<00:02:30.810> really<00:02:31.080> can't<00:02:31.320> go<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.620> much

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
correctly you really can't go that much

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:45.550 
correctly you really can't go that much
wrong<00:02:32.010> with<00:02:32.190> them

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.309 

delete<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.730> just<00:02:47.270> recreate<00:02:48.020> that<00:02:48.140> end

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
delete that and just recreate that end

00:02:48.319 --> 00:03:03.190 
delete that and just recreate that end
bone<00:02:51.099> do<00:02:52.099> the<00:02:52.220> baby<00:02:52.430> finger<00:02:52.760> next

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.100 

and<00:03:03.650> in<00:03:03.890> this<00:03:03.980> case<00:03:04.220> we're<00:03:04.430> going<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.580> need<00:03:04.760> a

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
and in this case we're going to need a

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.270 
and in this case we're going to need a
joint<00:03:06.110> that<00:03:06.290> actually<00:03:06.650> goes<00:03:06.800> much<00:03:07.069> further

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
joint that actually goes much further

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.520 
joint that actually goes much further
back<00:03:07.610> in<00:03:07.849> the<00:03:07.940> hand<00:03:08.239> so<00:03:09.019> what<00:03:09.110> I'm<00:03:09.200> going<00:03:09.319> to<00:03:09.379> do

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
back in the hand so what I'm going to do

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.720 
back in the hand so what I'm going to do
is<00:03:09.620> I'm<00:03:09.709> going<00:03:09.800> to<00:03:09.890> drag<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:10.220> joint<00:03:10.519> back

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
is I'm going to drag this joint back

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.880 
is I'm going to drag this joint back
first<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.360> where<00:03:11.510> it<00:03:11.629> needs<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.959> be<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.680> this

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
first to where it needs to be and this

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.670 
first to where it needs to be and this
is<00:03:19.010> going<00:03:19.129> to<00:03:19.220> help<00:03:19.400> us<00:03:19.550> with<00:03:19.610> a<00:03:20.680> cupping

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
is going to help us with a cupping

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.550 
is going to help us with a cupping
action<00:03:22.099> so<00:03:22.610> we<00:03:22.700> can<00:03:22.819> rotate<00:03:23.060> this<00:03:23.480> whole<00:03:24.140> joint

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
action so we can rotate this whole joint

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.710 
action so we can rotate this whole joint
down<00:03:24.860> and<00:03:25.040> around<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.430> hand<00:03:25.640> a<00:03:25.760> bit<00:03:25.910> now<00:03:26.510> we're

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
down and around the hand a bit now we're

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.720 
down and around the hand a bit now we're
missing<00:03:27.050> a<00:03:27.110> joint<00:03:27.380> now<00:03:27.590> so<00:03:27.920> I'm<00:03:28.400> just<00:03:28.519> going<00:03:28.640> to

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
missing a joint now so I'm just going to

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.080 
missing a joint now so I'm just going to
say<00:03:28.940> refine<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.110> refine<00:03:30.410> it<00:03:30.830> a<00:03:30.890> new<00:03:31.930> bone

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
say refine and refine it a new bone

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.130 
say refine and refine it a new bone
that's<00:03:35.090> has<00:03:35.330> to<00:03:35.420> be<00:03:35.510> just<00:03:35.780> about<00:03:35.810> one<00:03:36.019> of<00:03:36.049> my

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
that's has to be just about one of my

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.130 
that's has to be just about one of my
favorite<00:03:36.620> tools<00:03:36.769> in<00:03:37.099> the<00:03:37.250> max<00:03:37.790> bones<00:03:38.060> is<00:03:38.840> being

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
favorite tools in the max bones is being

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.140 
favorite tools in the max bones is being
able<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.410> refine<00:03:39.769> them<00:03:39.980> on<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.700> fly<00:03:43.030> it<00:03:44.030> can

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
able to refine them on the fly it can

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:51.580 
able to refine them on the fly it can
really<00:03:44.360> help<00:03:44.569> make<00:03:44.810> short<00:03:45.110> work

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:59.710 

of<00:03:51.680> getting<00:03:52.489> your<00:03:52.580> bones<00:03:52.959> set<00:03:53.959> up<00:03:54.080> correctly
