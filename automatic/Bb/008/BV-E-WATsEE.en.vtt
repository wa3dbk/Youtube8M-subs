00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.630
 but by Grandpa it is not did not seem 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:14.500
 I know nothing 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:16.570
 in July he is to school without clothes 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.250
 Talk about beauty, people who talk, come 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.189
 bringing you here one more today 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.020
 video new power pt br and is the second 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.680
 video comment that already my second 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.360
 book then we go here in play went well 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.980
 no one picks up before brian 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.689
 you probably know a channel of m 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.850
 and even as a player an excellent 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:39.579
 player who is part of the clan and finally 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:41.920
 I entered the mpe 63 made in soil and in the 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.249
 pc that is you already must have noticed by 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.649
 already the field of vision of gameplay and 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:50.199
 really this makes the game was awesome 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.499
 and the tip of our you see the guy 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:56.230
 only really is very difficult to play is 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:57.789
 You have to have a legal balance. 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.800
 who know how to play and try it yourself 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.600
 alone balance the main I think 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.839
 a very difficult thing Brazil did not do 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.150
 This will follow but he tried his best 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.780
 it stays inside the main to help 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.040
 the team 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.050
 you can also see that the team 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.300
 I was losing almost like losing 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.920
 at times his team had not 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.420
 just pick up the flag but still 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.670
 so it helped him to get his 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.140
 fixed schools is their response to the former 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.890
 message you are using for this here 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.570
 support to help himself and this 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.430
 calls attention to this investment in the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.890
 extension which also shows that 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.670
 new side of the stomp people also come back 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.440
 to the pc 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.880
 I think this is important because 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.250
 people who play on the pc should have 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.170
 the hypotension of women in the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.300
 third parties do not have the opportunity to 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.860
 enter the people's club yesterday and 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.230
 person will really be very upset 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.910
 you playing on PC and is pretty upset 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.320
 and wonder why I do not have a 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.870
 pc profession en br / enem at last is this flu 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.130
 shows that it is happening that 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.110
 few rpdc are coming are being 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.360
 done and this really shows that it is a 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.580
 large advance per button pin not only for 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.350
 Brazil not only can promote but also 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.170
 for everyone because this is a breakthrough 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.840
 amazing that I've always waited for 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.390
 players themselves and some issues 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.999
 which are certainly expanding in 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.829
 Damn great value and mpx solo is because 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.310
 playing solo as already mentioned is not 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.530
 easy 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.750
 even more playing on the pc and in the hemose 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.730
 keyboard until you get used to each 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.830
 team should play in xbox there a thing 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.660
 the guy get used but should not 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.030
 be very difficult should be very 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.730
 strange feeling really requires 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.819
 enough training is like playing hole 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.310
 Tell us what you think! 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.349
 on the pc it's still clear that it's already 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.959
 it 's a different thing from the 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.239
 that people who play and console 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.830
 personal playing console is more if 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.610
 really get a little complicated 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.590
 huh 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.150
 from the face when csn I stayed 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.140
 Wondering, he's definitely going to. 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.940
 try on a tube on the cam or something of the type 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.370
 and it really was not what he did 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.269
 been pick up fake hooks is not there 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.510
 many high records in upcn the games 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.950
 on the pc are not very high and I think 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.489
 It was why Brazil was trying 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.340
 set a new scorecard 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.849
 most prominent pc options and it was 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.790
 in search of it and really was one 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.609
 something that is going to be something that shows 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.829
 there for the players of the console that made 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.150
 also has good players, right? 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.600
 has good players unlike what 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.859
 many think there is is on the pc so do not 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.079
 There are a lot of people coming there and really 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:37.780
 Not a lot of people, now you have to. 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.940
 having 10,000 people playing in xbox 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.790
 no playstation 3 in case 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.900
 is this time should have 200 300 thousand 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.900
 people playing right 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.970
 it is at a time from that moment when 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.150
 the calculation of the block 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.819
 options early on had plenty of 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.900
 person playing there were about 500 thousand 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.319
 600 thousand 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.450
 That's when it was released, a lot of people were playing. 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.650
 really a nice time options stayed 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.560
 a little behind and that at the moment in 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.720
 that there were many players and everything 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.549
 but in any case it does not stop valuing 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.049
 in full because so because the last 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:15.700
 I hit hard and at last that law was caught 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.370
 as I had already mentioned by Bryan and 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.579
 this makes the people stopping as Czech 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.760
 also shows that people take a 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.860
 side pc pc gamer is also because it is 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.889
 It's really incredible that you have commitment. 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.620
 this great 60 freak solo 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.020
 and the minister is 6 sided because 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.030
 I finished chances you have that famous 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.279
 red kits in which everyone knows everything 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.499
 world certainly suffers from this kit 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:43.240
 and today it really is one thing. 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:46.870
 which is very disturbing in small varus 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.699
 pc or xbox background was generally ne 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.800
 but finally claims that they are enjoying their 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.150
 gameplay enjoying the documentary case 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.090
 Did you forget to evaluate? 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.340
