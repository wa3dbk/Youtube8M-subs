00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
to expand the hole so it's big enough to

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.490 
to expand the hole so it's big enough to
accept<00:00:46.950> one<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> adhesive<00:00:48.090> plugs<00:00:48.600> you

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
accept one of the adhesive plugs you

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
a bit of a drama but it's not as much of

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.500 
a bit of a drama but it's not as much of

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
a drama as getting out the jack and

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.960 
a drama as getting out the jack and
changing<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> tire<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.159> persevere<00:01:08.820> with

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
changing the tire so just persevere with

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.120 
changing the tire so just persevere with
that<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.420> pull<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.260> through<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.619> about<00:01:10.890> half

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
that and pull it through to about half

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.969 
that and pull it through to about half
way<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.700> little<00:01:12.600> bit<00:01:12.750> more<00:01:12.930> lubricant<00:01:13.680> because

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
way a little bit more lubricant because

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.380 
way a little bit more lubricant because
this<00:01:14.159> time<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.490> got<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.670> make<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.820> slippery

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
this time you got to make it slippery

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.999 
this time you got to make it slippery
enough<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.750> go<00:01:15.900> through<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.259> rough<00:01:16.530> hole<00:01:16.799> in

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
enough to go through that rough hole in

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.060 
enough to go through that rough hole in
the<00:01:17.100> tire<00:01:17.630> heavy<00:01:18.630> pressure<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:19.320> front<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.830> what

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
the tire heavy pressure up front is what

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.980 
the tire heavy pressure up front is what
you<00:01:20.220> need<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.729> can't<00:01:21.090> break<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.630> needle

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
you need but you can't break the needle

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.230 
you need but you can't break the needle
off<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.350> has<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.860> controlled<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:24.090> go

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
off so it has to be controlled you go

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.969 
off so it has to be controlled you go
all<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.810> way<00:01:24.960> down<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.619> end<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
all the way down to the end of the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.710 
all the way down to the end of the
collar<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.460> then<00:01:27.030> when<00:01:27.150> you're<00:01:27.270> all<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.600> way

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
collar and then when you're all the way

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.450 
collar and then when you're all the way
in<00:01:27.930> there<00:01:28.110> put<00:01:28.380> two<00:01:28.590> fingers<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> collar

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
in there put two fingers on the collar

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.950 
in there put two fingers on the collar
and<00:01:29.700> withdraw<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.090> needle<00:01:30.600> while<00:01:30.720> you're

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
and withdraw the needle while you're

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.230 
and withdraw the needle while you're
pressing<00:01:31.259> down<00:01:31.439> with<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.920> other<00:01:32.070> hand<00:01:32.340> and

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
pressing down with the other hand and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.060 
pressing down with the other hand and
that<00:01:33.360> repairs<00:01:33.780> pretty<00:01:34.079> much<00:01:34.259> air<00:01:34.470> tight<00:01:34.740> now

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
that repairs pretty much air tight now

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.100 
that repairs pretty much air tight now
and<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:35.790> tidy<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> razor

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
and you just tidy it up with a razor

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.870 
and you just tidy it up with a razor
blade<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.860> want<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.189> some<00:01:38.549> people<00:01:38.700> just

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
blade if you want to some people just

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.609 
blade if you want to some people just
let<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> abrasion<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.079> road<00:01:40.259> do<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
let the abrasion with the road do the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.230 
let the abrasion with the road do the
work<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:42.350> one<00:01:43.350> thing<00:01:43.649> missing<00:01:43.920> now<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.490> little

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
work just one thing missing now a little

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.149 
work just one thing missing now a little
bit<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.450> air<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.930> here's<00:01:46.439> some<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.770> prepared

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
bit of air and here's some we prepared

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.550 
bit of air and here's some we prepared
earlier<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> compressor<00:01:48.630> at<00:01:48.780> home<00:01:48.960> of

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
earlier in the compressor at home of

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.499 
earlier in the compressor at home of
course<00:01:49.799> at<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.310> roadside<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:51.000> need<00:01:51.270> a

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
course at the roadside you need a

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.270 
course at the roadside you need a
12-volt<00:01:52.140> compressor<00:01:52.619> connected<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
12-volt compressor connected to the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.520 
12-volt compressor connected to the
car's<00:01:53.520> battery<00:01:53.790> otherwise<00:01:54.689> doing<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> repair

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
car's battery otherwise doing the repair

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.630 
car's battery otherwise doing the repair
doesn't<00:01:55.799> really<00:01:56.159> help

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
doesn't really help

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.910 
doesn't really help
and<00:01:56.759> then<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.479> monitor<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> pressure<00:01:58.229> just

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
and then you monitor the pressure just

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.390 
and then you monitor the pressure just
to<00:01:59.009> make<00:01:59.159> sure<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.460> haven't<00:01:59.610> got<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.820> slow<00:02:00.119> link
