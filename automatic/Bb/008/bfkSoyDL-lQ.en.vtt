we've bought almost 40 machines total
and<00:01:15.460> we<00:01:16.460> just<00:01:16.670> purchased<00:01:17.140> eight<00:01:18.140> more

a<00:01:25.070> service<00:01:25.340> we've<00:01:25.640> had<00:01:25.850> is<00:01:26.030> a<00:01:26.660> big<00:01:26.960> part<00:01:27.289> the

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
a service we've had is a big part the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.749 
a service we've had is a big part the
pricing<00:01:28.670> has<00:01:28.759> been<00:01:28.910> a<00:01:28.940> good<00:01:29.840> bit<00:01:30.619> making<00:01:31.490> the

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
pricing has been a good bit making the

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.790 
pricing has been a good bit making the
decision<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.240> lot<00:01:32.360> easier<00:01:32.750> when<00:01:33.410> the<00:01:33.530> prices

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
decision a lot easier when the prices

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.580 
decision a lot easier when the prices
are<00:01:34.100> right<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.660> and<00:01:35.660> then<00:01:35.869> of<00:01:36.020> course<00:01:36.229> the

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
are right and and then of course the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.990 
are right and and then of course the
proofs<00:01:36.830> in<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.100> pudding<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.700> machines

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
proofs in the pudding and the machines

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.529 
proofs in the pudding and the machines
go<00:01:38.180> out<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:39.190> make<00:01:40.190> you<00:01:40.340> money<00:01:40.550> it's<00:01:41.119> real<00:01:41.420> easy

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
go out and make you money it's real easy

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.499 
go out and make you money it's real easy
to<00:01:41.860> stick<00:01:42.860> with<00:01:43.210> something<00:01:44.210> that's<00:01:44.330> working

to stick with something that's working

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:55.240 
to stick with something that's working
for<00:01:44.780> you
