00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.420
 I had the chance to meet 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:10.620
 the unknowns for real frankly we 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.920
 is not from the same generation 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.750
 but that's not felt must me 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.480
 I call it norman and I make 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.890
 videos so on the internet 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.590
 yes the internet we recognize the internet 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:28.980
 even in fact if there then he says 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.019
 so the computer I had their 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.239
 propose an idea of sketches we would have 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.800
 may have been able to do together and I had 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.620
 I was too scared that the guys 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.770
 react like that even if moved he is 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.820
 where the gag is what we laugh at but also 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.739
 at least thirty years of work I've never 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.000
 savored what we laugh in it 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.079
 that you want us to laugh at it for 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.489
 I was I was a little shy 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.789
 toys they were trying to 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.350
 judge 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.180
 and I was too scared to blunder 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.559
 or say something wrong and and 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.090
 finally that's exactly what happened 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.469
 past and me in the sketch I could 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.320
 make the jokes of young people and you 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:06.390
 could blacks let them 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.630
 blacks of two young people of the time a little 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.610
 hippie bins hippies 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.539
 they must hate me at once 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.130
 of the appointment he made me understand 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.530
 that they were not too much interested 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.840
 by my sketch at least that's what 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.280
 I deduced from it having seen their attitude during 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.689
 that talk to them and a moment in the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.240
 sketch we could have played all 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.289
 the four kinds of teletubbies as 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.670
 that and the end could sing 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.770
 isabelle has blue eyes but version 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:38.520
 dub step in space that's it 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:41.069
 please yeah super is super good idea 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.439
 but now finally down we remember 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:46.229
 okay you do not have my number 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.520
 No, we did not give you any good 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:56.189
 I think he will remind me 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:57.299
 never normal then come from the internet 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.500
 now that you learn for us a 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.709
 and we discovered twitter 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.240
 it keeps why we saw 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:11.310
 videos the super trendy video on 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.319

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.359
 little video the haye 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.189
 and what should I say then 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:22.950
 what do you want me to say a 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:25.170
 text to value a video at home 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.159
 but I do not necessarily go with you 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.540
 yeah that's it 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.260
 we see consciousness like that but you there 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.030

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:40.769
