00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.410
 In this video tutorial we will look at a few 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.760
 basic management tools 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.460
 objects to start with 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:19.000
 create several objects from different 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.000
 groups the first object will be a tree 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.280
 the next object will be . 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.200
 then horse 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.090
 and a small ship 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.439
 that is, as you understand the main 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.299
 the tool is an object creation and 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.810
 it is performed with the help of this 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.149
 team place yandex here this button 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.429
 then there are buttons such as mov adgex 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:24.240
 this is the movement of the object that is, if we are on 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:27.689
 press it and select the appropriate 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.349
 group then we can control the object from 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.560
 this group for example trees and plants 

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:36.420
 that is, we are now invited to choose 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.250
 any object from a group of plants and 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.020
 of trees 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:46.110
 if we choose transportation then us 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.299
 now it is proposed to work with objects 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.340
 transportation and precisely with the move 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.099
 of objects 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.299
 now we can take this object click 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:02:02.640
 left mouse button on this icon and 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:04.349
 move it where we need it 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.420
 is if we now want to move 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:09.079
 for example a horse, we cannot 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:18.450
 move it until we change the group 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:21.810
 changing the group on the character now as we 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.209
 see under the horse appeared icon undertake 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:32.489
 for the icon and move it to where 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:37.440
 we need the next tool this 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:40.280
 scaling he finds here also 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.760
 we can select the necessary object and 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.760
 resize it 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.630
 here is the same if we want to change 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.180
 size for example yacht 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:03.800
 and then we need to go to the section 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:08.680
 transportation and using scaling 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.680
 reduce the size of our object 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.490
 the next tool is moving 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:21.050
 object up and down 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:23.030
 is he here with this 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.000
 tool we can either lift the object 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.740
 either lower it now we will do 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.740
 it's from our yacht 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.600
 tool twist is he here 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.640
 also grab the know for the badge and not 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.120
 releasing the left mouse button 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.680
 turn it in the right direction 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:02.209
 there are some more icons here 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:10.060
 for example this one he turns the object 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:10.060
 on the other axis and similarly the second icon 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:24.890
 You can also return the last action 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:27.140
 take a step back unfortunately take a step back 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.180
 done only once possible at 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.510
 future versions of the program this defect 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.240
 will be fixed and now you can delete 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:41.020
 we do not need objects for this purpose 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:43.640
 select the basket tool and select the type 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.800
 objects in this case we have selected 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.580
 transport so we can safely remove 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:52.430
 our boat just click on it now 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.110
 we need to remove the barrel for this 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.350
 choose a group of objects which 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:02.960
 relate barrel this case is 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:07.010
 objects with the image of the house click on 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:11.170
 her and she disappears and naturally horse 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:17.090
 can also be removed by selecting characters and 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:18.850
 by clicking on the horse icon and the tree we 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.000
 move for this click 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.330
 moving 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.750
 type object of trees and choose our 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.750
 tree 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.830
 we covered the main tools 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.310
 work with objects see you in 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.310
 next lesson
