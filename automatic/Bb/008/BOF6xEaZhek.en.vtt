00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.629 
going to highly get nice I've got the
angel<00:03:51.010> elyria<00:03:51.549> haunted<00:03:52.299> number<00:03:53.139> one<00:03:53.410> um<00:03:53.829> it's

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
angel elyria haunted number one um it's

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.819 
angel elyria haunted number one um it's
interesting<00:03:55.180> that<00:03:55.840> I<00:03:56.139> was<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.530> little

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
interesting that I was a little

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.530 
interesting that I was a little
disappointed<00:03:56.949> in<00:03:57.519> this<00:03:57.669> is<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:58.030> whole<00:03:58.269> thing

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
disappointed in this is the whole thing

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.069 
disappointed in this is the whole thing
of<00:03:58.720> course<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:59.230> that<00:03:59.549> Illyria<00:04:00.549> is<00:04:00.970> came<00:04:01.840> into

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
of course is that Illyria is came into

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.930 
of course is that Illyria is came into
being<00:04:02.230> by<00:04:02.470> killing<00:04:02.919> bread<00:04:03.280> and<00:04:03.549> since<00:04:03.760> then

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
being by killing bread and since then

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.580 
being by killing bread and since then
she's<00:04:04.150> been<00:04:04.180> trapped<00:04:04.930> between<00:04:05.079> two<00:04:05.319> worlds

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
she's been trapped between two worlds

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.229 
she's been trapped between two worlds
and<00:04:06.069> I<00:04:06.099> guess<00:04:06.280> it<00:04:06.430> would<00:04:06.519> make<00:04:06.699> sense<00:04:06.730> that<00:04:07.090> it

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
and I guess it would make sense that it

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.640 
and I guess it would make sense that it
would<00:04:07.269> take<00:04:07.479> a<00:04:07.510> really<00:04:07.599> long<00:04:07.959> time<00:04:08.109> for<00:04:08.530> her<00:04:08.620> to

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
would take a really long time for her to

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.050 
would take a really long time for her to
come<00:04:08.919> to<00:04:08.949> grips<00:04:09.129> with<00:04:09.280> it<00:04:09.430> but<00:04:09.609> I<00:04:09.639> feel<00:04:09.940> like

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
come to grips with it but I feel like

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.640 
come to grips with it but I feel like
every<00:04:10.449> time<00:04:10.599> they<00:04:10.750> address<00:04:11.049> her<00:04:11.199> character

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
every time they address her character

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.189 
every time they address her character
they<00:04:12.099> start<00:04:12.519> her<00:04:12.699> at<00:04:12.909> the<00:04:13.120> same<00:04:13.419> spot<00:04:13.780> where

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:14.199 
they start her at the same spot where

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:15.899 
they start her at the same spot where
she's<00:04:14.440> like<00:04:14.620> I've<00:04:15.010> got<00:04:15.370> all<00:04:15.489> these<00:04:15.639> memories

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
she's like I've got all these memories

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.029 
she's like I've got all these memories
of<00:04:16.299> Fred<00:04:16.599> I<00:04:16.930> have<00:04:17.139> other<00:04:17.289> people's<00:04:17.680> memories

of Fred I have other people's memories

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.860 
of Fred I have other people's memories
of<00:04:18.190> Fred<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.760> don't<00:04:19.269> know<00:04:19.329> what<00:04:19.450> to<00:04:19.479> do<00:04:19.659> with<00:04:19.840> it

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
of Fred I don't know what to do with it

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.529 
of Fred I don't know what to do with it
lather<00:04:20.380> rinse<00:04:20.680> repeat<00:04:20.829> like<00:04:21.459> I<00:04:21.820> hope<00:04:22.360> that
