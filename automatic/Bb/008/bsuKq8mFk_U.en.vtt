00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.759
 [Music] 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.950
 and good hello to all and to all 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.700
 I hope you're fine, I'm fine 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.619
 very very good 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.090
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.670
 new crash and today we 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.519
 tackles the game need for speed revolt 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.740
 so it's November 21st, 2013 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.279
 and that's fine he's coming out today on 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.579
 pc so obviously this crash is 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.100
 already available for three days via 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.710
 the site sky euros but I waited 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.780
 until the last moment a fixed crack 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.230
 to fix the bugs 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.010
 backups et cetera and so so 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.160
 there normally 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.260
 the game works perfectly well at least 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.879
 I hope so anyway me I them 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.600
 test and it works really well 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.340
 so I invite you as usual to 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.140
 go into the description right in 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.520
 below the video where you will find so 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.670
 the different links so first of all 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.519
 you will download the microsoft software 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.670
 if you do not have it yet, 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.049
 you will go to the archived 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.340
 so who is always in the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.430
 description so you click on 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.710
 download and then you will have this 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.960
 so one of those cracks the torrent file 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.299
 and the config of the game so obviously 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.330
 I invite you to watch the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.060
 configuration to see if she 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.890
 corresponds well to that of your pc 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.810
 so that's very important otherwise you 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.729
 are not going to be able to play the game so he 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.020
 you need at least 4 gigas of ram 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.390
 so it's basic 1 4 gigas of ram 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.070
 it is absolutely minimally to 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.210
 minimum have 4 gigas of ram for 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.560
 can play a lot of games and have 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.070
 a good graphics card is very 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.590
 important 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.659
 so I let you watch then 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.490
 you have the torrent file so you 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.869
 click you double click on the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.630
 torrent file and these starts 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.320
 automatically on the software but 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.689
 croteau rent 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.399
 then you have the e2c crack so we 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.310
 will obviously extract it on our 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.840
 office like that it's done and once 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.330
 that you downloaded the game 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.330
 e once everything is done 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.069
 so we close these and you go 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.629
 so make it on the game folder so 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.750
 me it is in the folder 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.150
 downloads so usually and get 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.220
 find here so I have already opened for 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.910
 to make you watch and we go all 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.190
 simply slipped so the crack in 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.980
 so we have two applications and 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.750
 extension of the application so we will 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.709
 who knows this in we do move 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.890
 replace and now you have 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.720
 the game in your possession so when 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.680
 you could see it you have two 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:54.540
 applications so the application nf s 14 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:57.299
 and nfs 14 shot low x86 so what are 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.129
 the berliet differences that's all 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.660
 simply that the first is the 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.569
 32-bit version and second this is the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.620
 64-bit version so you're going to look 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.970
 on your config 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.860
 what is your number of bits me it's 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.709
 what it seems to me so I'm going 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.670
 take this one and we will create a 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.510
 shortcut on the desktop 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.870
 so sent to the shortcuts here so 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.459
 you can rename it for its phase 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.160
 even better so you need name 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.380
 for speed revolt for good you there 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.109
 find out so is on the desk so 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.720
 you just have to double click on it 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.310
 and the game will run normally 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.500
 automatically so obviously if 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.900
 you are asked to connect to 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.400
 origin you do it that's very 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.680
 important otherwise you can not play at 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.130
 game if you do not ask what 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.010
 might happen 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.910
 and well you can throw I 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.050
 automatically you create a 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.540
 account 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.700
 nor do you put anything 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.320
 you want it's just to gauge 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.820
 do not care did not put your true 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.020
 original account otherwise you risk 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.790
 to have trouble 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.180
 it's a crack you must not forget it 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.300
 you can be banned and there 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.720
 it would be a shame to lose all your 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.600
 new stadiums 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.840
 if you play some games that 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.460
 contains origins so that's it's a 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.519
 advice that I give you so created a 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.170
 other account origin 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.580
 this is then for the patch and do I 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.950
 put that in the description so you 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.420
 install it and it's very simple you do not 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.780
 so put in this folder there at 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.400
 when you will choose the 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.570
 destination folder I explain to you 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.550
 not how to do it because I already have 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.380
 explained for the other patches that's 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.840
 exactly the same thing so I you 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.490

 not at all with google + it's really 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.420
 the mess 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.500
 finally me this is my opinion after you game 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.670
 if I do not know what you think 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.990

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.440
 after this video there so I'm going to 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.320
 put on my secondary chain so 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.030
 it's a gameplay in cades ouzou where 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.060
 I made more than fifty frag so 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:30.030
 you will see I realized a good 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.260
 gameplay is so do not hesitate to go 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.720
 to see it so I would put it in 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.270
 annotations on the video so that's it 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.920
 have finished when we are very 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.270
 so normally the next crash 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.520
 these murders 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:45.510

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.240
 I do not do it today all 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:51.420
 simply because I had a problem with 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:55.050
 level of a torrent the torrent 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:58.020

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.760
