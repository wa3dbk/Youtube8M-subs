the robot mode you say we're not going
to<00:01:08.290> focus<00:01:08.440> too<00:01:08.619> heavily<00:01:09.369> on<00:01:09.630> everything<00:01:10.630> else

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
to focus too heavily on everything else

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.670 
to focus too heavily on everything else
and<00:01:11.290> get<00:01:11.409> the<00:01:11.560> arms<00:01:11.860> out<00:01:13.109> extend<00:01:14.109> this<00:01:14.200> out

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
bottom first otherwise it will fly off

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.760 
bottom first otherwise it will fly off
like<00:01:20.049> it<00:01:20.200> just<00:01:20.380> did<00:01:20.590> to<00:01:21.250> me<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.960> hopefully<00:01:23.530> you

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770

will<00:01:23.859> be<00:01:23.979> able<00:01:24.159> to<00:01:24.340> find<00:01:24.609> it

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
will be able to find it

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.560 
will be able to find it
flip<00:01:25.689> the<00:01:25.780> legs<00:01:25.929> down<00:01:26.820> split<00:01:27.820> them<00:01:27.969> come<00:01:28.509> on

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
flip the legs down split them come on

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:40.649 
flip the legs down split them come on
here<00:01:29.579> get<00:01:30.579> the<00:01:30.670> feet<00:01:30.880> out<00:01:38.340> now<00:01:39.340> he<00:01:39.399> is<00:01:39.579> like<00:01:40.570> a

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
here get the feet out now he is like a

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:41.999 
here get the feet out now he is like a
sudden<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:40.929> original<00:01:41.259> line<00:01:41.409> he<00:01:41.619> wasn't<00:01:41.920> just

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
sudden the original line he wasn't just

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.569 
sudden the original line he wasn't just
a<00:01:42.159> straight<00:01:42.579> repaint<00:01:42.999> of<00:01:43.119> sideswipe<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
a straight repaint of sideswipe the

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.300 
a straight repaint of sideswipe the
white<00:01:46.119> bar<00:01:46.359> and<00:01:46.869> that's<00:01:47.289> such<00:01:47.619> maybe<00:01:48.070> to<00:01:48.219> all

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
white bar and that's such maybe to all

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.130 
white bar and that's such maybe to all
moderate<00:01:48.700> like<00:01:49.299> I<00:01:49.390> do<00:01:49.450> with<00:01:49.659> my<00:01:49.780> side<00:01:49.960> so<00:01:50.079> I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
moderate like I do with my side so I

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.539 
moderate like I do with my side so I
figure<00:01:50.409> I<00:01:50.469> could<00:01:50.560> transform<00:01:51.070> his<00:01:51.249> legs<00:01:51.399> like

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
figure I could transform his legs like

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.819 
figure I could transform his legs like
this<00:01:51.759> but<00:01:52.600> just<00:01:52.840> to<00:01:53.319> give<00:01:53.439> him<00:01:53.499> a<00:01:53.560> little<00:01:53.679> bit

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
this but just to give him a little bit

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.160 
this but just to give him a little bit
of<00:01:53.920> physical<00:01:54.609> difference<00:01:54.969> from<00:01:55.170> sideswipe

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
of physical difference from sideswipe

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.649 
of physical difference from sideswipe
and<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:57.549> red<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:57.850> white<00:01:57.999> really<00:01:58.210> looks<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.539> lot

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
and the red and white really looks a lot

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.359 
and the red and white really looks a lot
better<00:01:58.810> on<00:01:59.499> the<00:01:59.619> front<00:01:59.829> of<00:01:59.890> his<00:01:59.979> legs<00:02:00.159> I<00:02:00.310> think

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
better on the front of his legs I think

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.370 
better on the front of his legs I think
I'll<00:02:01.149> go<00:02:01.420> ahead<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.719> transform<00:02:02.200> his<00:02:02.350> life

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
I'll go ahead and transform his life

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.300 
I'll go ahead and transform his life
like<00:02:02.679> that<00:02:03.240> I'm<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.420> top<00:02:04.630> part<00:02:04.840> you<00:02:04.990> want<00:02:05.140> to

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
like that I'm a top part you want to

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.040 
like that I'm a top part you want to
pull<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.399> arms<00:02:06.729> out<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:07.810> around<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.899> really

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
pull the arms out and around you really

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.840 
pull the arms out and around you really
want<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.260> make<00:02:11.350> sure<00:02:11.500> this<00:02:11.650> rotates<00:02:12.190> back<00:02:12.610> to

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
want to make sure this rotates back to

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.580 
want to make sure this rotates back to
the<00:02:12.940> back<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.480> underside<00:02:14.610> look<00:02:15.610> at<00:02:15.730> that

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
the back of the underside look at that

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.559 
the back of the underside look at that
so<00:02:17.590> it's<00:02:17.680> pointing<00:02:17.980> down<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.849> if<00:02:19.239> you<00:02:19.360> have

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
so it's pointing down and if you have

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.119 
so it's pointing down and if you have
the<00:02:19.690> hood<00:02:19.959> vertically<00:02:20.650> like<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:20.860> would<00:02:20.950> be<00:02:20.980> in

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
the hood vertically like it would be in

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.360 
the hood vertically like it would be in

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
the arm joint here pointing down so

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.160 
the arm joint here pointing down so
swivel<00:02:27.799> is<00:02:27.950> on<00:02:28.129> there<00:02:28.370> we<00:02:28.430> go<00:02:28.549> just<00:02:28.580> like<00:02:28.760> that

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
swivel is on there we go just like that

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.369 
swivel is on there we go just like that
flip<00:02:30.170> up<00:02:30.349> the<00:02:30.500> bumper<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.780> slide<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.260> whole

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
chest panel down just pulled up all the

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.850 
chest panel down just pulled up all the
way

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.660 

snap<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:39.980> into<00:02:40.069> place

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
snap it into place

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.479 
snap it into place
I<00:02:40.700> have<00:02:41.209> noticed<00:02:41.360> like<00:02:41.599> this<00:02:41.720> is<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.930> one<00:02:42.489> area

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
I have noticed like this is the one area

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.920 
I have noticed like this is the one area
there<00:02:43.760> we<00:02:43.819> go<00:02:43.940> just<00:02:44.150> getting<00:02:44.569> that<00:02:44.629> snapped

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
there we go just getting that snapped

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.690 
there we go just getting that snapped
into<00:02:45.079> place<00:02:45.140> for<00:02:46.040> some<00:02:46.220> reason<00:02:46.489> on<00:02:46.579> this

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
into place for some reason on this

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.839 
into place for some reason on this
version<00:02:46.879> gives<00:02:47.120> me<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.390> little<00:02:47.540> bit<00:02:47.659> trouble

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
version gives me a little bit trouble

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.690 
version gives me a little bit trouble
but<00:02:49.849> again<00:02:50.060> this<00:02:50.150> mole<00:02:50.360> has<00:02:50.569> been<00:02:50.750> used

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
but again this mole has been used

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.940 
but again this mole has been used
several<00:02:52.700> times<00:02:53.030> now<00:02:53.299> and<00:02:53.870> I<00:02:54.200> got<00:02:54.349> a<00:02:54.379> sake<00:02:54.709> All

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
several times now and I got a sake All

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.520 
several times now and I got a sake All
Things<00:02:55.310> Considered<00:02:56.019> it's<00:02:57.019> holding<00:02:57.349> up<00:02:57.500> very

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
Things Considered it's holding up very

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:05.229 
Things Considered it's holding up very
well<00:02:58.989> this<00:03:00.790> stay<00:03:03.489> then<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.579> arm<00:03:04.760> piece<00:03:05.030> when<00:03:05.209> I

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
well this stay then the arm piece when I

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.039 
well this stay then the arm piece when I
bring<00:03:05.359> around<00:03:05.690> rotate<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.560> doors<00:03:06.769> around

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
bring around rotate the doors around

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:18.449 
bring around rotate the doors around
just<00:03:09.049> like<00:03:09.170> that<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:12.560> do<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.769> same<00:03:12.980> over<00:03:13.129> here

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.399 

and<00:03:19.459> then<00:03:20.269> you<00:03:20.390> just<00:03:20.420> rotate<00:03:20.900> this<00:03:21.019> whole<00:03:21.200> back

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
and then you just rotate this whole back

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.430 
and then you just rotate this whole back
piece<00:03:22.299> and<00:03:23.299> that<00:03:23.420> will<00:03:23.569> raise<00:03:23.780> his<00:03:24.079> head<00:03:24.290> up

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
piece and that will raise his head up

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.110 
piece and that will raise his head up
now<00:03:24.829> he<00:03:24.890> does<00:03:25.069> have<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.340> black<00:03:25.579> helmet<00:03:25.970> as

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
now he does have the black helmet as

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.530 
now he does have the black helmet as
opposed<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.599> the<00:03:27.459> more<00:03:28.459> classic<00:03:29.000> red<00:03:29.180> helmet

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
opposed to the more classic red helmet

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.199 
opposed to the more classic red helmet
the<00:03:29.870> hanky<00:03:30.139> version<00:03:30.440> had<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.680> red<00:03:30.799> helmet<00:03:31.209> but

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
the hanky version had the red helmet but

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.479 
the hanky version had the red helmet but
the<00:03:32.359> generations<00:03:33.109> version<00:03:33.380> has<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.560> pretty

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
the generations version has the pretty

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.089 
the generations version has the pretty
much<00:03:34.609> just<00:03:34.760> sideswipes<00:03:35.209> head<00:03:35.419> just<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.690> black

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
much just sideswipes head just the black

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.000 
much just sideswipes head just the black
plastic<00:03:37.099> helmet<00:03:38.590> but<00:03:39.590> it<00:03:39.650> looks<00:03:39.799> pretty<00:03:39.889> good

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
plastic helmet but it looks pretty good

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.360 
plastic helmet but it looks pretty good
and<00:03:40.760> again<00:03:40.940> you<00:03:41.090> can<00:03:41.739> do<00:03:42.739> all<00:03:42.889> the<00:03:43.040> things<00:03:43.069> you

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
and again you can do all the things you

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.559 
and again you can do all the things you
can<00:03:43.489> do<00:03:43.639> with<00:03:43.790> all<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.030> other<00:03:44.150> versions<00:03:44.480> of

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
can do with all the other versions of

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.809 
can do with all the other versions of
the<00:03:44.660> mold<00:03:44.870> this<00:03:45.109> gun<00:03:45.349> can<00:03:45.620> plug<00:03:46.280> in<00:03:46.430> up<00:03:46.549> here<00:03:46.609> on

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
the mold this gun can plug in up here on

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.220 
the mold this gun can plug in up here on
his<00:03:46.940> shoulder<00:03:47.329> as<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.480> shoulder<00:03:47.840> cannon<00:03:48.139> which

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
his shoulder as a shoulder cannon which

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.199 
his shoulder as a shoulder cannon which
is<00:03:48.349> probably<00:03:48.650> how<00:03:48.769> I'll<00:03:48.919> display<00:03:49.310> it<00:03:49.430> he<00:03:50.090> can

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
is probably how I'll display it he can

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.150 
is probably how I'll display it he can
hold<00:03:50.329> it<00:03:50.450> in<00:03:50.540> his<00:03:50.629> hand<00:03:50.840> as<00:03:50.959> a<00:03:50.989> gun<00:03:51.230> this<00:03:51.919> can

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
hold it in his hand as a gun this can

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.849 
hold it in his hand as a gun this can
clip<00:03:52.370> onto<00:03:52.519> his<00:03:52.760> back<00:03:52.970> as<00:03:53.209> a<00:03:53.239> jet<00:03:53.569> pack<00:03:53.780> if<00:03:54.319> you

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
clip onto his back as a jet pack if you

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.390 
clip onto his back as a jet pack if you
want<00:03:55.129> you<00:03:55.730> can<00:03:55.849> clip<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:56.239> around<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:58.069> gun<00:03:58.250> if

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
want you can clip it around the gun if

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.520 
want you can clip it around the gun if
you<00:03:58.489> can<00:03:58.609> get<00:03:58.790> it<00:03:58.879> to<00:03:58.970> work<00:03:59.150> and<00:03:59.419> hold<00:04:00.079> it

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
you can get it to work and hold it

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.009 
you can get it to work and hold it
doesn't<00:04:00.799> hold<00:04:00.919> very<00:04:01.190> well<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:01.370> found<00:04:01.810> you<00:04:02.810> can't

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
doesn't hold very well I found you can't

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
really had that gun hold together well

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.509 
really had that gun hold together well
even<00:04:18.320> though<00:04:18.410> it<00:04:18.530> claims<00:04:18.799> it's<00:04:19.130> supposed<00:04:19.430> to

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
even though it claims it's supposed to

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.220 
even though it claims it's supposed to
be<00:04:19.609> able<00:04:19.729> to

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.470 

but<00:04:24.950> probably<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.370> like<00:04:25.670> I<00:04:25.820> gotta<00:04:26.030> mostly<00:04:26.390> to

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
but probably the like I gotta mostly to

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.420 
but probably the like I gotta mostly to
go<00:04:26.600> with<00:04:26.720> my<00:04:27.490> inferno<00:04:28.490> they<00:04:28.910> can<00:04:29.030> team<00:04:29.240> up<00:04:30.430> but

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
go with my inferno they can team up but

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.650 
go with my inferno they can team up but
you<00:04:31.520> have<00:04:31.550> hopefully<00:04:31.850> the<00:04:32.090> last<00:04:32.240> versions

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
you have hopefully the last versions

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.730 
you have hopefully the last versions
there's<00:04:32.810> no<00:04:32.930> Hold'em<00:04:33.200> could<00:04:33.380> be<00:04:33.560> in<00:04:33.650> the

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
there's no Hold'em could be in the

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.990 
there's no Hold'em could be in the
binding<00:04:34.040> because<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:34.250> have<00:04:34.490> several<00:04:34.820> versions

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
binding because I have several versions

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.780 
binding because I have several versions
of<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:35.330> already<00:04:35.510> but<00:04:36.470> overall<00:04:37.460> not<00:04:37.640> a<00:04:37.700> bad

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
of it already but overall not a bad

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.970 
of it already but overall not a bad
figure<00:04:38.120> it<00:04:38.300> really<00:04:38.660> is<00:04:38.810> he<00:04:39.380> said<00:04:39.530> it's<00:04:39.680> a<00:04:39.740> lot

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
figure it really is he said it's a lot

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.820 
figure it really is he said it's a lot
sturdier<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:41.020> solid<00:04:42.020> than<00:04:42.170> I<00:04:42.260> expected

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
sturdier and solid than I expected

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.770 
sturdier and solid than I expected

has<00:04:44.930> and<00:04:45.470> it<00:04:45.770> just<00:04:45.920> really<00:04:46.160> isn't<00:04:46.340> a<00:04:46.610> lot<00:04:46.760> more

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940
