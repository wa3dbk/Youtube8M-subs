00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
creating a square pattern just here and

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.290 
creating a square pattern just here and
it's<00:00:17.100> going<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.310> be<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.550> base<00:00:17.730> for<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.090> rest

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
it's going to be the base for the rest

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.260 
it's going to be the base for the rest
of<00:00:18.420> our<00:00:18.539> style<00:00:18.949> so<00:00:19.949> just<00:00:20.250> take<00:00:20.460> small<00:00:21.119> little

we're<00:00:24.689> just<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.140> backcomb<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:26.010> creating

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
we're just going to backcomb it creating

we're just going to backcomb it creating
as<00:00:26.550> much<00:00:26.789> height<00:00:27.119> as<00:00:27.630> much<00:00:27.960> base<00:00:28.289> as<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:29.070> can

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
as much height as much base as we can

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.010 
as much height as much base as we can
there's<00:00:31.859> many<00:00:32.130> ways<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.579> backcombing<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.870> is

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
tightly packed and create a lot of root

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.420 
tightly packed and create a lot of root
left<00:00:38.129> here<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:39.379> get<00:00:40.379> working<00:00:40.800> through<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.190> top

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430

left here to get working through the top
section

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.130 

there<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.670> go<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.660> have<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> background

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
there we go so we have a background

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.139 
there we go so we have a background
section<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.890> at<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.160> top<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.850> what<00:00:51.000> we're

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
section just at the top so what we're

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.299 
section just at the top so what we're
going<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> do<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:52.470> bring<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.010> forward

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
going to do is just bring this forward

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.880 
going to do is just bring this forward
and<00:00:53.640> start<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.149> roll<00:00:54.449> back<00:00:54.530> this<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.680> going<00:00:55.800> to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
and start to roll back this is going to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.450 
and start to roll back this is going to
give<00:00:56.010> us<00:00:56.040> root<00:00:56.370> lift<00:00:56.610> more<00:00:57.480> height<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.460> help

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
give us root lift more height and help

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.549 
give us root lift more height and help
it<00:00:59.610> sit<00:00:59.820> higher<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.360> head<00:01:00.540> I'm<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.500> to

going to wrap the hair up over the head
just<00:01:23.550> back<00:01:23.759> home<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.180> little<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> roots

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
just back home in a little of the roots

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.760 
just back home in a little of the roots
to<00:01:24.960> give<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.259> some<00:01:25.440> support<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:27.560> we<00:01:28.560> just

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
to give it some support and we just

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.219 
to give it some support and we just
missed<00:01:29.009> at<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> roots<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.080> throughout<00:01:31.080> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229

missed at the roots and throughout the
top<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:34.200> then<00:01:34.890> we're<00:01:35.039> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.190> wrap<00:01:35.369> this

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
top and then we're going to wrap this

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.160 
top and then we're going to wrap this
around<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:38.820> pin<00:01:39.060> now<00:01:39.899> we're<00:01:40.020> going<00:01:40.110> to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
around and just pin now we're going to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.620 
around and just pin now we're going to
repeat<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:40.590> process<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:41.130> side<00:01:41.369> just<00:01:42.360> take<00:01:42.600> a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
repeat the process this side just take a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.550 
repeat the process this side just take a
small<00:01:42.929> section<00:01:44.869> backcomb<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> roots<00:01:46.229> and

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
small section backcomb the roots and

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.240 
small section backcomb the roots and
once<00:01:47.250> again<00:01:47.399> free<00:01:48.090> sold<00:01:48.770> just<00:01:49.770> keep<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.159> in

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
once again free sold just keep it in

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.190 
once again free sold just keep it in
place<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:51.050> wrap<00:01:52.050> this<00:01:52.229> around<00:01:52.289> and<00:01:53.479> pin<00:01:54.479> into

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
place and wrap this around and pin into

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.260 
place and wrap this around and pin into
the<00:01:55.229> base<00:01:55.640> so<00:01:56.640> as<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.789> can<00:01:56.910> see<00:01:57.119> we're

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
the base so as you can see we're

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.570 
the base so as you can see we're
starting<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.690> build<00:01:57.869> up<00:01:58.050> a<00:01:58.200> high<00:01:58.410> shape<00:01:58.830> we're

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
starting to build up a high shape we're

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.979 
starting to build up a high shape we're
now<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.970> start<00:02:00.179> to<00:02:00.300> build<00:02:00.479> shape<00:02:00.780> at<00:02:00.959> the

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:00.989 
now going to start to build shape at the

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:03.979 
now going to start to build shape at the
front<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.470> head<00:02:02.390> this<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.539> where<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:03.810> can

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:03.989 
front of the head this is where you can

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:05.900 
front of the head this is where you can
start<00:02:04.349> to<00:02:04.470> choose<00:02:04.800> what<00:02:05.039> direction<00:02:05.459> and<00:02:05.819> how

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
start to choose what direction and how

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.699 
start to choose what direction and how
