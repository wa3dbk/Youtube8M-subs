 ah eme slept power 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.449
 19 songs hi my name is gender in weight and 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.660
 I'm the lead engineer for watch dogs 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.660
 modeling 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.320
 during the last year of work we 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.930
 worked closely with the company nvidia 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.629
 to make an image of chicago in the bye version 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.870
 watch dogs as alive as possible 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.550
 exciting one of the technologies 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.960
 made it possible to achieve this quality 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.960
 be a plus algorithms 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.540
 ambient occlusion or global model 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.250
 changes this technology which 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.489
 responsible for correct lighting 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.830
 object in the scenes it allows you to create 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.229
 patchy shadows that give 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.490
 pictures depth 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.940
 there are different algorithms and ambient 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.310
 surrounded by already be a + development and nvidia 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.080
 improves clarity of quality and 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.500
 shadow depth and at the same time reduce 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.600
 load on the graphics subsystem 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.700
 the stove plus works three times faster than 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.180
 other algorithms and use the latest 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.130
 direct x 11 technology to boost 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.720
 drill down and improve overall quality 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.060
 pictures in the game watch dogs 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.780
 we also used more on technology 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.580
 nvidia smoothing cupcakes and this is new 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.590
 technique that fights flicker 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.200
 borders of small objects when moving 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.360
 cameras in the game in dynamic scenes 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.740
 text and reduces visual noise from 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.710
 flicker contours of houses 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.539
 wires of grass and trees picture 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.660
 getting softer so we 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.399
 accustomed to seeing her films exactly these 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.140
 exclusive lighting technology 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.050
 anti-aliasing as well as many others 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.490
 tools allowed us to create 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.920
 exciting beautiful version of the game watch 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.270
 dogs dpk 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.039
 working with and nvidia we sought to 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.660
 so that gamers can really 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.670
 enjoy the most realistic and 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.709
 visually appealing world of 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.770
 ever created such a city 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.750
 winds you have never seen before 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.069
 hope you enjoyed this video before 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.069
