stress test of course I could control it

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.479 
stress test of course I could control it
by<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> keypad<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.440> twin<00:00:52.800> controller

by the keypad on the twin controller
that's<00:00:53.790> a<00:00:54.149> pain<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.320> alternative<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.190> use

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
that's a pain the alternative is to use

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.460 
that's a pain the alternative is to use
the<00:00:56.610> tone<00:00:56.850> control<00:00:57.360> which<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.050> rather<00:00:58.320> a

a vertical or horizontal position if I
choose<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.940> selection<00:02:11.330> view<00:02:12.430> then<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.610> can

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
choose the selection view then I can

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.720 
choose the selection view then I can
actually<00:02:13.910> activate<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:15.560> turntable<00:02:16.310> also

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
actually activate the turntable also

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.960 
actually activate the turntable also
from<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.709> switchboard<00:02:18.709> diagram<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.610> again

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
from the switchboard diagram and again

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.750 
from the switchboard diagram and again
it's<00:02:20.239> reflected<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.430> turntable<00:02:22.430> window

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
it's reflected in the turntable window

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.610 
it's reflected in the turntable window
over<00:02:23.180> on<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.390> right-hand<00:02:23.840> side

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.559 

but<00:02:28.190> all<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.549> this<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.909> course<00:02:28.940> have<00:02:29.269> got<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.480> be

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
but all of this of course have got to be

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.690 
but all of this of course have got to be
set<00:02:29.810> up<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.319> it's<00:02:30.799> done<00:02:31.010> through<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.250> dialog

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
set up and it's done through a dialog

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.479 
set up and it's done through a dialog
box<00:02:32.049> double<00:02:33.049> clicking<00:02:33.290> on<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.650> symbol<00:02:33.860> brings

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
box double clicking on the symbol brings

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.100 
box double clicking on the symbol brings
up<00:02:34.790> this<00:02:35.739> here<00:02:36.739> we<00:02:36.890> can<00:02:37.069> name<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:38.110> turntable

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
up this here we can name the turntable

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.350 
up this here we can name the turntable
itself<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.860> also<00:02:40.190> match<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.700> rotation

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
itself and also match the rotation

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.319 
itself and also match the rotation
period<00:02:41.629> so<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.290> matches<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.650> window<00:02:43.180> we<00:02:44.180> can

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
period so it matches the window we can

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.420 
period so it matches the window we can
also<00:02:44.569> obviously<00:02:44.989> add<00:02:45.409> the<00:02:45.680> address<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.400> that

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
also obviously add the address so that

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.270 
also obviously add the address so that
the<00:02:46.760> controller<00:02:47.540> knows<00:02:47.810> what<00:02:48.049> to<00:02:48.290> manipulate

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
the controller knows what to manipulate

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.759 
the controller knows what to manipulate
and<00:02:49.670> here<00:02:50.390> we<00:02:50.540> see<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.780> representation<00:02:51.650> on<00:02:51.739> the

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
and here we see a representation on the

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.530 
and here we see a representation on the
left<00:02:52.040> hand<00:02:52.250> side<00:02:52.549> of<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.909> turntable<00:02:53.450> itself

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
left hand side of the turntable itself

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.369 
left hand side of the turntable itself
completely<00:02:54.500> bridge<00:02:54.980> amount<00:02:55.340> possible<00:02:56.379> now

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
completely bridge amount possible now

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.699 
completely bridge amount possible now
we'll<00:02:57.650> match<00:02:57.829> in<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.840> graphical<00:02:59.840> information

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
we'll match in the graphical information
