00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.290
 good day 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.840

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:34.739
 she has and say crossroad with the street 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.190
 Eurasia now means I'm not yet 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.530
 yielded a newspaper on stage and on April 8 at 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:48.620
 April 8 for five years this 4 April 10 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:51.620
 the authorities have finally deigned to draw 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.620
 markup 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.460
 Now I can say that I wanted to take 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:08.580
 and piled out 1 will draw it 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.650
 markup it say c20xe covenants to 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.660
 we both went out and did well 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.040
 see something my phone 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.730
 bugged whether 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.990
 power has some kind of image not like 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:24.450
 and I have yet to here markup 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.510
 right will be held naturally 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.760
 conspire on marking done not 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.010
 believe it is from the crossroads 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:37.260
 very close to where the car is 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:42.479
 channel consists thumbs literally literally 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:46.440
 50 meters from the crossroads 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.960
 so that the drivers of the city of Uralsk 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:54.170
 now they will know the diagonal 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.170
 stop sign here we see that 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:05.189
 markup you know i am clean and in fact 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:10.160
 not on one line ie if 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:12.670
 see what the sign is behind 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.099
 markup 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.140
 I now do not know how to do it I you 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.170
 pissed off 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.470
 in fact, here is this sign that he stop 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.849
 a violation has been established must stand 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:31.050
 before color or her they get cosmetics or 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.610
 we see here that in fact 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.670
 no such smart crossroads 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.800
 preoccupied road safety 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.660
 movements from just understand this power 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.470
 just making money on your own 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.489
 okay citizens at least one 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.690
 but no less a mistake corrected here 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:56.160
 We do not see that in addition to this set 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:02.140
 put additional text 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:08.470
 stopwatch he froze welding it was 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:12.040
 after my first reporting okay 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.189
