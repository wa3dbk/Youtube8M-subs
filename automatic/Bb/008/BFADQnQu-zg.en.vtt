00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.889 
and lows in the process of weight loss
there<00:00:40.649> are<00:00:40.890> chances<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.730> after<00:00:42.390> one<00:00:42.660> year

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
there are chances that after one year

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.139 
there are chances that after one year
the<00:00:43.050> patient<00:00:43.500> may<00:00:43.620> start<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.190> slowly<00:00:44.460> gain<00:00:44.879> all

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
the patient may start to slowly gain all

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.080 
the patient may start to slowly gain all
the<00:00:45.450> weight<00:00:45.600> which<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.020> lost<00:00:46.489> this<00:00:47.489> shows<00:00:47.820> that

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the weight which is lost this shows that

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.910 
the weight which is lost this shows that
the<00:00:48.480> patients<00:00:48.989> are<00:00:49.110> taking<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.620> more<00:00:49.860> calories

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
the patients are taking in more calories

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.490 
the patients are taking in more calories
and<00:00:50.760> carbohydrates<00:00:51.120> than<00:00:51.809> allowed<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.350> is

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
and carbohydrates than allowed and is

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.319 
and carbohydrates than allowed and is
not<00:00:52.710> compensating<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.699> with<00:00:53.850> required

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
not compensating it with required

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.260 
not compensating it with required
exercise<00:00:55.550> therefore<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.640> will<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.910> better<00:00:57.149> for

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
exercise therefore it will be better for

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.240 
exercise therefore it will be better for
them<00:00:57.629> if<00:00:57.840> they<00:00:58.289> could<00:00:58.500> stick<00:00:58.800> with<00:00:58.829> the
