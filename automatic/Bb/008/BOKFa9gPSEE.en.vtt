00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
 A player who can take points that I want to aim at 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.589
 Greetings to all the fans of the training ground 31 player candidates 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.549
 is 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:09.859
 Near the body 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:11.829
 There is no Tsukuba circuit 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:14.639
 In auto race specification product 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:15.679
 next year 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.890
 Towards June's tv 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.989
 Trained hard 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:22.989
 We have seen tomorrow's star player 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.140
 In the debut game 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.180
 I will do my best so that I can run to meet my expectations 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.079
 Fans 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.100
 A warm voice 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.100
 Thank you in advance 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.840
 I had my eldest son now 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.190
 Greetings from fans 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.190
 cute 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.060
 There is also an angle of greetings with Furano-san, both of which are successful 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.720
 tax included 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.630
 I have it 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.660
 It is a practice match on this day 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.280
 I do not know whether it is every day, but at the beginning 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.280
 What is that 2 way of greetings 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.540
 Out of base 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.640
 When you win, it's a bad way to align 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.860
 I think I will learn something even though I do 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.130
 In the box 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.890
 There is also a female player candidate, but Sanuki Club 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.980
 The left side of the second column on the left side of the screen is a female player 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.320
 Do you think that you are a candidate student? 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.810
 It is l place 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.810
 This book is so 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.290
 Until now at the Golden Toe Number Party 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.650
 It is said that it will be the first female player born in 40 years 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.710
 I like it but I want to cover it in the interview 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.009
 Even though being led by the morning of the day for high, it is riding 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.979
 31 players who saw the state of the candidate- 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.189
 It will be quite encouraging for the personality, but it will be 7 days 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.079
 Rather than feeling in detail with such things, it is easy to partition after participating 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.300
 If you do not have many things to absorb before Eri other 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.290
 Trace I'm not going to stand 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.269
 The partnership will also be debut next year from now 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:10.759
 It is 31 for eight years
