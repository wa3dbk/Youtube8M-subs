butter on medium low heat and I waited

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.969 
butter on medium low heat and I waited
for<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.509> completely<00:01:34.140> melt<00:01:34.350> down<00:01:34.650> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
for that to completely melt down and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.160 
for that to completely melt down and
then<00:01:35.579> once<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.119> was<00:01:36.420> finished<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.140> was

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
then once that was finished it was

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.830 
then once that was finished it was
completely<00:01:37.560> melted<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.130> took<00:01:38.220> same<00:01:38.670> red<00:01:39.329> food

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
completely melted I took same red food

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.429 
completely melted I took same red food
coloring<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.909> guess<00:01:41.909> what<00:01:42.180> made<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.020> red

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
coloring and guess what made it red

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.410 
coloring and guess what made it red
because<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:44.340> really<00:01:44.640> hard<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.880> get<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.270> be

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
because it's really hard to get it to be

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.740 
because it's really hard to get it to be
a<00:01:45.890> pink
