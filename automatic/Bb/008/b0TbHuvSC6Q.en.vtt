00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
obscure I think so I'm gonna put the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.350 
obscure I think so I'm gonna put the
usage<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> spell<00:00:47.489> normally<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
usage for the spell normally on the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.930
