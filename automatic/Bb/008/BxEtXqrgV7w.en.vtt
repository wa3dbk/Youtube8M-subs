00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
and the breathability of the gears is

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.170 
and the breathability of the gears is
unbelievable<00:00:32.460> I'm<00:00:33.460> looking<00:00:33.640> forward<00:00:34.030> to

getting this stuff in the summer and I

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.900 
getting this stuff in the summer and I
don't<00:00:35.860> know<00:00:35.950> not<00:00:36.160> not<00:00:36.370> getting<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:36.730> heat

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
don't know not not getting the heat

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.310 
don't know not not getting the heat
trapped<00:00:37.180> in<00:00:37.390> and<00:00:37.570> not<00:00:37.660> having<00:00:37.840> to<00:00:37.930> deal<00:00:38.140> with<00:00:38.170> a

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
trapped in and not having to deal with a

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.849 
trapped in and not having to deal with a
pant<00:00:38.649> and<00:00:38.920> a<00:00:39.280> set<00:00:39.820> of<00:00:39.969> a<00:00:40.539> jersey<00:00:41.230> that<00:00:41.379> is<00:00:41.530> that

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
pant and a set of a jersey that is that

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.099 
pant and a set of a jersey that is that
is<00:00:42.010> too<00:00:42.579> heavy<00:00:42.789> so<00:00:43.210> I<00:00:43.480> guess<00:00:43.690> we<00:00:43.840> can<00:00:43.960> talk

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109 
is too heavy so I guess we can talk

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:45.720 
is too heavy so I guess we can talk
about<00:00:44.260> a<00:00:44.379> little<00:00:44.559> bit<00:00:44.680> of<00:00:44.859> those<00:00:44.980> features<00:00:45.399> and

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
about a little bit of those features and

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.240 
about a little bit of those features and
and<00:00:45.910> kind<00:00:46.570> of<00:00:46.600> go<00:00:46.719> from<00:00:46.840> there<00:00:47.109> the<00:00:47.410> knee<00:00:47.620> what

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
and kind of go from there the knee what

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.040 
and kind of go from there the knee what
I<00:00:48.280> like<00:00:48.519> about<00:00:48.550> the<00:00:48.850> knees<00:00:49.030> is<00:00:49.359> that<00:00:49.780> it<00:00:49.930> is

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
I like about the knees is that it is

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.439 
I like about the knees is that it is
pretty<00:00:50.440> low<00:00:50.649> profile<00:00:51.100> knee<00:00:51.309> there's<00:00:52.269> not<00:00:52.420> a

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
pretty low profile knee there's not a

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.470 
pretty low profile knee there's not a
ton<00:00:52.750> of<00:00:52.809> leather<00:00:53.519> but<00:00:54.519> there's<00:00:55.030> just<00:00:55.090> enough

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
ton of leather but there's just enough

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.810 
ton of leather but there's just enough
to<00:00:55.690> be<00:00:56.469> a<00:00:56.500> little<00:00:56.890> bit<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:57.129> a<00:00:57.190> burn<00:00:57.339> guard<00:00:57.640> and

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
to be a little bit of a burn guard and

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.229 
to be a little bit of a burn guard and
also<00:00:58.089> it's<00:00:58.269> a<00:00:58.329> fitted<00:00:58.719> knee<00:01:00.089> being<00:01:01.089> that<00:01:01.179> it's

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
also it's a fitted knee being that it's

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.619 
also it's a fitted knee being that it's
made<00:01:01.660> that<00:01:01.899> the<00:01:02.019> paint<00:01:02.289> is<00:01:02.410> made<00:01:02.739> to<00:01:02.769> actually

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
made that the paint is made to actually

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.270 
made that the paint is made to actually
kind<00:01:04.629> of<00:01:04.720> go<00:01:05.140> around<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.680> knee<00:01:05.830> rather<00:01:06.100> than

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
kind of go around the knee rather than

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.230 
kind of go around the knee rather than
just<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.580> straight<00:01:07.120> material<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.890> kind<00:01:09.820> of<00:01:09.909> the

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
just a straight material so kind of the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.969 
just a straight material so kind of the
paint<00:01:10.720> actually<00:01:11.079> goes<00:01:11.290> around<00:01:11.560> your<00:01:11.710> leg<00:01:11.950> a

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
paint actually goes around your leg a

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.920 
paint actually goes around your leg a
lot<00:01:12.250> better<00:01:12.400> doesn't<00:01:13.329> bunch<00:01:13.479> up<00:01:13.659> when<00:01:13.810> you're

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
lot better doesn't bunch up when you're

lot better doesn't bunch up when you're
riding<00:01:14.610> also<00:01:15.610> this<00:01:15.790> year<00:01:15.820> there's<00:01:16.329> a<00:01:16.390> lot<00:01:16.600> less

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
riding also this year there's a lot less

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.280 
riding also this year there's a lot less
tpr<00:01:17.320> which<00:01:17.710> is<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.100> what's<00:01:18.430> are<00:01:18.579> these<00:01:19.290> is

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
tpr which is the what's are these is

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.749 
tpr which is the what's are these is
little<00:01:20.950> rubbery<00:01:21.700> type<00:01:22.060> of<00:01:22.240> patches<00:01:22.810> and

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
little rubbery type of patches and

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.910 
little rubbery type of patches and
basically<00:01:24.759> that's<00:01:25.360> just<00:01:25.659> shedding<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.680> ton<00:01:26.890> of

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
basically that's just shedding a ton of

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.550 
basically that's just shedding a ton of
weight<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.790> lot<00:01:28.180> of<00:01:28.329> unnecessary<00:01:28.600> weight<00:01:29.170> which

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
weight a lot of unnecessary weight which

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.020 
weight a lot of unnecessary weight which
was<00:01:29.740> cool<00:01:29.920> because<00:01:30.130> what<00:01:30.700> they<00:01:30.790> ended<00:01:30.939> up

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
was cool because what they ended up

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.999 
was cool because what they ended up
doing<00:01:31.090> was<00:01:31.360> going<00:01:31.720> in<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.200> printing<00:01:32.590> actually

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
doing was going in and printing actually

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.959 
doing was going in and printing actually
into<00:01:33.189> the<00:01:33.280> material<00:01:33.630> making<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.960> pant<00:01:35.680> a<00:01:35.979> lot

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
into the material making the pant a lot

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.709 
into the material making the pant a lot
lighter<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.680> then<00:01:38.799> also<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.219> jersey<00:01:39.640> we<00:01:40.570> went

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
lighter and then also the jersey we went

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.800 
lighter and then also the jersey we went
through<00:01:40.960> several<00:01:41.229> materials<00:01:41.469> I<00:01:42.369> was<00:01:43.210> thankful

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
through several materials I was thankful

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.420 
through several materials I was thankful
