00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570

and I would gladly wear an eyepatch

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.440 
and I would gladly wear an eyepatch
because<00:01:52.320> pirates<00:01:52.560> are<00:01:52.920> awesome<00:01:53.430> but<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.149> don't

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
because pirates are awesome but I don't

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.920 
because pirates are awesome but I don't
think<00:01:54.689> that's<00:01:54.869> acceptable<00:01:55.850> um<00:01:56.850> but<00:01:57.780> then

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
think that's acceptable um but then

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.130 
think that's acceptable um but then
again<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:59.070> toy<00:01:59.729> store<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.479> maybe<00:02:00.840> it

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
again it is a toy store so maybe it

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.569 
again it is a toy store so maybe it
would<00:02:01.320> be<00:02:01.500> acceptable<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.399> don't<00:02:02.880> know<00:02:04.579> maybe

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
would be acceptable I don't know maybe

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.730 
would be acceptable I don't know maybe
only<00:02:05.969> during<00:02:06.210> Halloween
