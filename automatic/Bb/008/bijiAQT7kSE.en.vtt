and there you're gonna get two labels in
this<00:01:36.030> kit<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.509> I'll<00:01:36.600> show<00:01:36.750> them<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.290> a

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
this kit and I'll show them to in just a

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.440 
this kit and I'll show them to in just a
minute<00:01:37.530> there's<00:01:37.950> two<00:01:38.610> different<00:01:38.729> sizes<00:01:39.000> this

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
minute there's two different sizes this

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.120 
minute there's two different sizes this
size<00:01:39.720> which<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> small<00:01:40.470> one<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.950> there's

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
size which is a small one and there's

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.800 
size which is a small one and there's
one<00:01:41.280> that's<00:01:41.369> slightly<00:01:41.640> larger<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.600> think

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
one that's slightly larger and I think

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.240 
one that's slightly larger and I think
they'll<00:01:42.930> fit<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.500> about<00:01:43.649> any<00:01:43.890> bottle

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
they'll fit on just about any bottle

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.590

illustrator - so we've got a cute little
card<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.740> goes<00:02:37.860> in<00:02:38.100> there

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
card that goes in there

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.760 
card that goes in there
and<00:02:38.840> every<00:02:39.840> page<00:02:40.050> in<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.320> spec<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.650> an

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.560 
and every page in the spec is an
envelope<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.520> when<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.240> print<00:02:42.450> out<00:02:42.510> the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
envelope so when you print out the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.140 
envelope so when you print out the
templates<00:02:43.020> you'll<00:02:43.460> go<00:02:44.460> full<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.880> lip<00:02:45.000> and
