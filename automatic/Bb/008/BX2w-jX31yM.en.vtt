okay<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:23.620> as<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.010> can<00:02:24.130> tell<00:02:24.190> there's<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.640> rough

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
okay so as you can tell there's a rough

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.520 
okay so as you can tell there's a rough
sketch<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:27.310> trace<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.180> usually<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.410> like

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
sketch of the trace and usually I like

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.530 
sketch of the trace and usually I like
to<00:02:29.709> bring<00:02:30.040> out<00:02:30.220> my<00:02:30.370> winged<00:02:30.610> eyeliner<00:02:30.819> a<00:02:31.150> little

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
to bring out my winged eyeliner a little

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.260 
to bring out my winged eyeliner a little
bit<00:02:31.720> more<00:02:31.989> out<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:33.280> will<00:02:33.520> be<00:02:33.730> doing<00:02:33.910> that

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
bit more out and I will be doing that

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.940 
bit more out and I will be doing that
but<00:02:34.480> but<00:02:35.020> as<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.290> can<00:02:35.410> tell<00:02:35.470> there<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:37.950> gap

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
but but as you can tell there is a gap

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.589 
but but as you can tell there is a gap
right<00:02:39.310> there<00:02:39.370> because<00:02:39.940> we're<00:02:40.090> going<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.420> fill

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
right there because we're going to fill

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.660 
right there because we're going to fill
it<00:02:40.720> in<00:02:40.840> with<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.140> other<00:02:41.319> liquid<00:02:41.769> eyeliner<00:02:42.130> but

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
it in with the other liquid eyeliner but

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.190 
it in with the other liquid eyeliner but
the<00:02:42.760> reason<00:02:42.910> I'm<00:02:43.180> doing<00:02:43.209> that<00:02:43.569> is<00:02:43.690> because<00:02:44.050> i

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
the reason I'm doing that is because i

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.259 
the reason I'm doing that is because i
feel<00:02:44.500> like<00:02:44.530> this<00:02:44.800> eyeliner<00:02:45.220> isn't<00:02:45.730> as<00:02:45.880> black

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
feel like this eyeliner isn't as black

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.130 
feel like this eyeliner isn't as black
as<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.599> NYC<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:48.340> that's<00:02:49.209> why<00:02:49.450> I'm<00:02:49.569> taking<00:02:49.780> this

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
as the NYC so that's why I'm taking this

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.280 
as the NYC so that's why I'm taking this
pen<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.680> just<00:02:50.769> tracing<00:02:51.459> it<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:52.900> can<00:02:53.110> get

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
pen and just tracing it so you can get

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.830 
pen and just tracing it so you can get
that<00:02:53.349> perfect<00:02:53.980> winged<00:02:54.610> liner<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.269> what<00:02:55.630> I<00:02:55.660> did

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
that perfect winged liner so what I did

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.059 
that perfect winged liner so what I did
was<00:02:56.110> just<00:02:57.100> created<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:58.030> shape<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:59.110> how<00:02:59.440> long<00:02:59.799> I

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
was just created the shape of how long I

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.590 
was just created the shape of how long I
wanted<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.489> tail<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.910> be<00:03:01.030> i'm<00:03:01.120> probably<00:03:01.360> going

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
wanted the tail to be i'm probably going

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.940 
wanted the tail to be i'm probably going
to<00:03:01.690> make<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.930> little<00:03:02.080> bit<00:03:02.260> longer<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.890> then

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
to make it a little bit longer and then

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.930 
to make it a little bit longer and then
after<00:03:03.940> i<00:03:03.970> do<00:03:04.090> that<00:03:04.480> i<00:03:04.510> connect<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.670> i

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
after i do that i connect it so i

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.240 
after i do that i connect it so i
already<00:03:07.450> showed<00:03:07.780> you<00:03:07.840> guys<00:03:08.170> but<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:08.500> just<00:03:08.799> drag

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
already showed you guys but I just drag

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.729 
already showed you guys but I just drag
I<00:03:09.549> dragged<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.330> down<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:10.810> connected<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.500> and

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
I dragged it down and connected it and

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.490 
I dragged it down and connected it and
then<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.400> go<00:03:12.880> back<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.510> inner<00:03:13.690> corner<00:03:14.049> and

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
then I go back to the inner corner and

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.620 
then I go back to the inner corner and
then<00:03:14.680> I<00:03:14.890> draw<00:03:15.220> like<00:03:15.640> that<00:03:15.670> just<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.209> connect

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
then I draw like that just to connect

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.150 
then I draw like that just to connect
the<00:03:16.690> whole<00:03:16.930> thing<00:03:17.170> so<00:03:17.620> now<00:03:17.769> we're<00:03:17.920> going<00:03:18.099> to

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
the whole thing so now we're going to

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.009 
the whole thing so now we're going to
fill<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.730> fill<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.330> in<00:03:19.480> it's<00:03:19.720> pretty

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
fill it and fill it in it's pretty

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.410 
fill it and fill it in it's pretty
simple<00:03:20.380> when<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.040> have<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.340> pen<00:03:21.790> as<00:03:22.030> your

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
simple when you have a pen as your

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.960 
simple when you have a pen as your
guidance<00:03:23.019> tool<00:03:23.440> so<00:03:24.340> if<00:03:24.430> we're<00:03:24.580> just<00:03:24.730> going<00:03:24.910> to

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
guidance tool so if we're just going to

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.309 
guidance tool so if we're just going to
start<00:03:25.180> off<00:03:25.299> with<00:03:25.480> something<00:03:25.510> like<00:03:25.930> this<00:03:25.959> it's

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
start off with something like this it's

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.020 
start off with something like this it's
going<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.500> be<00:03:26.590> much<00:03:26.799> more<00:03:27.130> difficult<00:03:27.190> so<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:27.910> do

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
going to be much more difficult so I do

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.060 
going to be much more difficult so I do
suggest<00:03:28.390> a<00:03:28.720> pen<00:03:28.959> and<00:03:28.989> they<00:03:29.260> do<00:03:29.320> have<00:03:29.530> drugstore

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.960 
applicators that you go like this and
it's<00:04:47.710> just<00:04:47.889> harder<00:04:48.370> because<00:04:48.550> you<00:04:48.760> need<00:04:48.940> a

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
it's just harder because you need a

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.469 
it's just harder because you need a
steady<00:04:49.300> hand<00:04:49.590> so<00:04:50.590> I<00:04:51.070> would<00:04:51.699> suggest<00:04:51.880> if<00:04:52.360> you're

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
steady hand so I would suggest if you're

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.510 
steady hand so I would suggest if you're
a<00:04:52.539> beginner<00:04:52.780> to<00:04:53.199> just<00:04:53.440> use<00:04:53.590> a<00:04:53.800> pen<00:04:54.100> liquid

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
a beginner to just use a pen liquid

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.250 
a beginner to just use a pen liquid
liner<00:04:54.760> and<00:04:55.060> even<00:04:55.300> if<00:04:55.389> it's<00:04:55.539> not<00:04:55.690> block<00:04:55.990> enough

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
liner and even if it's not block enough

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.870 
liner and even if it's not block enough
just<00:04:56.440> put<00:04:56.590> some<00:04:56.740> eye<00:04:56.889> shadow<00:04:56.919> over<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.639> because

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
just put some eye shadow over it because

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.480 
just put some eye shadow over it because
this<00:04:58.389> could<00:04:58.780> be<00:04:58.930> quite<00:04:59.169> messy<00:04:59.740> and<00:05:00.010> it<00:05:00.250> dries

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
this could be quite messy and it dries

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.129 
this could be quite messy and it dries
matte<00:05:00.850> so<00:05:01.419> it's<00:05:01.539> going<00:05:01.630> to<00:05:01.720> be<00:05:01.780> harder<00:05:02.110> to

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
matte so it's going to be harder to

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.710 
matte so it's going to be harder to
remove<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:03.010> fix<00:05:03.340> but<00:05:04.000> once<00:05:04.210> you<00:05:04.360> feel<00:05:04.570> like

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
remove and fix but once you feel like

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.090 
remove and fix but once you feel like
you<00:05:04.930> have<00:05:05.080> developed<00:05:05.530> you're<00:05:05.650> more<00:05:05.800> steady

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
you have developed you're more steady

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.700 
you have developed you're more steady
hand<00:05:06.370> you<00:05:06.460> can<00:05:06.610> go<00:05:06.760> over<00:05:07.090> that<00:05:07.270> trace<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:08.050> you

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
hand you can go over that trace and you

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.290 
hand you can go over that trace and you
just<00:05:08.860> got<00:05:09.010> to<00:05:09.039> make<00:05:09.250> sure<00:05:09.280> that<00:05:09.610> you<00:05:09.729> know<00:05:10.180> how
