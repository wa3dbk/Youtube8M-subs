have<00:03:05.939> a<00:03:05.969> little<00:03:06.150> bit<00:03:06.299> of<00:03:06.329> time<00:03:06.629> for

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
have a little bit of time for

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.899

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
invulnerability so i can see around

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.750 
invulnerability so i can see around
where<00:03:09.329> i<00:03:09.359> am<00:03:09.629> that<00:03:10.590> NC<00:03:11.010> still<00:03:11.340> was<00:03:11.430> able<00:03:11.579> to

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
where i am that NC still was able to

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.819 
where i am that NC still was able to
kill<00:03:12.000> me<00:03:12.150> even<00:03:12.359> though<00:03:12.870> i<00:03:12.900> had<00:03:13.019> a<00:03:13.079> shotgun<00:03:13.349> so

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
kill me even though i had a shotgun so

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.800 
kill me even though i had a shotgun so
you<00:03:13.889> can<00:03:14.280> see<00:03:14.459> is<00:03:14.609> not<00:03:14.760> totally<00:03:15.239> overpowered

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
you can see is not totally overpowered

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.229 
you can see is not totally overpowered
but<00:03:16.590> after<00:03:16.889> spawning<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.489> couple<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.819> times<00:03:18.000> I

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
but after spawning a couple of times I

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.909 
but after spawning a couple of times I
was<00:03:18.389> able<00:03:18.599> to<00:03:18.750> clear<00:03:19.260> them<00:03:19.439> out<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.620> don't<00:03:19.859> know

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
was able to clear them out I don't know

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.619 
was able to clear them out I don't know
why<00:03:20.040> they<00:03:20.159> didn't<00:03:20.370> just<00:03:20.400> blow<00:03:20.849> up<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.239> sunder

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
why they didn't just blow up the sunder

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.539 
why they didn't just blow up the sunder
guess<00:03:22.259> they<00:03:22.439> desided<00:03:22.889> farming<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.400> was<00:03:23.519> a

guess they desided farming it was a

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.189 
guess they desided farming it was a
little<00:03:23.669> bit<00:03:23.849> better<00:03:24.030> there<00:03:24.659> is<00:03:24.750> an<00:03:24.870> increase

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
little bit better there is an increase

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.559 
little bit better there is an increase

from<00:04:06.959> Star<00:04:07.139> Wars<00:04:07.169> have<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.560> feeling<00:04:07.829> that's<00:04:07.979> not

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
from Star Wars have a feeling that's not

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.499 
from Star Wars have a feeling that's not
the<00:04:08.219> right<00:04:08.310> name<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:08.759> I'm<00:04:09.239> going<00:04:09.359> to<00:04:09.389> get

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:09.509 
the right name and I'm going to get

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:11.089 
the right name and I'm going to get
yelled<00:04:09.689> out<00:04:09.840> in<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.139> comments<00:04:10.379> but<00:04:10.769> that's

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
yelled out in the comments but that's

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.569 
yelled out in the comments but that's
fine<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:12.049> the<00:04:13.049> grenade<00:04:13.500> radius<00:04:13.889> has<00:04:14.189> been

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
fine and the grenade radius has been

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.279 
fine and the grenade radius has been
decreased<00:04:15.329> as<00:04:15.509> well<00:04:15.689> so<00:04:15.930> you<00:04:16.019> see<00:04:16.259> that

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
decreased as well so you see that

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.629 
decreased as well so you see that
grenade<00:04:16.620> probably<00:04:17.099> would<00:04:17.190> have<00:04:17.250> killed<00:04:17.310> me

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639

grenade probably would have killed me
but<00:04:18.389> I<00:04:18.419> was<00:04:18.630> lucky<00:04:18.780> enough<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.469> avoid<00:04:20.099> it<00:04:20.599> so

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
but I was lucky enough to avoid it so

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:22.939 
but I was lucky enough to avoid it so
there's<00:04:21.750> a<00:04:21.840> couple<00:04:21.959> other<00:04:22.139> changes<00:04:22.680> that<00:04:22.919> are

stuff<00:05:26.080> like<00:05:26.200> that<00:05:26.310> anti-air<00:05:27.310> turrets<00:05:27.640> are<00:05:27.790> a

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
stuff like that anti-air turrets are a

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.050 
stuff like that anti-air turrets are a
lot<00:05:28.630> better<00:05:28.930> now<00:05:29.230> a<00:05:29.410> lot<00:05:30.040> smoother<00:05:30.460> to<00:05:30.670> look

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
lot better now a lot smoother to look

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.200 
lot better now a lot smoother to look
around<00:05:31.360> you<00:05:31.900> have<00:05:32.080> full<00:05:32.680> control<00:05:32.830> over<00:05:33.100> it<00:05:33.550> so

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
around you have full control over it so

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.490 
around you have full control over it so
you<00:05:34.300> won't<00:05:34.390> just<00:05:34.570> get<00:05:34.720> killed<00:05:34.990> before<00:05:35.140> you<00:05:35.380> can

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
you won't just get killed before you can

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.140 
you won't just get killed before you can
even<00:05:35.530> turn<00:05:35.800> around<00:05:35.860> and<00:05:36.340> look<00:05:36.430> at<00:05:36.610> his<00:05:36.820> firing

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
even turn around and look at his firing

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.170 
even turn around and look at his firing
at<00:05:37.360> you<00:05:37.890> also<00:05:38.890> there<00:05:39.040> are<00:05:39.070> two<00:05:39.610> major<00:05:39.820> bugs

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
at you also there are two major bugs

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.000 
at you also there are two major bugs
that<00:05:40.330> have<00:05:40.480> developed<00:05:41.140> the<00:05:41.560> first<00:05:41.740> is<00:05:41.980> that

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
that have developed the first is that

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.370 
that have developed the first is that
lock<00:05:42.340> on<00:05:42.520> tones<00:05:42.760> don't<00:05:43.120> always<00:05:43.360> work<00:05:43.570> to<00:05:44.230> make

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
lock on tones don't always work to make

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.350 
lock on tones don't always work to make
sure<00:05:44.560> to<00:05:44.650> be<00:05:44.740> in<00:05:44.830> first<00:05:45.100> person<00:05:45.310> to<00:05:45.730> look<00:05:46.090> for

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
sure to be in first person to look for

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.630 
sure to be in first person to look for
the<00:05:46.450> indicator<00:05:46.960> also<00:05:47.919> frame<00:05:48.220> rate<00:05:48.400> has<00:05:48.610> been

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
the indicator also frame rate has been

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.170 
the indicator also frame rate has been
optimized<00:05:49.540> somewhat<00:05:49.900> but<00:05:50.169> also<00:05:50.410> has<00:05:50.710> issues

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
optimized somewhat but also has issues

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.700 
optimized somewhat but also has issues
so<00:05:52.180> we<00:05:52.300> are<00:05:52.480> fully<00:05:52.750> aware<00:05:52.960> of<00:05:53.140> the<00:05:53.380> new

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
so we are fully aware of the new

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.860 
so we are fully aware of the new
problems<00:05:54.100> and<00:05:54.280> are<00:05:54.370> working<00:05:54.520> on<00:05:54.820> it<00:05:55.330> around

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
problems and are working on it around

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.510 
problems and are working on it around
the<00:05:55.990> clock<00:05:56.200> so<00:05:56.410> just<00:05:56.590> be<00:05:56.710> patient<00:05:56.890> and<00:05:57.250> they
