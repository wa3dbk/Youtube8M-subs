00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
for a trucking my advice video it is

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.719 
for a trucking my advice video it is
items<00:01:06.140> to<00:01:06.380> make<00:01:06.530> life<00:01:06.860> on<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.280> road<00:01:07.460> as

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
items to make life on the road as

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.149 
items to make life on the road as
comfortable<00:01:08.240> as<00:01:08.420> possible<00:01:08.799> ok<00:01:09.799> so<00:01:09.859> I've

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
comfortable as possible ok so I've

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.590 
comfortable as possible ok so I've
already<00:01:10.280> done<00:01:10.549> a<00:01:10.579> video<00:01:10.759> similar<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.450> that<00:01:11.539> I

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
already done a video similar to that I

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.679 
already done a video similar to that I
think<00:01:12.049> that's<00:01:12.409> what<00:01:12.649> you're<00:01:12.799> talking<00:01:12.950> about

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
think that's what you're talking about

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.880 
think that's what you're talking about
so<00:01:14.689> if<00:01:14.749> you<00:01:14.840> go<00:01:14.960> back<00:01:15.109> into<00:01:15.380> some<00:01:15.649> of<00:01:15.770> my

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
so if you go back into some of my

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.160 
so if you go back into some of my
earlier<00:01:16.369> videos<00:01:16.850> it's<00:01:17.179> a<00:01:17.270> new<00:01:17.420> driver<00:01:17.719> video

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
earlier videos it's a new driver video

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.190 
earlier videos it's a new driver video
actually<00:01:18.409> you<00:01:18.679> can<00:01:18.799> go<00:01:18.859> to<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.039> website<00:01:19.070> I

Trap Hole I've got my truck so you might

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.450 
Trap Hole I've got my truck so you might
start<00:01:33.619> doing<00:01:33.889> something<00:01:34.100> like<00:01:34.219> that<00:01:34.369> where

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
start doing something like that where

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.859 
start doing something like that where
I'll<00:01:34.549> show<00:01:34.729> you<00:01:34.819> everything<00:01:35.060> that<00:01:35.240> I<00:01:35.359> do<00:01:35.450> carry

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
I'll show you everything that I do carry

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.919 
I'll show you everything that I do carry
yeah<00:01:36.590> that'd<00:01:37.249> be<00:01:37.429> one<00:01:37.639> long<00:01:38.210> as<00:01:38.719> video<00:01:39.579> so<00:01:40.929> ok

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
yeah that'd be one long as video so ok

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.069 
yeah that'd be one long as video so ok
so<00:01:42.289> where<00:01:42.649> was<00:01:42.799> I<00:01:42.979> here<00:01:43.219> uh<00:01:43.719> life<00:01:44.719> under<00:01:44.960> or

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
so where was I here uh life under or

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.929 
so where was I here uh life under or
discomfort<00:01:45.350> as<00:01:45.560> possible<00:01:45.889> ok<00:01:46.100> I<00:01:46.280> think<00:01:46.700> this

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
discomfort as possible ok I think this

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.999 
discomfort as possible ok I think this
could<00:01:47.179> help<00:01:47.359> new<00:01:47.659> drivers<00:01:48.170> make<00:01:48.409> their<00:01:48.439> first

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
could help new drivers make their first

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.429 
could help new drivers make their first
year<00:01:49.399> over<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:49.939> road<00:01:50.090> as<00:01:50.329> easy<00:01:51.049> as<00:01:51.229> possible

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
year over the road as easy as possible

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.139 
year over the road as easy as possible
so<00:01:51.920> yeah<00:01:52.069> it<00:01:52.189> probably<00:01:52.429> has<00:01:52.670> to<00:01:52.700> do<00:01:52.909> with<00:01:53.030> the

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
so yeah it probably has to do with the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:54.819 
so yeah it probably has to do with the
new<00:01:53.270> driver<00:01:53.509> starter<00:01:53.929> kit<00:01:54.109> so<00:01:54.229> that<00:01:54.380> video<00:01:54.530> is

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
new driver starter kit so that video is

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.969 
new driver starter kit so that video is
there<00:01:55.100> um<00:01:56.799> and<00:01:57.799> I<00:01:58.069> probably<00:01:58.399> did<00:01:58.609> a<00:01:58.639> couple<00:01:58.939> so

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
there um and I probably did a couple so

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.739 
there um and I probably did a couple so
could<00:02:00.979> you<00:02:01.009> also<00:02:01.310> tell<00:02:01.490> Linda<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.179> I<00:02:02.389> enjoy
