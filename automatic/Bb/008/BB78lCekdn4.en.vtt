00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.630
 microsoft office word preview 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.830
 It has become a preview version of the word many money 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.830
 Stalling 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.580
 Let's look at the candidate a little 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.230
 Yes 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.230
 It is a nice place to say 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.710
 I do not know whether I received this email early or late but I applied 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:57.490
 Well Kedomo I think Nante Do I think we have passed about two weeks from

 By the way, in the well terminal of the android 4.4 to be able to use Well 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.340

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:14.319
 Since the ram was or there something something variously limit or a 1 giga or more 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.000
 Oh Well Kedomo we Some people do not put even on this subject 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:22.910
 Somehow I am 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.130
 A single-acting fishing tablet in this xperia is used in a quantity corresponding to the two houses 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.840
 can do 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:32.280
 So now it's open like this 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.480
 I got a little familiar with the office 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.480
 The logo came out 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.900
 No Crowded serves as the timer use conditions part 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.269
 do it 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.170
 Yes there is a little bit of personal information that thanks a little to three friends, so later with San-in 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:53.890
 It feels like 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:57.960
 I 'm ready to show the document with the feeling that I'm ready. 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.560
 It came out that display was possible free of charge 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.560
 And then 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.599
 You will be able to use the office ? 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.400
 Ne 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:11.130
 It seems to be easier to use sideways yes 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.690
 See you here 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.950
 Than Tteyuu sentence of Dr. 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.050
 Oh, I can use it like this. 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.050
 Word is faction 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.050
 The 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.610
 What a nice 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.410
 In 2000 office 2013, it feels like summer a little bit similar to summer 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:39.440
 It is supposed to be 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:43.260
 Yes, saying that Excel was able to hunt the installation even though it was 8 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:47.519
 It came out like this for a moment 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.160
 Let's go a little with a blank book. There is a migration excel like this 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.080
 Teki directly below 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.650
 I'm glad yes 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:00.700
 Those who it looks like Excel 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:03.740
 Yes, hey, from here, because you shouldn't lengthen your armor video 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:10.330
 Masu eight enemy 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:15.990
 The installation is complete and I just opened a preview of the per-point 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:21.500
 Yes Press in I feel it 's you have created this I PowerPoint presentation 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:25.550
 The tree is actually the third take 3 but it is actually 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:29.630
 That something like this application has caused an anomaly 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:35.960
 The display comes out and the state does not advance for a while from now 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:41.350
 I can't use PowerPoint for a while, I think for a moment 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:44.470
 Because I would like to use par points better than Excel 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:48.130
 Sorry for this update 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.200
 I wonder if it will come up sometime in the library, so it's unclear because it is a preview version. 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.800
 Just like this 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:57.150
 A little on par points 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:00.200
 You can't show it a bit for the main gun, but you can cancel it for a little while 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:05.860
 Kedomo are you fantasize about for a 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:08.720
 This both this and take 3 three times but what is in you is I also 3 times as no reaction 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.110
 Yes, and it was a state of no reaction 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.050
 In this I just came out Powerpoint preview is not responding 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:19.580
 I see something like this 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:25.190
 I've watched the video for a while now, but how was it? 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:27.530
 With regard to the main feeling of use after actually using it, I will upload another positive video again 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.630
 Please see that person 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:34.660
 Still 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:37.990
 8 Those who have not been subscribed I think that I can still apply, so only that link 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:41.420
 I will paste it, so please register from that person 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.650
 Because it has become a flash at a glance 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:48.169
 It is feeling that we commented, but 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:52.090
 Thank you in advance etc. Please look at the sound video from now on more and more 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.090
