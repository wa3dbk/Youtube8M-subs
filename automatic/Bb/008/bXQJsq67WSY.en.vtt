how your your sound was so distinctive

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.990 
how your your sound was so distinctive
back<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.439> there<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.770> Le<00:01:31.860> Loi<00:01:32.250> generally<00:01:32.909> I

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
back in there and the Le Loi generally I

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.270 
back in there and the Le Loi generally I
think<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.390> think<00:01:33.659> what<00:01:34.110> people<00:01:34.259> mistake<00:01:34.950> for

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
think I think what people mistake for

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.830 
think I think what people mistake for
you<00:01:36.240> know<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.770> definitive<00:01:37.770> sound<00:01:38.369> was<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.540> lack

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you know a definitive sound was a lack

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.260 
you know a definitive sound was a lack
of<00:01:39.869> great<00:01:40.439> production<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.909> think<00:01:42.150> that

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
of great production and I think that

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.389 
of great production and I think that
that<00:01:42.420> instance<00:01:42.960> happens<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.890> lot<00:01:44.070> in

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
that instance happens a lot in

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.740 
that instance happens a lot in
particularly<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.240> rock'n'roll<00:01:45.659> music

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
particularly in rock'n'roll music

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.080 
particularly in rock'n'roll music
because<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.439> think<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> performance

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
because I think that the performance

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.020 
because I think that the performance
equals<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.439> happy<00:01:49.799> listener<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.729> know<00:01:50.850> when

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
equals the happy listener you know when

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.370 
equals the happy listener you know when
it<00:01:51.119> comes<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.360> rock<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.720> roll<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.049> know<00:01:52.079> Chuck

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.170 
Eddie to test that sound I actually kind
of<00:02:15.950> liked<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.160> way<00:02:16.489> the<00:02:16.640> first<00:02:16.760> eligos

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
of liked the way the first eligos

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.199 
of liked the way the first eligos
records<00:02:17.630> sound<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:19.130> it's<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.580> randall<00:02:20.000> amp

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
records sound and it's that randall amp

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.900 
records sound and it's that randall amp
on<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.510> first<00:02:20.720> one<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:21.110> know<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.349> RG<00:02:21.709> 18<00:02:22.069> you

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
on the first one you know the RG 18 you

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.120 
on the first one you know the RG 18 you
know<00:02:23.000> probably<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.920> impedance<00:02:24.920> was

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
know probably the impedance was

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.920 
know probably the impedance was
mismatched<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.000> omens<00:02:26.300> was<00:02:26.450> mismatched

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
mismatched and the omens was mismatched

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.050 
mismatched and the omens was mismatched
and<00:02:27.319> it<00:02:27.440> was<00:02:27.620> just<00:02:27.860> not<00:02:28.010> working<00:02:28.190> right<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:28.819> I

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
and it was just not working right and I

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.510 
and it was just not working right and I
think<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:29.690> played<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.900> warlock<00:02:30.380> on<00:02:30.650> most<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.400> that

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
think I played a warlock on most of that

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.420 
think I played a warlock on most of that
record<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.650> people<00:02:33.650> like<00:02:33.800> that<00:02:33.830> tone<00:02:34.220> you

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
record and people like that tone you

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.610 
record and people like that tone you
know<00:02:34.520> they<00:02:34.670> how<00:02:35.300> did<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.540> do<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:36.019> got<00:02:36.440> you

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
know just really crappy equipment you

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.640 
know just really crappy equipment you
know<00:02:38.300> it's<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:40.540> but<00:02:41.540> think<00:02:41.720> about<00:02:41.840> it<00:02:42.080> you<00:02:42.319> being

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
know it's a but think about it you being

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.470 
know it's a but think about it you being
you<00:02:42.739> were<00:02:42.860> listening<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.310> Jeff<00:02:43.519> white<00:02:43.760> no<00:02:44.269> and

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
you were listening to Jeff white no and

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.860 
you were listening to Jeff white no and
like<00:02:44.600> most<00:02:45.010> people<00:02:46.180> especially<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.780> know

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
like most people especially you know

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.390 
like most people especially you know
metal<00:02:48.350> guys<00:02:48.500> they<00:02:48.799> don't<00:02:48.860> want<00:02:49.069> to<00:02:49.130> play<00:02:49.280> out

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
metal guys they don't want to play out

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.650 
metal guys they don't want to play out
of<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:50.860> can't<00:02:51.860> electro<00:02:52.220> lamp<00:02:52.489> or<00:02:52.730> play<00:02:53.209> super

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
of it can't electro lamp or play super

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.940 
of it can't electro lamp or play super
guitar<00:02:54.140> or<00:02:54.290> something<00:02:54.650> like<00:02:54.739> that

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
guitar or something like that

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.860 
guitar or something like that
you<00:02:55.370> know<00:02:55.459> but<00:02:55.640> those<00:02:55.760> kind<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.150> crappy<00:02:56.420> things

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
you know but those kind of crappy things

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.949 
you know but those kind of crappy things
I<00:02:57.250> think<00:02:58.250> they<00:02:58.519> can<00:02:58.790> amplify<00:02:59.750> your

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
I think they can amplify your

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.870 
I think they can amplify your
personality<00:03:00.620> as<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:00.769> player<00:03:01.040> yeah<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:01.760> know

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
personality as a player yeah you know

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.479 
personality as a player yeah you know
what<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.030> mean<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.780> I<00:03:03.110> think<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:04.010> route<00:03:04.190> of

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
what I mean and and I think the route of

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.400 
what I mean and and I think the route of
a<00:03:04.940> lot<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.269> 80s<00:03:05.660> guys<00:03:05.840> particularly

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
a lot of the 80s guys particularly

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.410 
a lot of the 80s guys particularly
myself<00:03:06.739> and<00:03:07.220> I<00:03:07.250> think<00:03:07.459> c.c.<00:03:07.760> deville<00:03:08.030> suffers

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
myself and I think c.c. deville suffers

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.289 
myself and I think c.c. deville suffers
from<00:03:08.540> this<00:03:08.690> too<00:03:08.930> is<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:10.790> have<00:03:10.940> so<00:03:11.180> much

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
from this too is that you have so much

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.099 
from this too is that you have so much
gain<00:03:11.750> at<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.290> point<00:03:12.830> that<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:14.420> humans<00:03:14.900> not

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
gain at a point that the humans not

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.580 
gain at a point that the humans not
coming<00:03:15.470> through<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:17.380> conceited<00:03:18.380> build

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
coming through and conceited build

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.560 
coming through and conceited build
