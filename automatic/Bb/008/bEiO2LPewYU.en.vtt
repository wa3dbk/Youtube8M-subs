00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.040
 a friend of yours 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.080
 optical 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.830
 we are here again with our 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.230
 tips kotka tips and technology 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.230
 today we are going to talk about the eye that 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.269
 wonderful organ that enables us to 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:28.650
 to see with the eye is the main organ 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.349
 towards the vision of the eye globe logo 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.399
 here we have a model of sauce 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.610
 the sauce that we call or still 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:44.160
 Eye playback full size 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.020
 as you want to call it, guide you 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.570
 which is made up of several 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.510
 concentric layers 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.420
 the outermost layer is the white exits 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.120
 tomorrow is that the call of sclera or 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.449
 sclerosis here appear blue but is the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.449
 white eye then sclera 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.420
 or sclera or as a tunic 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.110
 fibrous is what has in the form the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.930
 favorite 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.049
 we have here the muscles that are 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.460
 responsible for eye movement of the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.040
 side to the other so the bass then the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.170
 fibrous tunica because it is more external we 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.070
 we have another that is called a choroid 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.299
 or tunica vascular acorod is rich in 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.549
 blood vessels that feed for more than 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.740
 internally we have the retina layer 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:43.380
 more internal and then we'll see 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:45.659
 inside it it comes the transparency and 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.180
 is known as cornea 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.869
 then the cornea is as if it were the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.200
 first natural eye lens 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.880
 completely transparent that pierced 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.689
 this layer that is more in front of it 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.689
 There's no way she is and she 's the rope. 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.619
 there is a book that is known as the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.799
 use 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.409
 always incessantly conducted his 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.659
 excess is eliminated through small 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:19.060
 This is known here as 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:21.190
 carlito bike that mix with 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.989
 the tears and grandma 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.420
 then we have the one to them is the 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.480
 colored part of the eye is the air that gives 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.250
 eye color 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.260
 then the function of the isi is the diaphragm 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:44.200
 she closes and opens the pupil that 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:47.590
 in its center thus enabling the 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.310
 eye receives the correct amount of light 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.159
 we left too much light 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.500
 the pupil is very small, that's where 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.629
 makes this move and when we return 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.239
 with the darker environment then the 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:05.230
 Vampira got out of there leaving me 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.959
 plus after the pupil we have 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.540
 crystalline or crystalline is also a 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.480
 natural gold lens the only one that changes 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.849
 the way we want to get 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.430
 far or near then the 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:22.150
 this natural lens is 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.269
 responsible for focusing on the 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.120
 away or close after the 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:31.870
 people make the crystalline age of 40 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.299
 begins to lose some of its function is 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.980
 gradual 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:39.160
 then in that phase that begins 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.720
 need to degree close to all 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.150
 people after 40 forty-something 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:50.370
 years we go to glasses according to age 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.349
 for compensation would not think of walking 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.989
 I'll think later and we'll have the mood 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:04:00.129
 vitreous which is a gelatinous substance 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:03.879
 a god-like gel that retains the shape of the douro 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:06.209
 here again we see the retina 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:10.239
 retina then has cells 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:14.129
 photosensitive we call colors 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:17.880
 and rods are photo receptor cells 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:20.700
 foto light receiver csrlos 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.830
 the image then forms on the retina has a 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.380
 right point to inform you that the 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.820
 center the year the image focus image 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.160
 Is the vision clear to you? 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.290
 there is no need for correction or 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.050
 bodies with contact lens 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.510
 if the position is different 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.280
 formalization were before the retina 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.300
 after the retina with hypothesis 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.920
 different, but the need to 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.480
 eyeglasses or 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.310
 contact lenses on the retina 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.650
 this light that was energy security 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.240
 light is transformed into energy 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.420
 electrical 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.620
 and there by a series of cell types 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.990
 many different 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.570
 We 'll study it, then, enough. 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.470
 complex but we are seeing here 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.030
 only major then does this energy 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.010
 light is transformed into energy 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:16.700
 and is driven by the optic nerve 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.700
 to the brain 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.310
 seeing now from behind for us nerve 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.730
 optic conducting electrical impulses 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:32.100
 to the brain of the retina 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:34.850
 the crystalline vitreous humor and the lens 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.850
 natural eye 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:42.630
 they control the amount of light 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.240
 in the eyes 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.780
 the cornea a layer completely 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:55.140
 transparent and places and closing here 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:57.870
 outside the slave people then it 's your 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.620
 is the main organ of the sense of 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:05.480
 our object of study 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.480
 Until our next meeting, thank you. 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.740
