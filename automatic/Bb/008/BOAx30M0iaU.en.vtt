here<00:00:11.600> at<00:00:11.690> FCA<00:00:12.019> we<00:00:12.230> we<00:00:12.710> build<00:00:12.980> custom<00:00:13.220> packaging

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
here at FCA we we build custom packaging

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.089 
here at FCA we we build custom packaging
for<00:00:14.180> parts<00:00:14.450> boxes<00:00:14.870> so<00:00:15.080> every<00:00:15.290> every<00:00:15.590> box<00:00:15.980> that

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:16.099 
for parts boxes so every every box that

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.190 
for parts boxes so every every box that
we<00:00:16.250> build<00:00:16.520> is<00:00:16.730> specific<00:00:17.240> to<00:00:17.450> the<00:00:17.930> part<00:00:18.170> that

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
we build is specific to the part that

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.710 
we build is specific to the part that
goes<00:00:18.440> in<00:00:18.619> that<00:00:18.740> box<00:00:19.010> so<00:00:19.970> the<00:00:20.119> box<00:00:20.300> on<00:00:20.480> the<00:00:20.570> man

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
goes in that box so the box on the man

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.390 
goes in that box so the box on the man
allows<00:00:21.020> us<00:00:21.230> to<00:00:21.380> do<00:00:21.500> that<00:00:21.650> it<00:00:21.830> allows<00:00:21.980> us<00:00:22.130> to<00:00:22.250> cut

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
allows us to do that it allows us to cut

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.400 
allows us to do that it allows us to cut
a<00:00:22.430> custom<00:00:22.820> sized<00:00:23.060> box<00:00:23.390> for<00:00:23.630> our<00:00:23.720> customer<00:00:24.230> when

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
a custom sized box for our customer when

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.779 
a custom sized box for our customer when
it<00:00:24.529> goes<00:00:24.650> out<00:00:24.860> and<00:00:24.890> they<00:00:25.190> put<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:25.490> part<00:00:25.699> in

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
it goes out and they put the part in

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.240 
it goes out and they put the part in
that<00:00:25.910> box<00:00:26.180> we<00:00:27.140> cut<00:00:27.320> anything<00:00:27.529> from<00:00:27.949> small

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
that box we cut anything from small

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.630 
that box we cut anything from small
shoebox<00:00:28.910> up<00:00:29.240> to<00:00:29.480> pulp<00:00:29.960> chest<00:00:30.230> size<00:00:30.439> boxes<00:00:31.039> the

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
four box on the man we had two machines

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.020 
four box on the man we had two machines
that<00:00:33.679> would<00:00:33.800> run<00:00:34.010> this<00:00:34.219> over<00:00:34.519> three<00:00:34.699> shifts

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
that would run this over three shifts

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.969 
that would run this over three shifts
we've<00:00:35.899> been<00:00:36.019> able<00:00:36.079> to<00:00:36.229> cut<00:00:36.409> down<00:00:36.440> to<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.800> one

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:36.979 
we've been able to cut down to the one

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:39.009 
we've been able to cut down to the one
machine<00:00:37.339> still<00:00:37.729> running<00:00:37.969> three<00:00:38.210> shifts<00:00:38.239> which

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
machine still running three shifts which

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.399 
machine still running three shifts which
allowed<00:00:39.319> us<00:00:39.350> to<00:00:40.210> save<00:00:41.210> labour<00:00:41.479> say<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.229> time

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:42.409 
allowed us to save labour say the time

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.079 
allowed us to save labour say the time
it<00:00:42.559> took<00:00:42.679> to<00:00:42.739> load<00:00:42.949> the<00:00:43.100> machine<00:00:43.249> but<00:00:43.639> also<00:00:43.789> get

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
it took to load the machine but also get

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:45.910 
it took to load the machine but also get
the<00:00:44.120> productivity<00:00:44.989> that<00:00:45.079> we<00:00:45.139> need<00:00:45.440> this

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
the productivity that we need this

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.680 
the productivity that we need this
machine<00:00:46.129> gives<00:00:46.519> us<00:00:46.729> a<00:00:46.879> lot<00:00:47.120> more<00:00:47.299> style<00:00:47.600> than

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
machine gives us a lot more style than

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.110 
machine gives us a lot more style than
our<00:00:47.899> old<00:00:48.049> process<00:00:48.499> gave<00:00:48.710> us<00:00:48.889> it<00:00:49.489> also<00:00:49.699> allowed

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
our old process gave us it also allowed

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.629 
our old process gave us it also allowed
us<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:50.359> go<00:00:50.780> back<00:00:50.960> to<00:00:51.139> our<00:00:51.229> customer<00:00:51.739> we're<00:00:52.549> able

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:52.639 
us to go back to our customer we're able

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:54.430 
us to go back to our customer we're able
to<00:00:52.909> go<00:00:53.030> back<00:00:53.179> and<00:00:53.389> offer<00:00:53.539> them<00:00:53.780> solutions<00:00:54.109> that

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
to go back and offer them solutions that

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.259 
to go back and offer them solutions that
we<00:00:54.530> couldn't<00:00:54.799> offer<00:00:54.859> them<00:00:55.100> before<00:00:55.429> so<00:00:56.120> this

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
we couldn't offer them before so this

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.289 
we couldn't offer them before so this
has<00:00:56.420> allowed<00:00:56.629> us<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:57.100> customize<00:00:58.100> our<00:00:58.609> boxes<00:00:59.119> to

00:00:59.289 --> 00:00:59.299 
has allowed us to customize our boxes to

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:00.819 
has allowed us to customize our boxes to
make<00:00:59.420> it<00:00:59.479> more<00:00:59.719> specific<00:01:00.199> to<00:01:00.319> what<00:01:00.350> they<00:01:00.589> want

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
make it more specific to what they want

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.859 
make it more specific to what they want
as<00:01:01.010> opposed<00:01:01.309> to<00:01:01.429> using<00:01:02.119> the<00:01:02.329> style<00:01:02.600> that<00:01:02.690> we

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:02.869 
as opposed to using the style that we

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:04.900 
as opposed to using the style that we
had<00:01:03.079> a<00:01:03.109> box<00:01:03.409> that<00:01:03.619> we<00:01:03.739> had<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:04.190> having<00:01:04.670> it<00:01:04.790> work

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
had a box that we had and having it work

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.730 
had a box that we had and having it work
for<00:01:05.090> their<00:01:05.180> application<00:01:05.780> going<00:01:06.230> from<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.590> two

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
for their application going from the two

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.320 
for their application going from the two
machines<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.280> one<00:01:07.430> machine<00:01:07.760> obviously<00:01:08.000> we

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
machines the one machine obviously we

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.630 
machines the one machine obviously we
saved<00:01:08.600> space<00:01:08.900> on<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.260> footprint<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:10.460> bigger

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
saved space on the footprint the bigger

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.310 
saved space on the footprint the bigger
savings<00:01:10.910> for<00:01:11.240> us<00:01:11.300> was<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:11.660> raw<00:01:11.780> material

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
savings for us was the raw material

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.320 
savings for us was the raw material
instead<00:01:12.740> of<00:01:12.860> bringing<00:01:13.100> in<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.280> sheet<00:01:13.520> size<00:01:13.790> of

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
instead of bringing in the sheet size of

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.990 
instead of bringing in the sheet size of
six<00:01:15.080> foot<00:01:15.290> by<00:01:15.440> 16<00:01:15.950> foot<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:16.460> trying<00:01:16.670> to<00:01:16.760> find

foot tall that we can stack and maneuver
around<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.270> plant<00:01:23.480> a<00:01:23.570> lot<00:01:23.720> easier<00:01:23.990> than<00:01:24.110> we

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
around the plant a lot easier than we

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.170 
around the plant a lot easier than we
were<00:01:24.350> before<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:25.190> also<00:01:25.340> allows<00:01:25.670> us<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.910> switch

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
were before it also allows us to switch

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.850 
were before it also allows us to switch
very<00:01:26.510> quickly<00:01:26.780> between<00:01:27.050> single<00:01:27.590> wall<00:01:27.680> and

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
very quickly between single wall and

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.530 
very quickly between single wall and
double<00:01:28.100> wall<00:01:28.250> all<00:01:28.760> we<00:01:28.880> have<00:01:28.970> to<00:01:29.090> do<00:01:29.180> is<00:01:29.300> program

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
double wall all we have to do is program

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.420 
double wall all we have to do is program
the<00:01:29.780> machine<00:01:30.110> hit<00:01:30.470> in<00:01:30.620> the<00:01:30.710> spec<00:01:30.980> that<00:01:31.130> we<00:01:31.220> want

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
the machine hit in the spec that we want

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.280 
the machine hit in the spec that we want
and<00:01:31.640> it<00:01:31.730> automatically<00:01:32.390> grabs<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:32.900> next<00:01:33.140> size

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
and it automatically grabs the next size

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.770 
and it automatically grabs the next size
material<00:01:33.470> instead<00:01:34.460> of<00:01:34.610> us<00:01:34.730> having<00:01:34.760> to<00:01:35.180> pull

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
material instead of us having to pull

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.300 
material instead of us having to pull
one<00:01:35.990> material<00:01:36.320> out<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:36.860> load<00:01:36.980> the<00:01:37.100> next

it from across the plant it's right here
it's<00:01:41.570> ready<00:01:41.780> to<00:01:41.900> go<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.740> other<00:01:42.890> big<00:01:43.100> advantage

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
it's ready to go the other big advantage

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.640 
it's ready to go the other big advantage
to<00:01:43.730> the<00:01:43.850> box<00:01:44.060> on<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.360> man<00:01:44.540> was<00:01:44.750> was<00:01:45.230> a<00:01:45.260> glueing

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
to the box on the man was was a glueing

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.070 
to the box on the man was was a glueing
system<00:01:45.980> that<00:01:46.100> came<00:01:46.220> with<00:01:46.460> it<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.930> old

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
system that came with it and the old

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.660 
system that came with it and the old
process<00:01:48.380> we<00:01:48.740> would<00:01:48.860> have<00:01:48.980> to<00:01:49.130> cut<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.460> box

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
process we would have to cut the box

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.090 
process we would have to cut the box
manually<00:01:50.420> glue<00:01:50.600> every<00:01:50.870> joint<00:01:51.140> weighed<00:01:51.980> it

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
manually glue every joint weighed it

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.220 
manually glue every joint weighed it
down<00:01:52.130> for<00:01:52.610> about<00:01:52.730> ten<00:01:53.000> minutes<00:01:53.150> we<00:01:54.080> have<00:01:54.200> a

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
down for about ten minutes we have a

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.500 
down for about ten minutes we have a
separate<00:01:54.620> process<00:01:55.130> of<00:01:55.280> glue<00:01:55.430> it<00:01:55.580> we<00:01:56.300> have<00:01:56.420> to

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
separate process of glue it we have to

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.870 
separate process of glue it we have to
take<00:01:56.690> it<00:01:56.810> back<00:01:56.990> off<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.470> restock<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:58.130> now<00:01:58.700> with

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
take it back off and restock it now with

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.490 
take it back off and restock it now with
the<00:01:59.030> gluer<00:01:59.240> we<00:01:59.600> could<00:01:59.750> actually<00:01:59.900> glue<00:02:00.380> it

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
the gluer we could actually glue it

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.990 
the gluer we could actually glue it
right<00:02:00.530> as<00:02:00.770> it<00:02:00.890> comes<00:02:01.070> off<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.370> machine

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
right as it comes off the machine

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.090 
right as it comes off the machine
it<00:02:02.300> sets<00:02:02.690> automatically<00:02:03.380> we<00:02:03.530> stack<00:02:03.770> it<00:02:03.800> on<00:02:03.979> the

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
it sets automatically we stack it on the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.440 
it sets automatically we stack it on the
pallet<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:04.550> we're<00:02:04.640> done<00:02:04.790> so<00:02:04.850> we<00:02:05.150> don't<00:02:05.300> have

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
pallet and we're done so we don't have

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.960 
pallet and we're done so we don't have
that<00:02:05.570> extra<00:02:05.840> stage<00:02:06.140> of<00:02:06.320> that<00:02:06.409> extra<00:02:06.710> person

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
that extra stage of that extra person

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.520 
that extra stage of that extra person
just<00:02:07.970> for<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.179> glue<00:02:08.359> process<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.439> other

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
just for the glue process the other

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.050 
just for the glue process the other
great<00:02:09.769> thing<00:02:09.979> about<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.340> machine<00:02:10.700> is<00:02:10.879> it's

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
great thing about the machine is it's

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.400 
great thing about the machine is it's
actually<00:02:11.239> leased

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
actually leased

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.900 
actually leased
not<00:02:12.680> purchased<00:02:13.190> so<00:02:13.340> we<00:02:13.430> had<00:02:13.520> no<00:02:13.700> capital

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
not purchased so we had no capital

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.030 
not purchased so we had no capital
expenditure<00:02:14.570> to<00:02:14.660> begin<00:02:14.930> with<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.800> it's

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
expenditure to begin with and it's

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.710 
expenditure to begin with and it's
actually<00:02:16.340> part<00:02:16.490> of<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.700> board<00:02:16.940> cost<00:02:17.210> which

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
actually part of the board cost which

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.480 
actually part of the board cost which
the<00:02:17.930> board<00:02:18.140> cost<00:02:18.380> was<00:02:18.560> actually<00:02:18.890> cheaper<00:02:19.070> than

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
the board cost was actually cheaper than

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.030 
the board cost was actually cheaper than
our<00:02:20.000> previous<00:02:20.180> supplier<00:02:20.780> we're<00:02:21.770> getting<00:02:21.980> a

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
our previous supplier we're getting a

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.100 
our previous supplier we're getting a
better<00:02:22.220> board<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:22.850> better<00:02:23.150> machine<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.900> we

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
better board a better machine and we

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.210 
better board a better machine and we
don't<00:02:24.260> have<00:02:24.350> to<00:02:24.440> put<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.710> upfront<00:02:24.860> capital

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
don't have to put the upfront capital

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.340 
don't have to put the upfront capital
into<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.670> machine<00:02:25.940> as<00:02:26.390> far<00:02:26.690> as<00:02:26.780> transition<00:02:27.290> in

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
into the machine as far as transition in

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.710 
into the machine as far as transition in
the<00:02:27.410> new<00:02:27.530> machine<00:02:27.890> we<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:29.060> was<00:02:29.180> very<00:02:29.390> very

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
the new machine we it was very very

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.750 
the new machine we it was very very
simple<00:02:30.110> very<00:02:30.230> easy<00:02:30.380> we<00:02:30.800> we<00:02:31.100> set<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.400> Machine

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
simple very easy we we set the Machine

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.970 
simple very easy we we set the Machine
up<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:32.360> technician<00:02:33.110> stuck<00:02:33.350> with<00:02:33.530> us<00:02:33.560> showed

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
up the technician stuck with us showed

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.170 
up the technician stuck with us showed
us<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.220> ins<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.520> outs<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.820> machine

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
us the ins and outs of the machine

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.420 
us the ins and outs of the machine
showed<00:02:35.990> us<00:02:36.080> how<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.260> maintain<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.710> work<00:02:37.250> with

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
showed us how to maintain it work with

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.070 
showed us how to maintain it work with
the<00:02:37.520> operators<00:02:37.970> for<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.180> couple<00:02:38.480> hours<00:02:38.540> and
