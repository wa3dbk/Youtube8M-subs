00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.580
 good evening and welcome here 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.260
 to our media discussion after our 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.030
 Home game against Fortuna Dusseldorf 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.590
 Thank you for your patience 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.630
 Saturday night players and a little longer 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.640
 many tv interviews were still too 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.590
 now we are here for you 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.660
 Of course, ours are very welcome 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.369
 guests from dÃ¼sseldorf a tip 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.720
 Coach norbert Meier does not 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.090
 so synonymous with his commentary on the game 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.289
 with yes congratulations to the fc schalke 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.329
 I think it was clear that the Schalke 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.880
 would try very much from the beginning 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.510
 pressure build up to play forward 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.250
 would 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.300
 they have then we shown 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.340
 have fallen back far too far 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.870
 to let 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.760
 but I think that we are ten 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.010
 minutes before the change then 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.739
 purposeful and also courageous after 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.690
 played in front and you as well 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.280
 already we could see that we were in 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.820
 the situation is also too promising here 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.289
 come 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.989
 the second half then has a whole 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.760
 another picture offered 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.739
 our team has much more courage 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.439
 has played the equalizer 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.850
 actually much has prevented it 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.340
 certainly not for the safety of 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.710
 opponents contributed to this compensation 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.110
 We achieved that but we have to 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.790
 also learn to reward us and the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.189
 The effort we have to operate is 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.360
 always huge 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.850
 Surely that did not affect us 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.710
 cards played the reisinger early 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.460
 out had not accrue cruz 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.110
 but in the end, you just have to 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.180
 in such a situation then wide awake 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.920
 stay and then you take thot in with you 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.119
 maybe surprising point though 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.299
 because of the performance in the second 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.250
 half-time certainly not undeserved point 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.530
 but we lost 21 and that's why 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.180
 also congratulations to my colleagues and 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.909
 to the fc schalke 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.880
 thanks to many thanks to Mr. meyer jens keller 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.670
 to write his comment or to 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.799
 a lot said the half-time 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.659
 we think we were very good there 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.799
 times played as well as we ourselves 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.670
 imagined 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.100
 We wanted to have early ball capture 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.970
 to defend forward wanted aggressively 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.710
 play 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.990
 i believe all these things have in the 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.060
 first half are optimally implemented 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.679
 then also rewarded with the goal 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.470
 we knew it today 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.709
 If you can then be patience game 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.840
 here of course 1 0 leads and with his 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.980
 superiority and then comes out of it 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.390
 break it is of course annoying 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.910
 Immediately after the break 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.890
 that would have made 2 0 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.610
 there we run four against two on the 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.920
 Goalkeeper to and seat collages in the at 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.569
 first contact and clean with 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.100
 Thus, the angle was a bit 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.470
 he pointed out that he still clean the ball 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.850
 but could play across nations 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.920
 half-time just have these things 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.530
 what the last weeks or games 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.290
 have defended well forward 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.110
 miss it aggressively so far 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.730
 let and the readiness to run 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.920
 naturally also in ball possession was not 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.540
 more because we better the situation 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.430
 could solve better 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.750
 but under the stroke we are easy 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.940
 Glad we then still the gate 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.459
 have done and here today 2 1 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.079
 have won many thanks jens keller 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.739

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.910

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.540

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.739
