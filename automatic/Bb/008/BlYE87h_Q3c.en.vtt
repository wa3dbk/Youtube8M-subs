00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.259
 Alexander purchased both cars in the spring 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:04.710
 I ordered more because in Russia 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.470

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.509
 model

 In Russian federation 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:12.070
 shipped in a similar bucha 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.299
 complete set 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:14.719
 but that which is offered 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.859
 a complete set that is 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.470
 standing on one 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.230
 but percent 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.230
 15 tons and 20 more expensive 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.770
 in the world car days are more interesting to me 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.840
 Alexander ventured to pay in advance 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.050
 the amount of one hundred and fifty thousand 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.949
 rubles began to wait when the new 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.720
 car will arrive in Russia 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.060
 everything happens very interesting 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.950
 you are applying for 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.190
 in the head on a certain model 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.230
 do you people start picking up inside 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.280
 the car 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.240
 I send to pick up either e 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.870
 mail 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.740
 you will already be paid for the car 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.640
 but they may not drive the car and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.770
 brought in the wrong 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.610
 qualities 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.610
 help to pick this one 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.920
 Alexander cut the car arrived 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.790
 after a month of reality turned out 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.399
 even better than in the photo 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.259
 but the main thing with documents was everything 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.390
 okay but in order to ride on 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.990
 car emigrant need to go

 customs clearance procedure graduate students of the seas 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.579
 it has become much more difficult 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:14.619
 car transport 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.180
 means also engine 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.430
 internal combustion 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.530

 environmental standard euro 5 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.770
 if the vehicle is not 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.160

 get pates to customs and 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.320
 accordingly and put it on record 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.150
 traffic police in this case, the direct road to 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.750
 fine parking so before you buy 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.840
 should check environmental 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.260

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.300
 New standard to release 2009 year 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.590

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.260
 that move across the border 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.560

 payments make out times just yours 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.710
 then moved across the border 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.450

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.430
 someone further in women 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.590
 so to say sacrifice in russia 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.400
 who sell the house and the car such 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.960

 year of production and cost than older 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:33.699
 more expensive the more the state duty and 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:35.789
