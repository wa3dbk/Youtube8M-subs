00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180

for you know that's what their sound is
like<00:02:54.300> that's<00:02:54.570> how<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.780> know<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.140> hotel<00:02:56.040> your<00:02:56.250> song

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
like that's how I know a hotel your song

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.010 
like that's how I know a hotel your song
and<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:57.030> wasn't<00:02:57.240> really<00:02:57.420> getting<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:57.840> when<00:02:57.990> I

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
and I wasn't really getting that when I

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.720 
and I wasn't really getting that when I
first<00:02:58.320> heard<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.800> band<00:02:59.010> when<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.250> first<00:02:59.550> heard

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
first heard the band when I first heard

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.040 
first heard the band when I first heard
them<00:02:59.910> I<00:02:59.970> thought<00:03:00.270> they<00:03:00.420> followed<00:03:00.870> the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
them I thought they followed the

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.230 
them I thought they followed the
blueprint<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.100> this<00:03:02.250> style<00:03:02.520> of<00:03:02.640> music<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:03.120> a

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
blueprint of this style of music just a

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.030 
blueprint of this style of music just a
little<00:03:03.540> too<00:03:03.780> close<00:03:04.200> for<00:03:04.230> comfort<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.860> the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
little too close for comfort to the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.070 
little too close for comfort to the
point<00:03:05.250> where<00:03:05.490> I<00:03:05.760> just<00:03:06.120> didn't<00:03:06.600> find<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.930> whole

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
point where I just didn't find a whole

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.810 
point where I just didn't find a whole
lot<00:03:07.290> about<00:03:07.320> them<00:03:07.680> that<00:03:07.920> was<00:03:08.160> memorable

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
lot about them that was memorable

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.820 
lot about them that was memorable
however<00:03:09.450> what<00:03:09.720> kind<00:03:09.960> of<00:03:10.020> made<00:03:10.170> me<00:03:10.380> change<00:03:10.650> my

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
however what kind of made me change my

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.490 
however what kind of made me change my
mind<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:11.340> revisit<00:03:11.820> this<00:03:11.940> LP<00:03:12.450> is<00:03:12.780> not<00:03:13.230> only

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
mind and revisit this LP is not only

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.230 
mind and revisit this LP is not only
were<00:03:13.650> tons<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.160> people<00:03:14.220> recommending<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.210> to

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
were tons of people recommending it to

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.290 
were tons of people recommending it to
me<00:03:15.510> every<00:03:16.440> chance<00:03:16.740> they<00:03:16.830> possibly<00:03:17.340> could<00:03:17.640> but

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
me every chance they possibly could but

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.530 
me every chance they possibly could but
also<00:03:18.710> I<00:03:19.710> think<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.550> songwriting<00:03:21.150> on<00:03:21.390> this

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
also I think the songwriting on this

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.450 
also I think the songwriting on this
thing<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:21.990> pretty<00:03:22.200> good<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.710> more<00:03:23.280> ambitious

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
thing is pretty good and more ambitious

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.940 
thing is pretty good and more ambitious
than<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.300> average<00:03:24.660> group<00:03:24.900> in<00:03:25.170> this<00:03:25.350> style<00:03:25.710> as

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
than the average group in this style as

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.890 
than the average group in this style as

element<00:04:48.820> of<00:04:49.170> blandness<00:04:50.170> in<00:04:50.530> my<00:04:50.800> opinion<00:04:51.250> as<00:04:51.400> I

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
element of blandness in my opinion as I

died<00:04:51.880> deeper<00:04:52.330> into<00:04:52.510> this<00:04:52.630> record<00:04:52.900> I'm<00:04:53.230> just

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
died deeper into this record I'm just

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.010 
died deeper into this record I'm just
not<00:04:53.560> even<00:04:53.770> finding<00:04:54.130> a<00:04:54.220> whole<00:04:54.430> lot<00:04:54.760> of<00:04:55.030> variety

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
not even finding a whole lot of variety

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.080 
not even finding a whole lot of variety
either<00:04:56.650> maybe<00:04:57.010> even<00:04:57.310> since<00:04:57.490> in<00:04:57.580> some<00:04:57.610> moments

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
either maybe even since in some moments

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.940 
either maybe even since in some moments
that<00:04:58.270> are<00:04:58.510> making<00:04:58.930> my<00:04:59.170> eyes<00:04:59.380> roll<00:04:59.710> a<00:04:59.740> little

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
that are making my eyes roll a little

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.770 
that are making my eyes roll a little
bit<00:05:00.250> like<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.760> song<00:05:00.940> live<00:05:01.180> in<00:05:01.270> drag<00:05:01.540> which

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
bit like the song live in drag which

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.120 
bit like the song live in drag which
seems<00:05:02.020> to<00:05:02.170> be<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:02.380> band<00:05:02.530> trying<00:05:02.860> their<00:05:03.010> hand

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
seems to be the band trying their hand

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.000 
seems to be the band trying their hand
at<00:05:03.370> like<00:05:03.490> a<00:05:03.520> screamo<00:05:04.120> track<00:05:04.480> but<00:05:05.290> the<00:05:05.530> riff<00:05:05.740> on

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
at like a screamo track but the riff on

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.070 
at like a screamo track but the riff on
this<00:05:06.310> song<00:05:06.550> only<00:05:06.850> really<00:05:07.300> ends<00:05:07.690> up<00:05:07.780> feeling

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
this song only really ends up feeling

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.710 
this song only really ends up feeling
like<00:05:08.290> a<00:05:08.650> bit<00:05:09.040> of<00:05:09.070> a<00:05:09.250> knockoff<00:05:09.910> of<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.390> guitar

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
like a bit of a knockoff of the guitar

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.020 
like a bit of a knockoff of the guitar
riff<00:05:10.990> on<00:05:11.260> the<00:05:11.290> La<00:05:11.710> Dispute<00:05:11.920> record<00:05:12.610> edit<00:05:12.790> your

riff on the La Dispute record edit your
hometown<00:05:13.540> or<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:14.110> really<00:05:14.320> Skippy<00:05:14.740> rhythm

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
hometown or the really Skippy rhythm

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.890 
hometown or the really Skippy rhythm
guitar<00:05:15.310> riff<00:05:15.520> on<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:15.790> track<00:05:16.000> your<00:05:16.300> deep<00:05:16.540> rest

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
guitar riff on the track your deep rest

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.690 
guitar riff on the track your deep rest
which<00:05:17.260> sounds<00:05:18.010> like<00:05:18.130> something<00:05:18.400> straight<00:05:18.640> out

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
which sounds like something straight out

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.820 
which sounds like something straight out
of<00:05:18.790> a<00:05:18.910> Third<00:05:19.180> Eye<00:05:19.390> Blind<00:05:19.420> song<00:05:20.200> and<00:05:20.470> that<00:05:20.560> vibe

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
of a Third Eye Blind song and that vibe

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.290 
of a Third Eye Blind song and that vibe
doesn't<00:05:21.040> really<00:05:21.310> change<00:05:21.370> up<00:05:21.790> when<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.120> song

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
doesn't really change up when the song

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.470 
doesn't really change up when the song
gets<00:05:22.510> deeper<00:05:22.930> into<00:05:23.320> the<00:05:23.560> verses<00:05:24.550> however<00:05:25.240> it

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
gets deeper into the verses however it

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.010 
gets deeper into the verses however it
was<00:05:25.990> kind<00:05:26.530> of<00:05:26.710> a<00:05:26.980> moving<00:05:27.970> when<00:05:28.360> I<00:05:28.390> listened<00:05:28.990> to
