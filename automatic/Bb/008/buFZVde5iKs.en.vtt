00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.529
 hub made 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.759
 in the basket itself the gear worn with 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.580
 tight around this is our bet on 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.020
 the basket rotates in order to 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.359
 to change the sense here it is 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.340
 the central part will be taken out there 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.039
 there will be another tricky sleeve under it 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.680
 I will make it later so that nothing 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.300
 new here we get with this 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.210
 so the parties here 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.910
 there will be another knock what will be 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:39.899
 rely on the inside of the bearings 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:41.870
 Andrei we also have the most important 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.780
 stock in place 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.460
 that is, chances without alterations without fat 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.160
 laying it all up for now 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.879
 Well, if you go further then 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.140
 it turns out somewhere about here in 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.100
 this place will be the center 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.870
 set fire to my cast under this case 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.939
 Well, I will find the size of it 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.610
 more precisely place here will be shorter 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.979
 installed threaded 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.830
 screwdriver stock and that's probably for the hole 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.869
 to drain the oil here is this control 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.990
 the version on will fix from chance 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.970
 it turns out then a lever on top and some 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.290
 cable stop this time will shrink 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.200
 and you squeeze the clutch 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.509
 so what we got in the final us 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.600
 it turned out that you will need to say more 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.909
 here is this little thing especially neat 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 and it will be necessary to drop here 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.790
 level and weld the basket in general 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.600
 settles on such a tricky one 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.030
 sleeve t-shaped with a step 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.579
 step on helps to keep here 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.189
 This side holds a picture of what 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:55.049
 it is placed in the autumn here here here 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:57.869
 still such study to basket here 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.329
 inside the pipe so completely worth it to 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.909
 between two brass bushings it all 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:07.320
 rotated that is accordingly so here 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.840
 this our i like the sleeve she presses 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.640
 like this Makar this teach your 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.080
 Bet well and the general assembly is such that 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.410
 dismantled the engine removed the old set 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.780
 throw this here sleeve top over old 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.480
 the picture here is natural bran and drives 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.090
 and this thing in the final all 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.700
 screwed everything you got 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:37.010
 clutch that's very backlash 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.010
 no basket rotates
