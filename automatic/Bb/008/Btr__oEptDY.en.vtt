Brescia ruins 300 a.m. which is here now

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.529 
Brescia ruins 300 a.m. which is here now
to<00:00:18.539> open<00:00:18.930> 300<00:00:19.590> AF<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:20.580> must<00:00:20.789> reach<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.270> warp

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
to open 300 AF you must reach the warp

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.290 
to open 300 AF you must reach the warp
gate<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.990> 5af<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.609> behind<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.090> locked

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
gate in the town area so you must find

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.460

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
the holding key style that's in this

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.190 
the holding key style that's in this
area<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.580> reach<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.970> warp<00:00:30.210> gate<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:31.140> 300<00:00:31.619> AF

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.450 
area to reach the warp gate to 300 AF
that<00:00:34.200> sounds<00:00:34.469> more<00:00:34.649> difficult<00:00:35.070> than<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.340> is

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
that sounds more difficult than it is

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.209 
that sounds more difficult than it is
it's<00:00:35.880> rather<00:00:36.149> simple<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:37.860> guys<00:00:38.010> need<00:00:38.190> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
it's rather simple the guys need a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.130 
it's rather simple the guys need a
better<00:00:38.460> break<00:00:38.940> down<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.300> could<00:00:39.480> record<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.020> quick

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
better break down I could record a quick

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.680 
better break down I could record a quick
video<00:00:40.350> for<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.739> but<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:41.760> now<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.420> for

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
video for that but for now this is for

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.470 
video for that but for now this is for
the<00:00:42.750> purple<00:00:43.050> chocobo<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.680> here<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:43.950> are<00:00:44.480> bring

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
the purple chocobo so here we are bring

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.670 
the purple chocobo so here we are bring
up<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> map<00:00:47.719> now<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.750> have<00:00:49.050> my<00:00:49.230> best<00:00:49.410> luck

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
up the map now I have my best luck

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.180 
up the map now I have my best luck
running<00:00:50.010> along<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.850> area<00:00:51.180> here<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.190> that's

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
running along this area here so that's

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.330 
running along this area here so that's
what<00:00:53.370> we're<00:00:53.489> gonna<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:54.980> along<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.010> narrow

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
what we're gonna do along that narrow

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.729 
what we're gonna do along that narrow
passage<00:00:56.760> right<00:00:56.940> here<00:00:57.120> around<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.600> corner<00:00:57.870> so

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
passage right here around this corner so

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.160 
passage right here around this corner so
just<00:00:58.920> run<00:00:59.100> back<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.280> forth<00:00:59.460> here

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.670 

you'll<00:01:03.859> mostly<00:01:04.280> get<00:01:04.519> these<00:01:04.939> guys<00:01:05.680> they're

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
you'll mostly get these guys they're

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.010 
you'll mostly get these guys they're
easy<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:07.040> runaway<00:01:07.280> thumbs<00:01:07.640> just<00:01:07.850> do<00:01:07.970> that<00:01:08.150> so

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
easy to runaway thumbs just do that so

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.840 
easy to runaway thumbs just do that so
just<00:01:09.049> keep<00:01:09.320> this<00:01:09.439> up<00:01:09.650> to<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.100> purple<00:01:10.340> chocobo

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
just keep this up to the purple chocobo

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:20.810 
just keep this up to the purple chocobo
decides<00:01:11.450> to<00:01:11.570> pop<00:01:11.750> up

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.160 

which<00:01:21.420> may<00:01:21.660> take<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.960> couple<00:01:23.390> spawns<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.810> he'll

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
which may take a couple spawns but he'll

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.130 
which may take a couple spawns but he'll
come<00:01:25.320> up<00:01:25.440> eventually

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.510 

so<00:01:31.890> there<00:01:32.130> is

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.120 

even<00:01:37.090> though<00:01:37.210> he<00:01:37.360> looks<00:01:37.510> blue<00:01:38.010> guessing<00:01:39.010> just

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
even though he looks blue guessing just

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.899 
even though he looks blue guessing just
does<00:01:39.310> it<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.520> snow

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.270 

so<00:01:46.909> he<00:01:47.000> does<00:01:47.179> have<00:01:47.210> a<00:01:47.359> heel<00:01:47.659> so<00:01:48.100> watch<00:01:49.100> out<00:01:49.250> for

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
so he does have a heel so watch out for

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.980 
so he does have a heel so watch out for
that<00:01:49.429> and<00:01:49.759> he<00:01:49.880> can<00:01:50.060> actually<00:01:50.450> flee<00:01:50.780> from

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
that and he can actually flee from

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.169 
that and he can actually flee from
battles<00:01:51.350> but<00:01:52.189> that<00:01:52.399> didn't<00:01:52.640> happen<00:01:52.729> very<00:01:52.939> much

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
battles but that didn't happen very much

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.630 
battles but that didn't happen very much
I<00:01:53.539> actually<00:01:53.630> had<00:01:53.929> to<00:01:54.020> fight<00:01:54.049> him<00:01:54.520> quite<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.549> few

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
I actually had to fight him quite a few

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.700 
I actually had to fight him quite a few
times<00:01:55.789> I<00:01:56.210> say<00:01:56.359> six<00:01:56.689> or<00:01:56.810> seven<00:01:57.049> tries<00:01:57.229> before<00:01:57.469> I

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
times I say six or seven tries before I

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:05.100 
times I say six or seven tries before I
finally<00:01:58.039> got<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.310> crystal

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.780 

and<00:02:06.110> as<00:02:06.230> always<00:02:06.440> if<00:02:07.010> you<00:02:07.220> can't<00:02:07.460> kill<00:02:07.730> them

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
and as always if you can't kill them

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.300 
and as always if you can't kill them
with<00:02:07.940> a<00:02:07.970> Ferro<00:02:08.270> link<00:02:08.860> they'll<00:02:09.860> better<00:02:10.100> your

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
with a Ferro link they'll better your

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.590 
with a Ferro link they'll better your
chances<00:02:10.670> of<00:02:10.729> grabbing<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.480> crystal<00:02:13.090> but<00:02:14.090> it

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
chances of grabbing the crystal but it

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:32.050 
chances of grabbing the crystal but it
is<00:02:14.720> not<00:02:14.840> necessary<00:02:15.470> as<00:02:16.040> you'll<00:02:16.250> see<00:02:16.400> here

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:44.920 

there<00:02:33.060> we<00:02:33.180> go<00:02:33.300> got<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.810> finally

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.600

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
so let's go ahead and bring up the map

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.910 
so let's go ahead and bring up the map
one<00:02:46.819> more<00:02:46.970> time<00:02:47.379> show<00:02:48.379> my<00:02:48.530> current<00:02:48.860> location

one more time show my current location
where<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:49.489> got<00:02:49.670> them<00:02:49.790> from<00:02:50.200> there's<00:02:51.200> a<00:02:51.290> whole

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
where I got them from there's a whole

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.690 
where I got them from there's a whole
map<00:02:51.739> zoomed<00:02:52.730> in<00:02:52.939> here<00:02:54.220> yeah<00:02:55.220> let's<00:02:55.280> check<00:02:55.430> them

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
map zoomed in here yeah let's check them

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.229 
map zoomed in here yeah let's check them
out<00:02:59.470> there<00:03:00.470> he<00:03:00.590> is

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
out there he is
