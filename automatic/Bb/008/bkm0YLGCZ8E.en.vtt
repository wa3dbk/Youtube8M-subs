this is a brake caliper front axle on an
LD<00:00:06.569> V<00:00:06.779> van<00:00:07.140> now<00:00:07.769> this<00:00:08.639> will<00:00:09.089> be<00:00:09.360> relevant<00:00:09.540> to

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
LD V van now this will be relevant to

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.589 
LD V van now this will be relevant to
Land<00:00:10.080> Rover<00:00:10.320> because<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:10.980> itself<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:12.299> a

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
Land Rover because this itself is of a

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.790 
Land Rover because this itself is of a
defender<00:00:13.559> okay<00:00:14.429> they<00:00:14.639> do<00:00:14.700> fit<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.539> axles<00:00:16.049> this

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
defender okay they do fit the axles this

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.280 
defender okay they do fit the axles this
has<00:00:17.040> a<00:00:17.070> single<00:00:17.550> line<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:18.030> the<00:00:18.120> caliper<00:00:18.450> some<00:00:19.170> of

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290 
has a single line to the caliper some of

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.890 
has a single line to the caliper some of
them<00:00:19.410> have<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.620> twin<00:00:19.920> line<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.630> this<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.780> an

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
them have a twin line and this is an

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.320 
them have a twin line and this is an
older<00:00:22.260> caliper<00:00:22.740> design<00:00:23.100> which<00:00:23.730> also<00:00:23.940> has<00:00:24.300> a

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
older caliper design which also has a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.540 
older caliper design which also has a
single<00:00:24.780> line<00:00:24.960> now<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.890> can<00:00:26.040> see<00:00:26.190> the<00:00:26.310> blank

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
single line now you can see the blank

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.650 
single line now you can see the blank
for<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.820> doubles<00:00:27.210> there

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
for the doubles there

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.380 
for the doubles there
however<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.740> one's<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.190> single<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.270> is

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
however this one's a single and this is

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.580 
however this one's a single and this is
also<00:00:30.750> off<00:00:30.930> a<00:00:31.140> defender<00:00:32.060> right<00:00:33.060> a<00:00:33.420> caliper<00:00:34.290> here

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
also off a defender right a caliper here

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.070 
also off a defender right a caliper here
you<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:35.460> see<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.970> this<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> bracket<00:00:36.690> off

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
you can see that this is the bracket off

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.280 
you can see that this is the bracket off
the<00:00:37.290> defender<00:00:37.830> this<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.000> twin<00:00:39.480> line<00:00:39.720> system

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the defender this is a twin line system

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.340 
the defender this is a twin line system
as<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.220> see<00:00:41.460> here<00:00:41.880> it's<00:00:42.510> got<00:00:42.660> twin<00:00:43.079> lines

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
as we can see here it's got twin lines

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.510 
as we can see here it's got twin lines
and<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.770> little<00:00:44.070> bit<00:00:44.220> more<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
and it's a little bit more of a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.970 
and it's a little bit more of a
complicated<00:00:44.880> caliper<00:00:45.630> if<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.560> ever<00:00:46.739> come

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
complicated caliper if you ever come

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.250 
complicated caliper if you ever come
across<00:00:47.130> one<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.550> these<00:00:47.700> calipers<00:00:48.150> you<00:00:48.900> need<00:00:49.110> to

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
across one of these calipers you need to

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.250 
across one of these calipers you need to
bleed<00:00:49.650> out<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.980> Pistons<00:00:50.460> first<00:00:50.970> before<00:00:51.750> you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
bleed out the Pistons first before you

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.979 
bleed out the Pistons first before you
bleed<00:00:52.680> out<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.130> main<00:00:53.370> body<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.420> I'll<00:00:54.720> show

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
bleed out the main body and I'll show

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.770 
bleed out the main body and I'll show
you<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.470> in<00:00:55.800> later<00:00:56.040> tutorial<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.450> twin

ones you do have and then you can go

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.389 
ones you do have and then you can go
ahead<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.020> order<00:01:58.169> them<00:01:58.439> when<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.770> get<00:01:59.099> your

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
ahead and order them when you get your

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.899 
ahead and order them when you get your
pads<00:01:59.819> for<00:02:00.240> your<00:02:00.389> calipers<00:02:01.609> rather<00:02:02.609> than

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
pads for your calipers rather than

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.330 
pads for your calipers rather than
actually<00:02:03.270> using<00:02:03.719> holes<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.560> pads<00:02:04.799> itself

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
actually using holes in the pads itself

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.730 
actually using holes in the pads itself
like<00:02:05.579> we<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:05.849> in<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.090> first<00:02:06.359> set<00:02:06.810> we're

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
like we have in the first set we're

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.429 
like we have in the first set we're
looking<00:02:08.190> at<00:02:08.340> these<00:02:08.610> anti-rattle<00:02:09.420> clips<00:02:10.079> that

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:10.439 
looking at these anti-rattle clips that

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.030

are retaining the pads in place

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.770 
are retaining the pads in place
they're<00:02:13.400> quite<00:02:13.610> easy<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:14.000> distinguish<00:02:14.600> when

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
they're quite easy to distinguish when

you look at the vehicle whichever way
you<00:02:17.450> use<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.840> either<00:02:18.170> pad<00:02:18.530> will<00:02:18.680> fit<00:02:18.860> the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
you use it either pad will fit the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.560 
you use it either pad will fit the
calipers<00:02:19.520> but<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.820> need<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.180> retaining

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
calipers but you need the retaining

calipers but you need the retaining
clips<00:02:20.990> for<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.410> right<00:02:21.620> pads<00:02:22.780> either<00:02:23.780> way<00:02:24.080> both

and this is a really shitty pipe and

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
and this is a really shitty pipe and
that<00:02:36.230> needs<00:02:36.500> replacing

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
will use a normal bolt with a normal

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.330 
will use a normal bolt with a normal
head<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.959> it's<00:03:48.080> very<00:03:48.470> difficult<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.190> actually

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340
