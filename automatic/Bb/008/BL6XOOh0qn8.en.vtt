straight and steady I usually rest my
hands<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> sides<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.570> tub<00:01:48.810> because

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
hands on the sides of the tub because

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.899 
hands on the sides of the tub because
you<00:01:49.200> want<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> hold<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.680> nice<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:49.890> level<00:01:50.220> as<00:01:50.610> it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
you want to hold it nice and level as it

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.389 
you want to hold it nice and level as it
drains<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.329> water<00:01:51.600> out<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.189> see

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
drains the water out and you can see

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.080 
drains the water out and you can see
already<00:01:54.799> it's<00:01:55.799> mostly<00:01:56.340> done<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.880> hear

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
already it's mostly done you can hear

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.050 
already it's mostly done you can hear
that<00:01:57.240> dripping<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:58.549> then<00:01:59.549> what<00:01:59.700> I'll<00:01:59.790> do<00:01:59.939> is

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
that dripping and then what I'll do is

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.270 
that dripping and then what I'll do is
I'll<00:02:00.149> tilt<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.719> one<00:02:00.840> end<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.259> drain<00:02:02.250> a

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
I'll tilt it to one end to drain a

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.240 
I'll tilt it to one end to drain a
little<00:02:02.610> bit<00:02:02.729> more<00:02:02.909> water<00:02:03.090> out<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.920> see<00:02:05.100> how

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
little bit more water out and see how

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.880 
little bit more water out and see how
much<00:02:05.399> red<00:02:05.729> water<00:02:05.969> gets<00:02:06.299> stone<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.719> there

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
much red water gets stone in there

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.750 
much red water gets stone in there
and<00:02:08.070> you'll<00:02:08.880> see<00:02:09.149> your<00:02:09.330> color<00:02:09.600> in<00:02:09.990> your<00:02:10.259> water

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
and you'll see your color in your water

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.300 
and you'll see your color in your water
definitely<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:12.140> usually<00:02:13.140> change<00:02:13.440> like<00:02:13.950> if<00:02:14.130> I'd

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
definitely I usually change like if I'd

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.040 
definitely I usually change like if I'd
was<00:02:14.490> going<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.730> change<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> blue<00:02:15.570> paper<00:02:15.810> or

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
was going to change to a blue paper or

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.270 
was going to change to a blue paper or
something<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.560> know<00:02:16.680> then<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:17.010> kind<00:02:17.190> of

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
something you know then you kind of

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.460 
something you know then you kind of
rinse<00:02:17.490> everything<00:02:17.760> off<00:02:18.210> empty<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.050> bucket

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
of pray press nice and hard and I flip

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.400 
of pray press nice and hard and I flip
the<00:03:45.900> sponge<00:03:46.170> over<00:03:46.560> do<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.310> other<00:03:47.460> half

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
the sponge over do the other half

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.600 
the sponge over do the other half
pressing<00:03:49.410> nice<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.800> hard<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.190> just<00:03:50.280> getting

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
pressing nice and hard and just getting

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.020 
pressing nice and hard and just getting
the<00:03:51.200> majority<00:03:52.200> of<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.410> water<00:03:52.680> out<00:03:53.030> another

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
the majority of that water out another

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.640 
the majority of that water out another
reason<00:03:54.390> why<00:03:54.480> we<00:03:54.660> like<00:03:54.840> this<00:03:55.020> punish<00:03:55.440> because

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
reason why we like this punish because

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.650 
reason why we like this punish because
with<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.430> little<00:03:56.730> one<00:03:56.910> that<00:03:56.940> comes<00:03:57.240> with<00:03:57.330> it

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
with the little one that comes with it

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.290 
with the little one that comes with it
you're<00:03:57.840> constantly<00:03:58.440> wringing<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.100> out<00:03:59.310> yeah

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
you're constantly wringing it out yeah

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.820 
you're constantly wringing it out yeah
that's<00:04:00.540> why<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.780> thickness<00:04:01.230> of<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:01.530> is<00:04:01.680> so

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
that's why the thickness of this is so

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.800 
that's why the thickness of this is so
nice<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.250> holds<00:04:02.520> a<00:04:02.580> lot<00:04:02.730> more<00:04:02.910> water<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.450> it

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
nice it holds a lot more water and it

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.590 
nice it holds a lot more water and it
gets<00:04:03.930> very<00:04:04.110> fine<00:04:04.500> by<00:04:04.800> and<00:04:05.190> yeah<00:04:05.460> so<00:04:06.210> it<00:04:06.330> soaks

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
gets very fine by and yeah so it soaks

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.630 
gets very fine by and yeah so it soaks
up<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:06.990> lot<00:04:07.200> and<00:04:07.470> then<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:07.620> just<00:04:07.980> ring<00:04:08.220> this<00:04:08.340> out

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
up a lot and then you just ring this out

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.320 
up a lot and then you just ring this out
and<00:04:09.830> it's<00:04:10.830> very<00:04:11.100> tough<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.790> can<00:04:11.940> wring<00:04:12.150> on

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
and it's very tough you can wring on

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.610 
and it's very tough you can wring on
this<00:04:12.510> thing<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:12.900> it's<00:04:13.020> not<00:04:13.110> going<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.470> fall

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
this thing and it's not going to fall

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.820 
this thing and it's not going to fall
apart<00:04:14.480> get<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.690> water<00:04:15.900> out<00:04:16.049> I'm<00:04:16.560> going<00:04:16.739> to

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
apart get that water out I'm going to

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.140 
apart get that water out I'm going to
put<00:04:17.040> back<00:04:17.160> over<00:04:17.489> there<00:04:17.610> and<00:04:17.760> then<00:04:17.880> I<00:04:17.940> usually

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
put back over there and then I usually

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.510 
put back over there and then I usually
use<00:04:18.510> my<00:04:18.660> fist<00:04:19.640> to<00:04:20.640> really<00:04:21.209> press<00:04:21.540> down<00:04:21.840> hard

and get the rest of that water out and
then<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:28.620> flip<00:04:28.950> it<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:29.310> do<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.610> other<00:04:29.640> side
