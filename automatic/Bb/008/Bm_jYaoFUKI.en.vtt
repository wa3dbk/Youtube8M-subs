series<00:00:09.820> we're<00:00:10.820> going<00:00:10.850> to<00:00:11.000> talk<00:00:11.120> about<00:00:11.240> triads

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
series we're going to talk about triads

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.240 
series we're going to talk about triads
today<00:00:13.660> basically<00:00:14.770> it<00:00:15.770> gives<00:00:15.920> you<00:00:16.039> a<00:00:16.100> lot<00:00:16.190> of

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
today basically it gives you a lot of

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.100 
today basically it gives you a lot of
flexibility<00:00:16.910> to<00:00:17.330> move<00:00:17.449> all<00:00:17.600> over<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:17.900> neck

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
flexibility to move all over the neck

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.930 
flexibility to move all over the neck
now<00:00:18.410> lightens<00:00:19.039> up<00:00:19.130> a<00:00:19.250> lot<00:00:19.369> of<00:00:19.460> the<00:00:19.520> chords<00:00:19.850> from

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
now lightens up a lot of the chords from

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.090 
now lightens up a lot of the chords from
the<00:00:20.090> typical<00:00:20.270> power<00:00:20.600> chords<00:00:21.110> and<00:00:21.320> stuff<00:00:21.950> like

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
the typical power chords and stuff like

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.470 
the typical power chords and stuff like
that<00:00:22.300> so<00:00:23.770> if<00:00:24.770> we<00:00:24.980> think<00:00:25.340> about<00:00:25.670> say<00:00:26.180> crazy

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
that so if we think about say crazy

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.380 
that so if we think about say crazy
train<00:00:26.810> in<00:00:27.290> the<00:00:27.350> verse<00:00:27.700> the<00:00:28.700> chords<00:00:29.270> are

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
train in the verse the chords are

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.310 
train in the verse the chords are
basically<00:00:29.660> a<00:00:29.900> ed<00:00:30.740> and<00:00:31.039> a<00:00:31.220> so<00:00:32.059> as<00:00:32.329> a<00:00:32.419> open<00:00:33.079> court

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
basically a ed and a so as a open court

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.049 
basically a ed and a so as a open court
it<00:00:33.440> would<00:00:33.500> be<00:00:33.820> something<00:00:34.820> like<00:00:34.940> this<00:00:35.210> would<00:00:35.450> be

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
it would be something like this would be

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.500 
it would be something like this would be
I'm<00:00:38.059> sorry<00:00:38.329> a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.850 

now<00:00:44.510> you're<00:00:44.960> kind<00:00:45.110> of<00:00:45.170> moving<00:00:45.350> all<00:00:45.470> over<00:00:45.500> there

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
now you're kind of moving all over there

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.380 
now you're kind of moving all over there
I<00:00:46.070> mean<00:00:46.310> it's<00:00:46.460> in<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.640> open<00:00:46.910> position<00:00:46.940> but

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
I mean it's in the open position but

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.000 
I mean it's in the open position but
you're<00:00:47.510> you're<00:00:47.750> moving<00:00:48.080> so<00:00:48.260> what<00:00:48.770> we'd<00:00:48.920> like

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
you're you're moving so what we'd like

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.500 
you're you're moving so what we'd like
to<00:00:49.100> do<00:00:49.280> with<00:00:49.400> the<00:00:49.490> inversions<00:00:49.940> in<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.150> Triads

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
to do with the inversions in the Triads

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.780 
to do with the inversions in the Triads
is<00:00:50.660> we<00:00:50.810> can<00:00:50.960> use<00:00:51.770> voice<00:00:52.010> leading<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:52.610> there's

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
is we can use voice leading so there's

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.540 
is we can use voice leading so there's
not<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:52.970> lot<00:00:53.120> of<00:00:53.150> moving<00:00:53.510> between<00:00:53.690> me<00:00:54.550> between

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
not a lot of moving between me between

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.550 
not a lot of moving between me between
the<00:00:55.640> chords<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:56.210> if<00:00:56.960> we<00:00:57.080> think<00:00:57.200> about<00:00:57.320> what

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
the chords so if we think about what

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.800 
the chords so if we think about what
Randy<00:00:57.830> Rhoads<00:00:57.950> was<00:00:58.100> doing<00:00:58.430> he<00:00:59.030> took<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.630> same

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
Randy Rhoads was doing he took the same

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.690 
Randy Rhoads was doing he took the same
cause<00:01:00.110> he<00:01:00.320> just<00:01:00.920> did<00:01:01.070> them<00:01:01.190> up<00:01:01.250> here<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:01.640> we

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
cause he just did them up here so we

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.080 
cause he just did them up here so we
went<00:01:04.960> so<00:01:05.960> it's<00:01:06.320> just<00:01:06.560> a<00:01:06.740> downward<00:01:07.640> movement

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
went so it's just a downward movement

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.520 
went so it's just a downward movement
from<00:01:08.330> one<00:01:08.390> part<00:01:08.810> to<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.020> next<00:01:09.760> very<00:01:10.760> smooth<00:01:11.530> we

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
from one part to the next very smooth we

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.820 
from one part to the next very smooth we
can<00:01:12.680> also<00:01:12.800> move<00:01:13.430> that<00:01:13.640> up<00:01:13.760> even<00:01:14.030> further<00:01:14.500> so<00:01:15.500> we

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
can also move that up even further so we

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:26.580 
can also move that up even further so we
could<00:01:16.369> go<00:01:20.020> we<00:01:21.020> take<00:01:21.170> that<00:01:21.350> up<00:01:21.440> even<00:01:21.650> higher

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.320 

I've<00:01:27.590> got<00:01:27.800> this<00:01:27.920> tab<00:01:28.370> on<00:01:28.550> my<00:01:28.670> website<00:01:29.090> will

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
I've got this tab on my website will

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.920 
I've got this tab on my website will
Chris<00:01:29.540> key<00:01:29.690> calm<00:01:30.080> you<00:01:30.290> can<00:01:30.590> check<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:30.800> out

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
Chris key calm you can check that out

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.190 
Chris key calm you can check that out
I've<00:01:32.930> shown<00:01:33.170> other<00:01:33.440> inversions<00:01:33.950> of<00:01:34.150> a

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
I've shown other inversions of a

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.570 
I've shown other inversions of a
starting<00:01:36.200> on<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.380> lobe<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:36.830> want<00:01:37.070> to<00:01:37.160> take

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
starting on the lobe so you want to take

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.730 
starting on the lobe so you want to take
a<00:01:37.640> triad<00:01:38.000> in<00:01:38.390> all<00:01:38.630> its<00:01:38.810> inversion<00:01:39.320> so<00:01:39.530> you<00:01:39.620> can

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
a triad in all its inversion so you can

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.450 
a triad in all its inversion so you can
take<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.010> a<00:01:40.330> start<00:01:41.330> down<00:01:41.540> low<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.340> move<00:01:43.340> it

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
take the a start down low and move it

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.270 
take the a start down low and move it
off<00:01:43.780> like<00:01:44.780> that<00:01:44.960> my<00:01:45.470> show<00:01:45.680> up<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.040> down<00:01:46.160> the

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
off like that my show up and down the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.820 
off like that my show up and down the
back<00:01:46.460> on<00:01:46.640> each<00:01:46.820> set<00:01:47.060> of<00:01:47.090> three<00:01:47.390> strings<00:01:47.720> up<00:01:48.530> you

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
back on each set of three strings up you

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.640 
back on each set of three strings up you
know<00:01:48.920> I'll<00:01:49.040> pass<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.430> 12th<00:01:49.730> fret<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.290> i<00:01:51.290> would

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
know I'll pass the 12th fret and i would

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.080 
know I'll pass the 12th fret and i would
suggest<00:01:51.800> taking<00:01:52.280> some<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:52.640> your<00:01:52.790> favorite

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
tunes and taking them from the power

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.060 
tunes and taking them from the power
cord<00:01:56.450> type<00:01:56.690> thing<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:59.380> moving<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.680> you

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
cord type thing and moving it to you

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.880 
cord type thing and moving it to you
know<00:02:01.190> triads<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.290> it<00:02:03.290> also<00:02:03.440> helps<00:02:03.740> if<00:02:03.830> you

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
know triads and and it also helps if you

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.200 
know triads and and it also helps if you
want<00:02:04.040> to<00:02:04.130> double<00:02:04.430> sum<00:02:04.610> of<00:02:04.700> your<00:02:04.760> parts<00:02:04.820> if

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
want to double sum of your parts if

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.490 
want to double sum of your parts if
you're<00:02:05.330> recording<00:02:05.600> songs<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:06.290> you<00:02:06.380> could

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
you're recording songs that you could

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.800 
you're recording songs that you could
take<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.490> chords<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:08.270> move<00:02:08.390> them<00:02:08.510> up<00:02:08.630> the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
take the chords and move them up the

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.840 
take the chords and move them up the
neck<00:02:08.990> and<00:02:09.260> you<00:02:09.740> can<00:02:09.860> also<00:02:10.010> use<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:10.399> for<00:02:10.610> solo

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
neck and you can also use it for solo

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.700 
neck and you can also use it for solo
and<00:02:11.090> when<00:02:11.240> you<00:02:11.330> think<00:02:11.510> about<00:02:11.570> sort<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.620> the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
and when you think about sort of the
