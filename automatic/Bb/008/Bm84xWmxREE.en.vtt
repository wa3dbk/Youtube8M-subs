would<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> wheel<00:00:58.710> arches<00:00:59.039> which<00:00:59.339> some<00:00:59.550> of

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
would be the wheel arches which some of

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.970 
would be the wheel arches which some of
you<00:00:59.760> may<00:00:59.940> recognize<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:01.079> being<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.530> windscreen

Cooper<00:01:34.579> ways<00:01:35.579> we've<00:01:35.759> done<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.119> for<00:01:36.180> example

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
Cooper ways we've done this for example

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.109 
Cooper ways we've done this for example
of<00:01:36.960> curving<00:01:37.619> up<00:01:37.740> from<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.219> wheel<00:01:38.640> arch<00:01:38.880> here

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
of curving up from the wheel arch here

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.200 
of curving up from the wheel arch here
up<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.570> light<00:01:39.780> also<00:01:40.229> we've<00:01:41.149> managed<00:01:42.149> to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
up to the light also we've managed to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.330 
up to the light also we've managed to
keep<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.719> curve<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.409> shoulder<00:01:43.829> going<00:01:44.130> for

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
keep the curve of the shoulder going for

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.560 
keep the curve of the shoulder going for
all<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> way<00:01:44.610> from<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.850> back<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> front

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
all the way from the back to the front

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.730 
all the way from the back to the front
we've<00:01:46.110> actually<00:01:46.229> used<00:01:46.469> an<00:01:46.560> interesting

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
we've actually used an interesting

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.039 
we've actually used an interesting
building<00:01:47.250> technique<00:01:47.579> down<00:01:47.789> here<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.840> some<00:01:48.960> of

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
building technique down here but some of

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.389 
building technique down here but some of
you<00:01:49.140> guys<00:01:49.289> will<00:01:49.500> understand<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.159> when<00:01:50.340> you

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
you guys will understand that when you

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.399 
you guys will understand that when you
build<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.729> yourselves<00:01:51.060> also<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.229> bow

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
what you can also do there's open up the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.199 
what you can also do there's open up the
base<00:02:34.889> here<00:02:35.189> and<00:02:35.370> then<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.879> actually<00:02:35.969> have<00:02:36.120> a

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
base here and then you actually have a

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.520 
base here and then you actually have a
spare<00:02:36.510> wheel<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:37.049> the<00:02:37.230> back<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.319> is<00:02:40.439> the
