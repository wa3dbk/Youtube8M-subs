source which we call the modeling light
here<00:06:04.120> we<00:06:04.270> have<00:06:04.480> a<00:06:04.510> fluorescent<00:06:05.350> modeling<00:06:05.860> life

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
here we have a fluorescent modeling life

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.910 
here we have a fluorescent modeling life
so<00:06:06.700> that<00:06:06.910> it<00:06:07.120> will<00:06:07.270> be<00:06:07.330> cooler<00:06:07.900> for<00:06:08.530> the<00:06:08.560> flash

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:08.920 
so that it will be cooler for the flash

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.630 
so that it will be cooler for the flash
unit<00:06:09.430> a<00:06:09.990> strobe<00:06:10.990> or<00:06:11.200> flash<00:06:11.530> is<00:06:11.830> a<00:06:11.860> burst<00:06:12.430> of

of<00:06:18.250> light<00:06:18.520> is<00:06:18.910> like<00:06:19.510> a<00:06:19.540> lightning<00:06:20.230> bolt<00:06:20.260> it<00:06:20.860> is

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
of light is like a lightning bolt it is

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.850 
of light is like a lightning bolt it is
sudden<00:06:22.030> it<00:06:22.270> could<00:06:22.570> be<00:06:22.690> as<00:06:22.810> short<00:06:23.110> as<00:06:23.350> 15

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860

heat<00:06:46.210> is<00:06:46.419> an<00:06:46.900> issue<00:06:47.140> and<00:06:47.560> with<00:06:48.160> some<00:06:48.460> high-end

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:48.940 
heat is an issue and with some high-end

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.090 
models if it gets too hard the flash
will<00:06:52.120> automatically<00:06:52.810> shut<00:06:53.110> down<00:06:53.140> so<00:06:53.650> it<00:06:53.800> can
