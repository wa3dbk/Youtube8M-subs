00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
like my arms as I said my actual

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.649 
like my arms as I said my actual
forearms<00:01:48.799> are<00:01:49.799> actually<00:01:50.340> very<00:01:50.759> very<00:01:51.030> firm

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
I've never had this feeling before with

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
I've never had this feeling before with
any<00:01:53.729> product<00:01:54.270> or<00:01:55.219> you<00:01:56.219> know<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:56.369> ever<00:01:56.820> dunno

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
any product or you know just ever dunno

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.149 
any product or you know just ever dunno
why<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.200> but<00:01:58.920> guess<00:01:59.850> that's<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.149> good<00:02:00.299> sign

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
why that is but guess that's a good sign

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.700 
why that is but guess that's a good sign
my<00:02:02.159> theory<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.640> probably<00:02:03.119> got<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:04.229> do<00:02:04.350> with<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
my theory is probably got to do with the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.779 
my theory is probably got to do with the
opening<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:06.530> 84<00:02:07.530> not<00:02:07.920> gonna<00:02:08.039> lie<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.729> a

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
opening of 84 not gonna lie that is a

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.130 
opening of 84 not gonna lie that is a
bit<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.209> bitch

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
bit of a bitch

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.480 
bit of a bitch
