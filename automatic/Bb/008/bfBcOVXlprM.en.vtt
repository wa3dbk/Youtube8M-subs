00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
I'll be showing you some tricks for me

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.300 
I'll be showing you some tricks for me
and<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:06.439> the<00:02:07.439> reason<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.770> can't<00:02:08.039> do<00:02:08.190> many

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
and you the reason I can't do many

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.430 
and you the reason I can't do many
tricks<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:09.420> manuals<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.050> no<00:02:10.170> demands

tricks like manuals and no demands

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.050 
tricks like manuals and no demands
because<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.009> could<00:02:11.130> kind<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.400> tell<00:02:11.610> there's<00:02:11.910> no

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
because it could kind of tell there's no

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.990 
because it could kind of tell there's no
tail<00:02:12.360> or<00:02:12.750> nose<00:02:13.410> there's<00:02:14.250> also<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.640> small

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
tail or nose there's also a small

00:02:15.000 --> 00:03:45.300 
tail or nose there's also a small
platform

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310
