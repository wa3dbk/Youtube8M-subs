00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
storyboard is a range of options here I

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.690 
storyboard is a range of options here I
couldn't<00:00:40.440> stop<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.430> little

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
to do some bugs and this one here is

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.510 
to do some bugs and this one here is
supposed<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.000> simulate<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.629> ladybug<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.620> we

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
supposed to simulate a ladybug and we

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.850 
supposed to simulate a ladybug and we
have<00:00:50.760> one<00:00:51.180> that's<00:00:51.420> completed<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.590> just

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
have one that's completed and I just

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.630 
have one that's completed and I just
added<00:00:53.160> iron-on<00:00:54.090> crystals<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.199> simply<00:00:56.190> put

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
added iron-on crystals and simply put

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.760 
added iron-on crystals and simply put
the<00:00:56.760> iron<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:57.180> crystals<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.989> create<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
the iron on crystals to create the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.060 
the iron on crystals to create the
little<00:00:58.980> yoke<00:00:59.690> ladybug<00:01:00.719> but<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.350> had<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:02.039> a

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
little yoke ladybug but I had to do a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.579 
little yoke ladybug but I had to do a
different<00:01:02.699> technique<00:01:03.090> for<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.750> ladybug

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
different technique for the ladybug

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.070 
different technique for the ladybug
which<00:01:05.159> was<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.489> saw<00:01:05.850> two<00:01:05.909> small<00:01:06.510> pieces<00:01:06.810> of

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
which was I saw two small pieces of

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.810 
which was I saw two small pieces of
black<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.979> red<00:01:08.010> together

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
black and red together

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.480 
black and red together
and<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.540> we<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> range<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.250> different

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and then we have a range of different

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.899 
and then we have a range of different
sizes<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.420> completed<00:01:13.110> yo-yos<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.040> did<00:01:14.610> use

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
sizes of completed yo-yos here I did use

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.560 
sizes of completed yo-yos here I did use
the<00:01:15.210> green<00:01:15.869> yo-yo<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.680> all<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.340> did<00:01:17.580> was<00:01:17.939> lined

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the green yo-yo and all I did was lined

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.190 
the green yo-yo and all I did was lined
up<00:01:18.869> there's<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.920> cut<00:01:20.460> out<00:01:20.490> circle<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.930> lined

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
up there's a cut out circle I just lined

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.130 
up there's a cut out circle I just lined
it<00:01:22.409> up<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.430> black<00:01:23.790> was<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.900> edge

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
it up so that the black was to that edge

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.510 
it up so that the black was to that edge
and<00:01:25.470> that's<00:01:25.920> how<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.220> basically<00:01:26.880> created<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
and that's how I basically created the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.920 
and that's how I basically created the
little<00:01:29.520> ladybug<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.689> did<00:01:30.840> about

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
little ladybug so you did about

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.200 
little ladybug so you did about
one-third<00:01:31.500> two-third<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.189> fabric<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.909> can

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
one-third two-third of fabric so you can

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.140 
one-third two-third of fabric so you can
have<00:01:33.540> some<00:01:33.840> versatility<00:01:34.610> you<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.820> know<00:01:35.939> you're

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
have some versatility you I know you're

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.819 
have some versatility you I know you're
going<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.450> adding<00:01:36.840> some<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.350> some<00:01:37.560> hand

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
something the next one that we have is

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.770 
something the next one that we have is
is<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:41.310> little<00:03:41.580> pig<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.120> we<00:03:42.150> started<00:03:42.570> with

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
is the little pig and we started with

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.530 
is the little pig and we started with
the<00:03:43.680> center<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.400> then<00:03:44.489> we<00:03:44.670> reversed<00:03:45.150> one<00:03:45.390> of

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
the center and then we reversed one of

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.930 
the center and then we reversed one of
the<00:03:45.660> smaller<00:03:46.050> ones<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.709> then<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.430> two<00:03:47.640> tiny

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
the smaller ones and then the two tiny

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.140 
the smaller ones and then the two tiny
ones<00:03:48.300> are<00:03:48.600> for<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.050> ears<00:03:49.489> mm-hmm<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.760> we<00:03:50.970> also

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
ones are for the ears mm-hmm and we also

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.190 
ones are for the ears mm-hmm and we also
I<00:03:51.720> also<00:03:51.989> have<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.620> white<00:03:52.950> one<00:03:53.190> here<00:03:53.670> now<00:03:54.450> you<00:03:55.170> can

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
I also have a white one here now you can

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.620 
I also have a white one here now you can
also<00:03:55.620> make<00:03:56.489> them<00:03:56.760> into<00:03:57.239> a<00:03:57.269> bear<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.320> cat<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:59.430> dog

also make them into a bear a cat a dog
it's<00:04:00.630> limitless<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:01.800> we're<00:04:02.730> going<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:03.000> work<00:04:03.330> a

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
it's limitless and we're going to work a

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.210 
it's limitless and we're going to work a
little<00:04:03.690> bit<00:04:03.900> on<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.320> components<00:04:04.890> of<00:04:05.040> the

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
little bit on the components of the

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.699 
little bit on the components of the
elephant<00:04:05.760> we<00:04:05.910> have<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.390> ears<00:04:06.630> kind<00:04:06.989> of<00:04:07.170> offset

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
elephant we have the ears kind of offset

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.360 
elephant we have the ears kind of offset
one<00:04:08.580> large<00:04:09.360> yo-yo<00:04:09.870> flipped<00:04:10.290> for<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.769> face<00:04:11.010> and

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
one large yo-yo flipped for the face and

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.940 
one large yo-yo flipped for the face and
then<00:04:11.910> tiny<00:04:12.330> yo-yos<00:04:12.959> that<00:04:12.989> will<00:04:13.500> create<00:04:13.830> the

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
then tiny yo-yos that will create the
