this nice brick out here here's one of

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.649 
this nice brick out here here's one of
the<00:01:49.140> four<00:01:49.470> gates<00:01:50.100> they<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> gate<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:50.820> each

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the four gates they have a gate on each

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.380 
the four gates they have a gate on each
and<00:01:52.229> if<00:01:52.859> gates<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> sides<00:01:53.729> -<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.270> these

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and if gates on the sides - but these

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.169 
and if gates on the sides - but these
are<00:01:54.569> the<00:01:54.659> main<00:01:54.869> gates<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.979> if<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.219> walk<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.729> here

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
are the main gates so if we walk in here

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.169 
are the main gates so if we walk in here
we<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.229> kind<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.560> get<00:01:58.799> down<00:01:58.829> at<00:01:59.219> eye<00:01:59.369> level<00:01:59.399> see

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
we can kind of get down at eye level see

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.559 
we can kind of get down at eye level see
