00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.620
 Round 25 knots still calmed down a bit 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.980
 on the winter mill 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.130
 but much stronger return than predicted by Opel and at night 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.130
 not in the shirt and Christmas Eve not a surprise 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.270
 we have some opponents 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.240
 and we have 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.149
 and the most important thing to say, look forward to printing 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.630
 somehow, somehow, it is also here to participate 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.690
 this game is the focus of the event 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.030
 in a very personal environment 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.030
 and of course, heart and soul behind this thing 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.729
 106 000 cars continue as many as possible 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.790
 with which we reward our business with 16 points 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.399
 accordingly great evening nice counter to the left 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.330
 Pia Sundstedt the markets in Singapore and Sydney Rotenburg 

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:14.429
 there ransacked moment is actually heard 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:15.799
 AND MANY MORE 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.120
 there and diesel dies and diesel fields 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.009
 came too late 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:22.989
 that comes from Intel 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.849
 and how she has been before this important and floral wreath 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.849
 it's easier for me on goalkeeper Wessels 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:02.499
 ca 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.249
 With 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.980
 With 

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:23.499
 Oil 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:30.499
 more 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.740
 interrupted in the Netherlands with five minutes
