 pauline first on this phone who 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.660

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.190
 range of phones 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.500
 so this is a function that will allow 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.350
 the user to merge the map 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.440
 internal memory phone with a card 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.150
 microsd km his phone so everything 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.740
 simply by software update 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.970
 the user will see happen in the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.970
 game settings 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.409

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.290
 unified storage cluster archos 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.990

 you will insert a card 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.450
 micro sd the phone will automatically 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.280
 propose to merge your memories 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.750
 that means he will have more problem 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.950
 to know where are we putting his pictures 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.899
 or do we have these applications on 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.340
 no longer poses any problem of 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.140
 memory 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.460
 phone will completely handle the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.979
 cards it's like we had by 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.259
 example 16 and 16 32 this was the case on 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.030
 this phone at home I have 32 gigas I 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.530
 gone from sixteen so in fact I have more to 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.030
 to worry about telling me who I am and that I 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.619
 put my photos on my micro SD card 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.620
 it's over it's the device that will handle 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.770
 for me and of course if we 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.090
 and we make his microsd card and then on 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.780
 the option is the stock stop 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.490
 and two actually 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.990
 sounds like it gives May 10 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.729
 positioned the apps on the 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.619
 part of the internal memory the data 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.060
 media on the memory card like that in 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.560
 do we will make a 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.569
 the application it will be able to completely 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.260
 know his phone so for the 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.030
 part software on is 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.010
 version of android then there we will launch 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.599
 as you can see in kit kat 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.549
 there will be an update in the 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.860
 next few weeks in libya 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.930
 so there this one by ota we will have a 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.610
 update the book so and function 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.780
 merger will be brought on both 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.730
 four is both on our iphone 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.650
 here and on all the range g a six 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.770
 pack on his phone there that really 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.950
 valid on 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.780
 tablets and smartphones 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.610
 but on a version of Android to pure 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.220
 it will be quite so all of us 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.570
 because no overlay is added by 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.770
 against us as to which applications 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.110
 especially the video watchman who is 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.090
 enough 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.430
 but otherwise we use pure android 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.370
 exactly like the nexus for example it 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.930
 is available 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.960
 this phone is there at the 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.910
 sale of 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.800
 a week and we have a very great success 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.330
 so we have a little trouble finding 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.830
 because we are a little bit we have been 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.210
 impressed by the enthusiasm of young people 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.850
 will soon have new boxes 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.860
 available and thank you this was the 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.310
 video presentation of the archos 50 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.310
