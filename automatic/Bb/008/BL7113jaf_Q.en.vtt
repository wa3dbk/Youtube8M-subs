microphone and it works in a number of
great<00:00:24.660> applications<00:00:25.970> let's<00:00:26.970> take<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> look<00:00:27.330> at

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
great applications let's take a look at

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.750 
great applications let's take a look at
some<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.689> features<00:00:27.810> shall<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:28.760> starting

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
some of the features shall we starting

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.800 
some of the features shall we starting
from<00:00:29.849> left<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.090> right<00:00:30.269> we<00:00:30.390> had<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.599> pad

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
from left to right we had the pad

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.170 
from left to right we had the pad
basically<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.679> minus<00:00:31.980> 10<00:00:32.160> DB<00:00:32.340> minus

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
basically you have a minus 10 DB minus

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.950 
basically you have a minus 10 DB minus
20<00:00:33.420> DB<00:00:33.570> pad<00:00:33.899> selectable<00:00:34.640> you<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
20 DB pad selectable you have a

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.200 
20 DB pad selectable you have a
high-pass<00:00:36.960> filter<00:00:37.440> which<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.460> selectable<00:00:39.000> as

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
high-pass filter which is selectable as

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.600 
high-pass filter which is selectable as
well<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.620> steep<00:00:40.829> roll-off<00:00:41.280> and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
well for you have a steep roll-off and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.010 
well for you have a steep roll-off and
then<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> more<00:00:42.180> gentle<00:00:42.570> sloping

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
then you have a more gentle sloping

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.319 
then you have a more gentle sloping
roll-off<00:00:43.440> pattern<00:00:44.430> selector<00:00:44.789> switch<00:00:45.030> -<00:00:45.149> this

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
roll-off pattern selector switch - this

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.790 
roll-off pattern selector switch - this
is<00:00:45.510> really<00:00:45.930> kind<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.230> interesting<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.680> this

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
is really kind of interesting in this

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.430 
is really kind of interesting in this
actually<00:00:47.280> two<00:00:47.520> switches<00:00:48.320> basically<00:00:49.320> what

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
actually two switches basically what

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.420 
actually two switches basically what
we're<00:00:49.530> going<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> three-way

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
we're going to have is a three-way

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.790 
we're going to have is a three-way
switch<00:00:50.489> here<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.180> more<00:00:52.079> towards<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> middle

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
switch here on more towards the middle

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.020 
switch here on more towards the middle
and<00:00:53.329> in<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:55.289> extreme<00:00:55.920> sides<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> switch

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
and in the extreme sides of the switch

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.970 
and in the extreme sides of the switch
you're<00:00:57.480> going<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.660> have<00:00:57.780> basically<00:00:58.199> Omni<00:00:58.770> and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
you're going to have basically Omni and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.090 
you're going to have basically Omni and
then<00:00:59.670> also<00:00:59.969> figure<00:01:00.300> eight<00:01:00.480> patterns<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:02.010> in

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
then also figure eight patterns but in

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.590 
then also figure eight patterns but in
the<00:01:02.219> middle<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.730> actually<00:01:03.329> two

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
the middle here is actually two

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.310 
the middle here is actually two
different<00:01:03.930> patterns

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
different patterns

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.500 
different patterns
I<00:01:04.409> guess<00:01:04.979> four-way<00:01:05.610> switches<00:01:06.030> weren't<00:01:06.360> very

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
I guess four-way switches weren't very

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.760 
I guess four-way switches weren't very
easy<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.020> come<00:01:07.200> by

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
easy to come by

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.200 
easy to come by
it<00:01:08.310> would<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.490> been<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.640> lot<00:01:08.790> more<00:01:08.970> expensive

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
it would have been a lot more expensive

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.050 
it would have been a lot more expensive
adding<00:01:09.720> more<00:01:09.840> cost<00:01:10.159> so<00:01:11.159> basically<00:01:11.460> they<00:01:11.790> added

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
adding more cost so basically they added

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.490 
adding more cost so basically they added
a<00:01:12.090> two<00:01:12.270> way<00:01:12.420> switch<00:01:12.659> here<00:01:12.930> over<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> side

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
a two way switch here over on the side

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.570 
a two way switch here over on the side
which<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.210> both<00:01:15.210> cardioid<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.580> super

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
which is both cardioid and super

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.730 
which is both cardioid and super
cardioid<00:01:17.850> all<00:01:18.810> features<00:01:19.200> considered

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
cardioid all features considered

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.620 
cardioid all features considered
basically<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> most<00:01:20.970> important<00:01:21.330> thing<00:01:21.450> is

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
basically the most important thing is

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.660 
basically the most important thing is
how<00:01:21.869> does<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> sound

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
how does it sound

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.920 
how does it sound
overall<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.700> found<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.150> microphone<00:01:24.570> not<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
overall I found this microphone not to

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.090 
overall I found this microphone not to
be<00:01:25.259> quite<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:27.290> quote<00:01:28.290> unquote<00:01:28.380> natural<00:01:29.040> or

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
be quite as quote unquote natural or

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.630 
be quite as quote unquote natural or
uncoloured<00:01:29.700> sounding<00:01:30.210> or<00:01:31.189> boring<00:01:32.189> sounding

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
uncoloured sounding or boring sounding

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.870 
uncoloured sounding or boring sounding
maybe<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.060> some<00:01:33.840> might<00:01:33.960> consider<00:01:34.259> its<00:01:36.259> visual

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
maybe is some might consider its visual

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.600 
maybe is some might consider its visual
competition<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.970> suppose<00:01:39.710> it<00:01:40.710> definitely<00:01:41.490> has

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
competition I suppose it definitely has

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.649 
competition I suppose it definitely has
a<00:01:41.640> little<00:01:41.880> bit<00:01:41.970> more<00:01:42.119> character<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.450> what<00:01:42.630> I

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
a little bit more character and what I

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.069 
a little bit more character and what I
found<00:01:42.840> about<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.200> mic<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:44.149> it's<00:01:45.149> really<00:01:45.810> cool

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
found about this mic is it's really cool

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.620 
found about this mic is it's really cool
for<00:01:46.409> layering<00:01:46.740> acoustic<00:01:47.430> guitars<00:01:47.759> if<00:01:48.479> you're

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
for layering acoustic guitars if you're

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.330 
for layering acoustic guitars if you're

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
going to start doing double tracking and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.710 
going to start doing double tracking and
hard<00:01:50.579> panning<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.090> different<00:01:51.420> things<00:01:51.570> and

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
hard panning of different things and

hard panning of different things and
just<00:01:51.780> stacking<00:01:52.200> up<00:01:52.610> various<00:01:53.610> layers<00:01:53.850> of

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
just stacking up various layers of

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.030 
just stacking up various layers of
acoustic<00:01:54.540> guitars<00:01:54.810> all<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.140> something<00:01:55.500> like<00:01:55.649> I

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
acoustic guitars all is something like I

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.370 
acoustic guitars all is something like I
don't<00:01:56.670> know<00:01:56.820> Traveling<00:01:57.750> Wilburys<00:01:58.049> or

don't know Traveling Wilburys or
something<00:01:58.680> like<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.860> sounding<00:01:59.579> then<00:02:00.030> this

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
something like that sounding then this

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.880 
something like that sounding then this
is<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> microphone<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.290> would<00:02:01.530> definitely

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
is a microphone I would definitely
