00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:22.349 
and but I'm gonna talk about in today's

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.760 
and but I'm gonna talk about in today's
topic<00:00:22.950> is<00:00:23.310> simply<00:00:23.759> why<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.450> binge<00:00:24.720> it's<00:00:25.230> very

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
topic is simply why we binge it's very

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.690 
topic is simply why we binge it's very
simple<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.610> hopefully<00:00:27.300> will<00:00:27.750> be<00:00:28.169> a<00:00:28.700> quick

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
simple so this hopefully will be a quick

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.490 
simple so this hopefully will be a quick
video<00:00:31.220> basically<00:00:32.220> if<00:00:32.730> we<00:00:33.300> were<00:00:34.050> living<00:00:34.290> in

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
video basically if we were living in

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.520 
video basically if we were living in
nature<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.250> we<00:00:35.550> only<00:00:35.730> had<00:00:36.140> natural<00:00:37.140> foods

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
nature and we only had natural foods

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.549 
nature and we only had natural foods
available<00:00:38.130> to<00:00:38.640> us<00:00:38.820> then<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:40.079> wouldn't<00:00:40.470> have

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
available to us then we wouldn't have

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.240 
available to us then we wouldn't have
this<00:00:41.219> issue<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:42.360> binging<00:00:42.950> and<00:00:43.950> that's

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
this issue with binging and that's

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.980 
this issue with binging and that's
because<00:00:45.140> if<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.490> know<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.670> had<00:00:48.240> mangoes

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
because if we you know just had mangoes

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.020 
because if we you know just had mangoes
on<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.290> tree<00:00:49.650> and<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.160> ate<00:00:50.310> as<00:00:50.460> much<00:00:50.670> as<00:00:50.850> we

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
on a tree and we ate as much as we

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.960 
on a tree and we ate as much as we
wanted<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.570> eat<00:00:51.810> that<00:00:52.200> would<00:00:53.040> be<00:00:53.190> no<00:00:53.370> problem

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
wanted to eat that would be no problem

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.010 
wanted to eat that would be no problem
but<00:00:54.270> when<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:55.400> pizza<00:00:56.400> and<00:00:57.020> hamburgers

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
but when we have pizza and hamburgers

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.720 
but when we have pizza and hamburgers
and<00:00:58.640> ice<00:00:59.640> cream<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.780> all<00:01:01.470> of<00:01:01.829> these<00:01:02.010> crazy

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
and ice cream and all of these crazy

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.890 
and ice cream and all of these crazy
things<00:01:03.060> we<00:01:03.329> call<00:01:03.540> food<00:01:04.850> available<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.090> us<00:01:06.270> to

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
things we call food available to us to

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.100 
things we call food available to us to
binge<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.640> causes<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> problem<00:01:10.490> so

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
binge on that causes a problem so

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.350 
binge on that causes a problem so
basically<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.680> reason<00:01:13.829> why<00:01:14.250> we<00:01:14.460> binge<00:01:14.880> is

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
basically the reason why we binge is

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.000 
basically the reason why we binge is
built<00:01:16.260> into<00:01:16.680> our<00:01:18.530> instincts<00:01:19.530> or<00:01:19.740> it's

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
built into our instincts or it's

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.120 
built into our instincts or it's
connected<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.610> our<00:01:20.729> instincts<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.770> our

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
connected to our instincts so if our

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.240 
connected to our instincts so if our
body<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:24.890> low<00:01:25.890> or<00:01:26.340> lacking<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:27.240> nutrients<00:01:28.250> so

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
body is low or lacking in nutrients so

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.490 
body is low or lacking in nutrients so
that<00:01:29.400> includes<00:01:30.140> macronutrients<00:01:31.140> which<00:01:31.229> are

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
that includes macronutrients which are

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.899 
that includes macronutrients which are
carbohydrates<00:01:32.040> proteins<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.390> fat<00:01:34.020> or<00:01:34.909> micro

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
carbohydrates proteins and fat or micro

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.370 
carbohydrates proteins and fat or micro
nutrients<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.810> vitamins<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.799> minerals<00:01:39.380> or

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
nutrients like vitamins and minerals or

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.520 
nutrients like vitamins and minerals or
we're<00:01:41.159> lacking<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.729> calories<00:01:42.390> our<00:01:42.750> body<00:01:43.140> will

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
we're lacking in calories our body will

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.800 
we're lacking in calories our body will
spend<00:01:44.040> our<00:01:44.340> brain<00:01:44.850> will<00:01:45.180> send<00:01:45.420> us<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.659> message

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
spend our brain will send us a message

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.510 
spend our brain will send us a message
to<00:01:46.460> find<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.970> densest<00:01:48.810> food<00:01:49.590> source<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.369> we

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
to find the densest food source that we

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.080 
to find the densest food source that we
can<00:01:50.780> if<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:52.049> were<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.290> nature<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.580> densest

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
can if we were in nature the densest

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.170 
can if we were in nature the densest
food<00:01:54.390> source<00:01:54.720> would<00:01:55.020> be<00:01:55.229> fruit<00:01:56.180> usually

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
food source would be fruit usually

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.109 
food source would be fruit usually
sometimes<00:01:58.080> if<00:01:58.830> they're<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.220> season<00:01:59.700> we<00:02:00.000> would

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
sometimes if they're in season we would

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.050 
sometimes if they're in season we would
be<00:02:00.299> able<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.630> find<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.590> small<00:02:01.770> amount<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.580> nuts

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
be able to find a small amount of nuts

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.300 
be able to find a small amount of nuts
or<00:02:03.390> seeds<00:02:04.340> now

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
or seeds now

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.040 
or seeds now
in<00:02:06.850> modern<00:02:07.630> society<00:02:07.930> it's<00:02:08.649> very<00:02:08.950> easy<00:02:09.310> to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
in modern society it's very easy to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.750 
in modern society it's very easy to
binge<00:02:11.050> on<00:02:11.410> nuts<00:02:11.680> and<00:02:11.890> seeds<00:02:12.130> because<00:02:12.460> we<00:02:12.580> can

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
binge on nuts and seeds because we can

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.080 
binge on nuts and seeds because we can
just<00:02:12.970> take<00:02:13.150> handfuls<00:02:13.690> out<00:02:14.050> of<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.260> bag<00:02:14.610> but<00:02:15.610> for

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
just take handfuls out of a bag but for

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.410 
just take handfuls out of a bag but for
example<00:02:16.570> if<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:17.050> had<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.230> pecan<00:02:17.770> tree<00:02:18.420> the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
example if you had a pecan tree the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.600 
example if you had a pecan tree the
pecans<00:02:19.900> early<00:02:20.320> in<00:02:20.440> season<00:02:20.860> for<00:02:21.040> about<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.250> month

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
pecans early in season for about a month

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.170 
pecans early in season for about a month
and<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:23.530> have<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:23.890> sit<00:02:24.100> there<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.459> crack<00:02:24.880> them

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
and you have to sit there and crack them

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.560 
and you have to sit there and crack them
open<00:02:25.330> so<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.810> can't<00:02:26.080> eat<00:02:26.260> very<00:02:26.530> many<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:28.390> it's

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
open so you can't eat very many so it's

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.570 
open so you can't eat very many so it's
very<00:02:28.750> would<00:02:29.200> be<00:02:29.320> very<00:02:29.590> hard<00:02:29.830> in<00:02:29.980> nature<00:02:30.340> to

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
very would be very hard in nature to

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:38.210 
very would be very hard in nature to
binge<00:02:31.000> on<00:02:31.480> nuts<00:02:33.390> now<00:02:35.280> what<00:02:36.280> happens<00:02:36.820> in<00:02:37.390> our

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
binge on nuts now what happens in our

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.940 
binge on nuts now what happens in our
modern<00:02:39.220> world<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:40.600> that<00:02:40.989> maybe<00:02:41.410> we're<00:02:41.650> eating

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
modern world is that maybe we're eating

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.850 
modern world is that maybe we're eating
enough<00:02:42.220> calories<00:02:42.810> but<00:02:43.810> maybe<00:02:44.320> we're<00:02:44.560> eating

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
enough calories but maybe we're eating

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.830 
enough calories but maybe we're eating
empty<00:02:45.370> calories<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.239> we're<00:02:46.510> lacking

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
empty calories and we're lacking

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.350 
empty calories and we're lacking
nutrients<00:02:47.830> so<00:02:47.980> we<00:02:48.070> have<00:02:48.370> enough<00:02:48.670> calories<00:02:48.940> but

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
nutrients so we have enough calories but

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.870 
nutrients so we have enough calories but
we<00:02:49.480> don't<00:02:49.870> have<00:02:50.110> enough<00:02:50.380> nutrients<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.730> that's

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
we don't have enough nutrients so that's

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.140 
we don't have enough nutrients so that's
gonna<00:02:52.060> send<00:02:52.480> our<00:02:53.070> body<00:02:54.070> a<00:02:54.250> message<00:02:54.850> to

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
gonna send our body a message to

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.390 
gonna send our body a message to
continue<00:02:55.959> to<00:02:56.170> eat<00:02:56.380> because<00:02:56.800> we<00:02:56.950> still<00:02:57.340> need

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
continue to eat because we still need

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.640 
continue to eat because we still need
more<00:02:57.820> nutrients<00:02:58.590> or<00:02:59.940> maybe<00:03:00.940> we<00:03:01.600> are<00:03:01.900> lacking

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
more nutrients or maybe we are lacking

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.820 
more nutrients or maybe we are lacking
in<00:03:03.040> calories<00:03:03.940> because<00:03:04.780> maybe<00:03:05.290> we've<00:03:05.560> been

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
in calories because maybe we've been

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.240 
in calories because maybe we've been
trying<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:08.459> do<00:03:09.459> portion<00:03:10.030> control<00:03:10.380> or<00:03:11.380> whatever

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
trying to do portion control or whatever

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.199 
trying to do portion control or whatever
else<00:03:12.519> or<00:03:13.830> maybe<00:03:14.830> we're<00:03:15.310> just<00:03:15.340> not<00:03:15.880> eating

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
else or maybe we're just not eating

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.620 
else or maybe we're just not eating
enough<00:03:16.630> and<00:03:17.580> so<00:03:18.580> our<00:03:18.790> body<00:03:19.000> sends<00:03:19.299> us<00:03:19.480> a

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
enough and so our body sends us a

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.580 
enough and so our body sends us a
message<00:03:20.260> instinctively<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.640> go<00:03:22.450> for<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.230> most

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
message instinctively to go for the most

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.420 
message instinctively to go for the most
calorie<00:03:24.310> dense<00:03:24.700> foods<00:03:25.120> that<00:03:25.420> means<00:03:25.980> dairy<00:03:26.980> and

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
calorie dense foods that means dairy and

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.820 
calorie dense foods that means dairy and
oils<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.420> very<00:03:28.750> heavy<00:03:29.230> things<00:03:29.769> meat<00:03:31.830> so

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
oils and very heavy things meat so

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.710 
oils and very heavy things meat so
that's<00:03:33.040> where<00:03:33.250> we<00:03:33.400> get<00:03:33.549> into<00:03:33.700> trouble<00:03:33.820> like<00:03:34.570> I

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
that's where we get into trouble like I

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.990 
that's where we get into trouble like I
said<00:03:35.019> if<00:03:35.320> all<00:03:35.590> that<00:03:35.890> stuff<00:03:36.160> wasn't<00:03:36.400> available

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
said if all that stuff wasn't available

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.259 
said if all that stuff wasn't available
to<00:03:37.180> us<00:03:37.360> it<00:03:37.900> would<00:03:38.110> be<00:03:38.260> no<00:03:38.620> problem<00:03:38.940> we<00:03:39.940> wouldn't

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
to us it would be no problem we wouldn't

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.759 
to us it would be no problem we wouldn't
have<00:03:40.540> we<00:03:40.810> wouldn't<00:03:40.840> even<00:03:41.110> be<00:03:41.320> having<00:03:41.530> this

that is is because the starches in
starch<00:05:26.920> starch<00:05:27.790> foods<00:05:28.180> like<00:05:28.450> potatoes<00:05:28.960> and

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
starch starch foods like potatoes and

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.520 
starch starch foods like potatoes and
grains<00:05:29.700> they<00:05:30.700> have<00:05:30.970> to<00:05:31.240> be<00:05:31.450> broken<00:05:31.930> down<00:05:32.350> they

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
grains they have to be broken down they

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.710 
grains they have to be broken down they
take<00:05:32.680> a<00:05:32.740> much<00:05:33.040> longer<00:05:33.430> time<00:05:33.700> to<00:05:34.000> break<00:05:34.240> down<00:05:34.270> a

take a much longer time to break down a
much<00:05:34.900> longer<00:05:35.230> time<00:05:35.470> to<00:05:35.830> get<00:05:36.400> to<00:05:36.550> our<00:05:36.580> brain<00:05:37.030> so

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
much longer time to get to our brain so

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.840 
much longer time to get to our brain so
we're<00:05:38.380> eating<00:05:38.770> and<00:05:39.040> eating<00:05:39.190> and<00:05:39.400> eating<00:05:39.550> and

we<00:05:47.080> get<00:05:47.290> the<00:05:47.470> message<00:05:47.680> to<00:05:48.550> the<00:05:48.730> brain<00:05:48.760> okay<00:05:49.660> we

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
we get the message to the brain okay we

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.510
