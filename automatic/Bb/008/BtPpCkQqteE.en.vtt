00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.960
 who is all good you do not women's 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:17.760
 that my blog today says pink to 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.480
 you a good flour phase 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.710
 I'll hear good people as we were 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.779
 always walk 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.949
 the attraction was a little let 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.320
 maceio 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:34.440
 We'll need three cups of 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:40.920
 wheat flour 2 whole eggs two 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:44.969
 cups sugar 1 cup of oil 2 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.360
 cups and a half hot water a pinch 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.320
 of salt and a teaspoon of 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:56.370
 baking soda one tablespoon 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.670
 of baking powder and a teaspoon of 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.500
 vanilla essence good first 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.500
 people are going to put the two eggs 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.049
 the three cups of wheat flour 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:22.420
 the sugar the essence of vanilla 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.420
 teaspoon full 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.540
 the oil 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.780
 After we give a little stir 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.750
 places baking soda and a 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:45.130
 salt spray does not have to be very 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.990
 finally the hot yeast we 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.380
 we put it after a little stirring 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.210
 until it gets a bit consistent 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.370
 is homogeneous 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.510
 like at home yesterday the mixer did muck 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.940
 even south 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:02.890
 but of course it's an electric mixer. 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.900
 much easier and when you think the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.660
 mass is almost at the point of stopping 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:13.780
 fiddle with a good consistency 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:16.780
 put the yeast there it will stir one more 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:26.280
 little and when the mass is homogeneous 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:30.100
 Why is she ready to color us? 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.600
 You are going to need a container for 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.120
 separate the colors 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.250
 I'll use the plastic cup that's more 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.739
 simple was what I had at home 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.160
 but if you have plastic bowl 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.690
 It also looks better to mix is like 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.890
 are six colors 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.810
 I have a cup for every color you go 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.090
 try to fill all with the same 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.130
 amount of pasta I prefer to make 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.200
 this using a shell that is easier 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:02.440
 but that does not stop you from doing a bit of 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:05.070
 Mele is on the table and such but it is but help 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.070
 it's easier 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.850
 so in each cup you will put the 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.590
 with the colors of your choice in 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.960
 each part of the mass 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.840
 I do not have exactly an amount 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.810
 drops for each 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.360
 you will put enough to stay 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.920
 in a tone that you think is good 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:32.470
 The stronger the color the better. 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.630
 stay there and then there is because when 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.350
 knead if he loses a little run 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:41.770
 so I put a lot is important 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:46.230
 to mix well with the dough 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.230
 there are none left but blank 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.560
 after you've done all the 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.680
 colors and clean the table that was dirty efe 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.780
 it's time to put it all together but before 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.030
 to join you need to fight that way 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.980
 You're going to put the dough so you can 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.750
 round shape 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.610
 then you just need a little 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.459
 margarine I pass a paper towel 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:22.280
 easier to spread and with 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.330
 he passes you on every surface that 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:30.280
 will cake batter and then the form is 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.280
 covers with wheat flour 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.590
 first you will put in shape the 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.790
 thing you want that is on the side 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.560
 of the cake 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.440
 I chose red so I go 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:52.460
 center there in the middle of the chain and 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:05:00.110
 Dump you do not need to spread it 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:01.910
 spread it out there is the color you like 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.300
 will do the same thing will centralize 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:09.320
 she in the form and put on top of the 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.090
 another that she spreads by herself 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.450
 and then you do it with all the 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.450
 Colors 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.250
 When it finishes, just take the oven with 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.590
 careful that the dough does not mix 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:33.130
 and it's good you already leave the oven warm 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.960
 slightly before between 180 and 200 degrees 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.180
 so when you put the cake goes 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.170
 be ready on average in the period of 30 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.230
 minutes 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.960
 there goes the time you can make a 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.510
 with a toothpick or with 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:51.040
 fork to see if the dough does not 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.570
 on the stick on the square fork of this cake is 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.120
 ready 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:58.480
 after they create we will turn 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:05.710
 he on a platter and I have to turn 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:07.180
 he quick for him not to break my being 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.700
 a little relaxed because you do not 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.910
 it will be a bit rushed and I will 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:16.450
 It was not totally cold but if you 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:18.910
 wait for it to cool he prissy 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.770
 in the time to wait I'll be ready 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.140
 I prepared a brigadeiro to make the 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.430
 coverage and you can do with 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.430
 coverage you want 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:34.360
 I have not decided to do it with me 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.110
 in the colorful confetti that he is well 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.110
 the handsome 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:49.720
 and at the end he gets the colored cake and then the 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.720
 people see it inside 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.710
 Good, this was the recipe for today. I hope. 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:05.470
 that you liked 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:08.720
 I like it very good, very good 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:10.850
 they lacked the gift 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:15.200
 so be sure to sign up for the 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:18.020
 channel so I had already shared the idea 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:21.410
 my facebook page does not 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.280
 I have instagram everything down here for 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.690
 you 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.690
 and that's it until the next 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:36.300
 I do not even want that one
