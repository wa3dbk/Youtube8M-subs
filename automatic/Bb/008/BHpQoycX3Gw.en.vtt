00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.510
 the practice presents itself 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.310
 olympus sp 100 ee as well-equipped 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.900
 bridge camera with many buttons one 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.460
 full hd video recording with 60 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.869
 Full frames per second and a very 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.390
 exceptional point visor for 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:32.080
 image control as a picture sensor comes in 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.750
 the olympus sp 100 ee 1 1/2 3 inches tall 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.640
 c mos ship with 15 9 megapixel resolution 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.519
 and a third-stage adjustable 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.410
 sensor sensitivity of iso 125 with 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:44.830
 iso 6,400 for use 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.390
 with iso 125 and iso 200 the falls 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.430
 detail rendering for this sensor size 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.930
 still relatively good, but even here 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.970
 already can intervene a first 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.619
 the in-camera processing 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.780
 recognize a slight blur 

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:57.280
 with iso 400 iso 800, the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.159
 noise filter stronger and I think 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.449
 because some details from iso 1600 need 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.170
 we already cut back on the 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.490
 image quality iso 3200 iso 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.290
 6,400 are no longer an option 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.390
 in less light, the moves 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.840
 Detail rendering up to 200 iso on one 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.369
 acceptable levels from iso 1600 are the 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.990
 Pictures then only soggy the 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.700
 Picture quality of the bridge camera is located 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.329
 thus overall slightly below the class 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.039
 usual level 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.719
 the in-camera processing ratified 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.140
 strong and smoothens the shots 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.140
 visible 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.150
 our final conclusion 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.380
 the olympus sp 100 ee is a solid 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.510
 equipped bridge camera with one 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.220
 special feature of this is a 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.170
 hinged point visor under the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.720
 also hinged lightning and is 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.979
 so far unique in this camera class 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.690
 whether you see the visor with the 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.310
 red crosshairs, however, really 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.080
 needed is another question 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.670
 this allows the field of view 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.590
 well sunk lens 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.050
 But she is hardly too close to me 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.690
 In most cases, you use it 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.460
 the high-resolution with 920,000 pixels 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.070
 but something low-contrast search better 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.200
 equipped these stabilized and 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.330
 shows that the effective picture field is the 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.770
 display is with 460,000 pixels only 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.540
 average dissolved for the 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.580
 fast image control but sufficient 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.530
 unfortunately you have to search between display 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.150
 the camera would change by pressing a button 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.860
 own eyes sensor would be the change 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.870
 automatically possible and therefore clear 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.180
 more comfortable the good equipment 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.650
 wants to touch wheels and photo programs 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.570
 Unfortunately, not by the partially 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.920
 very comfortable operation and one 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.840
 only a few conclusive restrictions 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.040
 tarnished in the modes dazzle and 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.900
 Time delay is neither the 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.060
 series picture function still usable iso 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.890
 was possible to change the aperture 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.870
 In addition, a nd filter is used 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.820
 one would be strong with the possible walls 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.530
 Restrictive we like it better because of the 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.600
 Selection with changing focal length 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.489
 zooming can be done either objectively 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.000
 or the focal length regulator on the photo 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.580
 trigger 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.220
 Here you have the free choice in the 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.660
 speed indicates the olympus sp 100 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.820
 ee with a very fast series 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.680
 frame rate of 83 images per second for 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.690
 six shots in a row to please 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.000
 The autofocus quickly sharp and 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.200
 requires only 0 26 seconds in wide angle 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 to focus 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.489
 It is also great that the bridge camera 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.200
 in just 9 95 seconds completely 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.820
 is turned on and the first one 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.640
 picture after turning on already after 0 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.340
 Takes 98 seconds to record the olympus 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.560
 sp 100 de is thus unlimited 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.329
 snapshot suitable a good 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.730
 result also achieves the video mode 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.680
 the videos are not only very own 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.360
 good picture quality thanks to 60 full pictures 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.060
 per second, they are also at any time 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.500
 Liquid the image quality is 15 9 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.540
 megapixel sensors is about 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.920
 common as soon as higher sensor find 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.630
 which will come into play 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.440
 pictures, unfortunately, significantly blurred 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.630
 the 50x zoom is from 24 to 1200mm 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.669
 Small picture focal length very variable with 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.970
 f65 on the topic but not synonymous 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.970
 weak
