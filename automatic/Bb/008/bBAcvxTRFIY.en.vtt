00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
you have too many bookmarks along the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.630 
you have too many bookmarks along the
top<00:01:06.930> or<00:01:07.140> too<00:01:07.470> many<00:01:07.530> folders<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.610> a

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
top or too many folders you have a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.039 
top or too many folders you have a
double<00:01:08.970> arrow<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.600> click<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.020> and

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
double arrow here and you click it and

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.750 
double arrow here and you click it and
then<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.409> can<00:01:10.560> select<00:01:10.740> your<00:01:10.920> stuff<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.400> want

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
now I think that's a little bit

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.030 
now I think that's a little bit

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
inefficient to be honest I'd like to be

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.280 
inefficient to be honest I'd like to be
able<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.570> multiple<00:01:18.799> rows<00:01:19.799> if<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.580> of

the long-winded way to do it but then
your<00:01:49.770> default<00:01:50.250> profile<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:51.030> Chrome<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.200> this

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
your default profile then Chrome so this

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.590 
your default profile then Chrome so this
should<00:01:52.799> be<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.070> your<00:01:53.159> entire<00:01:53.640> path<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.450> how

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
should be that your entire path and how

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.940 
should be that your entire path and how

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
to get to this file that we need to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.969 
to get to this file that we need to
change<00:01:56.360> so<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> file<00:01:58.500> called<00:01:58.619> user

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
change so you have a file called user

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
will actually keep herself at this one

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.449 
will actually keep herself at this one
one<00:04:18.900> level<00:04:19.109> I'm<00:04:19.350> not<00:04:19.500> sure<00:04:19.650> I<00:04:19.829> can<00:04:20.039> give<00:04:20.190> it<00:04:20.310> to

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
one level I'm not sure I can give it to

show<00:04:21.090> you<00:04:21.150> is<00:04:21.419> actually<00:04:21.720> working<00:04:21.900> okay<00:04:22.260> at<00:04:22.349> the

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
show you is actually working okay at the

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.340 
show you is actually working okay at the
moment<00:04:22.470> but<00:04:23.099> if<00:04:23.220> it<00:04:23.370> does

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
moment but if it does

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.380 
moment but if it does
although<00:04:24.680> here<00:04:24.890> we<00:04:24.920> go<00:04:25.250> and<00:04:25.340> as<00:04:26.000> you<00:04:26.120> can<00:04:26.240> see

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
although here we go and as you can see

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.260 
although here we go and as you can see
the<00:04:26.540> solving<00:04:27.170> one<00:04:27.350> bit<00:04:27.770> here<00:04:28.010> and<00:04:28.190> it's<00:04:28.910> got

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
the solving one bit here and it's got

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.540 
the solving one bit here and it's got
the<00:04:29.390> double<00:04:29.510> arrows<00:04:29.900> again<00:04:30.230> so<00:04:30.950> if<00:04:31.070> it<00:04:31.190> does<00:04:31.340> do

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
the double arrows again so if it does do

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.850 
the double arrows again so if it does do
that<00:04:31.720> because<00:04:32.720> now<00:04:32.930> it's<00:04:33.140> like<00:04:33.350> completely

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
that because now it's like completely

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.680 
that because now it's like completely
stopped<00:04:34.070> working<00:04:34.460> so<00:04:34.730> if<00:04:35.240> it<00:04:35.390> does<00:04:35.540> do<00:04:35.660> that

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
stopped working so if it does do that

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.480 
stopped working so if it does do that
all<00:04:35.900> you<00:04:35.990> need<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.200> do<00:04:36.320> is<00:04:36.500> just<00:04:36.710> go<00:04:36.830> I'm<00:04:37.250> gonna
