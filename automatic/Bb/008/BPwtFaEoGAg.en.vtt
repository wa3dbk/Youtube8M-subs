00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
exploding skeletons which is basically

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.190 
exploding skeletons which is basically
on<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.650> show<00:03:03.860> he<00:03:04.100> takes<00:03:04.430> like<00:03:04.970> a<00:03:05.000> skull<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.690> he

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
has wires like attached to the pieces so

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.820 
has wires like attached to the pieces so
it<00:03:11.299> looks<00:03:11.510> like<00:03:11.630> it's<00:03:11.840> exploding<00:03:12.170> but<00:03:12.709> it's

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
it looks like it's exploding but it's

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.069 
it looks like it's exploding but it's
all<00:03:12.980> connected<00:03:13.250> with<00:03:13.580> wires<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.330> you're<00:03:14.930> like

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
all connected with wires and you're like

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.060 
all connected with wires and you're like
a<00:03:15.109> gap<00:03:15.470> gasps<00:03:16.220> glass<00:03:17.060> case<00:03:17.930> gasps<00:03:18.380> case<00:03:18.799> that

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
a gap gasps glass case gasps case that

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.789 
a gap gasps glass case gasps case that
makes<00:03:19.310> no<00:03:19.489> sense<00:03:19.519> can't<00:03:20.180> but<00:03:20.750> yeah<00:03:20.989> it<00:03:21.320> is<00:03:21.500> so

makes no sense can't but yeah it is so

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.860 
makes no sense can't but yeah it is so
interesting<00:03:22.519> like<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.850> artistry<00:03:23.359> that<00:03:23.420> takes

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
interesting like the artistry that takes

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.340 
interesting like the artistry that takes
to<00:03:24.019> do<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:24.260> it's<00:03:24.680> like<00:03:24.890> oh<00:03:25.299> my<00:03:26.299> gosh<00:03:26.600> I<00:03:27.019> can
