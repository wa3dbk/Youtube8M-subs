 mobile telephony during these four 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.380
 days that will last the fairs we are going to 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.130

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.140
 vodafone to those who appreciate a lot

 to support us one more year in 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.730
 this fair so important so 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.830
 let's go we have a lot a lot 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.230
 of things to tell you by the way 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.200
 police cars of mossos 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.000
 d'esquadra that are behind is that today 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.000
 the fair opens the mayor come 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.870
 one more year we use nfc technology 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.870
 to pass the entrance turnstiles 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.460
 we're just entering the fair we 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.770
 We found with the Samsung Pavilion 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.170
 that has brought its high range its high range 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.410
 with denomination s 6 and with denomination 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.320
 s 6 edge that is this device that 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.880
 be here also guarded what are 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.260
 the differences especially with respect 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.110
 to previous generations good then in 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.180
 the case of LEDs that now the screen is 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.070
 curved is curved but on both sides 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.500
 that is, we could say that they have 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.500
 done pretty much the same with the note 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.750
 four axes but on both sides and without 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.970
 curved so they have also opted for 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.860
 premium materials have gone from one 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.380
 plastic back to a part 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.020
 glass back with a frame 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.300
 aluminum that gives it a very 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.450
 There are also changes inside 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.979
 and that is that exynos integrate their processor 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.509
 an 8-core and 64- bit processor 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.450
 besides this does not stay here and also 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.460
 in storage without expansion through 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.750
 of micro sd slots of 32 64 and 128 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.300
 gigabytes and here in this one 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.390
 another showcase we have the samsung galaxy s 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.980
 6 to dry ie the flat the plane the 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.300
 that does not have the curved screen that 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.840
 has the same specifications 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.660
 only with a tad less battery 2 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.209
 thousand 550 milliamperes against the 1600 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.280
 of the 'hedge and that has like its 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.610
 brother curved a camera of 16 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.780
 rear megapixels will feature lollipop 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.840
 and lte 4g to be able to surf super fast 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.959
 and as a complement some new vr guides 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.310
 samsung virtual reality glasses 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.480
 in which the new 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.250
 device the s6 promise 11% more than 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.510
 sharpness in the stand of sony among others 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.300
 things we have found with two 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.680
 great news to start a tablet 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.840
 this one that I have here the sony xperia z4 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.150
 tablet maybe you're asking 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.700
 good thing is that this more with tablets seems 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:01.069
 an ultraportable or something like that 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.890
 yes but not because it's a tablet that 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.989
 has this keyboard as an accessory and 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.670
 makes it more versatile 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.950
 for all those who want to have 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.500
 a tablet also to work as 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.290
 you see the keyboard is very finite and accompanies 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.290
 perfectly to the tablet that has 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.160
 10.1 - inch screen resolution 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.959
 quad hd and that also integrates the last 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.290
 qualcomm processor which started at 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:30.590
 talk to 810 of 8 cores physically 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.360
 have reduced the frame a little by 20% 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.750
 less of frame to give you more 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.000
 prominence to this screen 2 cam 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.380
 has a storage of 32 gigabytes 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 that can be expanded by cards 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.850
 micro SD 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.310
 as you see it is very very very finite 6.1 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.660
 inches here under the covers are 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.220
 all connections but in this 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.530
 What they have done is that the 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.990
 tablet is still submersible but the 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.780
 microusb port has no lid with what 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.280
 which at the time of loading and removing the 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.959
 connection cable is much more 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.430
 comfortable and we avoid so we can have 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.350
 a future problems with the cap by 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.320
 course will have a wifi version and 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.660
 another version with wifi and 4g the first 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.600
 sony tablet device that counts 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.250
 with this connectivity but they have 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.050
 presented something else as I said 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.019
 also very related to the subject of 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.760
 water as it is already a classic is there as well 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.120
 let's see it since we have the 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.700
 xperia m4a quad this device that 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.950
 surely if we look at it like that a little bit 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.169
 distantly remind us of another of the 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.169
 sonic family elder brother el 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.480
 xperia z3 why then because what they have 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.090
 wanted to do is simulate a bit the 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.800
 feeling of this high range but to a 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.349
 lowest price 2 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.560
 99 euros for it that they have done then 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:48.530
 replace aluminum for example the 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.960
 frame and also the part glass 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.759
 back putting a back part of 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.770
 plastic that the truth is that it gives 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:57.259
 pretty good he sticks that if in what 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.930
 have spared the water resistance 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:02.509
 because it has ips 68 that is to say that 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.360
 You can dive and a half meters 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.970
 depth for 30 minutes per 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.729
 inside qualcomm snapdragon processor 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:14.180
 615 64-bit 8 gigs of storage 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:16.250
 internal and camera by here 13 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.259
 megapixels at the hyÃ¨res stand we 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.650
 we have found a very curious thing the 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:23.030
 project will pretend that you do not know what is 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.979
 the project now good as it is a 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.860
 google project developed in the 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.539
 google lab x is the 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.000
 laboratory that invented such things 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:34.520
 strange like the google glass and that 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.780
 have gotten into a rather curious topic 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.510
 is about 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.150
 and a smartphone based on modules the 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.160
 idea is that the user buys a chassis 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.770
 which has also implemented the 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.530
 screen and then once we already have 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.000
 let's say that body we are filling it with 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.960
 different modules that are going to be the ones that 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.250
 they will give us the different 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.010
 smartphone functionalities that 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.900
 we want the only thing necessary 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.600
 it will always be of course the 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.430
 screen and it's going to be the processor is 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.010
 tell the intelligence of the device to 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.560
 From there, what we would have is 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.140
 the possibility of putting more 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.030
 for example storage chamber which 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.560
 We want to say that we can have a 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.880
 smartphone with camera like there are 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.230
 right now in the market but what happens 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.240
 If we do not want the camera then 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.850
 directly we remove it or directly 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.150
 we do not put it and put it in its place 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:25.520
 an audio module we also put then 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:29.290
 a heart rate sensor and even 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.290
 we can put a game module 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.340
 well nothing clip it is that we finish the 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:43.590
 day as we started with a like dad we 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.590
 we see tomorrow with more news
