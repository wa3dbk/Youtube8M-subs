 I have never played this engine itself 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.659

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.360

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.530

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.720
 I believe because then they cannot 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.149
 catch in that animation that you say so 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.740

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.469
 or where my camera had to be put on 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.789
 and that I could not have such a two 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.860
 three fixes 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.690

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.230

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.239
 you refuse I am caught 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.080
 so I wanted to type in the chat but the chat 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.989
 is a little weird 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.780
 oh shit I'm going to accidentally folds that cunt 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.950

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.180
 so my two are doing very well again 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.290

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:58.709

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:01.080

 okay we are going to count some lives then 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.610
 we can not be conducted at once 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:09.870
 if we then say so 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.940
 if you already no what i he bends him 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.709
 just through the wall 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.300
 this way you can actually make sense 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.900
 actually getting dirty movie life skills 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.110
 but what the we you what you have a 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.700
 and perk creation story yes one happens 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.170
 then we had a sprint and something 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.890
 faster vibrate I believe or can you do it 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.310

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.080
 he grabbed me from the boring side 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.340
 sometimes it's pretty weird when the animation 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.110
 gets up to not fucking hell 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.060

 I had aimed twice but you know 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.549
 what sucks is he you that the filter 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.040

 Deathmatch Your and I Someone's Staying 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.129
 is that if you are someone like me say 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.170
 he continues to hold me and then 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.510
 you first have to wait a long time and 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.939
 you have to get rid of smoke first 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.150
 wait a long time and if you have a whole 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.150
 time 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.500
 this is the app icon then you should 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.260
 wait a long time before going again 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.170
