00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.400 

another<00:00:01.800> very<00:00:02.070> important<00:00:02.460> issue<00:00:02.610> is<00:00:03.410> hasta

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
another very important issue is hasta

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.380 
another very important issue is hasta
cata<00:00:04.620> staccato<00:00:05.160> here<00:00:05.490> if<00:00:05.730> we<00:00:05.910> do<00:00:06.089> it<00:00:06.180> very

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
cata staccato here if we do it very

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.720 
cata staccato here if we do it very
short<00:00:06.899> with<00:00:07.379> freezing<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.890> air<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.429> there<00:00:08.639> is

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
short with freezing the air and there is

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.879 
short with freezing the air and there is
tension<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.420> then<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:10.110> has<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.440> release<00:00:10.710> to

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
tension and then it has to release to

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.740 
tension and then it has to release to
come<00:00:11.070> down<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:11.700> we<00:00:11.820> cannot<00:00:12.059> use<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.570> whole

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
come down so we cannot use the whole

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.320 
come down so we cannot use the whole
power<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.019> gravity<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.820> takes<00:00:15.030> too<00:00:15.299> long

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
power of gravity and it takes too long

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.029 
power of gravity and it takes too long
and<00:00:15.809> there's<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.080> lot<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.379> tension<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.920> air

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
and there's a lot of tension in the air

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.390 
and there's a lot of tension in the air
so<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.490> has<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:18.119> be<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:19.050> staccato<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.710> nowhere

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
so it has to be the staccato is nowhere

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.500 
so it has to be the staccato is nowhere
short<00:00:20.880> as<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.510> often<00:00:21.689> do<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.130> an<00:00:23.340> avocado<00:00:23.820> to

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
short as we often do it is an avocado to

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.290 
short as we often do it is an avocado to
send<00:00:24.960> me<00:00:25.199> back<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:28.490> also<00:00:29.490> there's<00:00:30.060> such<00:00:30.269> a

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
send me back and also there's such a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.000 
send me back and also there's such a
sense<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:32.180> timing<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.570> key<00:00:33.840> fulfilling<00:00:34.559> that

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
sense of timing the key fulfilling that

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.240 
sense of timing the key fulfilling that
they<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.760> down<00:00:35.910> off<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.420> plane<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.559> also

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
they up and down off the plane and also

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.430 
they up and down off the plane and also
for<00:00:38.640> successful<00:00:39.300> up<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.510> happen<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.230> come

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
for successful up to happen and come

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.380 
for successful up to happen and come
down<00:00:40.649> again<00:00:41.010> there<00:00:41.219> has<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.460> be<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.820> sense<00:00:42.180> of

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
down again there has to be a sense of

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
down again there has to be a sense of
having<00:00:42.600> played<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.110> key<00:00:44.270> going<00:00:45.270> down<00:00:45.780> it's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
having played the key going down it's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.020 
having played the key going down it's
like<00:00:46.590> when<00:00:46.860> I'm<00:00:46.980> moving<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.399> one<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.910> down

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
like when I'm moving this one going down

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.220 
like when I'm moving this one going down
and<00:00:49.129> when<00:00:50.129> there<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> release<00:00:51.770> rebound<00:00:52.770> up

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
and when there is a release rebound up

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.200 
and when there is a release rebound up
it<00:00:55.230> takes<00:00:55.500> me<00:00:55.800> from<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> fingertip<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
it takes me from the fingertip to the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.250 
it takes me from the fingertip to the
elbow

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.500 

so<00:01:01.890> there's<00:01:02.100> really<00:01:02.400> a<00:01:02.550> sense<00:01:02.610> that<00:01:03.270> by<00:01:03.450> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
so there's really a sense that by the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.450 
so there's really a sense that by the
time<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.110> go<00:01:04.440> to<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.620> next<00:01:04.920> C<00:01:05.010> I'm<00:01:05.100> just

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
time I go to the next C I'm just

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.510 
time I go to the next C I'm just
catching<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.180> Keith<00:01:06.450> came<00:01:06.780> back<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:08.340> I'm

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
catching the Keith came back and I'm

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.340 
catching the Keith came back and I'm
there<00:01:08.910> again<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.630> very<00:01:09.660> very<00:01:11.180> efficient<00:01:12.180> way

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
there again in a very very efficient way

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.020 
there again in a very very efficient way
ready<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.800> bring<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.340> down<00:01:14.520> again<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:17.400> that's

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
ready to bring it down again and that's

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.300 
ready to bring it down again and that's
plenty<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.840> staccato<00:01:19.229> just<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> key<00:01:19.920> coming

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
plenty of staccato just the key coming

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.580 
plenty of staccato just the key coming
out<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.610> already<00:01:20.970> an<00:01:21.510> act<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.900> staccato<00:01:24.500> so<00:01:25.500> I'm

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
out is already an act of staccato so I'm

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.219 
out is already an act of staccato so I'm
not<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:26.040> moving<00:01:26.280> myself<00:01:26.880> but<00:01:27.150> I'm<00:01:27.420> very<00:01:27.900> much

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
not just moving myself but I'm very much

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.270 
not just moving myself but I'm very much
I<00:01:29.090> would<00:01:30.090> say<00:01:30.390> synchronized<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:32.100> key

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
I would say synchronized with the key

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.420 
I would say synchronized with the key
itself<00:01:32.700> very<00:01:33.150> much<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.600> tune<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.160> speed

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
itself very much in tune with the speed

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.200 
itself very much in tune with the speed
of<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.759> key<00:01:36.350> like<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:40.640> now<00:01:41.640> when<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:41.970> go<00:01:42.180> to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
of the key like this now when I go to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.499 
of the key like this now when I go to
the<00:01:42.509> next<00:01:42.690> one<00:01:43.259> here's<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.830> rotation

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
the next one here's the rotation

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.490 
the next one here's the rotation
civilization<00:01:45.509> taking<00:01:45.900> me<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.320> next

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
civilization taking me to the next

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.620 
civilization taking me to the next
measure<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.990> turning<00:01:49.790> across<00:01:50.790> just<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.479> in

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
measure the turning across just like in

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:59.450 
measure the turning across just like in
scales<00:01:57.649> so<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:59.040> I'm<00:01:59.130> exaggerating

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
scales so you can see I'm exaggerating

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:15.690 
scales so you can see I'm exaggerating
it<00:01:59.970> a<00:02:00.090> little<00:02:00.240> bit<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:01.020> see

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:25.420 

and<00:02:16.700> here<00:02:16.879> comes<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.180> scale<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:24.189> now<00:02:25.189> there's

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
and here comes a scale so now there's

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.979 
and here comes a scale so now there's
another<00:02:25.730> issue<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.150> doesn't<00:02:26.599> have<00:02:26.689> to<00:02:26.840> do

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
another issue that doesn't have to do

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.569 
another issue that doesn't have to do
with<00:02:27.019> that<00:02:27.530> once<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.129> right<00:02:28.280> thing<00:02:28.459> is

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
with that once the right thing is

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.160 
with that once the right thing is
working<00:02:28.909> well<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.359> that<00:02:29.599> is<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.049> left<00:02:32.170> people

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
working well and that is the left people

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.899 
working well and that is the left people
think<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:33.769> as<00:02:33.859> chords<00:02:34.340> but<00:02:34.549> it's<00:02:34.700> not

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
think of it as chords but it's not

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.710 
think of it as chords but it's not
chords<00:02:35.359> it's<00:02:35.629> broken<00:02:36.439> chord<00:02:37.000> which<00:02:38.000> means<00:02:38.390> you

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
chords it's broken chord which means you

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.979 
chords it's broken chord which means you
playing<00:02:38.989> four<00:02:39.470> notes<00:02:40.329> quickly<00:02:41.329> one<00:02:41.569> after<00:02:41.840> the

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
playing four notes quickly one after the

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.039 
playing four notes quickly one after the
other<00:02:42.019> not<00:02:42.890> if<00:02:43.159> that's<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.670> case<00:02:43.909> in<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.810> last

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
other not if that's the case in the last

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.780 
other not if that's the case in the last
note<00:02:45.470> in<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.739> left<00:02:45.769> hand<00:02:46.099> plays<00:02:46.280> with<00:02:46.700> the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
note in the left hand plays with the

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.379 
note in the left hand plays with the
first<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:49.129> first<00:02:49.400> note<00:02:49.639> of<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:49.970> measure

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
first of the first note of the measure

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.599 
first of the first note of the measure
then<00:02:51.079> what<00:02:51.290> happens<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.920> previous<00:02:52.310> three

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
then what happens to previous three

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.190 
then what happens to previous three
notes<00:02:52.849> and<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.299> is<00:02:53.420> something<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:53.870> creates

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
notes and that is something that creates

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.309 
notes and that is something that creates
a<00:02:54.409> lot<00:02:54.530> of<00:02:54.560> confusion<00:02:54.799> and<00:02:55.579> very<00:02:55.819> often<00:02:56.060> is<00:02:56.480> in

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
a lot of confusion and very often is in

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.440 
a lot of confusion and very often is in
the<00:02:57.500> way<00:02:57.709> of<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.489> smoothness<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.180> right

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
the way of the smoothness of the right

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.030 
the way of the smoothness of the right
and<00:02:59.659> if<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.840> right<00:02:59.989> hand<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.290> working<00:03:00.650> well<00:03:00.829> so

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
and if the right hand is working well so

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.379 
and if the right hand is working well so
we<00:03:01.519> have<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:01.819> decide<00:03:02.209> when<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:03.560> broken<00:03:03.980> chord

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
we have to decide when that broken chord

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:09.539 
we have to decide when that broken chord
happens<00:03:06.670> previously<00:03:07.670> what<00:03:07.849> does<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:08.120> start

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
happens previously what does it start

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:17.369 
happens previously what does it start
in<00:03:10.549> this<00:03:10.819> case<00:03:11.409> that's<00:03:12.409> what<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:12.799> happening

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:22.700 

what<00:03:18.379> you<00:03:18.560> hear

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.760 

but<00:03:23.250> you're<00:03:23.430> giving<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:24.120> left<00:03:24.360> hand<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.930> timing

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
but you're giving the left hand a timing

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.310 
but you're giving the left hand a timing
to<00:03:26.070> start<00:03:26.490> in<00:03:27.060> relation<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.780> right<00:03:27.990> hand

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
to start in relation to the right hand

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.010 
to start in relation to the right hand
so<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.160> does<00:03:29.340> become<00:03:29.550> in<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:29.970> last<00:03:30.000> moment<00:03:30.810> and

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
so it does become in the last moment and

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:39.470 
so it does become in the last moment and
not<00:03:31.170> know<00:03:31.320> exactly<00:03:31.710> what<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.070> do<00:03:38.240> so<00:03:39.240> one<00:03:39.450> of

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
not know exactly what to do so one of

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.660 
not know exactly what to do so one of
the<00:03:39.630> things<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.230> really<00:03:40.650> keep<00:03:40.860> in<00:03:41.040> mind<00:03:41.310> that

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
the things to really keep in mind that

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.570 
the things to really keep in mind that
the<00:03:41.820> final<00:03:42.330> result<00:03:43.880> has<00:03:44.880> steps<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.960> really

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
the final result has steps that really

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.360 
the final result has steps that really
don't<00:03:47.750> have<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.960> do<00:03:49.140> with<00:03:49.320> what<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.800> looks<00:03:50.130> like

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
don't have to do with what it looks like

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.790 
don't have to do with what it looks like
on<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.880> page<00:03:51.120> on<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.960> page<00:03:52.200> it<00:03:52.410> just<00:03:52.440> looks

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
on the page on the page it just looks

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.660 
on the page on the page it just looks
like<00:03:53.180> you<00:03:54.180> know<00:03:54.300> broken<00:03:54.540> chords<00:03:55.670> quick

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
like you know broken chords quick

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.810 
like you know broken chords quick
repeated<00:03:57.180> notes<00:03:57.420> but<00:03:58.350> where<00:03:58.860> they<00:03:59.040> all<00:03:59.220> match

repeated notes but where they all match

repeated notes but where they all match
whether<00:04:00.270> where<00:04:00.840> do<00:04:00.990> they<00:04:01.110> relate<00:04:01.440> to<00:04:01.470> each

whether where do they relate to each

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.810 
whether where do they relate to each
other<00:04:01.860> what<00:04:02.040> we<00:04:02.070> call<00:04:02.160> ways<00:04:02.610> the

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
other what we call ways the

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.820 
other what we call ways the
interdependence<00:04:03.630> of<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.900> two<00:04:04.110> hands<00:04:04.410> is

interdependence of the two hands is

interdependence of the two hands is
something<00:04:05.160> that<00:04:05.460> really<00:04:05.640> needs<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:06.060> analyze

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
something that really needs to analyze
