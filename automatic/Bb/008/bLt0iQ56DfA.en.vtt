00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
you basically hold the lure down by the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.090 
you basically hold the lure down by the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
actually pull the line now you know I'll

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.949 
actually pull the line now you know I'll
demonstrate<00:02:05.939> its<00:02:06.630> kind<00:02:06.929> of<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:08.569> downward<00:02:09.569> point

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959

I'm<00:02:20.760> going<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:20.970> just<00:02:21.180> try<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.560> get<00:02:22.560> some<00:02:22.799> of

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
I'm going to just try to get some of

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
these outside pads and with the pitch

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.280 
these outside pads and with the pitch
you<00:02:29.940> can<00:02:30.560> be<00:02:31.640> ready<00:02:32.640> on<00:02:32.760> every<00:02:33.299> every<00:02:33.989> pitch

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
you can be ready on every every pitch

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.500 
you can be ready on every every pitch
because<00:02:34.830> they<00:02:34.980> hit<00:02:35.250> off<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.670> on<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.910> fall<00:02:36.180> you

because they hit off and on the fall you
can<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.370> can<00:02:38.519> basically<00:02:39.269> work<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.959> work

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
can and you can basically work it work

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.259 
the pitch back like a Texas rig you may
just<00:02:44.930> jig<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.140> like<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.769> flipping<00:02:47.220> or<00:02:47.549> just<00:02:48.060> work

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
just jig it like a flipping or just work

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.259 
just jig it like a flipping or just work
back<00:02:48.630> slowly<00:02:49.549> you're<00:02:50.549> really<00:02:50.700> close<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.239> the

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
back slowly you're really close to the

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.220 
back slowly you're really close to the
boat<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.630> like<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.930> use<00:02:52.109> a<00:02:52.140> sidearm<00:02:54.079> this<00:02:55.079> is
