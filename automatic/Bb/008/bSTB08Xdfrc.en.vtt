great to have in your makeup collection
but<00:05:13.440> again<00:05:14.280> not<00:05:14.460> so<00:05:14.669> portable<00:05:15.000> so<00:05:15.630> if<00:05:15.780> you're

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
but again not so portable so if you're

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.300 
but again not so portable so if you're
going<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:16.080> go<00:05:16.200> on<00:05:16.320> vacation<00:05:16.350> and<00:05:17.190> you're

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
going to go on vacation and you're

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.090

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
trying to condense your makeup this is

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.280 
trying to condense your makeup this is
definitely<00:05:20.550> not<00:05:20.580> a<00:05:21.060> great<00:05:21.990> thing<00:05:22.169> because

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
definitely not a great thing because

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.940 
definitely not a great thing because
it's<00:05:22.560> bulky<00:05:22.860> but<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:24.900> actual<00:05:25.290> product<00:05:25.800> is

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
it's bulky but the actual product is

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.380 
it's bulky but the actual product is
that<00:05:26.130> the<00:05:26.250> wax<00:05:26.460> is<00:05:26.640> excellent

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
that the wax is excellent

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.870 
that the wax is excellent
I<00:05:27.450> like<00:05:28.050> it<00:05:28.170> better<00:05:28.320> than<00:05:28.590> any<00:05:29.160> wax<00:05:29.370> I've<00:05:29.670> used

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.780 
for my eyebrows and the powder I like as
well<00:05:32.880> so<00:05:33.260> definitely<00:05:34.260> recommend<00:05:34.770> this<00:05:34.830> if<00:05:35.670> you

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790
