 sunny spring smelt victory true 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:12.840
 the victory was still somewhat infinite 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.999
 long days 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:17.310
 34 hours Katyusha's ears legendary

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.310
 in fights 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.710
 but there were cars no less glorious true 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.430
 built overseas one of them with 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.919
 coming in traffic jams for the medics got out 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.230
 the hands of the Soviet army was in dire need of 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.550
 small all-wheel drive 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.230
 cars capable of performing 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.960
 all possible tasks 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.210
 design weight primitive in place 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.230
 it is still early to hang everything you need and 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.620
 the machine is ready by the way part of the land 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.830
 entered the USSR in a disassembled form 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.400
 in boxes and going to Kolomna 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.110
 the car quickly fell in love with the Soviet 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.769
 the soldiers 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.079
 many flights began to breed command 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.249
 the composition of parts and compounds serve in 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:55.189
 intelligence as well as used as 

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.740
 So 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.120
 Institute them 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.110
 artillery tractor it certainly sounds 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.010
 proudly but surely pascal small 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.010
 sorokapyatki guns and its such rare sbar 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.210
 there is a proverb all ingenious is simple here 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.750

 engine with a volume of two point two 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.080
 having only 60 liters 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.480
 horsepower but it's a real wizard 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.820
 able to pull the tone over weight 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.350
 especially not straining

 on contract costs or forgot 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.680
 only driver 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.160
 but this is a joke but seriously instead 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.190
 so fond of the Red Army that 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.320

 agree hilad bad did not call 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.840
 by today's standards it fought very 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.980
 harsh power steering machine and 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.550
 Naturally there is no vacuum amplifier 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.570
 brakes too everything is fair but it 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.900
 does not mean that the car is bad 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.030
 the driven machine is very narrow and 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.940
 maneuverable single radius 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.460
 about six meters when 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.710
