00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.470
 woods 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.280
 this is the raw material essential to 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.280
 joiner's job 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.380
 beginning with the solid wood that 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.119
 centuries is a basic element of the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.119
 furniture manufacturing around the world 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.010
 here we see a piece of wood in 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.739
 who has not yet received any type of 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.809
 treatment in joinery 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.480
 now we see a piece equipped with 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:50.380
 higher degree of surface finish 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.600
 with greater aesthetic value is from the 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.820
 finish done by the carpenter who 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.190
 makes it possible to better appreciate 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.450
 differences in texture design and 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.450
 coloring of each species 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.280
 in addition the wood presents 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.190
 variations in naturalness and resistance 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.140
 mechanics, which makes the knowledge of 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.670
 specificities of each species is 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.600
 important for the professional 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.930
 woodworker the most appropriate woods 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.080
 for furniture manufacturing in reality 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.210
 are those even considered to be of average 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.090
 density 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:34.750
 so I would cite as an example cedar 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:38.530
 freijÃ³ Embuia cherry that are so 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.170
 less dense woods and some of the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.710
 a density so slightly higher 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.540
 that lend themselves to the manufacture of furniture 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:53.440
 the ivory sucupira peroba and in view of 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:56.170
 a series of situations that per adi 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.550
 became increasingly difficult said 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:05.200
 acquires the most noble woods and even 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.930
 even because of is a series of 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.630
 technical restrictions if the timber 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.390
 they offer to make them work 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.430
 latch then started looking for 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:24.160
 alternative solutions 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:26.650
 then it is initially in the 20th century 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.690
 the beginning of the 20th century have already 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:35.489
 arise is the plywood that 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:41.709
 in fact they are broad that are 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:45.840
 crosses forming a plaque is precisely 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:48.840
 aiming to provide more stability in 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.840
 material 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.810
 As the teacher said, come to the wood. 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.480
 has been replaced by some 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.150
 processed wood alternatives to 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.790
 more used the plywood that is composed 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.760
 by alternating layers of wood sheets 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.830
 treated and disposed of 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.410
 so that the fibers are transverse 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:15.150
 to each layer I see the first plate is 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.140
 placed with the fibers in the 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.810
 following bed rest is placed 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.480
 transversely with the fibers forming 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.090
 angle of 90 degrees with the previous 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.680
 so successively the plates are being 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.590
 overlapping 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.990
 this distribution provide two 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.060
 special features greater 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.970
 mechanical strength and greater 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.830
 dimensional stability 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.470
 because the fibers of the wood that are 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.650
 longer are more resistant and stable 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.590
 in the direction of the length of the fibers 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.200
 between fibers the lower resistance to 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.360
 put cross-alternating layers 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.100
 the plywood sheet becomes more 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.100
 resistant in every way
