00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
kind of weak but hopefully that pays off

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.969 
kind of weak but hopefully that pays off

Carlos<00:02:21.850> Hyde<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.150> he's<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:22.840> close<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.410> a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
Carlos Hyde and he's so close to a

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.110 
Carlos Hyde and he's so close to a
touchdown<00:02:24.040> he's<00:02:24.160> practically<00:02:24.550> gonna<00:02:24.790> get<00:02:25.000> it

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120

touchdown he's practically gonna get it
right<00:02:25.270> here<00:02:25.630> so<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.320> course<00:02:26.650> he<00:02:27.040> ends<00:02:27.280> up<00:02:27.340> with

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490

the<00:02:27.610> ball<00:02:27.850> again<00:02:28.209> mainly<00:02:28.570> because<00:02:28.980> he<00:02:29.980> started

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
the ball again mainly because he started

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.270 
the ball again mainly because he started
with<00:02:31.480> kicking<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.320> ball<00:02:32.470> so<00:02:32.800> that's<00:02:33.040> kind<00:02:33.250> of

definitely need to get some points on
the<00:02:49.810> board<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:50.110> thought<00:02:50.320> off<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.620> past<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:51.040> my

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
the board I thought off the past to my

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.370 
the board I thought off the past to my
tight<00:02:51.489> end<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.239> you<00:02:52.510> can<00:02:52.660> see<00:02:52.840> I'm<00:02:52.989> kind<00:02:53.290> of

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
tight end and you can see I'm kind of

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.440 
tight end and you can see I'm kind of
running<00:02:53.530> out<00:02:53.680> of<00:02:53.739> time<00:02:54.100> there's<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.700> minute<00:02:55.060> 25

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
running out of time there's a minute 25

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.699 
running out of time there's a minute 25
left<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:55.989> clock<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.350> fire<00:02:56.560> off<00:02:56.680> another

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
left on the clock I fire off another

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.979 
left on the clock I fire off another
pass<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.340> Brandon<00:02:57.520> Lloyd<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.510> guess<00:02:58.750> it's

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
pass to Brandon Lloyd and I guess it's

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.630 
pass to Brandon Lloyd and I guess it's
not<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.410> time<00:02:59.620> for<00:02:59.830> these<00:02:59.920> really<00:03:00.370> short

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
not the time for these really short

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.040 
not the time for these really short
strike<00:03:00.910> so<00:03:01.030> I'm<00:03:01.120> just<00:03:01.330> trying<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.630> take<00:03:01.840> what<00:03:02.020> I

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
strike so I'm just trying to take what I

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.810 
strike so I'm just trying to take what I
could<00:03:02.140> get<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.560> get<00:03:02.709> sacked<00:03:03.100> over<00:03:03.310> here<00:03:03.640> that's

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
could get I get sacked over here that's

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.300 
could get I get sacked over here that's
just<00:03:04.000> not<00:03:04.450> what<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:04.750> want<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:05.200> happen<00:03:05.410> so

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
just not what I want to happen so

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.890 
just not what I want to happen so
eventually<00:03:06.700> I<00:03:06.940> decided<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.360> change<00:03:07.540> things<00:03:07.720> up

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
eventually I decided to change things up

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.660
