00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.070
 and the prequel that everyone lived her 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.550
 pixar 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.550
 uy 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.090
 monsters university 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.800
 I had many expectations for 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.800
 university 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.720
 how 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.720
 that movie 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.699
 picks is more the time they pass that joke 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.410
 that was in all the trailers of one 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.350
 I will be late will go as 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.110
 to commit suicide was like this movie but 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.420
 the fever anyway I told them ok let's go 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.579
 to check this out 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.809
 sects outs and then if I took one 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.879
 pleasant surprise with monsters and 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.370
 university is not as bad as I thought 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.680
 it's really pretty good now 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.240
 we will not have a bit more in monsters 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.340
 university 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.380
 If you want, want 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.850
 ok but the two animation modes is 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.780
 university monsters or pretty pretty 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.880
 good in the renders the images all 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.039
 that is false but at the same time it looks like 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.609
 realistic is it is quite rare and 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.110
 interesting and there is nothing quite 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.130
 great now before you start talking 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.659
 from the movie I would like to talk 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.380
 briefly of the cut that happened before 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.380
 of this movie 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.300
 it's great maybe very similar to paper 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.880
 man the color is behind rakitic road 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.320
 seen it see you are on YouTube 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.900
 pretty similar story but the 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.670
 Animation was quite cruise and pretty 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.300
 Realistic photo is actually more when 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.720
 party was like wow wow wow wow 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:57.220
 pretty good but as a short game 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.220
 good but rise towards the end 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.070
 but let's talk about monsters university 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.530
 now the plot of this movie is 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.320
 pretty simple is not so hot such 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.910
 like toy type story ratatouille not for 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.530
 a prequel to monsters inc 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.450
 it's good of all the elements had 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.850
 humor had the simple story but 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.010
 say something that was missing something small and 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.300
 big at the same time the emotion continues 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.010
 something that is missing a monster without 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.540
 investments the emotion that the first 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.520
 had because first you have to say 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.000
 Our style is not as good as 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.200
 First I'm sorry but I will not be waiting 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.780
 I do not think that anyone either 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.910
 waiting for it but if it is not good 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.170
 parties emotions I remember the last 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.270
 scenes from monsters inc 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.870
 they forced that you should have seen 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.870
 monsters Inc 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.590
 monsters Inc 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.590
 do it but if this last scene 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.620
 but outside of that I think they are pretty 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.290
 good job I would say that my favorite part 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.480
 of this application the last 30 to 25 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.180
 minutes in which I thought or the movie 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.099
 will exterminate but not because if a 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.239
 exterminator is exact moment that yes 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.860
 have seen the movie I hope you know 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.319
 which one I'm talking about if I had finished 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.400
 in that moment it would have been like oh 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.400
 that was all 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.950
 ok yesterday of connections and references the 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.959
 first monsters university that like 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.640
 things ended up being what they are what 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.530
 which is quite fun to watch too 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.090
 it's funny and much sweeter what 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.610
 I was waiting because just by watching me 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.040
 trailers looked like a normal comedy 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.840
 and this pixar type being like the era of 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.840
 ice or the secret ring 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.859
 damn blue skies but I must admit the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.930
 much better movies than trailers 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.340
 maybe it's one of the most 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.620
 weak pixar 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.290
 what is so far from being bad though 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.209
 many slamming much better though it's not 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.860
 say a lot but let's hope that the 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.390
 next year already with the return movies 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.870
 originals and do again what 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.209
 they were but so if you want to have a 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.680
 an hour and a half of fun with your 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.209
 your bruises 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.930
 I would say monsters and university 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.550
 definitely an option 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.860
 but if you 're waiting but I try to 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.300
 history 3 maybe you want to skip this 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.130
 but if you want to have a fun time 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.130
 one hour and a half of ouija 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.299
 completely 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.380
 exit 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.710
 it's pretty cool and in the verse of this 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.920
 week we have animated movies in 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.420
 2013 which is better in your opinion the 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.420
 raw monsters university 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.610
 and that they saw them I'm going to have to 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.500
 say the clubs would say it was more or 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.880
 less equally funny together with 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.040
 monsters university but I had that 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.650
 small then of action that I showed 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.449
 university 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.820
 although if you cross them what is your choice 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.820
 is with the criteria 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.060
 if frozen it looks pretty fun and a 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.870
 small ad something big small 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:06.240
 medium large is coming 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:08.950
 soon as it is comes it comes 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.390
 tries pants but a week 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.639
 busy will not be on Wednesday when 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.740

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.930
 of the solitary genre that contrasts 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.110
 premier tomorrow so he explains 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:23.660
 before the premiere wii and the one that contains 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.880
 the world word critic 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:30.430
 to world war z starring 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.430
 brad pitt and her hair and black cut
