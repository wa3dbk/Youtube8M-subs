I'm<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.680> kidding<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.000> add<00:01:09.420> another<00:01:09.750> ball

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
I'm just kidding so to add another ball

I'm just kidding so to add another ball
to<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.260> shower<00:01:10.500> pattern<00:01:10.799> let's<00:01:11.610> start<00:01:11.939> with<00:01:12.060> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
to a shower pattern let's start with a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.940 
to a shower pattern let's start with a
two<00:01:12.299> ball<00:01:12.510> shower<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.260> say<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.560> want<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.830> add

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
two ball shower and say you want to add

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.630 
two ball shower and say you want to add
the<00:01:14.100> third<00:01:14.310> ball

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
the third ball

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.990 
the third ball
you<00:01:15.630> would<00:01:15.780> flash<00:01:16.140> both<00:01:16.560> up<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.070> air<00:01:17.280> so

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
you would flash both up in the air so

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.820 
you would flash both up in the air so
that<00:01:18.150> your<00:01:18.299> hands<00:01:18.540> are<00:01:18.780> completely<00:01:19.229> empty<00:01:19.380> for

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
that your hands are completely empty for

that your hands are completely empty for
a<00:01:19.860> moment<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.780> that's<00:01:21.780> where<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> third<00:01:22.530> ball

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
a moment and that's where the third ball

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.149 
a moment and that's where the third ball
will<00:01:23.040> come<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:24.259> you<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.409> clap<00:01:25.619> your<00:01:25.799> hands<00:01:25.950> if

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
will come in you can clap your hands if

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.880 
will come in you can clap your hands if
you<00:01:26.250> want<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.090> make<00:01:27.270> sure<00:01:27.590> that<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.710> have

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
you want just to make sure that you have

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.230 
you want just to make sure that you have
enough<00:01:29.159> time<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:31.110> add<00:01:31.290> another<00:01:31.530> ball<00:01:32.180> now<00:01:33.180> we

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
enough time to add another ball now we

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.289 
enough time to add another ball now we
do<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> same<00:01:33.630> thing<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.200> three<00:01:34.409> balls<00:01:35.270> get<00:01:36.270> a

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
do the same thing with three balls get a

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.109 
do the same thing with three balls get a
three<00:01:36.570> ball<00:01:36.720> shower<00:01:36.990> going<00:01:38.780> flash<00:01:39.780> all<00:01:40.170> three

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
three ball shower going flash all three

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.340 
three ball shower going flash all three
so<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.270> all<00:01:42.509> three<00:01:42.869> are<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.170> air<00:01:45.170> you<00:01:46.170> can

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
so that all three are in the air you can

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.660 
so that all three are in the air you can
clap<00:01:46.530> your<00:01:46.740> hands<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.280> want

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
clap your hands if you want

however it's not necessary to be able to

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.170 
however it's not necessary to be able to
do<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:52.280> then<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.399> simply<00:01:53.579> add<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
do that and then you simply add the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.209 
do that and then you simply add the
fourth<00:01:54.479> ball<00:01:54.750> now<00:01:55.290> when<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.500> go<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.680> start<00:01:56.070> the

first try starting with two balls in
each<00:02:00.329> hand<00:02:00.619> so<00:02:01.619> start<00:02:01.979> throwing<00:02:02.250> high<00:02:02.460> throws

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
each hand so start throwing high throws

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.459 
each hand so start throwing high throws
from<00:02:03.119> one<00:02:03.329> hand<00:02:03.600> when<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:03.960> hand<00:02:04.170> becomes

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
from one hand when this hand becomes

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.690 
from one hand when this hand becomes
empty<00:02:04.969> feed<00:02:05.969> from<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.360> other<00:02:06.570> hand<00:02:07.580> simple<00:02:08.580> as

empty feed from the other hand simple as

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.830 
empty feed from the other hand simple as
that

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
that

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.150 
that
really<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:11.020> can<00:02:11.170> start<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.500> shower<00:02:11.710> pattern

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
really you can start a shower pattern

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.460 
really you can start a shower pattern
with<00:02:12.370> any<00:02:12.670> number<00:02:13.060> of<00:02:13.180> balls<00:02:13.390> in<00:02:13.630> any<00:02:13.810> hands<00:02:14.290> so

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
with any number of balls in any hands so

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.260 
with any number of balls in any hands so
if<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.680> wanted<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:14.980> start<00:02:15.280> three<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:15.850> this<00:02:16.000> hand

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
if I wanted to start three in this hand

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.040 
if I wanted to start three in this hand
that<00:02:16.740> works<00:02:18.000> if<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.120> want<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.390> start<00:02:19.660> with<00:02:19.840> all

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
that works if I want to start with all

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.380 
that works if I want to start with all
four<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:20.740> this<00:02:20.890> hand<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:22.050> works<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:24.390> try

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
four in this hand that works to try

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.120 
four in this hand that works to try
different<00:02:25.600> methods<00:02:26.140> find<00:02:26.560> out<00:02:26.740> what<00:02:26.920> works

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
different methods find out what works

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.940 
different methods find out what works
best<00:02:27.430> for<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:29.260> that<00:02:29.560> pretty<00:02:29.860> much

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
best for you so that pretty much

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.610 
best for you so that pretty much
thoroughly<00:02:30.850> covers<00:02:31.210> how<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.660> do<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.200> four<00:02:32.500> ball

shower<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:33.220> hope<00:02:33.840> there<00:02:34.840> are<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.990> few<00:02:35.230> other

I would like to point out now the the

too<00:03:48.760> much<00:03:49.090> another<00:03:49.870> thing<00:03:50.080> to<00:03:50.200> think<00:03:50.380> about<00:03:50.440> is

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
too much another thing to think about is

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.230 
too much another thing to think about is
your<00:03:51.360> passes<00:03:52.360> from<00:03:53.110> hand<00:03:53.320> to<00:03:53.380> hand<00:03:53.470> I<00:03:54.240> prefer

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
your passes from hand to hand I prefer

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.620 
your passes from hand to hand I prefer
to<00:03:55.420> do<00:03:55.600> them<00:03:55.780> with<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:56.080> slight<00:03:56.700> downward<00:03:57.700> motion

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
to do them with a slight downward motion

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.450 
to do them with a slight downward motion
so<00:03:59.020> normally<00:03:59.800> when<00:03:59.890> I'm<00:04:00.010> doing<00:04:00.250> shower

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
so normally when I'm doing shower

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.380 
so normally when I'm doing shower
patterns<00:04:01.000> my<00:04:02.100> feeding<00:04:03.100> hand<00:04:03.430> will<00:04:03.820> call<00:04:04.030> it<00:04:04.180> is

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.980

held<00:04:04.960> slightly<00:04:05.500> higher<00:04:05.740> I<00:04:06.630> think<00:04:07.630> this<00:04:07.780> makes

held slightly higher I think this makes

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.430 
held slightly higher I think this makes

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
the pattern easier notice what happens

the pattern easier notice what happens
when<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:11.620> do<00:04:11.740> the<00:04:12.400> shower<00:04:12.610> pattern<00:04:12.940> on<00:04:13.209> my

when I do the shower pattern on my
non-dominant<00:04:14.110> side<00:04:14.200> I<00:04:14.800> tend<00:04:15.610> to<00:04:15.730> do<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:15.970> pass

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
non-dominant side I tend to do the pass

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.390 
non-dominant side I tend to do the pass
more<00:04:16.570> straight<00:04:17.080> across

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
more straight across

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.130 
more straight across
not<00:04:19.400> even<00:04:19.640> on<00:04:19.760> purpose<00:04:20.030> that's<00:04:20.390> kind<00:04:20.870> of<00:04:20.990> just

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
not even on purpose that's kind of just

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.550 
not even on purpose that's kind of just
the<00:04:21.260> way<00:04:21.440> it<00:04:21.650> happens<00:04:22.150> now<00:04:23.150> there<00:04:23.990> is<00:04:24.110> no<00:04:24.290> right

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
the way it happens now there is no right

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.370 
the way it happens now there is no right
or<00:04:24.590> wrong<00:04:24.830> way<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.280> do<00:04:25.700> this<00:04:25.880> so<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:26.930> suggest

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
or wrong way to do this so I suggest

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.500 
or wrong way to do this so I suggest
trying<00:04:27.650> different<00:04:28.250> ways<00:04:28.580> finding<00:04:29.270> out<00:04:29.360> what

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
trying different ways finding out what

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.960 
trying different ways finding out what
you<00:04:29.630> like<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:29.990> best<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:30.470> think<00:04:31.190> doing<00:04:31.370> a<00:04:31.670> slight

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
you like the best I think doing a slight

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.840 
you like the best I think doing a slight
downward<00:04:32.270> pass<00:04:32.750> is<00:04:33.020> easier<00:04:33.560> however<00:04:34.400> I

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
downward pass is easier however I

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.880 
downward pass is easier however I
strongly<00:04:35.360> feel<00:04:35.780> that<00:04:35.840> a<00:04:36.110> straight<00:04:36.560> across

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
strongly feel that a straight across

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.090 
strongly feel that a straight across
pass<00:04:37.400> looks<00:04:38.060> better<00:04:38.480> so<00:04:38.810> it's<00:04:39.530> really<00:04:39.800> about

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
pass looks better so it's really about

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.640 
pass looks better so it's really about
personal<00:04:40.850> preference<00:04:41.150> I've<00:04:41.900> also<00:04:42.170> had<00:04:42.440> people

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
personal preference I've also had people

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.340 
personal preference I've also had people

throwing the high throws you throw a

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.500 
throwing the high throws you throw a
high<00:05:14.210> crossing<00:05:14.660> throw<00:05:14.870> so<00:05:15.500> that<00:05:15.650> transition

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
high crossing throw so that transition

juggle and people told you not to do
this<00:07:02.480> this<00:07:03.480> is<00:07:03.750> the<00:07:03.870> part<00:07:04.140> where<00:07:04.260> you're

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
this this is the part where you're

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.590 
this this is the part where you're
actually<00:07:04.560> gonna<00:07:05.010> want<00:07:05.400> to<00:07:05.610> practice<00:07:06.360> doing

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
actually gonna want to practice doing

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.440 
actually gonna want to practice doing
this<00:07:07.200> so<00:07:08.040> that<00:07:08.070> you<00:07:08.250> can<00:07:08.430> get<00:07:08.610> as<00:07:08.790> low<00:07:09.000> and<00:07:09.210> fast

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.450 
this so that you can get as low and fast

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.410 
this so that you can get as low and fast
as<00:07:09.660> possible<00:07:10.230> to<00:07:10.440> be<00:07:10.560> able<00:07:10.650> to<00:07:10.890> do<00:07:11.420> high-low

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:12.420 
as possible to be able to do high-low

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.320 
as possible to be able to do high-low
showers<00:07:12.840> so<00:07:13.230> once<00:07:14.220> you're<00:07:14.430> comfortable<00:07:14.970> with

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.330 
showers so once you're comfortable with

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.480 
showers so once you're comfortable with
that<00:07:15.540> with<00:07:15.720> three<00:07:16.020> balls<00:07:16.200> which<00:07:16.680> isn't<00:07:17.190> too

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.490 
that with three balls which isn't too

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.420 
that with three balls which isn't too
difficult<00:07:18.350> trying<00:07:19.350> to<00:07:19.410> for<00:07:19.770> which<00:07:20.100> gets<00:07:20.340> a

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430 
difficult trying to for which gets a

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.640 
difficult trying to for which gets a
little<00:07:20.610> bit<00:07:20.700> more<00:07:20.850> difficult<00:07:21.360> I'm<00:07:22.170> not<00:07:22.470> really

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:22.650 
little bit more difficult I'm not really

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.190 
little bit more difficult I'm not really
sure<00:07:22.980> I<00:07:23.010> can<00:07:23.220> offer<00:07:23.370> any<00:07:23.580> further<00:07:23.910> explanation

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:24.200 
sure I can offer any further explanation

the<00:07:25.200> timing<00:07:25.680> is<00:07:25.860> a<00:07:25.920> bit<00:07:26.190> tricky<00:07:26.640> it<00:07:26.730> just<00:07:26.940> takes

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 
the timing is a bit tricky it just takes

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:32.030 
the timing is a bit tricky it just takes
practice<00:07:28.010> but<00:07:29.630> there<00:07:30.630> is<00:07:30.840> a<00:07:30.870> high-low<00:07:31.500> version

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:32.040 
practice but there is a high-low version

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.260 
practice but there is a high-low version
of<00:07:33.030> shower<00:07:33.330> patterns<00:07:33.930> with<00:07:34.250> three<00:07:35.250> four<00:07:35.820> five

of shower patterns with three four five
balls<00:07:36.570> there's<00:07:36.930> also<00:07:37.110> high<00:07:37.530> low<00:07:37.920> low<00:07:38.190> high<00:07:38.940> mid

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:39.270
