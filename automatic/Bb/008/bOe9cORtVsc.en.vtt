I'm<00:00:13.019> going<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.590> show<00:00:13.799> how<00:00:14.070> Alamo<00:00:14.400> keno<00:00:14.849> can<00:00:15.120> be

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
I'm going to show how Alamo keno can be

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.480 
I'm going to show how Alamo keno can be
motorized<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.080> driven<00:00:16.470> as<00:00:16.619> standard<00:00:17.070> cinema

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
motorized and driven as standard cinema

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.570 
motorized and driven as standard cinema
frame<00:00:17.760> rates<00:00:18.000> for<00:00:18.390> about<00:00:18.630> thirty<00:00:19.020> dollars<00:00:19.580> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
frame rates for about thirty dollars the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.689 
frame rates for about thirty dollars the
parts<00:00:20.880> required<00:00:21.029> would<00:00:21.930> be<00:00:21.990> superglue<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.890> nut

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
parts required would be superglue a nut

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.220 
parts required would be superglue a nut
I<00:00:23.970> use<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> 3/8<00:00:25.410> inch<00:00:25.619> nut<00:00:25.980> with<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> diameter<00:00:26.699> of

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
I use a 3/8 inch nut with a diameter of

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.950 
I use a 3/8 inch nut with a diameter of
9/16<00:00:28.230> s<00:00:28.760> finally<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:30.300> will<00:00:30.359> need<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.570> cordless

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
9/16 s finally you will need a cordless

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.709 
9/16 s finally you will need a cordless
drill<00:00:31.080> with<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> nut<00:00:32.189> driver<00:00:35.120> be<00:00:36.120> aware<00:00:36.420> that

per second first remove the hand crank
you<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:56.940> use<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> knife<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.449> pry<00:00:57.930> where<00:00:58.199> it

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
you can use a knife to pry where it

you can use a knife to pry where it
attaches<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.190> center<00:00:59.550> spindle<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.350> don't

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
attaches to the center spindle you don't

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.990 
attaches to the center spindle you don't
have<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.680> exactly<00:01:02.010> be<00:01:02.219> careful<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:02.879> it

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
have to exactly be careful with it

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.820 
have to exactly be careful with it
because<00:01:03.180> we're<00:01:03.480> not<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.409> using<00:01:04.739> it

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
because we're not going to be using it

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.410 
because we're not going to be using it
again<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.549> don't<00:01:05.820> think<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.210> will<00:01:06.270> be

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
again and I don't think it will be

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.440 
again and I don't think it will be
reattached<00:01:06.720> ballif<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.470> change<00:01:07.740> your<00:01:07.920> mind

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
reattached ballif you change your mind

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.530 
reattached ballif you change your mind
then<00:01:09.770> superglue<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.979> nut<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.490> both<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
then superglue the nut to both the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.200 
then superglue the nut to both the
center<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.229> outer<00:01:13.409> spindle<00:01:14.040> be<00:01:14.909> aware<00:01:15.150> that

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
center and outer spindle be aware that

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.270 
center and outer spindle be aware that
it<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.900> actually<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.470> outer<00:01:16.619> spindle<00:01:17.159> that

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it is actually the outer spindle that

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.270 
it is actually the outer spindle that
drives<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.909> camera<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.890> should<00:01:19.890> also<00:01:20.070> mention

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
drives the camera I should also mention

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.999 
drives the camera I should also mention
that<00:01:21.030> regular<00:01:21.420> superglue<00:01:21.960> works<00:01:22.290> great

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
that regular superglue works great

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.060 
that regular superglue works great
I<00:01:23.150> tried<00:01:24.150> epoxy<00:01:24.750> F<00:01:24.840> first<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.770> seemed<00:01:25.979> to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
I tried epoxy F first but it seemed to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.969 
I tried epoxy F first but it seemed to
melt<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> plastic<00:01:26.720> now<00:01:27.720> wait<00:01:28.470> for<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.710> glue

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
melt the plastic now wait for the glue

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.170 
melt the plastic now wait for the glue
to<00:01:29.009> dry<00:01:29.659> then<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.930> camera<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.470> ready<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.890> go

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
to dry then the camera is ready to go

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.649 
to dry then the camera is ready to go
and<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.540> did<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:33.960> only<00:01:34.110> $30<00:01:34.860> if<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.540> are

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
and I did it for only $30 if you are

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.179 
and I did it for only $30 if you are
concerned<00:01:37.020> about<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.380> film<00:01:37.590> damaging<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
camera will as it runs out my experience

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.819 
camera will as it runs out my experience
has<00:01:41.640> shown<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.899> sprocket<00:01:43.439> holes<00:01:43.470> will

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
has shown that the sprocket holes will

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.969 
has shown that the sprocket holes will
actually<00:01:44.220> be<00:01:44.729> ripped<00:01:45.000> out<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.420> film

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
before too much pressure is built up so

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.760 
before too much pressure is built up so
even<00:01:51.210> though<00:01:51.329> I've<00:01:51.509> run<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.869> film<00:01:52.229> completely

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
even though I've run the film completely

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.760 
even though I've run the film completely
out<00:01:52.920> multiple<00:01:53.520> times<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:54.570> never<00:01:55.259> put<00:01:55.530> any

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
out multiple times it's never put any

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.499 
out multiple times it's never put any
