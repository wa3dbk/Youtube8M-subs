passes<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.289> got<00:00:46.500> shoot<00:00:47.360> and<00:00:48.739> that

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
passes you just got shoot and that

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.439 
passes you just got shoot and that
should<00:00:49.980> happen<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.550> should<00:00:50.760> get<00:00:50.940> right<00:00:51.210> into

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
should happen you should get right into

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.450 
should happen you should get right into
the<00:00:51.660> next<00:00:51.899> hand<00:00:52.110> now<00:00:52.739> wait<00:00:52.920> until<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.309> next

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
the next hand now wait until that next

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.490 
the next hand now wait until that next
hand<00:00:53.760> over<00:00:53.969> there<00:00:54.180> at<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> bottom<00:00:54.660> hence<00:00:55.170> you

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
hand over there at the bottom hence you

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.569 
hand over there at the bottom hence you
and<00:00:57.530> it<00:00:59.180> should<00:01:00.180> let<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.230> go<00:01:01.410> into<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.859> but

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
and it should let you go into it but

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.509 
and it should let you go into it but
sometimes<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.750> doesn't<00:01:04.140> because<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.739> just

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
sometimes it doesn't because I just

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.640 
sometimes it doesn't because I just
screwed<00:01:05.909> up<00:01:06.119> right<00:01:06.330> there<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.960> I'm<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.470> gonna

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
screwed up right there so I'm just gonna

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.630 
screwed up right there so I'm just gonna
go<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:10.250> shoot<00:01:12.260> and<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.470> screwed<00:01:13.799> up<00:01:13.920> but

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
go in and shoot and so I screwed up but

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.850 
go in and shoot and so I screwed up but
anyway<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> coin<00:01:15.720> right<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.409> middle<00:01:16.590> over

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
anyway the coin right in the middle over

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.630 
anyway the coin right in the middle over
here<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:18.530> it's<00:01:19.530> not<00:01:19.590> really<00:01:19.890> too<00:01:20.100> hard<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.490> get

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
here and it's not really too hard to get

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.260 
here and it's not really too hard to get
through<00:01:21.270> these<00:01:21.720> two<00:01:22.080> cannons<00:01:23.119> then<00:01:24.119> all<00:01:24.240> we

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
through these two cannons then all we

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.899 
through these two cannons then all we
have<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.450> do<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.810> get<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.950> red<00:01:26.250> cannon<00:01:26.670> and

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
have to do is get to this red cannon and

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.520 
have to do is get to this red cannon and
it'll<00:01:27.119> shoot<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.420> right<00:01:27.450> into<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.990> coin<00:01:28.229> I

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
it'll shoot you right into the coin I

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.720 
it'll shoot you right into the coin I
think<00:01:29.960> now<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.200> crazy<00:01:31.439> hard

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
think now for crazy hard

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.030 
think now for crazy hard
this<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.690> gave<00:01:33.960> me<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.170> bit<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.350> trouble<00:01:34.560> but

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
this one gave me a bit of trouble but

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.120 
this one gave me a bit of trouble but
not<00:01:35.370> as<00:01:35.520> much<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:37.350> level<00:01:37.650> right<00:01:37.800> after

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
not as much as the level right after

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.470 
not as much as the level right after
this<00:01:39.740> so<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.770> getting<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.700> blimp<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.210> easy

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
this so I getting to the blimp and easy

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.660 
this so I getting to the blimp and easy
to<00:01:43.170> hot<00:01:43.710> air<00:01:43.740> balloon<00:01:44.100> whenever<00:01:44.370> you<00:01:44.490> want<00:01:44.640> to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
to hot air balloon whenever you want to

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.990 
to hot air balloon whenever you want to
call<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:45.890> now<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.950> trick<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.580> making

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
call it now the trick here is making

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.840 
call it now the trick here is making
sure<00:01:48.300> you<00:01:48.450> don't<00:01:48.720> run<00:01:49.020> out<00:01:49.260> of<00:01:49.290> fuel<00:01:49.650> just<00:01:50.610> do

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
sure you don't run out of fuel just do

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.970 
sure you don't run out of fuel just do
whatever<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.660> don't<00:01:52.170> run<00:01:52.410> out<00:01:52.620> of<00:01:52.650> fuel

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
whatever you can don't run out of fuel

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:00.350 
whatever you can don't run out of fuel
and<00:01:56.570> there<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.810> think<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:59.520> didn't<00:02:00.030> hit<00:02:00.150> any

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
and there I think I didn't hit any

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.890 
and there I think I didn't hit any
enemies<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:01.340> had<00:02:02.340> invincibility<00:02:02.910> on<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.630> I

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
enemies I had invincibility on so I

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.230 
enemies I had invincibility on so I
couldn't<00:02:04.290> tell<00:02:04.440> now<00:02:04.980> this<00:02:05.190> one<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.730> probably

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
couldn't tell now this one is probably

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.180 
couldn't tell now this one is probably
the<00:02:06.510> harvest<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.350> far<00:02:08.780> too<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.110> screwed<00:02:10.770> up<00:02:10.860> okay

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
the harvest so far too I screwed up okay

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.360 
the harvest so far too I screwed up okay
now<00:02:11.790> what<00:02:12.210> you<00:02:12.330> want<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.600> do<00:02:12.720> here<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.350> it<00:02:14.280> will

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
now what you want to do here is it will

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.850 
now what you want to do here is it will
take<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> couple<00:02:14.790> tries<00:02:15.240> but<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:16.590> want<00:02:16.770> to

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
take you a couple tries but you want to

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.920 
take you a couple tries but you want to
make<00:02:17.040> sure<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.730> all<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.000> cans<00:02:18.210> are<00:02:18.480> lined<00:02:18.510> up

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
make sure that all the cans are lined up

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.690 
make sure that all the cans are lined up
so<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.560> don't<00:02:19.680> have<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:20.010> wait<00:02:20.130> for<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.340> lava

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
so you don't have to wait for the lava

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.560 
so you don't have to wait for the lava
to<00:02:20.850> pass<00:02:21.030> by<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.330> time<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.720> Sun<00:02:21.960> gets<00:02:22.140> there

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570

all right now for the so-called

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.970 
all right now for the so-called
impossible<00:02:44.990> level<00:02:45.140> it's<00:02:45.500> really<00:02:45.800> not<00:02:45.920> that

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
impossible level it's really not that

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.090
