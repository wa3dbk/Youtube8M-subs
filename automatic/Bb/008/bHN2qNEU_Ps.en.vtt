00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.440 
division I think you know beating Cotto
showed<00:05:45.170> a<00:05:45.200> lot<00:05:45.500> even<00:05:45.620> though<00:05:45.800> it<00:05:45.860> was<00:05:45.950> 145<00:05:46.520> but

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
showed a lot even though it was 145 but

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.510

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
still you know Cotto is probably the

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.330 
still you know Cotto is probably the
