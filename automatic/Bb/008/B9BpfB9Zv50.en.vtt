00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.290 

I<00:00:03.870> think<00:00:04.830> going<00:00:04.980> into<00:00:05.190> we've<00:00:05.550> been<00:00:05.700> we've<00:00:06.270> been

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:06.300 
I think going into we've been we've been

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.690 
I think going into we've been we've been
training<00:00:07.230> for<00:00:07.470> this<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.859> preparing<00:00:08.340> for<00:00:08.580> this

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
training for this and preparing for this

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.240 
training for this and preparing for this
for<00:00:08.760> six<00:00:09.480> months<00:00:09.780> when<00:00:09.930> we<00:00:10.019> knew<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.380> when<00:00:11.130> we

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
for six months when we knew the when we

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.490 
for six months when we knew the when we
when<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:11.580> found<00:00:11.820> out<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.000> draw<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.600> keep

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
when we found out the draw and keep

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.110 
when we found out the draw and keep
saying<00:00:13.740> all<00:00:13.830> along<00:00:13.860> we<00:00:14.160> we<00:00:14.730> kind<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:14.970> always

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
saying all along we we kind of always

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.509 
saying all along we we kind of always
felt<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.690> was<00:00:15.810> going<00:00:15.930> to<00:00:15.990> take<00:00:16.260> three<00:00:17.010> games<00:00:17.340> to

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:17.519 
felt it was going to take three games to

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:18.769 
felt it was going to take three games to
get<00:00:17.640> through<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> win<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.330> other<00:00:18.420> day<00:00:18.630> would

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
get through a win the other day would

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.060 
get through a win the other day would
have<00:00:18.869> been<00:00:18.960> great<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.380> probably<00:00:19.890> would<00:00:20.009> have

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
have been great and probably would have

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.009 
have been great and probably would have
saw<00:00:20.279> us<00:00:20.429> through<00:00:20.669> but<00:00:20.849> it's<00:00:21.509> not<00:00:21.660> like<00:00:21.839> we're

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:22.019 
saw us through but it's not like we're

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.040 
saw us through but it's not like we're
disappointed<00:00:22.439> because<00:00:22.970> we<00:00:23.970> knew<00:00:24.179> that<00:00:24.210> if<00:00:24.990> we

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
disappointed because we knew that if we

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.779 
disappointed because we knew that if we
played<00:00:25.349> well<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.589> three<00:00:25.919> games<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:26.609> would

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
played well in three games that we would

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.609 
played well in three games that we would
we<00:00:27.239> would<00:00:27.269> get<00:00:27.449> through<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.779> group<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.230> so

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
we would get through the group and so

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.399 
we would get through the group and so
that's<00:00:28.800> still<00:00:29.159> on<00:00:29.999> our<00:00:30.179> minds<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:31.140> just<00:00:31.289> gotta

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:31.409 
that's still on our minds we just gotta

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:32.990 
that's still on our minds we just gotta
keep<00:00:31.589> moving<00:00:31.859> forward<00:00:32.040> progressing<00:00:32.910> each

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
keep moving forward progressing each

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.920 
keep moving forward progressing each
game<00:00:34.070> getting<00:00:35.070> better<00:00:35.340> as<00:00:36.330> when<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.630> lose<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
game getting better as when we lose the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.140 
game getting better as when we lose the
ball<00:00:37.080> our<00:00:37.980> reactions<00:00:38.520> getting<00:00:38.880> behind<00:00:38.970> the

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
ball our reactions getting behind the

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.420 
ball our reactions getting behind the
ball<00:00:39.330> making<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.500> difficult<00:00:40.650> on<00:00:40.920> our<00:00:41.040> opponent

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
ball making it difficult on our opponent

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.420 
ball making it difficult on our opponent
but<00:00:42.090> uh<00:00:42.150> you<00:00:42.990> know<00:00:43.110> saying<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.070> we're<00:00:44.220> still

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
but uh you know saying that we're still

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.060 
but uh you know saying that we're still
and<00:00:44.820> then<00:00:45.060> the<00:00:45.330> last<00:00:45.480> game<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.010> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
and then the last game and we have a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.410 
and then the last game and we have a
possibility<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.730> through<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.270> that's

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
possibility of going through and that's

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.240 
possibility of going through and that's
position<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.320> want<00:00:49.470> to<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.650> in<00:00:49.830> and<00:00:50.010> we're

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
position you want to be in and we're

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.560 
position you want to be in and we're
happy<00:00:50.370> with<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.820> far<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.210> think<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
happy with that so far I think the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.060 
happy with that so far I think the
moment<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.290> know<00:00:52.410> we<00:00:52.530> start<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.860> put

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
moment you know we start to put

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.730 
moment you know we start to put
individual<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.600> know<00:00:54.720> lancer<00:00:55.170> needs<00:00:55.440> in

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
individual you know lancer needs in

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.290 
individual you know lancer needs in
front<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.130> you<00:00:56.400> know<00:00:56.520> we're<00:00:56.670> doing<00:00:56.790> as<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> team

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
front of you know we're doing as a team

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.660 
front of you know we're doing as a team
is<00:00:57.570> role<00:00:58.470> in<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.680> crash<00:00:58.950> I<00:00:59.160> think<00:00:59.400> at<00:00:59.490> this<00:00:59.580> point

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
is role in a crash I think at this point

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.060 
is role in a crash I think at this point
I<00:01:00.090> mean<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.020> see<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> locker<00:01:01.590> room<00:01:01.770> you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
I mean you see in the locker room you

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.290 
I mean you see in the locker room you
know<00:01:02.190> before<00:01:02.490> the<00:01:02.579> game<00:01:02.730> everybody<00:01:03.000> just

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
know before the game everybody just

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.700 
know before the game everybody just
cares<00:01:03.540> about<00:01:03.600> how<00:01:03.810> we<00:01:03.870> do<00:01:04.019> together<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.589> I

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
cares about how we do together and I

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.690 
cares about how we do together and I
think<00:01:04.890> that's<00:01:05.009> all<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.220> matters<00:01:05.489> does

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
think that's all that matters does

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.520 
think that's all that matters does
matter<00:01:05.880> who<00:01:06.000> scores<00:01:06.240> or<00:01:06.450> how<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.600> score<00:01:06.960> as

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
matter who scores or how we score as

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.410 
matter who scores or how we score as
long<00:01:07.680> as<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:07.860> get<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> results<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.370> need<00:01:08.580> you

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
long as we get the results we need you

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.730 
long as we get the results we need you
