00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.279
 play one is the name of the voter 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.830
 speakers from the house sony 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.630
 whether the 200 euro expensive speaker holds 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.140
 what he promises you will learn now and 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.180
 here in the review with the play 1 or 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.190
 playon completes its sonos 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.220
 offer of hormones themed speakers 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.850
 after play 3play five of the playboy one 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.850
 Subwoofer now follows the playon 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.190
 sonos play 1 is about 15 cm high twelve 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.660
 centimeter wide and as deep a 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.490
 look at the balance already indicates 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.110
 that the developers a lot of technology 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.040
 in the cylindrical speaker 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:03.010
 have to have housed whole 1860 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.290
 gram measures the good piece in the compact 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.310
 and send cardboard display 1 is located 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.990
 next to some fast 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.090
 still a special one 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.340
 adapted power cable whose strength 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.400
 is flattened so he does not leave the 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.890
 speaker housing also protrudes 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.289
 very flat lan cable lays sonos 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.450
 also in the processing of the 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.810
 Plan is on a high level 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.270
 level 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.249
 the drivers installed one each for high 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.869
 and low frequencies sit one 

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:30.700
 closed plastic housing 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.859
 This offers, among other things, the advantage 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.069
 that play one by the manufacturer for the 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.299
 use in the bathroom is released 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.460
 on the back there is a 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.499
 thread here leaves at play on 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.350
 attach static or wall brackets 

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:45.880
 Who already uses them over the 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.630
 really no thought 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.819
 close 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.229
 in addition the new speaker becomes simple 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.929
 connected to the mains 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.850
 in the matching devices app new sonos 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.969
 Add component selected and 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.100
 already the music streaming can start at 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.869
 the playon however as sole 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.700
 solos components must use him 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.310
 first by LAN cable with the router 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.289
 the music supply is supposed to connect 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.709
 without a barber so wlan from the stage 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.700
 go 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.260
 you need a so-called bridge 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.530
 This zone is still available separately for purchase 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.319
 on 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.940
 One thing I have to say but no matter 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.930
 which way the component 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.090
 to be added 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.060
 the sonos furnishing is exemplary 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.500
 and really simple it is 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.160
 Amazing what a print full of 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.190
 even the smallest sounded 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.050
 loudspeaker brings about solo 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.940
 on the desk the shelf floor 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.800
 or placed on the kitchen table like 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.480
 the little one plays bigger rooms himself 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.760
 without being exhausting 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.620
 in the middle and in the heights are despite the structural 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.680
 limited possibilities finely resolved 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.600
 and even low frequencies delivers play 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.730
 one with a panzer in the ear one man 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.250
 otherwise only from much larger system 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.220
 recognizes as a very high volume level 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.780
 However, the device tends to oversteer 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.970
 then the level is already so high 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.130
 that in about 30 square meters 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.770
 big room no normal entertainment 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.100
 possible is the play 1 possesses on the 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.030
 top one play or pause button tip 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.530
 If the key to 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.780
 finished for music playback 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.670
 or paused you tap the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.770
 button twice in quick succession 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.840
 who automatically the next song in the 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.520
 playlist plays the 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.250
 volume can also be directly 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.750
 from the device control and fix this 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.610
 talk play music 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.460
 different sources online as well 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.050
 is offline from a connection to a nas 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.730
 as possible as the use of known 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.990
 streaming offers such as 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.700
 spotify premium radio or napster 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.920
 Of course you can also do it from home 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.810
 numerous podcast offers as well 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.230
 internet radio stations called 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.030
 become 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.400
 now the good piece should be 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.050
 show what it is important that now 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.390
 to have a look into the song 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.350
 to grant quality 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.910
 I recorded the song with mine 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.150
 wheel podcaster microphone 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.800
 I have the same title for comparison 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.830
 also about the speakers of the macbook 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.090
 pros played long talk short sense 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.090
 lord thy god himself 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.810
 last still follows my personal 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.750
 Conclusion Three aspects summarize the play man 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.710
 in my opinion good together 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.740
 surprisingly full sounded good 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.120
 processing and simple setup 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.160
 his plan a completely successful 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.930
 extension but also a cheaper 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.420
 entry into the world of solo systems 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.060
 the service via ios android or 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.130
 desktop application is really good 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.830
 realized also offer many more 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.610
 possibilities and work without 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.700
 problems 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.100
 play one is available for 199 euros 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.280
 the separately available bridge costs 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.300
 another 49 euros for associated links 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.430
 I put you in the video 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.020
 description that should be it now too 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.560
 I have the video has you 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.240
 like 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.010
 if that was the case shows that yet 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.380
 again in the thumbs up, suggestions 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:46.150
 and co place in the comments 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.150
 until then it'll be good 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.259
 times
