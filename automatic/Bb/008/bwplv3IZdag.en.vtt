to be honest with you and even close

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.119 
to be honest with you and even close
range<00:01:01.260> with<00:01:01.350> steady<00:01:01.620> aim<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.100> a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
range with steady aim it's like a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.219 
range with steady aim it's like a
shotgun<00:01:02.460> long-range<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:03.510> got<00:01:03.629> rapid<00:01:04.049> fire

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
shotgun long-range it's got rapid fire

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.770 
shotgun long-range it's got rapid fire
so<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.530> shoots<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> G<00:01:05.159> 11<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:06.420> then<00:01:06.659> again

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780

they really do look for the red dots on

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.289 
they really do look for the red dots on
the<00:01:56.399> radar<00:01:56.579> because<00:01:56.850> they<00:01:56.939> don't<00:01:57.119> know<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
the radar because they don't know the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.580 
the radar because they don't know the
maps<00:01:57.509> they<00:01:57.659> don't<00:01:57.840> know<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> spawns<00:01:58.350> and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
maps they don't know the spawns and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.260 
maps they don't know the spawns and
there's<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> lot<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.100> good<00:01:59.280> players<00:01:59.579> hiding<00:02:00.180> in

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
there's a lot of good players hiding in

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.819 
there's a lot of good players hiding in
there<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:01.020> can't<00:02:01.259> tell<00:02:01.380> who's<00:02:01.560> good<00:02:01.799> who's

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
there you can't tell who's good who's

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.399 
there you can't tell who's good who's
bad<00:02:02.040> by<00:02:02.399> rank<00:02:02.670> at<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:02.969> stage<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.869> really

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
bad by rank at this stage so you really

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.719 
bad by rank at this stage so you really
need<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.710> be<00:02:04.799> having<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.040> assassin<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.549> it

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
need to be having that assassin on it

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.639 
need to be having that assassin on it
hide<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.030> from<00:02:06.119> UAV<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:07.290> hides<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.619> from

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.199 
heartbeat sensors motion sensors
everything<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.530> then<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.340> approach<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:12.030> this

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
everything and then the approach of this

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.490 
everything and then the approach of this
which<00:02:12.390> doesn't<00:02:12.720> take<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:12.959> long<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.170> get<00:02:13.379> at

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
which doesn't take that long to get at

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.760 
which doesn't take that long to get at
all

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
all

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.210 
all
it<00:02:14.220> um<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:15.720> means<00:02:15.900> you're<00:02:16.110> immune<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.500> EMP<00:02:17.070> you

head around a few to spawned a bit of
the<00:03:20.280> maps<00:03:20.520> and<00:03:20.820> you<00:03:20.910> understand<00:03:21.300> it<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.450> bit<00:03:21.600> i

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
the maps and you understand it a bit i

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.440 
the maps and you understand it a bit i
would<00:03:22.140> definitely<00:03:22.530> definitely<00:03:23.010> go<00:03:23.550> for<00:03:23.580> what

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
would definitely definitely go for what

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.470 
would definitely definitely go for what
i'm<00:03:24.570> using<00:03:24.720> in<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.020> game<00:03:25.200> predator<00:03:26.480> strafe

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
i'm using in this game predator strafe

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.730 
i'm using in this game predator strafe
run<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:28.190> a<00:03:29.780> whatsit<00:03:30.780> pave<00:03:31.170> low<00:03:31.380> yeah<00:03:31.620> of

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
run and a whatsit pave low yeah of

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.949 
run and a whatsit pave low yeah of
course<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.910> pave<00:03:33.060> lows<00:03:33.240> at<00:03:33.360> 12<00:03:33.600> rather<00:03:33.840> than

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
course the pave lows at 12 rather than

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.800 
course the pave lows at 12 rather than
nine<00:03:34.200> kills<00:03:34.620> now<00:03:35.000> wellpoint<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.600> can<00:03:36.720> get

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
nine kills now wellpoint you can get

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.360 
nine kills now wellpoint you can get
points<00:03:37.110> for<00:03:37.170> domination<00:03:37.740> captures<00:03:38.280> and

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
points for domination captures and

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.550 
points for domination captures and
everything<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:38.910> probably<00:03:39.690> does<00:03:39.870> even<00:03:40.200> out<00:03:40.320> it

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
everything so probably does even out it

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.720 
everything so probably does even out it
does<00:03:40.709> take<00:03:41.010> about<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.280> same<00:03:41.340> amount<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:41.670> time

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
does take about the same amount of time

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.570 
does take about the same amount of time
to<00:03:41.940> get<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:42.990> i<00:03:43.290> find<00:03:43.800> he's<00:03:43.920> really<00:03:44.160> complement

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
to get so i find he's really complement
