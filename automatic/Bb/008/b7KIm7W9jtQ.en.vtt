 you know, the higher is all mine 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.080
 childhood of course with cartoons at that 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.900
 the time when the CTC and TNT were not the same 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.490
 guy who by some channels would say so on 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.789
 shows them really good 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.779
 things especially at noon noon people 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.760
 semi afternoon deck afternoon 5 o'clock it was 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.380
 time cartoons and they went like that 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.210
 first did not start on tnt then 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.880
 ended on CTC and I mean it went 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.619
 somewhere around 11 and 30 and until 16 in the evening 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.790
 omit all sorts of poems with time 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.300
 little witches 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.680
 small secrets miracles of science shorter yes 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.230
 it was cool 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.120
 I often celebrate I run from 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.890
 schools to catch tv not 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.780
 skip my favorite series 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.340
 cartoon and today I want to move 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.230
 little bit your feelings of nostalgia and 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.629
 remember these cartoons the future of you 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.460
 tell you about my favorite 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.949
 cartoons in childhood that name on the channel 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.739
 TNT page fox cysts example, I do not 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.600
 I ’m probably still taking the first cartoon 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.430
 he probably loved more than all 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.189
 the rest will be on this list 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.350
 oh these babes every episode of this 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.420
 series is another story about the adventures 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.490
 toddler friends showing the world and 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.380
 parenting relationship with a child 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.630
 big role in the borderline material 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.060
 imaginations for example in one of the series 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.159
 parents took the kids to the zoo and the kids 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.740
 presented as if they are in the wild 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.090
 jungle often children are looking for adventures in 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.250
 the time when their parents 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.860
 chatting peacefully in the kitchen or somewhere 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:34.290
 leaves or growth stand next 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.840
 It happens and there is a certain pattern 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.970
 series which is always repeated children 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.660
 playing in the yard or visiting tours 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.240
 chat they listen to their dads moms oh often 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.300
 don't understand what they say angelica 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:55.620
 not everything is explained only in its own way 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:57.510
 was able to explain everything in her own way 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.030
 ends where does the adventure find 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.759
 Angelica is often punished for 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.040
 children made me the most of course 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.530
 they liked this series angelika 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.300
 Yes, it's like you can say antihero but 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.030
 she's great you have to admit it 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.610
 oh my god she happens such an hour and we say 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.709
 but I can not not love it 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.290
 is exactly what drives it 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.600
 series what is above its interesting what 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.190
 makes these connections to children but for now 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.650

 Arnold who she can not him 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.550
 confess and you probably think that 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.760
 the most common series about schoolchildren 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.510
 no every episode is filled with some 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.520
 meaning 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.200
 for example, that appreciating friendship is not 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.270
 it is necessary well, for example, to hope only one 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.270
 man that the family is the most dear 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.480
 for you for example this is the most interesting in 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.030
 that the hero and they are not like a template and 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.950
 true shadow patterns perfect if 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.990

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.640
 city ​​roller will be so i will give you 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.640
 just one example of this is 5 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:22.260
 and it became then now the time has come 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.750
 go to tv channel know between tnt and 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.669
 CTC was really a big difference 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.010
 cartoon missing there are shown 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.570
 superhero when in patent out 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.000
 superheroes and of course it was possible 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.530

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.419
 showed plan entente 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.139
 why I do not know 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.330
 have mercy 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.970
 but also the adventures of batman league 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.400
 justice we of course x people 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.169
 evolution if you remember me small 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:54.210
 when i saw these films then from league 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:57.090
 justice is such an act of a couple with such 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.810
 strange things husband and similar to 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.060
 lightning yes it's cool whether it's my favorite 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.570
 a character from this particular series i 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.800
 I learned about flash and I am extremely pleased in short 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.680
 it is clear what the justice league is 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.210
 just gathered friends not familiar and 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.210
 strangers just gathered 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.460
 a huge number of superheroes and steel 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.340
 together to save the land of such avengers 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.860
 only they were born or x practically 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.910
 how to visit there is not important at all if 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:30.030

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.130
 just loved him every episode was with 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.630
 is a unique can of just from 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.539
 this cartoon therefore do not constitute 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.940
 I know a top most fucking series is 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:41.100
 I even know what they did to this tube 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.260
 I saw it personally and of course people 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.389
 x evolution know i always adored 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.240
 Watch TV shows about the superhero team 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.580
 because when a lot of superheroes are 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.830

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.110

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.580
 most liked the night serpent 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.180
 so the movie is the most honest he 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.910
