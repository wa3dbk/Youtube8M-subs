inexpensive alternative to both of these

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.569 
inexpensive alternative to both of these
options<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.440> I'm<00:00:56.010> going<00:00:56.130> to<00:00:56.190> show<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.430> how<00:00:56.520> to

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
options and I'm going to show you how to

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.950 
options and I'm going to show you how to
make<00:00:56.760> them<00:00:56.910> show<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.630> don't<00:00:57.780> want<00:00:57.900> to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
make them show so if you don't want to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.480 
make them show so if you don't want to
buy<00:00:58.079> them<00:00:58.200> you<00:00:58.410> can<00:00:58.740> make<00:00:58.829> them<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.130> of<00:00:59.310> raw

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
buy them you can make them out of raw

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.030 
buy them you can make them out of raw
wire<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.170> then<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.290> you<00:01:01.380> do<00:01:01.560> with<00:01:01.680> them<00:01:01.829> is

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
wire and then what you do with them is

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.729 
wire and then what you do with them is
you<00:01:02.220> just<00:01:02.400> open<00:01:02.700> them<00:01:02.820> up<00:01:03.259> you're<00:01:04.259> going<00:01:04.530> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
you just open them up you're going to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.819 
you just open them up you're going to
slide<00:01:05.009> on<00:01:05.689> whatever<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:07.110> these<00:01:07.470> happen

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829 
slide on whatever you have these happen

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.340 
slide on whatever you have these happen
to<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:07.950> some<00:01:08.340> precio<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.079> crystal<00:01:10.079> Braille

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
to be some precio so crystal Braille

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.880 
to be some precio so crystal Braille
lots<00:01:10.649> and<00:01:11.549> then<00:01:11.819> you<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:12.179> close<00:01:12.960> them<00:01:13.170> up<00:01:13.289> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
lots and then you just close them up and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.190 
lots and then you just close them up and
wear<00:01:14.700> them<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:14.999> is<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.840> they<00:01:15.929> can<00:01:15.960> work

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
wear them as is so they can work

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.630 
wear them as is so they can work
interchangeable<00:01:17.009> where<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.429> take<00:01:17.609> your

interchangeable where you can take your

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.760 
interchangeable where you can take your
pliers<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.569> can<00:01:18.749> just<00:01:18.960> squash<00:01:19.200> them<00:01:19.469> a<00:01:19.499> little

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
pliers you can just squash them a little

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.919 
pliers you can just squash them a little
bit<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.490> make<00:01:20.639> these<00:01:20.850> kidney<00:01:21.240> back<00:01:21.389> ear<00:01:21.689> wires

the center of a pre-cut 2 inch piece of

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.240 
the center of a pre-cut 2 inch piece of
wire<00:02:16.230> you

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
wire you

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.180 
wire you
make<00:02:17.550> these<00:02:18.590> kidney<00:02:19.590> back<00:02:19.740> ear<00:02:19.980> wires

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
make these kidney back ear wires

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.190 
make these kidney back ear wires
whatever<00:02:20.580> length<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:20.970> want<00:02:21.270> in<00:02:21.510> style<00:02:21.990> right

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
now are some of the two inch ones these

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.500 
now are some of the two inch ones these
are<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.300> half<00:02:24.690> inch<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.340> then<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.580> 3/4<00:02:27.120> inch<00:02:27.240> 2

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
are a half inch and then the 3/4 inch 2

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.460 
are a half inch and then the 3/4 inch 2
inch<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:27.810> we<00:02:27.900> have<00:02:27.990> them<00:02:28.110> in<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.230> lot<00:02:28.350> of

inch so we have them in a lot of

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.080 
inch so we have them in a lot of
different<00:02:28.710> sizes<00:02:29.100> but<00:02:29.520> this<00:02:29.640> way<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.880> can

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
different sizes but this way you can

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.060 
different sizes but this way you can
make<00:02:30.240> them<00:02:30.420> in<00:02:30.540> whatever<00:02:30.720> size<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.320> want<00:02:31.350> so

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070
