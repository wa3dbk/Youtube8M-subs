00:00:08.256 --> 00:00:10.922
At the Under 63 kilo Tournament press conference...

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:14.418
Where was Matsumoto?

00:00:14.418 --> 00:00:20.499
I asked them to let me go to it. Let me go on stage! Let me go!

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:28.448
He was the last fighter to be signed.

00:00:28.448 --> 00:00:34.923
He was touted as the up-and-comer to beat Otsuki.

00:00:34.923 --> 00:00:43.684
If I would have won, they just would have said it was because Otsuki was old.

00:00:43.684 --> 00:00:48.164
I'm sure no one is expecting anything from me.

00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:49.628
Q: You're not the star.

00:00:49.628 --> 00:00:52.307
A: I'm not.

00:00:52.307 --> 00:00:57.870
He knows he's not favored to win

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.920
I'm sure no one thinks I'll win, but I want to surprise them all.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.533
I'll become the star.

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:13.394
Strong heart

00:01:13.394 --> 00:01:18.108
I never give up.

00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:24.855
Even if you break my bones, nose, or teeth, you'll never break my will.

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:26.591
I chipped my tooth!

00:01:26.591 --> 00:01:29.124
So what? It's just a tooth.

00:01:29.124 --> 00:01:32.560
Like Fire Harada.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.503
To become the star

00:01:38.503 --> 00:01:42.610
He must rise to the challenge.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.969
I've lost twice in a row...

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.666
And I was ready to retire...

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:56.948
If I don't win I can't move up in rank. I'm not someone who deserves to.

00:01:56.948 --> 00:02:00.807
Dedication and challenge.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.895
Maeda: You did well! Good job! Good job!

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:16.967
We'll see if I'm the star or not.

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:20.062
This fight will show if I'm the one to lead.

00:02:20.062 --> 00:02:23.500
I'm not only thinking about getting stronger and winning.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:31.652
I want to have a fight where the fans will want to cheer me on.

00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:35.570
I'm probably the one with the most to lose.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.298
Matsumoto also has things on the line.

00:02:39.298 --> 00:02:44.316
I have no job except training.

00:02:44.316 --> 00:02:53.669
If I win, I can make a living as a fighter.

00:02:53.669 --> 00:03:04.147
I want to prove I can do it.  I can't afford to lose.
35
00:03:04,147 --&gt; 00:03:02,333
I want to win for baby and child.

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:09.555
I think convincing Matsumoto to give K-1 up and getting a regular job,

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:13.819
The star of the show.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.123
The man hoping to steal that star.
