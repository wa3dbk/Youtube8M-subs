delusional I'm just going through it

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.459 
delusional I'm just going through it
because<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.739> kind<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.219> tilos<00:01:00.120> build<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:01.079> me<00:01:01.199> it

because the kind of tilos build to me it

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.290 
because the kind of tilos build to me it
seems<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.670> lot<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.000> build<00:01:03.149> that

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
seems like it's just a lot of build that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.149 
seems like it's just a lot of build that
he's<00:01:03.449> used<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.170> ladder<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.530> not<00:01:04.710> refrain

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
he's used in the ladder it's not refrain

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.910 
he's used in the ladder it's not refrain
hard<00:01:05.489> enough<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.570> tells<00:01:07.140> me<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.530> he<00:01:07.619> hasn't

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
hard enough that tells me that he hasn't

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.340 
hard enough that tells me that he hasn't
had<00:01:08.360> specific<00:01:09.360> one-on-one<00:01:09.869> training<00:01:10.080> with

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
had specific one-on-one training with

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.780 
had specific one-on-one training with
teammates<00:01:10.710> because<00:01:10.890> that's<00:01:11.130> how<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.369> refine

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
teammates because that's how you refine

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.550 
teammates because that's how you refine
your<00:01:11.820> build<00:01:12.119> cuz<00:01:12.750> they<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> same

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
your build cuz they you do the same

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.590 
your build cuz they you do the same
thing<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:14.070> 50<00:01:14.460> games<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.850> row<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.210> you

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
thing like 50 games in a row and you

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.570 
thing like 50 games in a row and you
fill<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.049> holes<00:01:16.259> where<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.710> week<00:01:16.920> which

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
fill in the holes where it's week which

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.520 
fill in the holes where it's week which
seems<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.060> hasn't<00:01:18.240> been<00:01:18.420> done<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.990> I

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
seems like it hasn't been done and I

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.810 
seems like it hasn't been done and I
think<00:01:19.770> that's<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.040> problem<00:01:20.220> because<00:01:20.400> they're

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
think that's a problem because they're

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.100 
think that's a problem because they're
on<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> protist<00:01:21.299> player<00:01:21.479> isn't<00:01:21.600> team<00:01:21.810> look<00:01:21.930> well

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
is really hard s boxing career and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.719 
is really hard s boxing career and
heroes<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.650> career<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.159> well<00:01:32.310> there's<00:01:32.640> like

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
heroes in career as well there's like

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.090 
heroes in career as well there's like
nobody<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.420> train<00:01:33.659> with<00:01:33.840> TL<00:01:34.079> oh<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.409> I

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
nobody the train with TL oh and I

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.160 
nobody the train with TL oh and I
suppose<00:01:35.159> all<00:01:36.000> his<00:01:36.119> training<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.570> ladder<00:01:36.840> I

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
suppose all his training just ladder I

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.830 
suppose all his training just ladder I
don't<00:01:37.860> know<00:01:37.920> which<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.610> not<00:01:38.790> ideal<00:01:38.820> because<00:01:39.390> a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
don't know which is not ideal because a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.289 
don't know which is not ideal because a
lot<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.680> training<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.130> not<00:01:41.280> consistent<00:01:41.700> so

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
lot of training is not consistent so

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.450 
lot of training is not consistent so
yeah<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.170> does<00:01:43.530> seem<00:01:43.710> like<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.009> bill<00:01:44.189> does

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
yeah it does seem like this bill does

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.219 
yeah it does seem like this bill does
have<00:01:44.579> problems<00:01:44.880> with<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.149> looks<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.509> at

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
have problems with it looks like at

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.660 
have problems with it looks like at
least<00:01:46.290> opens<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.950> same<00:01:47.130> way<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.460> time

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
least opens the same way this time

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.580 
least opens the same way this time
around<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.119> would<00:01:48.780> out<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.470> see

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
around I would out just like to see

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.200 
around I would out just like to see
something<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.040> little<00:01:50.159> bit<00:01:50.430> more<00:01:51.000> creative

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
something a little bit more creative

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.630 
something a little bit more creative
from<00:01:51.659> TLO<00:01:52.079> because<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.799> think<00:01:53.130> trying<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> same

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
from TLO because I think trying the same

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.310 
from TLO because I think trying the same
build<00:01:53.909> over<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.270> over<00:01:54.329> again<00:01:54.540> if<00:01:54.869> he<00:01:55.140> loses

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
build over and over again if he loses

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.480 
build over and over again if he loses
this<00:01:55.560> one<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:55.950> build<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.310> would

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
this one with this build I would

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.859 
this one with this build I would
certainly<00:01:56.850> expect<00:01:57.210> him<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.479> do<00:01:57.570> something

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
certainly expect him to do something

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.179 
certainly expect him to do something
different<00:01:57.899> because<00:01:58.530> it's<00:01:58.920> picked<00:01:59.070> his

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
different because it's picked his

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.679 
different because it's picked his
preferred<00:01:59.460> map<00:01:59.670> for<00:01:59.850> this<00:01:59.939> now<00:02:00.090> yeah<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.390> think

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
preferred map for this now yeah I think

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.420 
preferred map for this now yeah I think
he's<00:02:00.960> actually<00:02:01.079> using<00:02:01.259> these<00:02:01.799> games<00:02:02.130> as

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
he's actually using these games as

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.100 
he's actually using these games as
refinement<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.270> his<00:02:03.390> build<00:02:03.630> he's<00:02:03.899> just

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
refinement to his build he's just

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.080 
refinement to his build he's just
improving<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.680> every<00:02:05.040> single<00:02:05.250> game<00:02:05.490> or<00:02:05.729> trying

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
improving it every single game or trying

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.789 
improving it every single game or trying
to<00:02:06.329> yeah<00:02:06.630> every<00:02:06.990> single<00:02:07.259> game<00:02:07.320> because<00:02:07.680> of

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
to yeah every single game because of

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.320 
to yeah every single game because of
that<00:02:07.890> lack<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.099> practice<00:02:08.399> which<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.209> only

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
that lack of practice which is the only

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.570 
that lack of practice which is the only
reason<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.869> kind<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.530> feel<00:02:10.679> why<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.039> not

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
reason I can kind of feel why it's not

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.920 
reason I can kind of feel why it's not
working<00:02:11.640> he's<00:02:12.000> doing<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.270> same<00:02:12.420> again

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
working he's doing the same again

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.539 
working he's doing the same again
as<00:02:13.140> he's<00:02:13.319> only<00:02:13.500> got<00:02:13.650> one<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.040> refinery

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
as he's only got one in the refinery

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.250 
as he's only got one in the refinery
again<00:02:14.879> yeah<00:02:15.209> he's<00:02:15.659> going<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.870> be<00:02:15.959> going<00:02:16.049> for

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
again yeah he's going to be going for

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.440 
again yeah he's going to be going for
this<00:02:16.349> double<00:02:16.590> marine<00:02:16.829> into<00:02:17.189> tech<00:02:17.370> lab<00:02:17.549> and<00:02:18.359> it

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
this double marine into tech lab and it

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.610 
this double marine into tech lab and it
looks<00:02:18.599> like<00:02:18.659> he's<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:18.930> gonna<00:02:19.109> do<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.439> same

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
looks like he's just gonna do the same

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.199 
looks like he's just gonna do the same
thing<00:02:19.829> again<00:02:20.040> he<00:02:20.250> wants<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.609> refinery<00:02:21.000> he

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
thing again he wants the refinery he

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.209 
thing again he wants the refinery he
basically<00:02:22.170> when<00:02:22.349> somebody's<00:02:22.709> like<00:02:22.859> this<00:02:23.069> the

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
basically when somebody's like this the

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.220 
basically when somebody's like this the
mentality<00:02:23.700> they<00:02:23.819> have<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.180> like<00:02:24.329> my<00:02:24.780> build<00:02:25.049> is

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
mentality they have is like my build is

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.160 
mentality they have is like my build is
good<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.859> will<00:02:26.129> whisk<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.239> properly<00:02:27.569> may<00:02:28.140> I

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
good it will whisk you to properly may I

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.110 
good it will whisk you to properly may I
do<00:02:28.379> this<00:02:28.590> properly<00:02:28.920> or<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.280> didn't<00:02:29.670> fill<00:02:30.000> this

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
do this properly or I didn't fill this

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.209 
do this properly or I didn't fill this
in<00:02:30.299> properly<00:02:30.629> so<00:02:31.439> he's<00:02:31.590> gonna<00:02:31.680> keep<00:02:31.859> doing<00:02:32.099> it

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:32.219 
in properly so he's gonna keep doing it

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.670 
in properly so he's gonna keep doing it
until<00:02:32.340> until<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.269> gets<00:02:33.480> shut<00:02:33.689> down<00:02:33.719> so

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
until until it just gets shut down so

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.839 
until until it just gets shut down so
many<00:02:34.799> times<00:02:34.920> raised<00:02:35.250> like<00:02:35.400> all<00:02:35.519> right<00:02:35.670> that

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
many times raised like all right that

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.849 
many times raised like all right that
build<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.209> bad<00:02:36.450> which<00:02:37.049> is<00:02:37.200> practice<00:02:37.680> that's

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
build is bad which is practice that's

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.490 
build is bad which is practice that's
training<00:02:38.489> which<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.359> I<00:02:39.569> don't<00:02:39.780> know<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.109> class

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
training which is I don't know the class

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.020 
training which is I don't know the class
and<00:02:40.709> Kalona<00:02:40.980> can<00:02:41.189> make<00:02:41.310> from<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.489> okay<00:02:41.879> I'm

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
and Kalona can make from that okay I'm

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.409 
and Kalona can make from that okay I'm
doing<00:02:42.299> that<00:02:42.420> I'm<00:02:42.900> certainly<00:02:43.230> not<00:02:44.219> at<00:02:44.939> odds

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:45.419 
doing that I'm certainly not at odds

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.059 
doing that I'm certainly not at odds
with<00:02:45.569> him<00:02:45.750> doing<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.079> at<00:02:46.200> all<00:02:46.349> if<00:02:46.709> this<00:02:46.919> is

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
with him doing that at all if this is

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.039 
with him doing that at all if this is
what<00:02:47.400> he<00:02:47.519> thinks<00:02:47.819> is<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.209> good<00:02:48.450> idea<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.959> he

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
what he thinks is a good idea and he

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.569 
what he thinks is a good idea and he
thinks<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.409> he<00:02:49.470> can<00:02:49.500> refine<00:02:49.889> it<00:02:50.069> then<00:02:50.220> we'll

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
thinks that he can refine it then we'll

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.940 
thinks that he can refine it then we'll
see<00:02:50.849> there's<00:02:51.480> perhaps<00:02:51.930> one<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.439> best<00:02:52.680> ways

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
see there's perhaps one of the best ways

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.259 
see there's perhaps one of the best ways
I<00:02:52.980> supposed<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.609> check<00:02:53.879> whether<00:02:54.060> or<00:02:54.120> not<00:02:54.209> i

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
I supposed to check whether or not i

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.330 
I supposed to check whether or not i
billed<00:02:54.510> as<00:02:54.629> good<00:02:54.840> as<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.139> throw<00:02:55.829> yourself<00:02:56.189> into

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
billed as good as to throw yourself into

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.099 
billed as good as to throw yourself into
the<00:02:56.459> fire<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.939> test<00:02:57.359> it<00:02:57.510> in<00:02:57.659> the<00:02:57.689> heat<00:02:58.079> of

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
the fire and test it in the heat of

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.140 
the fire and test it in the heat of
battle<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.769> very<00:02:59.040> risky<00:02:59.489> for<00:02:59.939> when<00:03:00.030> it's

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
battle is very risky for when it's

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.629 
battle is very risky for when it's
autumn<00:03:00.359> environment<00:03:00.930> well<00:03:01.459> what<00:03:02.459> better

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
autumn environment well what better

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.520 
autumn environment well what better
motivation<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.389> that<00:03:03.599> to<00:03:03.780> execute<00:03:04.230> your<00:03:04.319> build

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
motivation is that to execute your build

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.589 
motivation is that to execute your build
perfectly<00:03:05.010> than<00:03:05.159> that<00:03:05.370> much<00:03:06.239> better<00:03:06.419> than

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
perfectly than that much better than

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.569 
perfectly than that much better than
ladder<00:03:06.919> alright<00:03:07.919> so<00:03:08.129> we<00:03:08.219> do<00:03:08.310> have<00:03:08.340> that

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
ladder alright so we do have that

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.759 
ladder alright so we do have that
Marauder<00:03:08.790> once<00:03:09.120> again<00:03:09.359> probably<00:03:09.659> reefer<00:03:10.169> you

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
Marauder once again probably reefer you

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.349 
Marauder once again probably reefer you
can<00:03:10.889> pretty<00:03:11.040> much<00:03:11.129> predict<00:03:11.519> exam<00:03:11.879> oh<00:03:12.090> sheila

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359

there and notice it be going down with
it<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.120> time<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:30.629> perhaps<00:03:31.109> not<00:03:31.439> bunker

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
it this time so perhaps not bunker

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.379 
it this time so perhaps not bunker
pressure<00:03:31.949> this<00:03:32.159> time<00:03:32.370> around<00:03:32.489> they're<00:03:33.359> really

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
pressure this time around they're really

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.259
