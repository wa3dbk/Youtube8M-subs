place the quinoa on top and you have

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.330 
place the quinoa on top and you have
something<00:02:17.360> that's<00:02:17.720> really<00:02:18.320> easy<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.950> make<00:02:19.130> the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
something that's really easy to make the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.980 
something that's really easy to make the
night<00:02:19.490> before<00:02:19.670> or<00:02:20.210> in<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.510> morning<00:02:20.870> if<00:02:20.960> you

night before or in the morning if you

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.970 
night before or in the morning if you
have<00:02:21.230> some<00:02:21.470> time

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
have some time

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.060 
have some time
it<00:02:22.190> just<00:02:22.460> takes<00:02:22.700> about<00:02:22.910> 10<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.720> 15<00:02:24.470> minutes<00:02:24.650> to

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
it just takes about 10 to 15 minutes to

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.970 
it just takes about 10 to 15 minutes to
prepare<00:02:25.660> but<00:02:26.660> yeah<00:02:26.900> it's<00:02:27.290> not<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.500> lot<00:02:27.740> of<00:02:27.830> work

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
prepare but yeah it's not a lot of work

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.190 
prepare but yeah it's not a lot of work
and<00:02:28.190> it's<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.459> really<00:02:28.820> really<00:02:28.970> yummy<00:02:29.540> lunch<00:02:29.870> I

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
and it's a really really yummy lunch I

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.780 
and it's a really really yummy lunch I
really<00:02:33.200> like<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.530> put<00:02:33.709> balsamic<00:02:34.310> vinaigrette

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
really like to put balsamic vinaigrette

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.850 
really like to put balsamic vinaigrette
on<00:02:35.060> top<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.450> my<00:02:35.570> salads<00:02:35.990> but<00:02:36.230> I<00:02:36.350> think<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.680> makes

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
on top of my salads but I think it makes

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.430 
on top of my salads but I think it makes
it<00:02:37.070> extra<00:02:37.730> delicious<00:02:37.970> but<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.110> can<00:02:39.320> use

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
it extra delicious but you can use

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.170 
it extra delicious but you can use
whatever<00:02:39.680> dressing<00:02:40.220> you<00:02:40.340> want<00:02:40.550> but<00:02:40.850> this<00:02:40.970> is

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
whatever dressing you want but this is

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.490 
whatever dressing you want but this is
definitely<00:02:41.420> my<00:02:41.930> all-time<00:02:42.200> favorite

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.320 

most<00:02:48.500> of<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.860> time<00:02:49.069> I'll<00:02:49.310> take<00:02:49.489> a<00:02:49.549> banana<00:02:49.970> or<00:02:50.150> a

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
most of the time I'll take a banana or a

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.660 
most of the time I'll take a banana or a
fruit<00:02:50.659> fresh<00:02:50.930> snack<00:02:51.230> but<00:02:51.739> if<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:52.069> really<00:02:52.489> want

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
fruit fresh snack but if you really want

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.729 
fruit fresh snack but if you really want
to<00:02:52.790> treat<00:02:52.970> yourself<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.720> would<00:02:54.140> suggest<00:02:54.349> going

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
to treat yourself I would suggest going

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.369 
to treat yourself I would suggest going
for<00:02:55.099> some<00:02:55.280> guacamole<00:02:55.610> or<00:02:56.360> it<00:02:56.450> sells<00:02:56.690> up<00:02:56.900> as<00:02:57.110> you

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
for some guacamole or it sells up as you

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.140 
for some guacamole or it sells up as you
can<00:02:57.530> see<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:57.680> chose<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.129> guacamole<00:02:58.640> but<00:02:59.030> you

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
can see I chose the guacamole but you

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.210 
can see I chose the guacamole but you
can<00:02:59.360> do<00:02:59.510> both<00:02:59.690> and<00:03:00.319> then<00:03:00.830> I<00:03:00.860> put<00:03:01.190> some

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
can do both and then I put some

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.520 
can do both and then I put some
multigrain<00:03:02.000> chips<00:03:02.390> in<00:03:02.599> another<00:03:03.019> container

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
multigrain chips in another container

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.280
