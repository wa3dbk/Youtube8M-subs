have some fun if looking back to the

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.210 
have some fun if looking back to the
beginning<00:00:46.960> did<00:00:47.470> you<00:00:47.560> think<00:00:47.770> you<00:00:47.890> would<00:00:48.040> take

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
beginning did you think you would take

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.890 
beginning did you think you would take
this<00:00:48.400> so<00:00:48.610> seriously<00:00:48.640> I<00:00:49.210> mean<00:00:49.360> here<00:00:49.690> you<00:00:49.720> are

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
this so seriously I mean here you are

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.140 
this so seriously I mean here you are
they<00:00:50.500> still<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.010> top<00:00:51.220> of<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.430> league<00:00:51.610> I<00:00:51.850> think

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
they still the top of the league I think

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.400 
they still the top of the league I think
we<00:00:52.270> knew<00:00:52.480> that<00:00:52.510> we<00:00:52.780> could<00:00:52.930> improve<00:00:53.170> our

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
we knew that we could improve our

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.290 
we knew that we could improve our
fitness<00:00:53.860> but<00:00:54.489> well<00:00:54.640> I<00:00:54.760> don't<00:00:54.880> think<00:00:55.150> we<00:00:55.210> had

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
fitness but well I don't think we had

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.390 
fitness but well I don't think we had
any<00:00:55.330> idea<00:00:55.960> just<00:00:55.989> by<00:00:56.500> improving<00:00:57.220> our

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
any idea just by improving our

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.520 
any idea just by improving our
organization<00:00:58.180> etc<00:00:58.300> how<00:00:58.930> much<00:00:59.170> we<00:00:59.380> could

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
organization etc how much we could

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.200 
organization etc how much we could
improve<00:00:59.620> because<00:01:00.010> you<00:01:00.580> can't<00:01:00.880> really<00:01:00.940> improve

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
improve because you can't really improve

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.390 
improve because you can't really improve
your<00:01:01.510> ability<00:01:01.570> as<00:01:02.350> you<00:01:02.559> said<00:01:02.800> your<00:01:03.010> ability

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
your ability as you said your ability

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.189 
your ability as you said your ability
won't<00:01:03.640> improve<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.449> much<00:01:04.720> unless<00:01:04.900> you're

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
won't improve that much unless you're

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.010 
won't improve that much unless you're
going<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:05.410> be<00:01:05.500> doing<00:01:06.160> it<00:01:06.370> on<00:01:06.400> a<00:01:06.460> full-time

yelling<00:01:39.100> they're<00:01:39.520> not<00:01:39.700> as<00:01:39.850> quick<00:01:40.150> as<00:01:40.330> they

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
yelling they're not as quick as they

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.570 
yelling they're not as quick as they
used<00:01:40.600> to<00:01:40.720> be<00:01:40.780> but<00:01:41.560> nevertheless<00:01:41.950> they'll<00:01:42.400> know

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
used to be but nevertheless they'll know

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.190 
used to be but nevertheless they'll know
how<00:01:42.729> to<00:01:42.760> keep<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.210> ball<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.659> they'll<00:01:43.840> get<00:01:44.050> you

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
how to keep the ball and they'll get you

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.630 
how to keep the ball and they'll get you

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
running I think there may well be

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.850 
running I think there may well be
weaknesses<00:01:46.150> I<00:01:46.300> can't<00:01:46.780> really<00:01:47.020> see<00:01:47.229> this<00:01:47.500> enemy

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
weaknesses I can't really see this enemy

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.010 
weaknesses I can't really see this enemy
field<00:01:48.159> there<00:01:48.400> if<00:01:48.760> we<00:01:49.000> can<00:01:49.150> force<00:01:49.450> them<00:01:49.690> to<00:01:49.720> play

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
field there if we can force them to play

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.690 
field there if we can force them to play
inside<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.620> an<00:01:50.740> area<00:01:50.890> of<00:01:51.010> perhaps<00:01:51.310> where<00:01:51.580> they

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
inside to an area of perhaps where they

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.850 
inside to an area of perhaps where they
might<00:01:51.850> be<00:01:51.909> slightly<00:01:52.330> weaker<00:01:52.810> where<00:01:53.320> we<00:01:53.470> are

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
might be slightly weaker where we are

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.770 
might be slightly weaker where we are
stronger<00:01:54.340> yeah<00:01:54.610> we<00:01:54.790> can<00:01:54.970> win<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.210> ball<00:01:55.390> and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
stronger yeah we can win the ball and
