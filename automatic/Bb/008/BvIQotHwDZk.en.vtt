of<00:02:45.130> milk<00:02:45.190> I'm<00:02:46.180> just<00:02:46.510> gonna<00:02:46.660> eyeball<00:02:46.989> it

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
of milk I'm just gonna eyeball it

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.830 
of milk I'm just gonna eyeball it
because<00:02:48.610> that's<00:02:49.540> just<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.230> way<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.410> roll

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
because that's just the way I roll

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.740 
because that's just the way I roll
you<00:02:52.840> want<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.080> start<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.560> little<00:02:53.920> bit<00:02:54.130> at<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.370> time

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
you want to start a little bit at a time

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.240 
you want to start a little bit at a time
again<00:02:55.750> this<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.739> won't<00:02:56.920> get

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
again this is so that you won't get

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.330 
again this is so that you won't get
clumping<00:02:58.299> you<00:02:59.260> want<00:02:59.470> to<00:02:59.560> stir<00:02:59.830> that<00:02:59.860> until

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
clumping you want to stir that until

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.600 
clumping you want to stir that until
it's<00:03:00.700> smooth<00:03:01.299> and<00:03:01.860> then<00:03:02.860> add<00:03:03.069> a<00:03:03.100> little<00:03:03.459> bit

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
it's smooth and then add a little bit

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:11.910 
it's smooth and then add a little bit
more<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:09.310> your<00:03:09.489> one<00:03:09.700> cup<00:03:09.970> has<00:03:10.150> been<00:03:10.390> added<00:03:10.920> once

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
more so your one cup has been added once

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.850 
more so your one cup has been added once

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.130 
all your milk is incorporated then
you're<00:03:15.100> going<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.400> cook<00:03:15.819> it<00:03:15.989> continuing<00:03:16.989> to

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
you're going to cook it continuing to

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.630 
you're going to cook it continuing to
stir<00:03:18.480> over<00:03:19.480> I'd<00:03:20.290> say<00:03:20.620> of<00:03:20.799> medium<00:03:21.430> to

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
stir over I'd say of medium to

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.370 
stir over I'd say of medium to
medium-high<00:03:22.000> heat<00:03:22.239> until<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:23.459> thickens<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:25.600> I

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
medium-high heat until it thickens and I

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.740 
medium-high heat until it thickens and I
roll<00:03:26.890> can<00:03:29.400> continue<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.579> do<00:03:30.760> this<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.329> then

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
roll can continue to do this and then

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.380 
roll can continue to do this and then
I'll<00:03:31.900> come<00:03:32.739> back<00:03:32.769> once<00:03:33.280> we've<00:03:33.640> got<00:03:33.850> more<00:03:34.060> going

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.060 
would depend on what you're making with
it<00:04:42.450> since<00:04:43.450> I'm<00:04:43.660> making<00:04:44.020> a<00:04:44.080> cheese<00:04:44.350> sauce<00:04:44.650> and

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
it since I'm making a cheese sauce and

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.290 
it since I'm making a cheese sauce and
cheddar<00:04:45.220> cheese<00:04:45.370> team<00:04:47.190> tends<00:04:48.190> to<00:04:48.430> be<00:04:48.580> salty<00:04:49.270> I

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
cheddar cheese team tends to be salty I

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.900 
cheddar cheese team tends to be salty I
probably<00:04:49.750> won't<00:04:50.110> add<00:04:50.380> salt<00:04:50.770> to<00:04:50.950> this<00:04:51.100> but<00:04:51.880> I

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
probably won't add salt to this but I

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.560 
probably won't add salt to this but I
will<00:04:52.180> add<00:04:52.330> pepper<00:04:53.400> so<00:04:54.400> anyway<00:04:54.910> can<00:04:55.240> you<00:04:55.330> see

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
will add pepper so anyway can you see

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.960 
will add pepper so anyway can you see
how<00:04:55.720> this<00:04:55.900> is<00:04:56.220> thickened<00:04:57.220> up<00:04:59.310> if<00:05:00.310> you<00:05:00.610> wanted

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
how this is thickened up if you wanted

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.690 
how this is thickened up if you wanted
your<00:05:01.150> sauce<00:05:01.390> thicker<00:05:01.840> you<00:05:02.410> would<00:05:02.590> add<00:05:02.800> less

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
your sauce thicker you would add less

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.780 
your sauce thicker you would add less
milk<00:05:04.030> to<00:05:04.240> your<00:05:04.330> flour<00:05:04.630> if<00:05:05.140> you<00:05:05.380> want<00:05:05.830> it<00:05:05.950> more

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
milk to your flour if you want it more

liquidy<00:05:07.300> which<00:05:07.660> in<00:05:07.840> fact<00:05:08.050> I<00:05:08.380> do<00:05:08.520> you<00:05:09.520> would<00:05:09.669> add

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
liquidy which in fact I do you would add

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.330 
liquidy which in fact I do you would add
more<00:05:10.570> milk<00:05:10.840> which<00:05:11.140> I'm<00:05:11.350> going<00:05:11.590> to<00:05:11.710> do<00:05:11.830> for<00:05:12.190> my

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
more milk which I'm going to do for my

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.940 
more milk which I'm going to do for my
potatoes<00:05:12.790> au<00:05:13.090> gratin<00:05:13.530> because<00:05:14.530> they<00:05:14.740> will

potatoes au gratin because they will

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.280 
potatoes au gratin because they will
continue<00:05:15.310> to<00:05:15.580> thicken<00:05:15.760> up<00:05:16.000> as<00:05:16.240> they<00:05:16.780> cook<00:05:17.080> in

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
continue to thicken up as they cook in

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.390 
continue to thicken up as they cook in
the<00:05:17.440> pot<00:05:17.680> so<00:05:18.090> that's<00:05:19.090> your<00:05:19.270> basic<00:05:19.660> white<00:05:19.840> sauce
