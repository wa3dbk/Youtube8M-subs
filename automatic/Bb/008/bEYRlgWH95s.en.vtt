so of the first one I used the military
enjoy<00:00:16.770> with<00:00:17.010> your<00:00:17.130> precision<00:00:17.460> tip<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:17.940> that's

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
enjoy with your precision tip so that's

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.700 
enjoy with your precision tip so that's
the<00:00:18.960> primary<00:00:19.380> fire<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.250> sniper<00:00:20.760> rifle<00:00:20.970> and

the primary fire is a sniper rifle and
the<00:00:22.710> secondary<00:00:23.039> fire<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.550> obviously<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
the secondary fire is obviously the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.240 
the secondary fire is obviously the
hydraulic<00:00:24.779> engine<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.410> melee<00:00:25.800> when<00:00:26.010> they<00:00:26.099> get

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
hydraulic engine for melee when they get

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.359 
hydraulic engine for melee when they get
they<00:00:26.580> get<00:00:26.880> close<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.390> with<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.410> conic

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
they get close to you with the conic

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.690 
they get close to you with the conic
dispersal<00:00:29.939> as<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.300> lower<00:00:30.480> tool<00:00:30.810> tip<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.700> as

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
dispersal as the lower tool tip and as

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.690 
dispersal as the lower tool tip and as
for<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.149> attachments<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.930> used<00:00:34.440> both<00:00:35.130> damage

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
for the attachments I used both damage

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.310 
for the attachments I used both damage
support<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.239> have<00:00:36.300> as<00:00:36.510> much<00:00:36.719> damage<00:00:37.020> as

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
and the frame they have a lead frame

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.459 
and the frame they have a lead frame
obviously<00:00:47.489> for<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.270> total<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.809> eight<00:00:48.989> circuits

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
obviously for a total of eight circuits

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.010 
obviously for a total of eight circuits
four<00:00:49.800> up<00:00:49.980> four<00:00:50.219> down<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:51.660> I'm<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:51.899> gonna

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
four up four down so I'm just gonna

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.100 
four up four down so I'm just gonna
briefly<00:00:52.260> show<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.590> guys<00:00:53.149> for<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> upper<00:00:54.870> I

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
briefly show you guys for the upper I

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.500 
briefly show you guys for the upper I
chose<00:00:55.559> three<00:00:55.920> damage<00:00:56.250> tree<00:00:56.520> clip<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510

chose three damage tree clip and the
other<00:00:57.809> three<00:00:58.170> three<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> little<00:00:58.949> three<00:00:59.550> reload

three clip and for the lower the one I
just<00:01:02.699> used<00:01:03.359> for<00:01:03.719> close<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.260> rate<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.860> fire<00:01:05.040> and

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
just used for close to rate of fire and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.679 
just used for close to rate of fire and
blister<00:01:05.640> Eclipse<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.090> let's<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.450> see<00:01:06.570> this

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
blister Eclipse so let's just see this

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.000 
blister Eclipse so let's just see this
baby<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.260> action<00:01:08.510> this<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.900> gun<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.770> best

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
baby in action this this gun is the best

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.300 
baby in action this this gun is the best
so<00:01:11.689> primary<00:01:12.689> fire<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> sniper<00:01:14.100> rifle

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
so primary fire is it is a sniper rifle

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.910 
so primary fire is it is a sniper rifle
like<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.760> said<00:01:14.970> extremely<00:01:15.960> long<00:01:16.170> range<00:01:16.200> very

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
like I said extremely long range very

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.310 
like I said extremely long range very
accurate<00:01:17.490> lots<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.909> damage<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.930> rate<00:01:19.200> of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
accurate lots of damage but the rate of

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.179 
accurate lots of damage but the rate of
fire<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.560> pretty<00:01:20.520> low<00:01:20.700> as<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.970> guys<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.240> see

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
fire is pretty low as you guys can see

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.510 
fire is pretty low as you guys can see
reload<00:01:23.189> picks<00:01:23.490> about<00:01:23.729> three<00:01:24.000> seconds

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
reload picks about three seconds

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.580 
reload picks about three seconds
alternate<00:01:26.520> fire<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:27.240> what's<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.080> most<00:01:28.229> fun

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
alternate fire is what's the most fun

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.679 
alternate fire is what's the most fun
part<00:01:28.979> about<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.189> gun<00:01:29.970> because<00:01:30.240> I've<00:01:30.450> I've

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
part about this gun because I've I've

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.109 
part about this gun because I've I've
put<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> lot<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.409> circuits<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.340> increase<00:01:32.790> rate

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
put a lot of circuits that increase rate

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.929 
put a lot of circuits that increase rate
of<00:01:33.240> fire<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.650> extremely<00:01:35.040> extremely

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
of fire so it is extremely extremely

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.440 
of fire so it is extremely extremely
extremely<00:01:36.509> fast<00:01:37.549> it<00:01:38.549> feels<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:38.909> you're

swinging like a lightsaber amazing
really<00:01:42.750> fun<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.140> use<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.310> sound<00:01:44.579> is

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
really fun to use and the sound is

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.490 
really fun to use and the sound is
pretty<00:01:44.939> cool<00:01:45.149> too

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.760 

so<00:01:48.600> yeah<00:01:49.600> I'm<00:01:49.720> just<00:01:49.870> gonna<00:01:49.990> spawn<00:01:50.350> some

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
so yeah I'm just gonna spawn some

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.340 
so yeah I'm just gonna spawn some
enemies<00:01:51.159> some<00:01:51.490> Necromorphs<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:56.050> my

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
enemies some Necromorphs so the my

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.380 
enemies some Necromorphs so the my
intention<00:01:56.800> when<00:01:57.010> I<00:01:57.040> was<00:01:57.250> making<00:01:57.790> this<00:01:58.000> weapon

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
intention when I was making this weapon

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.300 
intention when I was making this weapon
is<00:01:58.540> to<00:01:59.470> pick<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.800> enemies<00:02:00.160> from<00:02:00.400> afar<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:02.310> if

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
is to pick the enemies from afar and if

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.210 
is to pick the enemies from afar and if
they<00:02:03.490> ever<00:02:03.640> come<00:02:03.970> close<00:02:04.030> to<00:02:04.479> you<00:02:04.600> which<00:02:04.810> is

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
they ever come close to you which is

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.520 
they ever come close to you which is
like<00:02:06.220> they're<00:02:06.729> gonna<00:02:06.850> have<00:02:07.060> a<00:02:07.090> hard<00:02:07.330> time

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530
