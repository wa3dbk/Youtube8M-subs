00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
going to travel down the track and then

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.760 
going to travel down the track and then
up<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.250> ramp<00:01:59.610> right<00:02:00.060> here<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.619> get

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
up this ramp right here you have to get

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.709 
up this ramp right here you have to get
past<00:02:02.009> Ultron<00:02:02.670> which<00:02:02.939> looks<00:02:03.210> pretty<00:02:03.479> easy

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
past Ultron which looks pretty easy

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.569 
past Ultron which looks pretty easy
right<00:02:04.140> here<00:02:04.380> well<00:02:04.619> that's<00:02:04.829> because<00:02:05.009> Ultron

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
right here well that's because Ultron

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.039 
right here well that's because Ultron
has<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.820> little<00:02:06.180> crank<00:02:06.509> right<00:02:06.689> here<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.020> let's

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
has a little crank right here so let's

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.889 
has a little crank right here so let's
crank<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.619> up

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
crank it up

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.759 
crank it up
kind<00:02:09.860> of<00:02:09.920> like<00:02:10.039> a<00:02:10.160> music<00:02:10.519> box<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:11.000> line<00:02:11.239> it<00:02:11.480> up

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
kind of like a music box you line it up

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.940 
kind of like a music box you line it up
and<00:02:13.360> when<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:14.480> let<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.750> go<00:02:14.930> now<00:02:15.290> Ultron's

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
and when you let it go now Ultron's

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.369 
and when you let it go now Ultron's
moving<00:02:16.370> back<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.790> forth<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:17.900> it's<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.140> little

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
moving back and forth so it's a little

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.680 
moving back and forth so it's a little
more<00:02:18.530> difficult<00:02:19.040> for<00:02:19.250> your<00:02:19.849> car<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.300> get<00:02:20.420> past

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
more difficult for your car to get past

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.350 
more difficult for your car to get past
the<00:02:20.930> launcher<00:02:21.319> and<00:02:21.500> if<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.129> doesn't<00:02:22.370> Ultron's

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
the launcher and if it doesn't Ultron's

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.750 
the launcher and if it doesn't Ultron's
going<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.569> throw<00:02:23.930> him<00:02:24.110> off<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.530> side<00:02:24.769> like

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
going to throw him off the side like

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.820 
going to throw him off the side like
that<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.599> let's<00:02:26.780> give<00:02:26.959> it<00:02:26.989> a<00:02:27.140> try<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.440> put<00:02:27.739> our

cycle and these are some thick tires
pretty<00:03:49.819> cool<00:03:50.180> looking<00:03:50.660> cycle<00:03:51.169> right<00:03:51.380> there

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
pretty cool looking cycle right there

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.420 
pretty cool looking cycle right there
it's<00:03:52.250> diecast<00:03:52.940> on<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.329> bottom<00:03:53.780> plastic<00:03:54.739> for

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
it's diecast on the bottom plastic for

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.400 
it's diecast on the bottom plastic for
the<00:03:55.549> rest<00:03:55.760> of<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.239> there's<00:03:56.480> Iron<00:03:56.750> Man<00:03:57.109> kind

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
the rest of it and there's Iron Man kind

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.009 
the rest of it and there's Iron Man kind
of<00:03:57.500> hunched<00:03:57.739> down<00:03:57.829> low<00:03:58.430> so<00:03:58.790> he<00:03:58.910> can<00:03:59.060> minimize

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
of hunched down low so he can minimize

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.620 
of hunched down low so he can minimize
the<00:04:00.260> wind<00:04:00.470> resistance<00:04:00.620> and<00:04:01.220> this<00:04:02.090> seems<00:04:02.450> like

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
the wind resistance and this seems like

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.479 
the wind resistance and this seems like
kind<00:04:02.780> of<00:04:02.900> a<00:04:02.989> launch<00:04:03.319> point<00:04:03.769> I<00:04:04.069> know<00:04:04.160> if<00:04:04.340> that's

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
kind of a launch point I know if that's

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:05.800 
kind of a launch point I know if that's
what's<00:04:04.669> really<00:04:04.880> intended<00:04:05.389> for<00:04:05.540> but<00:04:05.660> it's

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
what's really intended for but it's

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.509 
what's really intended for but it's
going<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:05.989> work<00:04:06.139> well<00:04:06.590> on<00:04:06.799> our<00:04:06.829> launcher<00:04:07.400> I'm

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
going to work well on our launcher I'm

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.000

hoping<00:04:07.849> we'll<00:04:08.060> give<00:04:08.209> it<00:04:08.329> a<00:04:08.419> try<00:04:08.660> here<00:04:08.989> in<00:04:09.169> just

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
hoping we'll give it a try here in just

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.290 
hoping we'll give it a try here in just
a<00:04:10.190> minute<00:04:10.280> so<00:04:10.639> there<00:04:10.819> we<00:04:10.910> go<00:04:10.940> there's<00:04:11.209> iron

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300
