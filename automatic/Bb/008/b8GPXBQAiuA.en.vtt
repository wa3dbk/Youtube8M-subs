this<00:00:32.099> shift<00:00:32.400> up<00:00:32.580> to<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.759> kind<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.120> an<00:00:33.239> F<00:00:33.420> chord<00:00:35.390> so

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
this shift up to a kind of an F chord so

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.210 
this shift up to a kind of an F chord so

B string in case you accidentally pluck

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.330 
B string in case you accidentally pluck
it<00:00:48.330> a<00:00:48.480> little<00:00:49.379> finger<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.830> going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.040> try<00:00:50.309> and

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
it a little finger is going to try and

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.869 
it a little finger is going to try and
stay<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:52.230> get<00:00:52.410> up<00:00:52.559> there<00:00:52.800> onto<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.460> fifth

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
fret of the thinnest string so you can

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.510 
fret of the thinnest string so you can
see<00:00:55.350> from<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.650> C

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.700 

little<00:01:00.030> fingers<00:01:00.600> everything's<00:01:01.110> off<00:01:01.320> little

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
little fingers everything's off little

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.320 
little fingers everything's off little
finger<00:01:01.980> comes<00:01:02.220> forward<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.790> other<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.120> go

down

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.969 

and<00:01:06.850> that<00:01:07.030> will<00:01:07.119> also<00:01:07.240> lead<00:01:07.450> into<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.049> first

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
and that will also lead into the first

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.070 
and that will also lead into the first
part<00:01:09.250> of<00:01:09.310> our<00:01:09.490> five<00:01:09.759> Littlefinger<00:01:10.630> will<00:01:10.750> stay

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
part of our five Littlefinger will stay

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.480 
part of our five Littlefinger will stay
on<00:01:11.290> and<00:01:11.470> slide<00:01:12.220> back<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:14.200> our<00:01:14.440> C<00:01:14.710> chord<00:01:14.979> that

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
on and slide back to our C chord that

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.859 
on and slide back to our C chord that
which<00:01:15.700> is<00:01:15.880> bar<00:01:16.090> five<00:01:16.299> which<00:01:16.479> I<00:01:16.570> don't<00:01:16.690> want<00:01:16.810> to

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
which is bar five which I don't want to

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.960 
which is bar five which I don't want to
go<00:01:16.960> into<00:01:17.200> just<00:01:17.350> yet<00:01:17.560> but<00:01:17.770> you<00:01:18.340> say<00:01:18.580> you<00:01:18.640> can<00:01:18.820> get

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
go into just yet but you say you can get

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.490 
go into just yet but you say you can get
the<00:01:19.119> idea<00:01:19.240> that<00:01:19.570> that<00:01:19.720> little<00:01:19.960> thing<00:01:20.170> is<00:01:20.350> going

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
the idea that that little thing is going

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.380 
the idea that that little thing is going
to<00:01:20.590> stay<00:01:20.890> on<00:01:20.920> as<00:01:21.250> being<00:01:21.520> a<00:01:21.610> little<00:01:21.820> guide<00:01:22.119> to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
to stay on as being a little guide to

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.350 
to stay on as being a little guide to
kind<00:01:22.630> of<00:01:22.720> tool<00:01:23.380> for<00:01:23.830> you<00:01:23.950> so<00:01:24.220> verse<00:01:24.940> three<00:01:25.240> and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
kind of tool for you so verse three and

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:34.120 
kind of tool for you so verse three and
four

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.399 

and<00:01:34.640> that's<00:01:34.939> it<00:01:35.150> okay<00:01:35.479> that<00:01:35.930> should<00:01:36.080> be<00:01:36.140> pretty

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
and that's it okay that should be pretty

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:37.570 
and that's it okay that should be pretty
straightforward<00:01:36.710> let's<00:01:37.100> go<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:37.310> have<00:01:37.369> a<00:01:37.460> look

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
straightforward let's go and have a look

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.239 
straightforward let's go and have a look
at<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.729> plucking<00:01:37.939> hand

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:41.249 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:44.190 

the<00:01:42.249> right<00:01:42.460> hand<00:01:42.729> 4<00:01:42.939> bars<00:01:43.119> 3<00:01:43.509> &amp;<00:01:43.630> 4<00:01:43.810> is<00:01:43.960> pretty

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
the right hand 4 bars 3 &amp; 4 is pretty

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.239 
the right hand 4 bars 3 &amp; 4 is pretty
straightforward<00:01:44.829> as<00:01:44.890> well

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:45.249 
straightforward as well

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:47.190 
straightforward as well
we<00:01:45.549> start<00:01:45.850> by<00:01:45.999> plucking<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.539> quarters<00:01:46.899> we<00:01:47.020> did

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
we start by plucking the quarters we did

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.880 
we start by plucking the quarters we did
before<00:01:47.560> playing<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.069> middle<00:01:48.520> four<00:01:48.759> strings

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
before playing the middle four strings

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.410 
before playing the middle four strings
third<00:01:50.890> finger<00:01:51.310> goes<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:51.700> plucks<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:52.060> second

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
third finger goes and plucks the second

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.040 
third finger goes and plucks the second
string<00:01:52.659> again

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
string again

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.620 
string again
then<00:01:54.620> we<00:01:54.770> pluck<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.460> same<00:01:55.760> cord<00:01:56.180> again<00:01:56.480> now<00:01:56.600> so

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
then we pluck the same cord again now so

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.020 
then we pluck the same cord again now so
left<00:01:56.960> hand<00:01:57.080> hasn't<00:01:57.380> changed<00:01:57.740> thumb<00:01:58.370> is<00:01:58.550> on<00:01:58.730> the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
left hand hasn't changed thumb is on the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.420 
left hand hasn't changed thumb is on the
fifth<00:01:59.720> string<00:02:00.020> still<00:02:00.320> but<00:02:00.590> all<00:02:00.770> of<00:02:01.010> what

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
fifth string still but all of what

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.620 
fifth string still but all of what
fingers<00:02:01.790> 1<00:02:02.000> 2<00:02:02.330> &amp;<00:02:02.630> 3<00:02:02.660> have<00:02:03.260> moved<00:02:03.650> from<00:02:03.980> here

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
fingers 1 2 &amp; 3 have moved from here

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.060 
fingers 1 2 &amp; 3 have moved from here
toward<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.780> ground<00:02:06.080> one<00:02:06.380> string<00:02:06.710> subs<00:02:07.010> now

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
toward the ground one string subs now

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.720 
toward the ground one string subs now
plucking<00:02:07.580> strings<00:02:07.970> 3<00:02:08.750> 2<00:02:09.140> &amp;<00:02:09.440> 1

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.670 

then<00:02:12.330> little<00:02:12.510> finger<00:02:12.900> goes<00:02:13.050> down<00:02:13.290> on<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.530> note

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
then little finger goes down on the note
