00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.259
 ok your family and welcome to my new one 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.180
 restless 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.920
 today we are going to bag a volunteer 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.260
 bag can make what a super simple 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.210
 looks doing nothing after you clean it 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.400
 cut and knots and this my own 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.380
 everyone we can have fun there ourselves 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.939
 advice and then I lie're alright and 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.949
 I already make your handbag out of it 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.990
 and of course one you see how you 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.970
 does this 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.010
 this is the super fun movie so test 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.950
 I'm going to work so very interested in 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.810
 see it click along so we start cherry 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.120
 a marker and of course I'm going to use 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.400
 saw a serrated scissors nice the green 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.720
 use normal dust scissors 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.380
 I just sign where I go chicken 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:54.000
 so i close this run i have the 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.290
 arm off and then cut under and dashes 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.240
 and I thought the line was a bit too long 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.800
 a bit shorter but that doesn't make him 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.160
 seen from it anyway that interpreting not really 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.740
 anyway and start by first and start 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.939
 cut off the other in lace 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.039
 therefore also a tunnel comes the same 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.600
 can cut the same turn 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.689
 when i gave birth to you i got there so 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.689
 from 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.140
 so we are going to cut the hall dust or had to 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:27.549
 is the folded that and easier i will 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.520
 that I even cut it on two it 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.479
 a t-shirt isn't really that bad either 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.890
 and I like having a cartel cutter 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.899
 so you dont like it a shot 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.100
 fraying 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.100
 we go without one and cut 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.549
 with handles to make the same level arms 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.159
 in the same way you can use a ruler for it 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.530
 users and the drawing but did 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.840
 I also think it can be a bit on the eye 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.359
 nice for nice bag then is difficult 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.759
 if you want to have my ingrid 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.649
 of course the side you do I do your ex and 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.090
 cut the knots 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.979
 the first to the last course 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.909
 each other fixed this is so once to the 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.909
 become an afternoon clip 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.640
 he had to prosecute 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.020
 cut off the disgraceful bs band 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.070
 but I didn't do it for me 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.160
 required 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.540
 I have three more and more 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.970
 finally get it again 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.670
 once the second with the third on 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.640
 connected that is really secure 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.530
 day a bath faucet week knot it becomes 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.270
 a bag is ready it doesn't even have ten 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.070
 bought in minutes but then the super 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.880

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.770

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.880
