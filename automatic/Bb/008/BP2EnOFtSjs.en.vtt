00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:10.600
 I was longing for living alone from a long time ago to a relative who runs a real estate company 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.070
 It is introduced a case property 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.070
 I already decided to move in 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.740
 If you think now, that was the beginning of fear 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.900
 I was so happy to find my own life I got for the first time in a narrow space 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.860
 But 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.890
 The first time I noticed something unusual was that night 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.890
 Hmm 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.370
 Good 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.220
 Yeah yeah 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.220

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.530
 Hmm 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.530
 eh 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.020
 It was 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.560
 eh 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.560
 I have slept as it is because it was caught off the day 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.970

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.500

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:46.130
 eh 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:46.130
 The sound came from the neighbor at a fixed time every day 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.530
 every day 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.650
 every day 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.680
 I've got bad you truly 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.680
 Hmm 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.310
 And I am told every day that said that I will get used to the sound directly below 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:16.090
 Hmm 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.090
 But this day was a little different 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.630
 Somehow unable to sleep well put was the night 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.760

 It's nice to talk 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.269
 It was that time 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.269
 The video in my head came to light 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.220

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.379

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.870
 me 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.520
 I just lost my mind 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.450
 Next day 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.450
 I left this room 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:52.550
 Not to mention the reason 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:55.170
 This is speculation , but if the next person catches a tail at the time when the sound has always been heard 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.430
 I think not 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.530
 even now 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.860
 That sound does not leave my ear 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.860
