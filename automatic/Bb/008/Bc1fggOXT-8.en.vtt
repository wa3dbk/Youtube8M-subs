your<00:00:33.420> solution<00:00:34.280> so<00:00:35.280> let's<00:00:35.610> get<00:00:35.760> right<00:00:35.910> into

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
your solution so let's get right into

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.950 
your solution so let's get right into
the<00:00:36.329> tutorial<00:00:36.840> shall<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.850> so<00:00:38.850> first<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.809> have

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the tutorial shall we so first you have

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.139 
the tutorial shall we so first you have
to<00:00:40.110> craft<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.680> bad<00:00:40.920> boy<00:00:41.219> let's<00:00:41.640> put<00:00:41.940> down<00:00:42.120> a

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
to craft this bad boy let's put down a

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.000 
to craft this bad boy let's put down a
crafting<00:00:42.750> bench<00:00:44.000> now<00:00:45.410> to<00:00:46.410> make<00:00:46.590> him<00:00:46.800> will

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
crafting bench now to make him will

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.250 
crafting bench now to make him will
first<00:00:47.340> need<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.879> computer<00:00:48.420> which<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:48.899> made<00:00:49.230> with

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
first need a computer which is made with

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.150 
first need a computer which is made with
six<00:00:49.710> phone<00:00:50.039> what<00:00:50.430> redstone<00:00:51.120> redstone<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:52.410> one

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
six phone what redstone redstone in one

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.060 
six phone what redstone redstone in one
glass<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.850> let's<00:00:54.030> make<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.510> oops<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.770> under

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
glass so let's make that oops it's under

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.710 
glass so let's make that oops it's under
stuff<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:57.420> my<00:00:57.719> inventory

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.270 

one<00:01:01.200> redstone<00:01:01.470> a<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.390> glass<00:01:03.540> pane<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.280> you

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
one redstone a and a glass pane and you

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.030 
one redstone a and a glass pane and you
have<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.460> computer<00:01:05.940> I<00:01:06.590> wish<00:01:07.590> they<00:01:07.770> were<00:01:07.830> that

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
have a computer I wish they were that

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.630 
have a computer I wish they were that
simple<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.670> real<00:01:08.880> life<00:01:09.380> now<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:11.190> have<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.400> take

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
simple in real life now you have to take

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.140 
simple in real life now you have to take
that<00:01:11.670> computer<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:14.100> put<00:01:14.400> seven<00:01:14.910> iron

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
that computer and you put seven iron

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.060 
that computer and you put seven iron
bars<00:01:15.510> around<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.370> and<00:01:18.080> a<00:01:19.080> chest<00:01:19.410> down<00:01:19.710> here

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
bars around that and a chest down here

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.770 
bars around that and a chest down here
so<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.520> hold<00:01:20.760> stuff<00:01:21.090> then<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.480> get<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
so we can hold stuff then you get a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.470 
so we can hold stuff then you get a
turtle<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:23.160> makes<00:01:23.370> him<00:01:23.610> mobile<00:01:24.120> so<00:01:24.360> he

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
turtle and that makes him mobile so he

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.400 
turtle and that makes him mobile so he
can<00:01:24.690> move<00:01:24.990> around<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.710> do<00:01:26.490> stuff<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.600> then<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
can move around and do stuff and then to

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.170 
can move around and do stuff and then to
make<00:01:28.530> them<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.770> mining<00:01:29.100> turtle<00:01:29.280> I'm<00:01:29.610> assuming

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
make them a mining turtle I'm assuming

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.790 
make them a mining turtle I'm assuming
you<00:01:30.270> know<00:01:30.420> how<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.630> make<00:01:30.870> a<00:01:30.900> diamond<00:01:31.230> pickaxe

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
you know how to make a diamond pickaxe

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.380 
you know how to make a diamond pickaxe
if<00:01:32.550> you<00:01:32.729> don't<00:01:34.250> look<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.400> up<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:35.790> play

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
if you don't look it up and play

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.109 
if you don't look it up and play

with a command-line interface scary

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.190 
with a command-line interface scary
right<00:02:11.390> actually<00:02:12.390> no<00:02:13.170> it's<00:02:13.500> not<00:02:13.739> scary<00:02:15.200> because
