00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.330
 Hello everyone in this video, I will show you 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.340
 bright holiday manicure 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.599
 with two varnishes and a thin brush 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.599
 for design on the wall 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.100
 First we cover the nails with a base varnish 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.020
 I'll give it completely dry 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.910
 draw much easier on dried 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.130
 laraki also you can cover varnish 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.130
 drying so as not to wait long hair 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.230
 further with a fine brush shimmer 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.070
 I am beginning to cover with a golden shade 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.070
 draw monograms 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.840
 brush is better to choose all soft 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.760
 elastic so it will be much better 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.739
 draw what you need 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.910
 frame elements will have to redo 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.910
 females several times 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.850
 drawing is much easier with 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.650
 shimmer and shiny lacquer rays 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.900
 the use of such varnishes is not very 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.640
 I clearly see the sins of your drawing 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.640
 he seems more neat 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.800
 adding a few simple elements 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.800
 to finish drawing 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.560
 the shorter the easier and easier to draw 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.150
 similar drawings 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.040
 so the probability is due 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.880
 drawing 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.880
 tonic pens 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.869
 now i will cover 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.920
 I started I was a little dry so he 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.729
 not unwound 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.729
 brush strokes 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.200
 and here is the result we got 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.470
 did not become their country on anyone drawing for 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.420
 to make the goal more interesting I 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.500
 say goodbye to you until the next video before 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.500
 new meetings yet
