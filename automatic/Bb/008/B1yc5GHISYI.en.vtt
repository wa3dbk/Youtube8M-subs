00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
our great repertoire is in chamber music

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.760 
our great repertoire is in chamber music
and<00:01:44.600> there's<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.780> much<00:01:45.930> as<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> bill<00:01:46.500> said

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
and there's so much as a bill said

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.980 
and there's so much as a bill said
there's<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.130> much<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.460> learn<00:01:47.640> from<00:01:47.990> chamber

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
there's so much to learn from chamber

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.290 
there's so much to learn from chamber
music<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.890> experience<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.550> being<00:01:51.119> on

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
music and the experience of being on

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.620 
music and the experience of being on
stage<00:01:51.360> with<00:01:52.050> other<00:01:52.800> musicians<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.670> think<00:01:54.420> it's

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
stage with other musicians I think it's

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.660 
stage with other musicians I think it's
at<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.320> risk<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.649> sounding<00:01:55.770> cliche<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.340> think

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
at the risk of sounding cliche I think

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.930 
at the risk of sounding cliche I think
it<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> very<00:01:57.450> intimate<00:01:58.409> experience<00:01:58.940> you're

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
it is a very intimate experience you're

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.660 
it is a very intimate experience you're
on<00:02:00.090> stage<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.630> you're<00:02:00.890> literally<00:02:01.890> breathing

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
on stage and you're literally breathing

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.990 
on stage and you're literally breathing
together<00:02:03.149> for<00:02:04.049> 30<00:02:05.039> minutes<00:02:05.429> or<00:02:05.550> however<00:02:05.759> long

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
together for 30 minutes or however long

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.969 
together for 30 minutes or however long
the<00:02:06.840> piece<00:02:07.080> is<00:02:07.289> you<00:02:07.440> know<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.679> you<00:02:07.770> really

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
the piece is you know and you really

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.949 
the piece is you know and you really
have<00:02:08.130> to<00:02:08.220> be<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.640> tune<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.179> another<00:02:09.390> person<00:02:09.840> on

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
have to be in tune to another person on

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.620 
have to be in tune to another person on
a<00:02:10.670> millisecond<00:02:11.670> level<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:14.090> think<00:02:15.090> without

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
a millisecond level and I think without

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.900 
a millisecond level and I think without
question<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:16.230> helps<00:02:16.650> us<00:02:16.800> with<00:02:17.040> it's<00:02:17.700> all

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
question that helps us with it's all

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.350 
question that helps us with it's all
