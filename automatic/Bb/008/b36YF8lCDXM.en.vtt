00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.870
 m 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:18.450
 So here I have at sea ​​a flash 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.710
 if i have xf 990 m for nikon so that's 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.450
 a flash that is quite impressive in 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.099
 terms of size it is comparable to sb 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.890
 910 is b 900 so he has some 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:33.420
 sync inputs on the other side there is the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.340
 same thing another app here what 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.000
 connect sources 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.110
 external energy 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.820
 picking and rotate needs 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.070
 every sense there is no look and so 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.760
 we little joke is a little bit 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.990
 as we want we understood behind in 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.550
 both directions menu side activated 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.440
 start up we have a high mode was 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.450
 it so that it will be compatible with 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:05.280
 the system nikon a word of power in 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:10.439
 going for and with the wheel have a 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:16.829
 weight down to 128th by third 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:19.020
 was a strobe mode where 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:21.090
 this time we will be able to define the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.170
 power the number of times we want 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:29.789
 flashed and frequency the button drivers 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.710
 lets us see what it's like 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.450
 fashion 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.299
 semi automatic in fact this is the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.979
 flash cell that to make the measurement 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.290
 and comes back in mode t t she 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.460
 if I will iron manual I have the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.740
 opportunity to go play on the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.310
 24mm zoom function always with the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.659
 wheel to mount up to 280 mm so 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.659
 for a wide focal range 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.369
 other option the possible to have the sound 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.880
 the beep that goes off every time 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:04.790
 that counts does not finish the search 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.790
 practical and if the flash and remote here is 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.380
 picture issue extinction we can not 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.110
 turn it off by chance when these one 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.190
 press the button a few times 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.210
 turn on the backlighting by the way 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.390
 we note in passing that the buttons 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.340
 are pretty well done it's not my c c 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.820
 it clicks well we know exactly what 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.450
 that we're talking about extinction actually 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.430
 it only takes a few seconds the flash 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.650
 and and m to turn it back even 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.569
 principle so the evening lepi in full 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.390
 so you will not see but here 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.930
 when the pile this vacuum in level 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.930
 starts to show 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.629
 what to say on the other hand in a priori thing 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.790
 a monologue but I do not really 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.079
 successful at the act so it's good we do not 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.090
 will not serve much on my side 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.109
 what more can I say about the pillay button 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.819
 allows declares at whatever the 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:56.500
 fashion so if we go on the 100% it goes 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.420
 quickly the eyes so it slams the fort and 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.280
 its recharging quite quickly as we have 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.280
 could see it in the laugh a video
