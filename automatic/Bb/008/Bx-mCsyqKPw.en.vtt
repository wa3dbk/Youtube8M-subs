00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the GTO power steering pump for it as

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.429 
the GTO power steering pump for it as
you<00:01:01.199> bought<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> replacement<00:01:02.219> one<00:01:02.670> or<00:01:02.789> whatever

fitting and then you just get the
factory<00:01:14.729> banjo<00:01:15.600> bolt<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.740> goes<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.189> and

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
factory banjo bolt that goes to this and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.780 
factory banjo bolt that goes to this and
then<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:18.030> kind<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.450> hook<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.759> kind<00:01:20.759> of

then you just kind of hook it up kind of

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.990 
then you just kind of hook it up kind of
like<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.119> kinda<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.729> then<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.850> got

the forum this is the F body drive shaft
right<00:03:05.030> there<00:03:05.209> that's<00:03:05.299> an<00:03:05.480> aluminum<00:03:05.930> one

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
right there that's an aluminum one

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.229 
right there that's an aluminum one
that's<00:03:07.340> kind<00:03:07.549> of<00:03:07.579> thinking<00:03:07.819> about<00:03:07.879> actually

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
that's kind of thinking about actually

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.420 
that's kind of thinking about actually
just<00:03:08.269> using<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:08.989> half<00:03:09.140> body<00:03:09.349> drive<00:03:09.709> shaft<00:03:10.010> and

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
just using the half body drive shaft and

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.000 
just using the half body drive shaft and
all<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.269> have<00:03:11.359> to<00:03:11.480> do<00:03:11.599> is<00:03:11.750> get<00:03:11.989> a<00:03:12.019> different

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
all you have to do is get a different

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.819 
all you have to do is get a different
end<00:03:13.220> right<00:03:13.430> there<00:03:13.640> it's<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.030> same<00:03:14.239> length<00:03:14.829> so

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
end right there it's the same length so

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.039 
end right there it's the same length so
the<00:03:15.950> length<00:03:16.220> is<00:03:16.430> actually<00:03:16.819> perfect<00:03:17.419> for<00:03:17.480> it

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
I'm gonna be using to tune it with with

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.229 
I'm gonna be using to tune it with with
the<00:04:02.840> HP<00:04:03.139> tuners<00:04:03.379> I<00:04:03.829> got<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.519> pro<00:04:04.730> version<00:04:04.760> of

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
the HP tuners I got the pro version of

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.240 
the HP tuners I got the pro version of
that<00:04:05.389> so<00:04:05.599> I<00:04:05.629> could<00:04:05.780> hook<00:04:05.870> up<00:04:06.079> the<00:04:06.349> the<00:04:06.829> wideband

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
that so I could hook up the the wideband

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.819 
that so I could hook up the the wideband
and<00:04:07.549> data<00:04:07.819> log<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.299> everything<00:04:08.660> with<00:04:08.840> with

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
and data log and everything with with

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.039 
and data log and everything with with
the<00:04:09.949> FRS<00:04:10.609> and<00:04:10.879> I<00:04:10.970> could<00:04:11.150> hook<00:04:11.389> up<00:04:11.569> oil<00:04:11.720> pressure

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
the FRS and I could hook up oil pressure

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.539 
the FRS and I could hook up oil pressure
and<00:04:12.230> just<00:04:12.379> a<00:04:12.500> bunch<00:04:12.650> of<00:04:12.799> random<00:04:13.099> little<00:04:13.310> things

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
and just a bunch of random little things

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.449 
and just a bunch of random little things
to<00:04:13.730> that<00:04:13.879> so<00:04:14.650> I'll<00:04:15.650> probably<00:04:15.799> end<00:04:16.010> up<00:04:16.130> doing

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
to that so I'll probably end up doing

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.789 
to that so I'll probably end up doing
that<00:04:16.720> you<00:04:17.720> know<00:04:17.840> so<00:04:18.019> when<00:04:18.109> I'm<00:04:18.229> drifting<00:04:18.470> and

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
that you know so when I'm drifting and

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.670 
that you know so when I'm drifting and
stuff<00:04:18.889> I'll<00:04:19.700> do<00:04:19.909> a<00:04:19.940> few<00:04:20.180> few<00:04:20.840> logs<00:04:21.430> you<00:04:22.430> know

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
stuff I'll do a few few logs you know

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.529 
stuff I'll do a few few logs you know
logs<00:04:23.039> of<00:04:23.550> everything<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.120> then<00:04:24.240> I'll<00:04:24.330> should

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
logs of everything and then I'll should

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.570 
logs of everything and then I'll should
be<00:04:24.690> able<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.900> see<00:04:25.110> if<00:04:25.740> my<00:04:25.889> oil<00:04:26.070> pressure<00:04:26.400> is

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
be able to see if my oil pressure is

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.140 
be able to see if my oil pressure is
dropping<00:04:27.110> at<00:04:28.520> any<00:04:29.520> point<00:04:29.850> in<00:04:29.910> time

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
dropping at any point in time

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.840 
dropping at any point in time
throw<00:04:30.630> out<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.750> I<00:04:31.199> throw<00:04:32.100> out<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.310> drift<00:04:32.610> or

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
throw out the I throw out the drift or

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.610 
throw out the I throw out the drift or
the<00:04:33.000> you<00:04:33.330> know<00:04:33.389> whatever<00:04:33.600> I'm<00:04:33.840> doing<00:04:34.250> so<00:04:35.389> I<00:04:36.620> was

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
the you know whatever I'm doing so I was

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.129 
the you know whatever I'm doing so I was
actually<00:04:37.979> found<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.280> set<00:04:38.460> of<00:04:39.139> exhaust

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
actually found a set of exhaust

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.770 
actually found a set of exhaust
manifolds<00:04:40.800> their<00:04:40.919> truck<00:04:41.660> manifolds<00:04:42.660> and

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
manifolds their truck manifolds and

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.629 
manifolds their truck manifolds and
that's<00:04:43.110> what<00:04:43.350> basically<00:04:43.770> everybody<00:04:44.070> uses<00:04:44.430> for

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
that's what basically everybody uses for

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.740 
that's what basically everybody uses for
the<00:04:44.699> turbo<00:04:46.220> turbos<00:04:47.220> they<00:04:47.490> they<00:04:47.910> just<00:04:48.120> get<00:04:48.600> the

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
the turbo turbos they they just get the

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.180 
the turbo turbos they they just get the
exhaust<00:04:49.020> they<00:04:49.259> flip<00:04:49.440> them<00:04:49.620> upside<00:04:49.889> down<00:04:49.919> they

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
exhaust they flip them upside down they

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.790 
exhaust they flip them upside down they
come<00:04:50.370> out<00:04:50.400> of<00:04:50.669> butt<00:04:51.000> up<00:04:51.330> here<00:04:51.389> and<00:04:51.870> then<00:04:51.990> you

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
come out of butt up here and then you

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.210 
come out of butt up here and then you
basically<00:04:52.919> just<00:04:53.990> hook<00:04:54.990> them<00:04:55.110> up<00:04:55.289> and<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:56.070> know

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
basically just hook them up and you know

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.860 
basically just hook them up and you know
weld<00:04:56.520> a<00:04:56.610> bunch<00:04:56.759> of<00:04:56.940> stuff<00:04:57.120> onto<00:04:57.449> it<00:04:57.599> and<00:04:57.690> bring

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
weld a bunch of stuff onto it and bring

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.219 
weld a bunch of stuff onto it and bring
a<00:04:57.930> turbo<00:04:58.289> turbo<00:04:58.860> over<00:04:59.190> here<00:04:59.490> and<00:05:00.360> it's<00:05:01.020> kind<00:05:01.139> of

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
a turbo turbo over here and it's kind of

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.629 
a turbo turbo over here and it's kind of
thinking<00:05:01.440> about<00:05:01.530> doing<00:05:01.830> that<00:05:01.919> eventually<00:05:02.250> on

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
thinking about doing that eventually on

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.770 
thinking about doing that eventually on
this<00:05:02.880> either<00:05:03.210> that<00:05:03.509> or<00:05:04.370> doing<00:05:05.370> a<00:05:05.430> 5<00:05:05.639> 3<00:05:06.060> and

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
this either that or doing a 5 3 and

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.140 
this either that or doing a 5 3 and
swapping<00:05:07.259> it<00:05:07.349> out<00:05:07.470> with<00:05:08.220> it<00:05:08.430> with<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.729> LS<00:05:08.940> one

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
swapping it out with it with the LS one

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.420 
swapping it out with it with the LS one
and<00:05:09.330> then<00:05:09.419> selling<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.780> LS<00:05:09.990> 1<00:05:10.229> because<00:05:10.530> the

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
and then selling the LS 1 because the

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.249 
and then selling the LS 1 because the
money<00:05:11.610> that<00:05:11.699> I<00:05:11.849> could<00:05:12.360> get<00:05:12.509> out<00:05:12.570> of<00:05:12.810> LS<00:05:13.050> 1<00:05:13.229> I

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
money that I could get out of LS 1 I

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.260 
money that I could get out of LS 1 I
could<00:05:13.440> pretty<00:05:13.710> much<00:05:13.860> build<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.250> whole<00:05:14.430> 5<00:05:14.940> 3

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
could pretty much build the whole 5 3

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:22.310 
could pretty much build the whole 5 3
turbo<00:05:15.660> setup<00:05:15.900> type<00:05:16.199> of<00:05:16.349> thing<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:19.190> what<00:05:21.320> yeah

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
turbo setup type of thing and what yeah

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.360 
turbo setup type of thing and what yeah
that's<00:05:22.620> pretty<00:05:22.830> much<00:05:22.949> it<00:05:23.070> for<00:05:23.490> now<00:05:23.550> so
