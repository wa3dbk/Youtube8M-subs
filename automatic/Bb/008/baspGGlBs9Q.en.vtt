00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
yet again you've got compression straps

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.850 
yet again you've got compression straps
on<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.250> side<00:01:51.520> which<00:01:52.390> I<00:01:52.570> did<00:01:52.780> just<00:01:53.020> disconnect

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
on the side which I did just disconnect

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.899

then it will sit in there nice and
comfortably<00:02:33.310> let's<00:02:34.239> just<00:02:34.510> do<00:02:34.690> this<00:02:34.900> up

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
comfortably let's just do this up

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.979 
comfortably let's just do this up
obviously<00:02:36.849> in<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.269> top<00:02:37.450> you've<00:02:37.629> got<00:02:37.840> your

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
issues but what you do have actual

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.339 
issues but what you do have actual
adjust<00:02:48.910> points<00:02:49.239> on<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.540> head<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.170> wreck

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
adjust points on the head of the wreck

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:51.420 
adjust points on the head of the wreck
site<00:02:50.620> now<00:02:50.829> obviously<00:02:51.099> you've<00:02:51.280> got<00:02:51.310> a

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
site now obviously you've got a

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.420 
site now obviously you've got a
compression<00:02:51.970> strap<00:02:52.269> here<00:02:52.540> which<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.349> will<00:02:53.590> just

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
compression strap here which I will just

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.210 
compression strap here which I will just
do<00:02:54.670> up<00:02:54.879> and<00:02:55.810> obviously<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.590> can<00:02:56.829> adjust<00:02:57.129> it

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
do up and obviously you can adjust it

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.130 
do up and obviously you can adjust it
accordingly<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.329> can<00:02:58.480> actually<00:02:58.660> use<00:02:58.989> this

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
accordingly so you can actually use this

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.650 
accordingly so you can actually use this
top<00:02:59.440> section<00:02:59.709> as<00:03:00.129> a<00:03:00.190> separate<00:03:01.000> storage<00:03:01.299> area

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
top section as a separate storage area

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.220 
top section as a separate storage area
because<00:03:02.079> you<00:03:03.000> can<00:03:04.000> basically<00:03:04.269> make<00:03:04.930> the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
because you can basically make the

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.830 
because you can basically make the
actual<00:03:05.530> head<00:03:05.739> pretty<00:03:06.519> much<00:03:06.790> extends<00:03:07.660> in

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
actual head pretty much extends in

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.020 
actual head pretty much extends in
minutes<00:03:08.739> that's<00:03:08.950> pretty<00:03:09.340> much<00:03:09.489> as<00:03:09.670> fill<00:03:09.910> as

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
minutes that's pretty much as fill as
