the dot um plist so right afterwards

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.570 
the dot um plist so right afterwards
just<00:04:11.790> default<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:13.530> that<00:04:13.709> your<00:04:13.950> ipod<00:04:14.250> doesn't

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
now basically you're not a net

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.320 
now basically you're not a net
overclocked<00:04:57.800> your<00:05:00.490> ipod<00:05:01.490> for<00:05:01.700> you<00:05:01.790> we<00:05:02.060> got<00:05:02.210> if

overclocked your ipod for you we got if

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.650 
overclocked your ipod for you we got if
I<00:05:02.480> touch<00:05:02.960> your<00:05:03.170> iPhone<00:05:04.010> or<00:05:04.040> your<00:05:04.400> iPad

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.200 

alright<00:05:24.470> so<00:05:24.950> now<00:05:25.370> that<00:05:25.610> you've<00:05:25.730> done<00:05:25.760> that<00:05:26.120> out

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
alright so now that you've done that out

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.860 
alright so now that you've done that out
of<00:05:26.300> the<00:05:26.360> computer<00:05:26.750> and<00:05:27.620> take<00:05:27.800> care<00:05:27.950> of<00:05:28.070> hot

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
of the computer and take care of hot

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.770 
of the computer and take care of hot
unplug<00:05:29.870> it<00:05:30.020> and<00:05:31.180> right<00:05:32.180> now<00:05:32.330> it's<00:05:32.480> not<00:05:32.540> going

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
unplug it and right now it's not going

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.430 
unplug it and right now it's not going
to<00:05:32.870> act<00:05:33.020> like<00:05:33.110> you've<00:05:33.320> done<00:05:33.530> anything<00:05:33.770> because

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
to act like you've done anything because

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.910 
to act like you've done anything because
it<00:05:36.440> hasn't<00:05:36.890> registered<00:05:37.220> yet<00:05:39.370> same<00:05:41.920> basically

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
it hasn't registered yet same basically

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.340 
it hasn't registered yet same basically
what<00:05:43.070> you're<00:05:43.130> doing<00:05:43.190> this<00:05:43.430> overclocking<00:05:44.000> it

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
what you're doing this overclocking it

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.840 
what you're doing this overclocking it
because<00:05:45.350> it's<00:05:45.560> a<00:05:45.710> planet<00:05:45.980> underclocked<00:05:46.670> in

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
because it's a planet underclocked in

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:47.950 
because it's a planet underclocked in
case<00:05:47.030> you<00:05:47.180> were<00:05:47.270> wondering<00:05:47.450> what<00:05:47.780> you're

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
case you were wondering what you're

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.240 
case you were wondering what you're
actually<00:05:48.110> doing<00:05:48.290> there<00:05:48.680> and<00:05:48.860> you<00:05:49.130> can

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
actually doing there and you can

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.460 
actually doing there and you can
probably<00:05:49.550> look<00:05:49.760> it<00:05:49.880> up<00:05:49.940> on<00:05:50.090> Google<00:05:50.420> like<00:05:51.320> how

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
probably look it up on Google like how

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.390 
probably look it up on Google like how
to<00:05:51.530> overclock<00:05:52.040> your<00:05:52.160> iphone<00:05:52.850> and<00:05:53.780> itouch<00:05:54.400> you

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
to overclock your iphone and itouch you

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.030 
to overclock your iphone and itouch you
find<00:05:55.760> it<00:05:55.880> just<00:05:56.000> as<00:05:56.120> easy<00:05:56.680> so<00:05:57.680> now<00:05:57.800> you're<00:05:57.890> going

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
find it just as easy so now you're going

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:04.180 
find it just as easy so now you're going
to<00:05:58.100> do<00:05:59.020> hold<00:06:00.020> down<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.230> power<00:06:00.260> button<00:06:03.190> slide

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
to do hold down the power button slide

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:12.470 
to do hold down the power button slide
to<00:06:04.370> power<00:06:04.400> off

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:25.850 

then<00:06:13.440> power<00:06:13.830> back<00:06:14.100> up

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.860 

you

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:39.080 

cup<00:06:34.550> linear<00:06:35.550> cascode<00:06:36.320> and<00:06:37.320> now<00:06:37.680> your<00:06:38.160> ipod<00:06:38.730> is

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
cup linear cascode and now your ipod is

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.180 
cup linear cascode and now your ipod is
completely<00:06:39.690> overclocked<00:06:40.230> and<00:06:40.500> it<00:06:40.770> will<00:06:40.890> run

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
completely overclocked and it will run

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.630 
completely overclocked and it will run
probably<00:06:41.670> about<00:06:42.680> 25<00:06:43.680> to<00:06:43.860> 50<00:06:44.130> percent<00:06:44.430> faster

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:44.640 
probably about 25 to 50 percent faster

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.300 
probably about 25 to 50 percent faster
depending<00:06:45.090> on<00:06:45.420> how<00:06:46.260> much<00:06:46.440> of<00:06:46.740> its<00:06:46.920> process

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
depending on how much of its process

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.410 
depending on how much of its process
here<00:06:47.550> to<00:06:47.760> use<00:06:47.940> let<00:06:48.840> people<00:06:49.200> use<00:06:49.380> any<00:06:49.860> of<00:06:49.890> it

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:50.420 
here to use let people use any of it

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.510 
here to use let people use any of it
then<00:06:51.830> there's<00:06:52.830> really<00:06:52.950> going<00:06:53.130> to<00:06:53.220> be<00:06:53.310> not<00:06:53.490> that

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
then there's really going to be not that

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.010 
then there's really going to be not that
much<00:06:53.820> of<00:06:53.850> a<00:06:54.030> difference<00:06:54.060> for<00:06:54.480> you<00:06:54.600> but<00:06:54.810> if<00:06:54.930> you

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 
much of a difference for you but if you

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.400 
much of a difference for you but if you
have<00:06:55.140> tons<00:06:55.380> of<00:06:55.560> winterboard<00:06:56.130> apps<00:06:56.400> running<00:06:57.410> or

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410 
have tons of winterboard apps running or

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.650 
have tons of winterboard apps running or
like<00:06:58.590> themes<00:06:58.980> and<00:06:59.460> all<00:06:59.520> that<00:06:59.760> just<00:07:00.480> probably

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
like themes and all that just probably

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.350 
like themes and all that just probably
make<00:07:00.870> a<00:07:00.900> big<00:07:01.140> difference<00:07:01.350> for<00:07:01.680> you<00:07:01.790> so<00:07:02.790> I<00:07:02.820> hope

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
make a big difference for you so I hope

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.530 
make a big difference for you so I hope
this<00:07:03.900> helps<00:07:04.320> and
