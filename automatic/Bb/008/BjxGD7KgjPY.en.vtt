with this assignment so I'm with a song

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.560 
with this assignment so I'm with a song
so<00:00:33.560> let's<00:00:33.800> go<00:00:34.220> with<00:00:34.640> let's<00:00:35.300> learn<00:00:35.420> the

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
so let's go with let's learn the

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.240 
so let's go with let's learn the
left-hand<00:00:35.990> part<00:00:36.140> first<00:00:36.380> here's<00:00:36.980> middle<00:00:37.130> C

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
left-hand part first here's middle C

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.850 
left-hand part first here's middle C
we're<00:00:38.210> gonna<00:00:38.300> start<00:00:38.570> at<00:00:38.660> a<00:00:38.780> right<00:00:39.650> below

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
we're gonna start at a right below

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.600 
we're gonna start at a right below
middle<00:00:40.040> C<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:41.410> Carol<00:00:42.410> Abele's<00:00:42.650> is<00:00:42.860> in<00:00:42.980> 3/4

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
middle C and Carol Abele's is in 3/4

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.980 
middle C and Carol Abele's is in 3/4
meaning<00:00:43.880> there's<00:00:44.030> three<00:00:44.390> beats<00:00:44.630> per<00:00:44.870> measure

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
meaning there's three beats per measure

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.130 
meaning there's three beats per measure
so<00:00:45.620> we're<00:00:45.710> gonna<00:00:45.800> go<00:00:45.980> one<00:00:46.460> two<00:00:46.880> three<00:00:46.910> one<00:00:47.810> two

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
so we're gonna go one two three one two

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.819 
so we're gonna go one two three one two
three<00:00:48.260> one<00:00:49.160> two<00:00:49.190> three<00:00:49.610> one<00:00:50.329> two<00:00:50.780> three<00:00:51.380> so

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
three one two three one two three so

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.910 
three one two three one two three so
we're<00:00:51.950> going<00:00:52.040> from<00:00:56.320> which<00:00:57.320> those<00:00:57.530> of<00:00:57.649> you<00:00:57.739> who

know<00:00:58.130> the<00:00:58.430> a<00:00:58.820> minor<00:00:59.210> scale<00:00:59.480> is<00:00:59.690> that<00:00:59.899> is<00:01:00.350> the

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
know the a minor scale is that is the

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.459 
know the a minor scale is that is the
