going to show you today is how to

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.799 
going to show you today is how to
convert<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.700> Manfrotto<00:00:08.700> ball<00:00:09.030> head<00:00:09.300> this<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.750> a

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
convert a Manfrotto ball head this is a

convert a Manfrotto ball head this is a
488<00:00:10.440> RC<00:00:10.830> 4<00:00:11.509> we're<00:00:12.509> going<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.690> convert<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.049> over

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
488 RC 4 we're going to convert it over

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.890 
488 RC 4 we're going to convert it over
to<00:00:13.830> an<00:00:14.160> ARCA<00:00:14.490> Swiss<00:00:14.700> style<00:00:15.179> clamp<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:17.779> put<00:00:18.779> an

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
to an ARCA Swiss style clamp and put an

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.470 
to an ARCA Swiss style clamp and put an
L<00:00:19.020> bracket<00:00:19.500> on<00:00:19.590> my<00:00:19.710> 5d<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.490> make<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.270> real<00:00:21.449> easy

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
L bracket on my 5d so make it real easy

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.740 
L bracket on my 5d so make it real easy
for<00:00:22.109> switching<00:00:22.320> from<00:00:22.939> horizontal<00:00:23.939> to

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
for switching from horizontal to

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.870 
for switching from horizontal to
portrait<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.560> not<00:00:26.189> having<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.460> change<00:00:26.730> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
portrait and not having to change the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.870 
portrait and not having to change the
composition<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:28.189> it<00:00:29.189> just<00:00:29.369> makes<00:00:29.640> things<00:00:29.789> a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
composition and it just makes things a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.730 
composition and it just makes things a
whole<00:00:30.000> lot<00:00:30.060> easier<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.689> clamp<00:00:30.990> here<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.380> it

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
whole lot easier this clamp here is it

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.270 
whole lot easier this clamp here is it
does<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.219> job<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:33.230> it's<00:00:34.230> just<00:00:34.440> clunky<00:00:34.950> and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
does the job but it's just clunky and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.400 
does the job but it's just clunky and
you<00:00:35.910> can't<00:00:36.120> get<00:00:36.210> an<00:00:36.329> L<00:00:36.420> bracket<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.170> far<00:00:37.350> as

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
you can't get an L bracket for as far as

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.680 
you can't get an L bracket for as far as
I<00:00:37.590> know<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.340> if<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.640> could<00:00:38.850> it'd<00:00:38.969> be<00:00:39.120> huge

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
I know and if you could it'd be huge

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.319 
I know and if you could it'd be huge
so<00:00:40.160> start<00:00:41.160> by<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.489> removing<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.000> 6

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
so start by just removing the 6

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.700 
so start by just removing the 6
millimeter<00:00:42.780> screw<00:00:43.140> here<00:00:43.379> right<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
millimeter screw here right in the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.400 
millimeter screw here right in the
middle<00:00:43.770> or<00:00:44.070> an<00:00:44.190> m6<00:00:44.760> M<00:00:45.090> -<00:00:45.360> 6<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.899> guess<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
middle or an m6 M - 6 I guess is the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.479 
middle or an m6 M - 6 I guess is the
other<00:00:46.559> name<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.180> typical<00:00:49.489> 6

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
other name for it but it's a typical 6

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.689 
other name for it but it's a typical 6
millimeter<00:00:50.969> screw<00:00:51.899> with<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> tapered<00:00:53.129> end<00:00:53.399> here

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699

millimeter screw with a tapered end here
at<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.149> top<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:56.039> just<00:00:56.070> take<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.399> out

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
at the top and you just take that out

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.000 
at the top and you just take that out
done<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.960> then<00:01:01.289> what<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.530> want<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.739> do<00:01:01.859> is

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
couple cranks and don't over tighten it

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.020 
couple cranks and don't over tighten it
so<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.229> don't<00:01:37.380> cross<00:01:37.710> thread<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.340> there

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
so you don't cross thread it and there

so you don't cross thread it and there
you<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.479> mean<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.780> simple<00:01:41.390> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
you have it I mean it's that simple and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.060 
you have it I mean it's that simple and
then<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> next<00:01:43.290> thing<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.439> want<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.829> is

then the next thing you want to do is

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.960 
then the next thing you want to do is
put<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.689> Kirk<00:01:46.070> L<00:01:47.070> plate<00:01:47.430> for<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.729> 5

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
put the this is a Kirk L plate for the 5

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.800 
put the this is a Kirk L plate for the 5
D<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:49.170> got<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.409> take<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:49.979> off<00:01:50.220> first

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.139 

let's<00:01:54.810> grab<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> little<00:01:55.320> coin<00:01:55.909> unscrew<00:01:56.909> this

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
let's grab a little coin unscrew this

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.850 
let's grab a little coin unscrew this
you<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.630> see<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.290> clunky<00:01:58.770> and

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
you just see it's just so clunky and

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:08.469 
you just see it's just so clunky and
huge<00:02:02.210> just<00:02:03.210> unscrew<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.780> take<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.500> off

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.960 

and<00:02:09.479> then<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.720> want<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.899> grab<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.970> l-bracket

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
and then you want to grab the l-bracket

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.070 
and then you want to grab the l-bracket
and<00:02:12.959> stick<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.290> on<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.650> UH<00:02:13.680> on<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:15.690> back<00:02:15.870> of

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
and stick it on the UH on the back of

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.729 
and stick it on the UH on the back of
the<00:02:16.230> around<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.920> bottom<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.459> camera<00:02:18.739> and

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
the around the bottom of the camera and

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.920 
the around the bottom of the camera and
what's<00:02:19.920> nice<00:02:20.099> about<00:02:20.129> this<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:21.510> once<00:02:21.810> you

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
what's nice about this is once you

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.290 
what's nice about this is once you
tighten<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.349> on<00:02:22.500> there<00:02:22.830> there's<00:02:23.580> no<00:02:23.790> slipping

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
tighten it on there there's no slipping

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.360
