00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:17.550
 seville in bormujos concretely with a 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:21.359
 heat that fry the good soul painted in 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.769
 Elizabethan and Baldomero's house and we have 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.339
 here to my sarita that will make us a 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.339
 Mojito 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.090
 to be nice that refreshes us a little 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:42.870
 we need a little bit of mint 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:49.050
 crushed ice brown sugar lime 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:52.100
 rum and homemade good refriango white if 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.780
 fell white 12 oats 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.260
 we have here a crush was wooden 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.790
 a spoon a knife a table and a 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.180
 glass and now now it will not say how it 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.330
 makes to start mixing the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.330
 ingredients 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.130
 two sugar spoons 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:20.800
 large soup spoons large 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.130
 this is comfortable but it is usually 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.300
 OK 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.090
 a file is cut into four pieces 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.230
 and stretches leaders the culillo and 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.230
 part in 4% 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.910
 everything is removed 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:53.080
 and it does not stay the same as the first master in the 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.210
 lima then you could do what happens 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.490
 here I think out smarter and equal 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.920
 have also shell and maybe the 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.990
 bitter acid if I from the shell actually 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.020
 that special touch yes 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:12.319
 so they come out good 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:16.400
 now that we have washed much abuse 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.120
 of the thing much more intense more quantity 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.120
 but less 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.610
 and the prettiest color that I know 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.620
 this smells that feeds the super boy 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.980
 richer color than ground 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.300
 Now let's throw the crushed ice 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.890
 we fill the mud up 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.890
 up whatever it is 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.240
 we enter the dose of alcohol of rum 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:20.360
 white that are usually 7 centiliters 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:22.700
 more or less a shot glass 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.340
 always the choice of the person who 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.530
 go to consume if white rum is rum 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.310
