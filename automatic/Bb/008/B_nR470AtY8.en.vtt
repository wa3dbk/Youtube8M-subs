familiar<00:00:32.129> with<00:00:32.460> what<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.879> combi<00:00:33.300> oven<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.720> I'm

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
familiar with what a combi oven is I'm

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.470 
familiar with what a combi oven is I'm
gonna<00:00:34.050> give<00:00:34.199> kind<00:00:34.470> of<00:00:34.559> combi<00:00:34.860> oven<00:00:35.070> basics<00:00:35.550> ok

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
gonna give kind of combi oven basics ok

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.660 
gonna give kind of combi oven basics ok
then<00:00:36.989> I'll<00:00:37.110> go<00:00:37.140> over<00:00:37.290> how<00:00:37.890> we<00:00:37.949> do<00:00:38.430> things

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
then I'll go over how we do things

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.670 
then I'll go over how we do things
distinctly<00:00:39.390> that's<00:00:39.750> that's<00:00:40.140> unique<00:00:40.470> to<00:00:40.620> our

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
distinctly that's that's unique to our

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.860 
distinctly that's that's unique to our
technology<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.670> then<00:00:42.120> we'll<00:00:42.239> cook<00:00:42.390> food<00:00:42.660> and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
technology and then we'll cook food and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.850 
technology and then we'll cook food and
you'll<00:00:42.960> see<00:00:43.140> how<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.440> works

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
you'll see how it works

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.510 
you'll see how it works
okay<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:45.000> combi<00:00:45.600> oven<00:00:45.900> in<00:00:46.080> its<00:00:46.470> basic<00:00:46.739> form<00:00:47.280> is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
okay so combi oven in its basic form is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.729 
okay so combi oven in its basic form is
you've<00:00:48.180> taken<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.600> convection<00:00:49.050> oven<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.590> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you've taken a convection oven and a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.650 
you've taken a convection oven and a
steamer<00:00:50.040> put<00:00:50.399> together<00:00:50.550> okay<00:00:51.180> then<00:00:51.390> one<00:00:51.510> out

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
steamer put together okay then one out

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.150 
steamer put together okay then one out
when<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.989> get<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.290> little<00:00:52.500> drunk<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.920> made<00:00:53.130> a

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
when I get a little drunk and made a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.660 
when I get a little drunk and made a
little<00:00:53.340> combi<00:00:53.790> oven<00:00:54.030> baby<00:00:54.239> okay<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
little combi oven baby okay so on the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.819 
little combi oven baby okay so on the
steamer<00:00:56.969> side<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.540> things<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.350> start

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
steamer side of things we can start

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.280 
steamer side of things we can start
producing<00:00:59.130> steam<00:00:59.610> as<00:00:59.760> low<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.090> 120<00:01:00.899> degrees

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
producing steam as low as 120 degrees

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.369 
producing steam as low as 120 degrees
okay<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.750> gives<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.989> foolproof

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
okay so that gives you foolproof

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.590 
okay so that gives you foolproof
proofing<00:01:05.040> applications<00:01:05.790> for<00:01:06.090> breads<00:01:06.330> and

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
to go out to the hot air or the hot air

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:39.320 
to go out to the hot air or the hot air
in<00:01:38.160> your<00:01:38.250> house<00:01:38.399> wants<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.880> go<00:01:38.970> out<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.240> the

cold air everything wants to create in
equilibrium<00:01:41.580> right<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:43.050> have<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.259> big

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
equilibrium right so we have this big

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.710 
equilibrium right so we have this big
chicken<00:01:44.069> any<00:01:44.280> protein<00:01:45.090> full<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.539> moisture

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
chicken any protein full of moisture

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.680 
chicken any protein full of moisture
inside<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.679> it<00:01:46.830> you<00:01:47.310> put<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.640> inside<00:01:48.090> your<00:01:48.149> hot

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
inside of it you put it inside your hot

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.499 
inside of it you put it inside your hot
convection<00:01:49.319> oven<00:01:49.590> all<00:01:49.800> that<00:01:50.459> moisture<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:51.149> is

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
convection oven all that moisture is is

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.389 
convection oven all that moisture is is
going<00:01:52.020> out<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.470> convection<00:01:52.830> oven<00:01:53.099> right

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
going out to the convection oven right

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.020 
going out to the convection oven right
but<00:01:53.940> now<00:01:54.179> with<00:01:54.929> 20%<00:01:55.440> humidity<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.580> have

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
but now with 20% humidity I have

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.210 
but now with 20% humidity I have
different<00:01:57.300> pressure<00:01:57.690> here<00:01:58.080> now<00:01:58.440> I<00:01:58.470> have<00:01:58.679> 20%

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
different pressure here now I have 20%

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.580 
different pressure here now I have 20%
humidity<00:01:59.970> out<00:02:00.149> here<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.539> there's<00:02:01.020> no<00:02:01.319> place

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
humidity out here and there's no place

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.339 
humidity out here and there's no place
for<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.890> moisture<00:02:02.160> to<00:02:02.520> go<00:02:02.899> so<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:03.959> keeps<00:02:04.110> it

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
for that moisture to go so it keeps it

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:05.859 
for that moisture to go so it keeps it
inside<00:02:04.530> right<00:02:05.009> we're<00:02:05.160> not<00:02:05.280> injecting

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
inside right we're not injecting

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.600 
inside right we're not injecting
humidity<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.080> into<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.649> Machine<00:02:08.009> into<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
humidity in into the Machine into the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.089 
humidity in into the Machine into the
product<00:02:09.360> we're<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:09.959> keeping<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.470> inside<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
product we're just keeping it inside and

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.640 
product we're just keeping it inside and
so<00:02:11.580> that's<00:02:12.420> going<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.690> increase<00:02:12.930> your<00:02:13.230> yields

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
so that's going to increase your yields

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.920 
so that's going to increase your yields
okay<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:14.670> now<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.060> birds<00:02:15.480> going<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.780> weigh

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
okay so now the birds going to weigh

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.510 
okay so now the birds going to weigh
more<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.500> end<00:02:16.650> because<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:16.860> hasn't<00:02:17.160> lost

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
more in the end because it hasn't lost

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.559 
more in the end because it hasn't lost
all<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.940> heat
