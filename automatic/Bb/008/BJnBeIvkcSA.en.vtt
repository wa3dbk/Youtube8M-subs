let's do this puppy okay for this
eggshell<00:00:23.310> texture<00:00:23.789> technique<00:00:24.210> we're<00:00:24.449> going

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
eggshell texture technique we're going

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.320 
eggshell texture technique we're going
to<00:00:24.840> get<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.890> Mod<00:00:26.130> Podge<00:00:26.400> or<00:00:26.760> whatever<00:00:27.060> glue

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330
