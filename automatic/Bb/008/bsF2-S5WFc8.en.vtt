00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Halli hello welcome to my 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.040
 company street rolls today i would like 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.750
 even show how the Axa closed 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.920
 if you have lost the key you 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.769
 stands with his bike and comes 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.719
 no further and yes how do I open this 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.560
 Of course it could be one now 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.630
 call a key service or someone else 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.220
 and that would say now yes we see 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.900
 here the bolts go crazy that 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.460
 That would be a possibility for us 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.150
 that open 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.000
 but there is another 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.230
 closed possibility and indeed over the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.340
 to do it all up and to do it 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.880
 So then my is mys 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.620
 to explain 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.649
 in the other video I had today 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.890
 i said yes again closed from the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.730
 I have built it up again 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.180
 I have only the feather here 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.930
 let out that any blanket here 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.789
 and the whole thing here is the mechanics 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.219
 disassembled and demarcated western 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.739
 here you can see that again jesus 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:04.049
 locked and if I now the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.850
 key take off 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.189
 So if I want to get out of that 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.950
 one of this position and that's how it works 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.140
 Finally, despite that, that is the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.020
 Consultation again add this 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.640
 small errors in it I live there now 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:22.560
 on it press and traders this function 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.390
 So for automatically terminate the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.880
 So this little feather does it well 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.860
 So now it's about opening 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.119
 you have to know how the whole thing 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.549
 work that has now first 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:37.259
 so explained in this other video and 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.400
 now it's about that I have that 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.299
 to find the right point that is 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.400
 actually quite simple 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.180
 and that is if it is now from the 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:52.470
 This is about the upper edge calls 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:54.960
 30 millimeters 32 mm and if you have the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.070
 point in the form of these tenants from 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:05.340
 This hole is out of here again 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:07.049
 25 millimeters well that would be if it were 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.090
 So this is not installed here 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.280
 There is no need to get out of the lid 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.490
 we need with conditions 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:21.480
 So that's why we're from here now 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:25.140
 then we would come in handy 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.950
 from this page go from here 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:32.489
 this is the middle line , that is 25 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.810
 their handy so here and from above 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.650
 have to be that 30 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.540
 that's because this is, however, 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.880
 not by the hand triggers the 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.880
 back knew so this is 30 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.100
 exactly and when I am at this position 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.680
 now a hole would inhabit 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.550
 drill that through completely then once 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:01.920
 The bike lock will be open and me 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.959
 then come exactly at this position here 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.140
 out and I think five millimeters 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.459
 drill would have to be enough 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.519
 So I could do that by federal list 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.890
 injection molding that a sheet metal is that 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:19.829
 is he wanted here practically this one 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:21.540
 the rough 0s of this one here 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:26.220
 that would be handy in this case 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.750
 area by word and then that is 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.799
 practically get out of the way and that 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.450
 bike lock is so on and yes me 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:37.380
 so need not be cut through here 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.610
 not to crack because often you arrive 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.390
 a bit difficult or talk 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.190
 because bent 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.440
 I've had there was so 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.450
 Anyone had bavaria because of the 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.709
 Spoke completely bent why at it 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.060
 to come so I'm so not only 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.400
 the right way or the better way 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.620
 is easy to drill from the back 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.840
 right place and then it just stops 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.400
 that closed well I explain that 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.310
 Normally I did that now 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.350
 video so this is self-help if we 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.030
 time something like that happened as the 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.859
 up closed as work is 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.859
 how can I do something and 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.519
 i am somehow in need and i am 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.989
 I have to be able to do it then 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.430
 to become self-employed with the set 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.870
 The mars not exactly if you forbade 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.609
 So if you are not in areas of 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.220
 the top are 30 millimeters from here 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.750
 25 you might as well we need to 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.380
 eight or ten inhabitants closed 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.360
 prevent 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.790
 because the key is gone but me 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.020
 So the bike can use content 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.560
 open to drive away 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.550
 it is forbidden that to a stranger 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.639
 to make a bicycle 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.830
 if that is done then that will be 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.850
 not prosecuted 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.419
 just go now and then on 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.250
 born 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.280
 So it is really annoying if you 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.419
 while denying it is right at all 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:53.910
 he was that meant and 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:55.960
 that's why the video here around me 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.210
 can help myself 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.039
 because I have already experienced that one 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.700
 key service has taken 400 euro 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:06.880
 which is not in order and 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.590
 so you have a guide content that 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.110
 you can help yourself so how 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.300
 said of finally the video is to 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.940
 self-help on his own bike 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.600
 not alien to his own property 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.750
 property 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.700
 because it makes you punishable and so 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.330
 Did you give him the opportunity to do that 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.460
 to open 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.700
 you know somebody it will come again 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.500
 my online colleagues write because 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.280
 You can over peck and soy people 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.750
 you can look 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.889
 but i have to say i have mine here 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.630
 had difficulties also with the 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.889
 I did not know exactly how 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.250
 it is now assembled 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:41.710
 actually my first and that is 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.450
 Weathered on the street around 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.160
 it has also been cracked here by 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.050
 anyone and because I do not know 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.729
 Anyway , I took it with me 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.870
 So if I do something here then I do 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.270
 then we do not need that to be new 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.150
 buy what costs a few euros and so 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.500
 it is free 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.030
 yes and then you have one 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.550
 functionally so this is closed 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.530
 in any case, the other safety 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.550
 what I had there was that easy 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.690
 only such a shallow key I there 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.820
 put it on what already 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.220
 right sensible keys were there 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.729
 So he also holds several to attitude 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.620
 in there so eight pieces recounted so 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.909
 eight pieces in total 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.360
 and the whole accordingly 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.780
 Shoot as next fun I would have 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.830
 make me 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.510
 I close your key and 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:28.350
 very simple now the whole one again 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.350
 Now the mistake comes to her 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:39.130
 in the castle and that will be there then 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:40.990
 hooked yes I can do that now yes 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.490
 i do that i am my girlfriend 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.360
 puts together now easy again 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.430
 just a few screws through 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.750
 my cousins ​​if I can do that 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.730
 I have and he shows me the whole thing again 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.860
 because I practically do that now 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.550
 can not open screws are not too 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.110
 aging 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.110
 ok, all said
