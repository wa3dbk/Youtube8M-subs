through<00:02:32.219> some<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.579> pros<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.060> cons<00:02:33.269> of

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
through some of the pros and cons of

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.030 
through some of the pros and cons of
this<00:02:33.870> particular<00:02:34.439> firearm<00:02:36.590> starting<00:02:37.590> with<00:02:37.739> I

this particular firearm starting with I

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.390 
this particular firearm starting with I
guess<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:38.879> the<00:02:39.480> finish<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.319> considered<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.159> very

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
guess the the finish I considered a very

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.349 
guess the the finish I considered a very
high<00:02:41.579> quality<00:02:41.849> finish<00:02:42.530> it's<00:02:43.530> actually<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:44.359> kg

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
high quality finish it's actually a kg

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.080
