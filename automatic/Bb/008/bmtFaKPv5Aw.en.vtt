00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the season which is pretty decent I'll

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.240 
the season which is pretty decent I'll
admit<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:09.869> not<00:01:10.049> my<00:01:10.200> favorite<00:01:10.650> song<00:01:10.890> but<00:01:11.130> as

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250

admit it's not my favorite song but as
season<00:01:11.610> first<00:01:11.850> go<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.270> definitely<00:01:12.750> better

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
season first go it's definitely better

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.780 
season first go it's definitely better
than<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.229> failure<00:01:13.560> song<00:01:13.950> from<00:01:14.130> season<00:01:14.520> three

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
than the failure song from season three

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.520 
than the failure song from season three
and<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.299> think<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.630> might<00:01:15.780> even<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> little

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
and I think it might even be a little

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.050 
and I think it might even be a little
better<00:01:16.710> than<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.040> find<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.400> pet<00:01:17.549> song<00:01:17.820> from

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
better than the find a pet song from

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.120 
better than the find a pet song from
season<00:01:18.450> two<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.020> song<00:01:19.259> even<00:01:19.590> has<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> really

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
season two the song even has a really

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.830 
season two the song even has a really
clever<00:01:20.340> reference<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.000> rocky<00:01:21.270> during<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
clever reference to rocky during the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.289 
clever reference to rocky during the
Crusaders<00:01:22.350> training<00:01:22.770> montage<00:01:23.189> obviously<00:01:24.150> the

Crusaders training montage obviously the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.969 
Crusaders training montage obviously the
joke<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.720> Scootaloo<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.409> having<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> tough

Dash<00:05:15.000> is<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.210> reason<00:05:15.600> they<00:05:15.720> act<00:05:15.870> like<00:05:16.080> that<00:05:16.200> in

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
Dash is the reason they act like that in

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.050 
Dash is the reason they act like that in
the<00:05:16.440> first<00:05:16.620> place<00:05:16.980> I<00:05:17.220> do<00:05:17.310> think<00:05:17.640> it's<00:05:17.790> kind<00:05:17.940> of

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
the first place I do think it's kind of

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.340 
the first place I do think it's kind of
weird<00:05:18.270> that<00:05:18.390> we<00:05:18.510> never<00:05:18.690> get<00:05:18.870> to<00:05:19.020> see<00:05:19.200> the<00:05:19.320> other

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
weird that we never get to see the other

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.320 
weird that we never get to see the other
performances<00:05:20.250> but<00:05:20.550> perhaps<00:05:20.790> it's<00:05:21.120> for<00:05:21.270> the

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
performances but perhaps it's for the

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.990 
performances but perhaps it's for the
best<00:05:21.420> that<00:05:21.780> it's<00:05:21.930> left<00:05:22.110> of<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.350> imagination

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
best that it's left of the imagination

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.460 
best that it's left of the imagination

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.180 
Sleepless in Ponyville as we finally get
to<00:05:54.570> see<00:05:54.720> Rainbow<00:05:55.080> Dash<00:05:55.260> act<00:05:55.530> like<00:05:55.890> the<00:05:56.010> big

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
to see Rainbow Dash act like the big

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.040 
to see Rainbow Dash act like the big
sister<00:05:56.490> that<00:05:56.790> she<00:05:56.940> promised<00:05:57.450> she<00:05:57.570> was<00:05:57.720> going

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
sister that she promised she was going

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.100 
sister that she promised she was going
to<00:05:58.140> be<00:05:58.290> just<00:05:58.710> that<00:05:58.919> was<00:05:59.820> such<00:06:00.240> a<00:06:00.270> good<00:06:00.630> zing

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
to be just that was such a good zing

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.260 
to be just that was such a good zing
obviously<00:06:02.010> with<00:06:02.160> the<00:06:02.280> competition<00:06:02.700> coming<00:06:03.180> up

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
obviously with the competition coming up

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.240 
obviously with the competition coming up
so<00:06:03.450> soon<00:06:03.720> events<00:06:04.230> had<00:06:04.350> to<00:06:04.440> be<00:06:04.530> moved<00:06:04.740> along<00:06:04.890> and

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
so soon events had to be moved along and

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.770 
so soon events had to be moved along and
resolved<00:06:05.640> quickly<00:06:05.940> while<00:06:06.330> keeping<00:06:06.660> the

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
resolved quickly while keeping the

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.810 
resolved quickly while keeping the
shifting<00:06:07.110> emotional<00:06:07.590> tone<00:06:07.770> believable<00:06:08.400> and<00:06:08.610> I

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
shifting emotional tone believable and I

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.520 
shifting emotional tone believable and I
think<00:06:09.060> it<00:06:09.180> works<00:06:09.360> for<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.660> most<00:06:09.840> part<00:06:10.200> but<00:06:10.410> it

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
think it works for the most part but it

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.170 
think it works for the most part but it
also<00:06:10.710> feels<00:06:11.100> like<00:06:11.340> they<00:06:11.460> could<00:06:11.520> explore<00:06:12.030> this

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
also feels like they could explore this

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.240 
also feels like they could explore this
topic<00:06:12.600> even<00:06:12.720> more<00:06:13.140> perhaps<00:06:13.470> in<00:06:13.800> a<00:06:13.890> future

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
topic even more perhaps in a future

episode<00:06:14.400> otherwise<00:06:15.360> my<00:06:15.720> main<00:06:15.900> problem<00:06:16.350> here

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
episode otherwise my main problem here

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.320 
episode otherwise my main problem here
is<00:06:16.650> that<00:06:16.680> a<00:06:16.830> lot<00:06:17.100> of<00:06:17.130> the<00:06:17.310> humor<00:06:17.669> falls<00:06:18.000> flat

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
is that a lot of the humor falls flat

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.690 
is that a lot of the humor falls flat
though<00:06:18.930> frankly<00:06:19.350> it<00:06:19.680> is<00:06:19.860> kind<00:06:20.130> of<00:06:20.190> a<00:06:20.280> big<00:06:20.490> deal

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
though frankly it is kind of a big deal

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.909 
though frankly it is kind of a big deal
when<00:06:20.970> nearly<00:06:21.240> every<00:06:21.780> joke<00:06:22.110> brings<00:06:22.410> the<00:06:22.530> entire

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
when nearly every joke brings the entire

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.890 
when nearly every joke brings the entire
episode<00:06:23.190> to<00:06:23.520> a<00:06:23.640> screeching<00:06:24.000> halt<00:06:24.419> in<00:06:24.600> fact

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
episode to a screeching halt in fact

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.330 
episode to a screeching halt in fact
that's<00:06:25.080> been<00:06:25.290> my<00:06:25.440> problem<00:06:25.470> with<00:06:26.040> every

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
that's been my problem with every

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.580 
that's been my problem with every
episode<00:06:26.760> this<00:06:26.940> season<00:06:27.300> so<00:06:27.510> far<00:06:27.840> except<00:06:28.410> for

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
episode this season so far except for

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.560 
episode this season so far except for
Castle<00:06:28.950> mania<00:06:29.370> which<00:06:29.580> basically<00:06:30.000> needed<00:06:30.480> to

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
Castle mania which basically needed to

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.000 
Castle mania which basically needed to
have<00:06:30.690> a<00:06:30.720> good<00:06:30.810> sense<00:06:31.140> of<00:06:31.290> humor<00:06:31.560> because<00:06:31.740> it

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010 
have a good sense of humor because it

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.440 
have a good sense of humor because it
was<00:06:32.130> the<00:06:32.220> only<00:06:32.400> thing<00:06:32.580> that<00:06:32.820> episode<00:06:33.270> had

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
was the only thing that episode had

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.270 
was the only thing that episode had
going<00:06:33.810> for<00:06:34.050> it<00:06:34.140> in<00:06:34.230> the<00:06:34.290> first<00:06:34.470> place<00:06:34.710> every

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
going for it in the first place every

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.340 
going for it in the first place every
other<00:06:35.430> episode<00:06:35.700> that<00:06:36.180> tries<00:06:36.390> to<00:06:36.539> be<00:06:36.660> mature<00:06:36.840> or

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
other episode that tries to be mature or

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.440 
other episode that tries to be mature or
make<00:06:37.560> a<00:06:37.590> point<00:06:37.979> falls<00:06:38.490> apart<00:06:38.940> when<00:06:39.120> it<00:06:39.240> tries

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.450 
make a point falls apart when it tries

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.970 
make a point falls apart when it tries
to<00:06:39.479> be<00:06:39.690> funny<00:06:39.720> and<00:06:40.260> that's<00:06:40.500> a<00:06:40.680> real

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
to be funny and that's a real

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.670 
to be funny and that's a real
shame<00:06:41.250> because<00:06:41.520> again<00:06:42.330> castlemania<00:06:43.170> proves

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
shame because again castlemania proves

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.650 
shame because again castlemania proves
that<00:06:43.830> the<00:06:43.950> show<00:06:44.130> can<00:06:44.400> still<00:06:44.760> do<00:06:44.910> comedy<00:06:45.420> very

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
that the show can still do comedy very

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.020 
that the show can still do comedy very
effectively<00:06:46.260> but<00:06:46.710> anyway<00:06:47.250> if<00:06:47.490> you<00:06:47.670> can<00:06:47.850> get

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
effectively but anyway if you can get

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.150 
effectively but anyway if you can get
