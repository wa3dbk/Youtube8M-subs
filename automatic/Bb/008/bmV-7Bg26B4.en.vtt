sabio just got a sock controller oh here

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.640 
sabio just got a sock controller oh here
it<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:19.340> got<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.900> guinea<00:00:21.900> pig<00:00:21.990> over<00:00:22.470> there

done<00:01:10.070> with<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:11.060> uh<00:01:11.270> I<00:01:12.490> just<00:01:13.490> have<00:01:13.790> to<00:01:13.910> show

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
done with and uh I just have to show

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.310 
done with and uh I just have to show
it's<00:01:15.380> not<00:01:15.560> modded<00:01:15.910> at<00:01:16.910> all<00:01:17.140> it's<00:01:18.140> not<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:20.320> show

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
it's not modded at all it's not and show

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:41.300 
it's not modded at all it's not and show
it<00:01:21.440> even<00:01:21.650> works<00:01:22.119> switch<00:01:23.119> it<00:01:23.150> up

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.910 

so<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.450> works<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:45.229> well<00:01:46.229> first<00:01:46.649> night

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
so it works and well first night

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.670 
so it works and well first night
probably<00:01:47.430> do<00:01:47.670> an<00:01:47.790> SMD<00:01:48.149> swap<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.079> PS<00:01:49.409> button

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
probably do an SMD swap and a PS button

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.480 
probably do an SMD swap and a PS button
led<00:01:51.229> got<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.320> get<00:01:52.439> rid<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.680> these<00:01:52.829> red<00:01:53.189> little

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
led got to get rid of these red little

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.569 
led got to get rid of these red little
shits<00:01:54.289> I'll<00:01:55.289> probably<00:01:55.470> do<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> little<00:01:56.130> tutorial

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
shits I'll probably do a little tutorial

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:04.179 
shits I'll probably do a little tutorial
on<00:01:57.149> SMBs<00:01:58.080> and<00:02:00.049> other<00:02:01.049> shit<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:02.210> but<00:02:03.210> um

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
on SMBs and other shit like that but um

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.850 
on SMBs and other shit like that but um
this<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.340> going<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.549> be<00:02:05.750> I'll<00:02:06.750> probably<00:02:07.590> take

me about a week I still gotta order some

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.180 
me about a week I still gotta order some
LEDs<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:12.410> some<00:02:13.410> some<00:02:13.980> different<00:02:14.340> colors<00:02:14.670> and

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
LEDs and some some different colors and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.680 
LEDs and some some different colors and
I'll<00:02:17.190> get<00:02:17.340> back<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.910> I'm<00:02:18.150> still<00:02:18.480> not<00:02:18.630> sure

I'll get back to you I'm still not sure

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.630 
I'll get back to you I'm still not sure
I'm<00:02:19.319> going<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.709> put<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:21.470> sick<00:02:22.470> mods<00:02:22.709> fader<00:02:23.160> in<00:02:23.489> it

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
I'm going to put a sick mods fader in it

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.690 
I'm going to put a sick mods fader in it
or<00:02:23.880> i<00:02:23.910> might<00:02:24.239> get<00:02:24.420> them<00:02:25.069> my<00:02:26.069> friend<00:02:26.340> makes<00:02:26.549> a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
or i might get them my friend makes a

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.610 
or i might get them my friend makes a
circuit<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:27.239> uh<00:02:27.739> just<00:02:28.739> just<00:02:29.190> like<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:30.620> just

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
circuit that uh just just like a just

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.920 
circuit that uh just just like a just
like<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.830> sequence<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:33.000> thinking<00:02:33.810> about

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
like a sequence and thinking about

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.380 
like a sequence and thinking about
putting<00:02:34.200> LEDs<00:02:34.530> like<00:02:35.130> all<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.459> way<00:02:35.610> around<00:02:35.730> and

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
putting LEDs like all the way around and

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.530 
putting LEDs like all the way around and
inside<00:02:36.930> here<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.470> what<00:02:38.190> this<00:02:38.700> his<00:02:39.000> chip<00:02:39.360> would

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
inside here and what this his chip would

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.740 
inside here and what this his chip would
do<00:02:39.690> was<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.860> would<00:02:41.040> light<00:02:41.340> like<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.209> one<00:02:42.450> and

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
do was it would light like this one and

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.690 
do was it would light like this one and
then<00:02:42.840> lay<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.349> one<00:02:43.410> bounced<00:02:43.950> out<00:02:44.370> on<00:02:44.519> that

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
then lay that one bounced out on that

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.210 
then lay that one bounced out on that
mound<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.170> start<00:02:46.170> on<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.410> side<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.709> go

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
mound and start on this side and go

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.699 
mound and start on this side and go
around<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.540> kind<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.840> looked<00:02:49.019> like<00:02:49.079> LEDs

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
around so it kind of looked like LEDs

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.530 
around so it kind of looked like LEDs
are<00:02:49.980> just<00:02:50.190> going<00:02:50.459> on<00:02:50.609> and<00:02:50.820> off<00:02:50.910> around<00:02:51.359> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
are just going on and off around the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.210 
are just going on and off around the
whole<00:02:51.690> controller<00:02:52.170> which<00:02:52.620> would<00:02:52.799> be<00:02:52.950> pretty

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
whole controller which would be pretty

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.979 
whole controller which would be pretty
cool<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.519> think<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:54.180> just<00:02:54.239> owe<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:57.510> chips<00:02:57.810> are

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
cool I think you just owe the chips are

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.800 
cool I think you just owe the chips are
kind<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.319> big<00:02:58.850> I'm<00:02:59.850> not<00:03:00.000> sure<00:03:00.180> if<00:03:00.239> I'm<00:03:00.359> fittin

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
kind of big I'm not sure if I'm fittin

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.630 
kind of big I'm not sure if I'm fittin
amilia<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:03.239> handles<00:03:03.660> are<00:03:03.780> not<00:03:03.989> but<00:03:04.739> we<00:03:05.220> can

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
amilia the handles are not but we can

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
amilia the handles are not but we can
try<00:03:06.650> but<00:03:07.650> uh<00:03:08.030> that's<00:03:09.030> pretty<00:03:09.480> much<00:03:09.569> it<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:11.660> see

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
try but uh that's pretty much it so see

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.230 
try but uh that's pretty much it so see
you<00:03:12.720> later<00:03:13.519> love<00:03:14.519> y'all

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240

I<00:03:16.330> did<00:03:17.080> do<00:03:17.770> some<00:03:17.950> disassembly<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:19.440> all<00:03:20.440> my

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
I did do some disassembly of all my

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.800 
I did do some disassembly of all my
whole<00:03:20.860> pieces<00:03:21.160> everywhere<00:03:22.470> buttons<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:24.630> lot<00:03:25.630> of

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
whole pieces everywhere buttons a lot of

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.860 
whole pieces everywhere buttons a lot of
shit<00:03:26.080> and<00:03:27.600> I've<00:03:28.600> already<00:03:29.140> done<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.740> PS<00:03:30.010> button

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
shit and I've already done the PS button

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.080 
shit and I've already done the PS button
and<00:03:31.870> I've<00:03:32.290> clipped<00:03:32.950> some<00:03:33.100> little<00:03:33.460> pieces<00:03:33.700> off

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
and I've clipped some little pieces off

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.970 
and I've clipped some little pieces off
as<00:03:34.510> you<00:03:34.630> can<00:03:34.720> see<00:03:34.930> sort<00:03:35.410> a<00:03:35.530> little<00:03:35.770> piece

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
the white touchpad holy and there's like

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:55.310 
the white touchpad holy and there's like
a<00:03:48.280> close-up<00:03:48.970> of<00:03:49.120> how<00:03:49.300> I<00:03:49.410> put<00:03:50.410> my<00:03:50.560> ladies<00:03:50.980> and

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.740 

then<00:03:56.320> glue<00:03:56.560> I<00:03:57.190> drilled<00:03:57.640> this<00:03:57.760> hole<00:03:57.820> too<00:03:58.330> big<00:03:58.360> it

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
then glue I drilled this hole too big it

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.710 
then glue I drilled this hole too big it
wasn't<00:03:58.960> thinking<00:03:59.320> and<00:03:59.760> so<00:04:00.760> I<00:04:00.790> had<00:04:01.060> a<00:04:01.390> little

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
wasn't thinking and so I had a little

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.040 
wasn't thinking and so I had a little
piece<00:04:01.930> of<00:04:01.960> plastic<00:04:02.530> that<00:04:02.800> I<00:04:03.690> eat<00:04:04.690> that's<00:04:04.900> why

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
piece of plastic that I eat that's why

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.440 
piece of plastic that I eat that's why
there's<00:04:05.380> a<00:04:05.670> electrical<00:04:06.670> tape<00:04:06.880> there<00:04:07.090> there's

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
there's a electrical tape there there's

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.030 
there's a electrical tape there there's
a<00:04:07.830> plastic<00:04:08.830> coat<00:04:10.140> just<00:04:11.140> piece<00:04:11.440> of<00:04:11.620> plastic

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
a plastic coat just piece of plastic

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.180 
a plastic coat just piece of plastic
from<00:04:12.310> my<00:04:12.540> SMD<00:04:13.540> cover<00:04:13.960> and<00:04:14.290> we'll<00:04:14.650> cut<00:04:14.860> off<00:04:15.010> you

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
from my SMD cover and we'll cut off you

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.140 
from my SMD cover and we'll cut off you
see<00:04:15.400> right<00:04:15.550> there<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:17.520> just<00:04:18.520> poked<00:04:19.060> a

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
see right there and I just poked a

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.280 
see right there and I just poked a
little<00:04:19.390> hole<00:04:19.540> with<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:21.180> little<00:04:22.180> exacto<00:04:23.080> knife

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
little hole with a little exacto knife

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.800 
little hole with a little exacto knife
and<00:04:23.650> then<00:04:23.880> she'll<00:04:24.880> be<00:04:25.000> led<00:04:25.300> in<00:04:25.450> there<00:04:25.630> now

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
and then she'll be led in there now

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.150 
and then she'll be led in there now
Itzik<00:04:26.110> here<00:04:26.350> it's<00:04:26.560> always<00:04:26.770> going<00:04:26.890> to<00:04:26.950> be<00:04:27.010> the

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
Itzik here it's always going to be the

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.240 
Itzik here it's always going to be the
same<00:04:27.340> spot<00:04:27.700> and<00:04:28.440> what<00:04:29.440> do<00:04:29.530> you<00:04:29.560> have<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:29.890> do<00:04:30.010> now

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
same spot and what do you have to do now

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.440 
same spot and what do you have to do now
is<00:04:31.140> make<00:04:32.140> a<00:04:32.200> hole<00:04:32.530> you<00:04:33.100> can<00:04:33.250> see<00:04:33.490> how<00:04:33.820> it<00:04:33.970> rises

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
is make a hole you can see how it rises

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.960 
is make a hole you can see how it rises
a<00:04:34.480> bit<00:04:34.750> a<00:04:34.990> little<00:04:35.290> circle<00:04:36.190> you<00:04:36.400> got<00:04:36.550> to<00:04:36.640> cut<00:04:36.850> it

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
a bit a little circle you got to cut it

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.920 
a bit a little circle you got to cut it
like<00:04:37.120> pretty<00:04:37.450> much<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.660> full<00:04:38.050> size<00:04:38.380> of<00:04:38.620> that

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
like pretty much a full size of that

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.070 
like pretty much a full size of that
what<00:04:40.930> I<00:04:40.960> use<00:04:41.380> is<00:04:41.950> I<00:04:42.130> just<00:04:42.270> burn<00:04:43.270> it<00:04:43.300> with<00:04:43.900> my

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
what I use is I just burn it with my

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.890 
what I use is I just burn it with my
soldering<00:04:44.500> iron<00:04:44.820> I<00:04:45.820> started<00:04:46.510> off<00:04:46.660> with<00:04:46.840> a

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
soldering iron I started off with a

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.200 
soldering iron I started off with a
knife<00:04:47.260> just<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:47.770> get<00:04:48.010> like<00:04:48.310> so<00:04:48.580> I<00:04:48.640> can<00:04:48.820> push<00:04:49.060> the

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
knife just to get like so I can push the

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.320 
knife just to get like so I can push the
solder<00:04:49.480> iron<00:04:49.660> in<00:04:50.790> that's<00:04:51.790> probably<00:04:52.210> the

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
solder iron in that's probably the

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330 
solder iron in that's probably the
easiest<00:04:52.360> way<00:04:52.930> other<00:04:53.350> than<00:04:53.500> having<00:04:54.010> a<00:04:54.100> hole

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
easiest way other than having a hole

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.120 
easiest way other than having a hole
punch<00:04:54.640> which<00:04:55.000> I<00:04:55.150> can't<00:04:55.810> find<00:04:56.170> right<00:04:56.440> now<00:04:56.620> just

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
punch which I can't find right now just

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.100 
punch which I can't find right now just
kind<00:04:57.370> of<00:04:57.400> pissed<00:04:57.640> off<00:04:57.880> about<00:04:58.120> that<00:04:58.300> actually

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
kind of pissed off about that actually

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.640 
kind of pissed off about that actually
because<00:04:59.590> a<00:05:00.480> hole<00:05:01.480> punch<00:05:01.720> like<00:05:01.990> works<00:05:02.320> almost

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
because a hole punch like works almost

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.850 
because a hole punch like works almost
exact<00:05:03.690> just<00:05:04.690> like<00:05:04.810> a<00:05:04.840> one<00:05:05.110> hole<00:05:05.350> punch<00:05:05.650> you

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
exact just like a one hole punch you

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.450 
exact just like a one hole punch you
just<00:05:06.100> grip<00:05:06.550> it<00:05:06.730> a<00:05:06.870> nice<00:05:07.870> beautiful<00:05:08.230> hole<00:05:08.530> then

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
just grip it a nice beautiful hole then

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.060 
just grip it a nice beautiful hole then
now<00:05:09.670> I<00:05:09.700> have<00:05:10.060> to<00:05:10.210> use<00:05:10.330> a<00:05:10.360> fucking<00:05:10.630> side

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
now I have to use a fucking side

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.020 
now I have to use a fucking side
so<00:05:13.960> yeah<00:05:14.960> and<00:05:15.440> I<00:05:15.980> was<00:05:16.130> going<00:05:16.280> to<00:05:16.340> do<00:05:16.400> a<00:05:16.430> voltage

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
so yeah and I was going to do a voltage

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.800 
so yeah and I was going to do a voltage
on<00:05:18.160> how<00:05:19.160> much<00:05:19.280> voltage<00:05:19.520> you<00:05:20.000> get<00:05:20.240> out<00:05:20.750> right

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
on how much voltage you get out right

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.690 
on how much voltage you get out right
here<00:05:21.320> and<00:05:21.590> right<00:05:22.310> here<00:05:24.040> I'll<00:05:25.040> plug<00:05:25.310> that<00:05:25.490> in

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
here and right here I'll plug that in

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.240 
here and right here I'll plug that in
after<00:05:26.180> him<00:05:26.630> once<00:05:27.050> i<00:05:27.200> got<00:05:27.350> my<00:05:27.500> bold<00:05:27.710> meter<00:05:27.980> off

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
after him once i got my bold meter off

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.500 
after him once i got my bold meter off
the<00:05:28.280> floor<00:05:30.040> time<00:05:31.040> i'm<00:05:31.880> probably<00:05:32.180> actually

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
the floor time i'm probably actually

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.990 
the floor time i'm probably actually
going<00:05:32.720> to<00:05:32.840> end<00:05:33.050> up<00:05:33.140> painting<00:05:33.440> this<00:05:33.710> white<00:05:34.670> and

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
going to end up painting this white and

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.430 
going to end up painting this white and
let's<00:05:35.600> not<00:05:35.720> like<00:05:35.900> some<00:05:36.170> blue<00:05:36.350> graphics<00:05:37.190> and

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
let's not like some blue graphics and

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.950 
let's not like some blue graphics and
some<00:05:39.440> little<00:05:39.650> custom<00:05:40.010> little<00:05:40.970> pieces<00:05:41.510> going

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
some little custom little pieces going

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.570 
some little custom little pieces going
to<00:05:42.020> put<00:05:42.170> in<00:05:42.320> and<00:05:44.620> so<00:05:45.620> i<00:05:45.740> gotta<00:05:46.010> start<00:05:46.340> drilling

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
to put in and so i gotta start drilling

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.920 
to put in and so i gotta start drilling
i'm<00:05:47.000> gonna<00:05:47.150> do<00:05:47.240> all<00:05:47.390> my<00:05:48.610> LED<00:05:49.610> holes<00:05:49.880> first<00:05:50.300> all

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
i'm gonna do all my LED holes first all

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.040 
i'm gonna do all my LED holes first all
the<00:05:50.990> way<00:05:51.260> around<00:05:52.240> I'm<00:05:53.240> astronaut<00:05:53.780> I'm<00:05:53.900> sure

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
the way around I'm astronaut I'm sure

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.770 
the way around I'm astronaut I'm sure
how<00:05:54.169> many<00:05:54.230> able<00:05:54.590> to<00:05:54.680> do<00:05:54.860> I'm<00:05:55.130> just<00:05:55.250> gonna<00:05:55.780> look

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
how many able to do I'm just gonna look

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.530 
how many able to do I'm just gonna look
at<00:05:57.050> how<00:05:57.800> far<00:05:58.130> apart<00:05:58.250> and<00:05:58.790> it's<00:05:59.150> just<00:05:59.330> going<00:05:59.510> to

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
at how far apart and it's just going to

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.680 
at how far apart and it's just going to
go<00:05:59.630> all<00:05:59.870> the<00:05:59.900> way<00:06:00.260> around<00:06:00.380> to<00:06:01.220> the<00:06:01.880> inside<00:06:02.240> so

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
go all the way around to the inside so
