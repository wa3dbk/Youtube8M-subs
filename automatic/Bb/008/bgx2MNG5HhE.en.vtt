00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
step one be sure to find a sealing space

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.160 
step one be sure to find a sealing space

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
large enough for your boat then using a

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.170 
large enough for your boat then using a

eye lags four inches apart if you're

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.060 
eye lags four inches apart if you're
using<00:00:49.210> a<00:00:49.360> parallel<00:00:49.690> ceiling<00:00:50.170> beam<00:00:50.350> you<00:00:50.890> can

using a parallel ceiling beam you can

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.770 
using a parallel ceiling beam you can
use<00:00:51.190> approximate<00:00:51.820> measurements<00:00:52.120> in<00:00:52.479> this

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
use approximate measurements in this

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.410 
use approximate measurements in this
case<00:00:52.960> approximately<00:00:53.589> 48<00:00:53.949> or<00:00:54.489> if<00:00:55.059> you're<00:00:55.239> using

increments of 24 inches in this case 48
inches<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:02.530> next<00:01:02.799> step<00:01:03.010> is<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.400> pre-drill

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
inches the next step is to pre-drill

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.450 
inches the next step is to pre-drill
your<00:01:04.180> eye<00:01:04.210> like<00:01:04.540> holes<00:01:04.839> using<00:01:05.409> a<00:01:05.470> drill<00:01:05.799> and<00:01:05.979> a

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
your eye like holes using a drill and a

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:15.380 
your eye like holes using a drill and a
7<00:01:06.880> and<00:01:07.060> 32<00:01:07.600> inch<00:01:07.810> drill<00:01:08.170> bit

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.670 

it's<00:01:16.390> important<00:01:16.870> to<00:01:16.960> note<00:01:17.110> that<00:01:17.140> you<00:01:17.410> need<00:01:17.560> to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
it's important to note that you need to

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.470 
it's important to note that you need to
be<00:01:17.800> drilling<00:01:18.070> into<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.790> ceiling<00:01:19.150> beam<00:01:19.330> and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
be drilling into the ceiling beam and

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.390 
be drilling into the ceiling beam and
not<00:01:19.600> just<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.110> sheetrock<00:01:20.350> so<00:01:21.070> you<00:01:21.160> can

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
not just the sheetrock so you can

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:38.810 
not just the sheetrock so you can
achieve<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.820> proper<00:01:22.060> weight<00:01:22.300> capacity

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.550 

the<00:01:39.820> next<00:01:40.090> step<00:01:40.270> is<00:01:40.510> to<00:01:40.690> screw<00:01:40.990> your<00:01:41.140> I<00:01:41.200> lags

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
the next step is to screw your I lags

00:01:41.560 --> 00:02:04.760 
the next step is to screw your I lags
into<00:01:42.159> the<00:01:42.250> beam

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.770 

be<00:02:05.340> sure<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.520> your<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.240> holes<00:02:06.539> are

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
be sure that your I like holes are

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.479 
be sure that your I like holes are
facing<00:02:07.079> each<00:02:07.380> other<00:02:07.619> as<00:02:07.890> pictured<00:02:10.160> if<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.370> are

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
facing each other as pictured if you are

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.460 
facing each other as pictured if you are
using<00:02:11.670> one<00:02:12.090> ceiling<00:02:12.540> beam<00:02:12.720> attach<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
using one ceiling beam attach the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.009 
using one ceiling beam attach the
shackle<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.220> outside<00:02:14.819> I<00:02:15.090> lag<00:02:15.420> if<00:02:15.690> you're

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
shackle to the outside I lag if you're

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.050 
shackle to the outside I lag if you're
using<00:02:16.170> multiple<00:02:16.410> ceiling<00:02:16.950> beams<00:02:17.160> adapter

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
using multiple ceiling beams adapter

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.940 
using multiple ceiling beams adapter
shackle<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.569> either<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.080> left<00:02:19.290> or<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.620> right

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
shackle to either the left or the right

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.850 
shackle to either the left or the right
I<00:02:20.129> lag<00:02:20.489> then<00:02:21.090> put<00:02:21.510> your<00:02:21.690> idler<00:02:21.930> pulley<00:02:22.290> on<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
I lag then put your idler pulley on the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.150 
I lag then put your idler pulley on the
shackle<00:02:24.019> attach<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.260> rope<00:02:25.440> clips<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:26.040> the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
shackle attach the rope clips to the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:36.750 
shackle attach the rope clips to the
remaining<00:02:26.459> I<00:02:26.700> legs

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.640 

then<00:02:37.760> thread<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.180> lead<00:02:38.330> line<00:02:38.569> up<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.290> over

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
then thread the lead line up and over

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:52.090 
then thread the lead line up and over
the<00:02:39.739> idler<00:02:40.040> pulley

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.250 

your<00:02:52.670> ceiling<00:02:53.030> setup<00:02:53.360> should<00:02:53.540> look<00:02:53.780> just<00:02:53.810> like

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
your ceiling setup should look just like

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:16.480 
your ceiling setup should look just like
this<00:02:54.440> when<00:02:55.400> it's<00:02:55.550> done

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.950 

next<00:03:17.490> you<00:03:17.610> need<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.910> attach<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.420> suspension

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
next you need to attach the suspension

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:27.290 
next you need to attach the suspension
strap<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.590> your<00:03:19.620> boat<00:03:25.370> thread<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.490> end<00:03:26.520> up<00:03:26.940> and

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
strap to your boat thread the end up and

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.760 
strap to your boat thread the end up and
through<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.690> cam<00:03:27.870> buckle<00:03:28.080> leaving<00:03:28.560> some

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
through the cam buckle leaving some

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.620 
through the cam buckle leaving some
slack<00:03:29.100> grab<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.150> bottom

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
slack grab the bottom

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.810 
slack grab the bottom
take<00:03:31.080> it<00:03:31.230> up<00:03:31.410> through<00:03:31.800> that<00:03:31.950> center<00:03:32.340> ring<00:03:32.580> to

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
take it up through that center ring to

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.790 
take it up through that center ring to
make<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.030> loop<00:03:33.270> and<00:03:33.510> attach<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.710> ratchet

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
make a loop and attach the ratchet

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:43.700 
make a loop and attach the ratchet
pulley<00:03:41.540> you<00:03:42.540> want<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.780> get<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.050> ring<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.530> the

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
pulley you want to get the ring and the

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.170 
pulley you want to get the ring and the
ratchet<00:03:44.100> pulley<00:03:44.310> as<00:03:44.520> centered<00:03:44.940> as<00:03:45.090> possible

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
ratchet pulley as centered as possible

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.120 
ratchet pulley as centered as possible
so<00:03:45.960> you'll<00:03:46.260> need<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.590> do<00:03:46.710> some<00:03:46.740> minor

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
so you'll need to do some minor

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.199 
so you'll need to do some minor
adjusting<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:49.370> then<00:03:50.370> tighten<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.760> down<00:03:50.820> nice

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
adjusting and then tighten it down nice
