00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 package hello to all welcome this is my 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.319
 cause to the mic and again and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.880
 alright i'll make you a video and 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.790
 well as I do for the wcs 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.020
 europe for the gsl and for the iem 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.449
 toronto and good preview is in 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.449
 level compared to what happens in 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.949
 wss america this one so it's not 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.769
 because it's the American continent 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.960
 that it is a continent with a level 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.480
 lower because in fact if you 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.520
 look what's happening in america in 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.309
 this moment well it does not look like 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.250
 really to wcs america since we have 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.559
 a large majority of Asians from 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.300
 korea especially who are present and 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.670
 who came to conquer 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.110
 so why are so many Koreans 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.110
 simply because a lot of 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.989
 Korean people made the decision to go into exile 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.870
 in europe and even more in the united states 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.590
 because still beats and the competition 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.079
 is rougher 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.699
 we have less competition other than 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.030
 gsl and pro official competitions 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.100
 league 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.220
 to win cash prize she is everything 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.250
 what is dreamhack all that is 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.600
 america event is a red bull type 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.820
 are not accessible or little 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.400
 accessible by level players 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.409
 lower as to scarlett or a Czech 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.080
 or an art that would be completely 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.820
 invisible in korea and who arrive in 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.650
 the final phases of wcs in america 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.689
 we can not at all blame them for 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.119
 do it and suddenly it does not 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.500
 to increase the level so we will talk 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:34.049
 quickly from dws america of which has 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.970
 been done and what will be done so 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.170
 we had the first eight faces so the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.619
 double six america it's the same 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.500
 structure that the gsl or that the wss 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.540
 europe you have a package fire 1 there 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 where we come in if we won the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.720
 caliph elsewhere we arrive in the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.890
 challenger and there as in the wcs 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.409
 europe you have a bo5 against a player 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.610
 at random from the first league so 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.380
 in fact you have players who falls 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.180
 of the first league and the players who 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.310
 have been climbing since the challenger since 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.399
 kui fire all that is found in the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.670
 challenger and so you have some 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.229
 players who will compete and at each 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.450
 once a player from the first 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.550
 league who retrograde and challenger 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.020
 to see playing 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.730
 against a player who comes from 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.820
 qualifiers elsewhere who qualified and 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.920
 so that will give dbo5 and if you win 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.840
 your old bag you go to 1st league 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.630
 if you lose your bo5 you are 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.620
 relegated and you have to go back through the 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.940
 qualifiers elsewhere in the season 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.240
 next so 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.880
 at the end of these two sets challenger 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.320
 league we had 32 skilled players who 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.790
 so have played in eight phases of hens 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.100
 in a pool phase hours 8 pool 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.680
 so is in the group a it's silly 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.070
 an enigma that have imposed themselves arthur has 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.880
 disappointed that we gave rather a top 2 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:52.220
 Korean in this cut grouped y 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.420
 accuses and jim the Chinese player so the 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.100
 two koreans there who did not 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.630
 qualified after that it's not Korean's 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.370
 ouf senestis which is more or less 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.090
 recruits for retirees in coach mode in 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.400
 more and alicia who who is really the 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.500
 player who has disappointed in this hen 1 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.840
 then group 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.940
 group c was pretty hard because we 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.290
 had polt so I really it's them 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.470
 who are qualified there was still 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.610
 max is d oz who are still beefy 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.959
 and so it's polt and so I have that are 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.800
 Qualified I am very happy for Paul 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.570
 you group Czech epic korean 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.310
 baby have naturally qualified for 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.870
 detract from the eggs of the American 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.870
 illusions and Chinese that I do not 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.940
 do not know anyway shana group e on 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.040
 saw the victory of violet and huck by 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.380
 compared to a revival revival day has 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.060
 disappointed Korean instinct that exiled into 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.310
 america to play at aeg 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.209
 but since at his level to really 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.470
 go down 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.930
 he was very good at the time he was 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.810
 again and today he finished last of 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.720
 hen in wcs good behind had really 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.610
 not terrible then you had the 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.230
 f group with art and scarlett who get 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.790
 are a feature imposed at the expense of 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.330
 sites and toodming Chinese players 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.980
 I am happy for scarlett in particular 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.470
 sidney site it was only a customer enough 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.880
 powerful and happy with the performance of 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.110
 scarlett because if he is a mine 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.959
 all mixed for one of the very best 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.790
 Chinese players so scarlett who 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.640
 imposed themselves it's very good then 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.669
 victory about natural size 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.100
 already followed by liquid hero not to 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.120
 confuse with cj hero aliquid hero 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.580
 is still less strong than its 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.380
 generals to the detriment of the Indre 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.850
 the normal Canadian iss cramped the 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.590
 chinese good 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.270
 finally good butter and major have finished 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.010
 first of their hen compared to 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.080
 this but puck in the group h 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.270
 so again that considering 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.270
 the shape of majors and bombers it remains 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.650
 good butter logical result 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.960
 so that's what was played the hero 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.290
 32 and now we'll start soon 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.360
 and indeed the dates are not 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.860
 announced on teamliquid so this will be 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.740
 most likely in early September 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.770
 near at the same time as wss europe 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.630
 abc and d groups so you see it 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.550
 remains a lot more Americans of the 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.560
 shot in the group at on to violet 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.330
 scarlatti agde herald so if I 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.840
 had to clear favorites in this 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.750
 group 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.500
 well I would already put the three to violate 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.780
 Scarlett Heroes D Clear a top 2 among 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.100
 these three players it would be difficult I 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.510
 think there is a bus going to lose but that 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.790
 was a good surprise so far so 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.130
 we could create the surprise but that 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.640
 would surprise me that they enter purple 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.620
 scarlett hero go I would say maybe 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.270
 I may go violet 0 1 to 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.100
 detriment scarlett but good scarlett 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.440
 can largely do it it's really 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.360
 not inaccessible for for m next 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.340
 group b huge and so you already have pic 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.010
 baby that's really I think the 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.420
 highest group of four since 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.800
 these four players who are really 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.670
 very very strong and four players who 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:46.850
 for me could finish top1 wcs since 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:48.020
 pic baby has won the last wcs talent 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.010
 and already you know who it is when 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.420
 same size already here is a beefy lol 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.030
 I have it is super strong and yoon 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.030
 so also clear I think you have 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.440
 already is given favorite in this hen 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.850
 but they would have been given ultra 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.430
 favorite in any other hen 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.680
 there he's just favorites and the three 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:10.210
 others it's really very tight 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.699
 I will put you limit so I have 2nd 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.729
 maybe I have so ouyoun big baby 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:18.009
 could be last but these jo 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:19.680
 then group c with tenk 10000 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:21.910
 bombers and rock 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.830
 perso the favorite i would say it's good 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.780
 butter but I think that cech can 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.250
 really make coffee because sheikh 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.160
 he is a former warcraft iii player 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.750
 for those who do not know him and 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.729
 it took a long time to break through a lot of 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.889
 time to break into starcraft 2 he was 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:37.259
 elf player on warcraft iii time in 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:40.150
 time he plays orc 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:45.569
 but it took a lot of time to 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.569
 break through but I really think that 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.080
 announcement is not the same Czech a game 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.360
 says shit it's not at all 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.889
 it's not at all the same check I see 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.120
 panting idea it's not him 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:07:00.580
 ok well hey it's not him mea culpa 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.900
 but we 'll play I saw it's game 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.759
 recently double it's it's me 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.840
 impressed 

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:06.099
 I thought I was more 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.900
 looking at it was the old Czech 

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:09.460
 but directly no it's not him 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.720
 so check bombers for favorites 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.229
 for me but jim could create the 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.330
 surprise 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:15.190
 after up I do not put it anyway 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.199
 favorites not favorite at all in this 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.330
 Czech hen 1 and bombers for my 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:22.630
 then favored group d constituted 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.729
 only teran that's good at 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.409
 the less they all have apart after a 

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:29.740
 only match up is the tvt they have that at 

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:31.690
 train in tvt for this couple from 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.940
 blow they'll all do it a paul tni 

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.259
 bart major good I think the day in 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.810
 below in this group c free 

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:40.750
 of course the favorite player is

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.009
