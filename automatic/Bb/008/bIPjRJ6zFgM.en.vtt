Japan<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:31.450> quite<00:01:31.660> sure<00:01:31.690> what<00:01:32.050> the<00:01:32.140> stars<00:01:32.410> mean

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
Japan not quite sure what the stars mean

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.950 
Japan not quite sure what the stars mean
though<00:01:32.920> I'm<00:01:33.340> pretty<00:01:33.850> sure<00:01:33.970> it<00:01:34.180> might<00:01:34.420> be<00:01:34.630> a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
though I'm pretty sure it might be a

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.090 
though I'm pretty sure it might be a
might<00:01:35.170> have<00:01:35.290> something<00:01:35.620> to<00:01:35.680> do<00:01:35.770> with<00:01:35.800> the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
might have something to do with the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.770 
might have something to do with the
rarity<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:41.550> it<00:01:42.550> also<00:01:42.700> looks<00:01:43.060> like<00:01:43.330> on<00:01:43.510> some<00:01:43.690> of

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
rarity and it also looks like on some of

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.560 
rarity and it also looks like on some of
these<00:01:43.840> cards<00:01:44.200> there<00:01:44.470> are<00:01:44.590> two<00:01:44.800> elements

these cards there are two elements

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.490 
these cards there are two elements
rather<00:01:46.570> than<00:01:46.900> just<00:01:47.110> one<00:01:48.930> which<00:01:49.930> allow<00:01:50.260> you<00:01:50.320> to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.460 
rather than just one which allow you to
win<00:01:50.740> those<00:01:50.950> small<00:01:51.520> car<00:01:52.030> duels<00:01:52.330> that<00:01:53.050> happened
