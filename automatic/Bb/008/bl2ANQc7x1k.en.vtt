00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.810
 why decomposed too much 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.160
 these two fingers are always in the same place there is only the index that 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.659
 will ride ropes again 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.659
 it's a fishing art that plays like that 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:35.130
 everything is played the same way 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.120
 we go up the down one notch 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.620
 still a time 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.490
 and for the last teaser the middle finger on the 6th place of the second string 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.420
 just before the chorus is a small variant 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.350
 we must return to their third album 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.320
 play twice 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.320
 I played twice the first 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.400
 for the first part of the solo this is the first chord 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.610
 the first time there is a taboo 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.610
 14th wrist per year 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.310
 for the second part of the solo you have to do that 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.080
 there is a dead here 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.540
 for the last part it's a little more complicated 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.540
 4 strait 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.270
 the agreement of art will not be used m 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:22.479
 to take it back without distortion 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.299
 these are just ordinary hogs 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.769
 the first agreement 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.899
 the second agreement 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.959
 the third 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:08.729
 and the last 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.009
 for the rif it must be done 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.819
 the only exception is when he says in guatemala and war in the end 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.379
 we must stay on these two agreements 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:45.219
 the couplet playing better than these 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.639
 it is played only with cord 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:14.559
 no 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.209
 Yes 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.789
 m 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.039
 it's always the same except for the last time you play it 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.039
 like this 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.120
 dour and on the third then on the first 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.169
 the song ends with this agreement
