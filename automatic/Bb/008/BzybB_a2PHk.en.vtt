00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.020
 he succeeded in his dream 

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:12.919
 we respect or 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.280
 yes, but not already 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.379
 Small discover bigger 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.379
 the league calls for the 164 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.639
 The list would be seen worldwide 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.180
 Bowles Dr must on many 1000 euros even if we have to do a good job 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.780
 Emden 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.220
 my grandpa had already had it for me 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.740
 he has started three cows with three cows after he has twelve cows 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.890
 my dad then continued that percent in the fifties 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.890
 and then had up to 35 for 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.950
 and today 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.840
 Now we have stagnated our four folders 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.630
 he recalls the year here has finished 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.689
 Chaos will spread next to buildings percent to 5 degrees 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:11.540
 all 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.540
 and almost everyone 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.959
 Bonn 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.409
 We want a lot of milk on this tour for parents 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.529
 and with that in their top to the 50 meters or 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:53.479
 even 60 liters come a day because the cow has to eat a lot 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.329
 to produce a lot of milk 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.519
 here with us knows how at the time 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:02:59.569
 about from 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.989
 50 to 55 kilos 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.269
 fresh dimensions that then corresponds 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.759
 22 24 5 on the water 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.220
 and if you are then in a heap 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.789
 that is gentle amount 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:15.569
 that's an increase of 44 percent want 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.609
 the feelings were great we expect from the IFA 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.130
 how exactly these amounts of groundbait can rip open 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.370
 if that fits 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.750
 then we really have high performance cows and can be efficient 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.750
 Produces milk 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.879
 the Kokang itself 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:40.150
 Here a 25 centimeters thick filled the boxing legend filled with sawdust 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.809
 it's a real comeback, so to speak 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:47.049
 and 2 for that also really well we can really relax 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:51.749
 and can also spend up to 15 hours a day here in this 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:54.079
 Spend a total of box 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.799
 and I believe that it is that in their book we can all form them 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.919
 to have happy and healthy cows 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.919
 but then it is also glad 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.860
 while we have quite a lot been down already fell out 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.670
 often become 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.550
 that changed the animals 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.449
 the Dr would like to have in the milking parlor 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.430
 So here is a wide basin 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.199
 and that places tore them off 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.689
 hung high 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:38.409
 and even the age is also one percent very severe 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.039
 Central Bank 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.389
 and she dash placements down here is simply on the market 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:44.160
 we can 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.520
 with such 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.850
 Tehran may also have been producing our milk the OECD that is 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:53.990
 Therefore, after the markets really folded really empty 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.179
 and so were no problems so it's production office 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.990
 conscription and pleasure 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.020
 we are now in the backlog that is, so to speak, the centerpiece 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:25.080
 this feeling is 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.860
 Here we have a power output of about 160 to 180 for 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.219
 and that's exactly what matters 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.860
 that we reach this train namely a good one 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.900
 Mel decay 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.699
 Percent below that is 11 that may take place here in this area 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:43.809
 in number 

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:45.409
 and if you still 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:50.190
 He averages around 11 to 34 to 35 feet 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.910
 the cow and day he notices then makes farming and milk production 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.910
 the professional fun
