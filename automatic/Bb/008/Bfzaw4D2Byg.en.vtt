00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
and on this TV you would have to use a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.160 
and on this TV you would have to use a
torque<00:01:21.630> screw

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
torque screw

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.380 
torque screw
I<00:01:22.200> mean<00:01:22.740> torque<00:01:22.950> bit<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.880> get<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.180> out<00:01:24.360> of

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
I mean torque bit we get that out of

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.960 
I mean torque bit we get that out of
like<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> automotive<00:01:25.439> store<00:01:25.790> it's<00:01:26.790> pretty

like a automotive store it's pretty

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.090 
like a automotive store it's pretty
cheap<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.420> like<00:01:27.540> under<00:01:27.750> ten<00:01:27.930> bucks<00:01:28.009> but<00:01:29.009> it

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
cheap it's like under ten bucks but it

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.960 
cheap it's like under ten bucks but it
looks<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> star<00:01:29.759> shaped<00:01:30.479> bit<00:01:31.880> just<00:01:32.880> like

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
looks like a star shaped bit just like

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.520 
looks like a star shaped bit just like
that<00:01:33.060> and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.380 

see<00:01:38.130> how<00:01:38.220> its<00:01:38.400> torque<00:01:38.700> shaped<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.300> a

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
see how its torque shaped it's like a

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.060 
see how its torque shaped it's like a
star-shaped<00:01:40.310> screw<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.090> get<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.420> bit<00:01:43.350> at

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
star-shaped screw so you get that bit at

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.340 
star-shaped screw so you get that bit at
the<00:01:44.250> automotive<00:01:44.610> store<00:01:45.320> right<00:01:46.320> there

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
the automotive store right there

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.140 
the automotive store right there
sometimes<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.160> can<00:01:47.280> use<00:01:47.400> a<00:01:47.430> small<00:01:47.940> a<00:01:48.090> small

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
sometimes you can use a small a small

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.240 
sometimes you can use a small a small
flat-head<00:01:48.810> screwdriver<00:01:48.990> squeeze<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.070> there

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
flat-head screwdriver squeeze in there

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.430 
flat-head screwdriver squeeze in there
should<00:01:50.880> work<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.120> the<00:01:51.540> same<00:01:51.570> just<00:01:52.350> be

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
should work just the same just be

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.920 
should work just the same just be
careful<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.800> don't<00:01:52.950> break<00:01:53.100> your<00:01:53.930> flathead

years<00:02:05.580> old<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:06.930> see<00:02:07.080> it's<00:02:07.229> very<00:02:07.440> busy

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
years old and you can see it's very busy

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.479 
years old and you can see it's very busy
and<00:02:09.110> that's<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.320> video<00:02:10.590> board<00:02:11.190> right<00:02:11.459> there

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
and that's the video board right there

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.580 
and that's the video board right there
as<00:02:12.270> where<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.810> plug<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.020> all<00:02:13.230> your<00:02:13.380> video

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
as where you plug in all your video

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.530 
as where you plug in all your video
inputs<00:02:13.980> there's<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.730> power<00:02:14.940> supply<00:02:15.270> right

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
inputs there's a power supply right

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.930 
inputs there's a power supply right
there<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.500> plug<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.190> power<00:02:17.340> right<00:02:17.790> in

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
there so you plug in the power right in

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.020 
there so you plug in the power right in
here<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.590> then<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.860> goes<00:02:20.400> right<00:02:20.520> there

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
here and then it goes right there

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.880 
here and then it goes right there
right<00:02:21.510> next<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.170> fuse<00:02:22.590> that's

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
right next to that is the fuse that's

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.280 
right next to that is the fuse that's
the<00:02:22.980> power<00:02:23.190> coming<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.300> power<00:02:24.480> supply<00:02:24.810> and

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
the power coming in the power supply and

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.460 
the power coming in the power supply and
converts<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.950> AC<00:02:26.130> into<00:02:26.580> DC<00:02:26.870> right<00:02:27.870> here<00:02:28.170> it

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
converts the AC into DC right here it

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.050 
converts the AC into DC right here it
looks<00:02:28.650> like<00:02:28.680> someone<00:02:29.040> worked<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.640> that's

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
looks like someone worked on it that's

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.870 
looks like someone worked on it that's
why<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.239> see<00:02:30.480> these<00:02:30.630> weird<00:02:30.959> capacitors<00:02:31.880> you

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
why you see these weird capacitors you

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.630 
why you see these weird capacitors you
know<00:02:32.940> off<00:02:33.420> on<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.750> side<00:02:33.980> taped<00:02:34.980> up<00:02:35.220> on<00:02:35.400> the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
know off on the side taped up on the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.420 
know off on the side taped up on the
heatsink<00:02:36.300> which<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:36.900> pretty<00:02:37.110> hot<00:02:37.380> heatsink<00:02:38.070> so

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
heatsink which is pretty hot heatsink so

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.729 
heatsink which is pretty hot heatsink so
this<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.090> typically<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.959> want<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.140> do<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.530> I

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
this is typically you want to do that I

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.160 
this is typically you want to do that I
didn't<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.820> was<00:02:42.000> an<00:02:42.120> old<00:02:42.269> repair<00:02:42.480> from<00:02:42.959> like

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
didn't this was an old repair from like

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.120 
didn't this was an old repair from like
years<00:02:43.380> ago<00:02:44.450> so<00:02:45.450> anyway<00:02:45.810> if<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.680> look<00:02:46.890> right

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
years ago so anyway if you look right

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.650 
years ago so anyway if you look right
around<00:02:47.459> here<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.940> middle<00:02:48.980> you'll<00:02:49.980> see<00:02:50.340> a

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
around here in the middle you'll see a

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
around here in the middle you'll see a
bulge<00:02:51.660> capacitor<00:02:52.730> what<00:02:53.730> if<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.850> see<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.680> the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
bulge capacitor what if you see that the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.110 
bulge capacitor what if you see that the
one<00:02:55.860> on<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.070> left<00:02:57.019> and<00:02:58.019> that<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.130> location

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
one on the left and that is location

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.660 
one on the left and that is location
number<00:03:00.480> C<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.010> C<00:03:02.160> stands<00:03:02.430> for<00:03:02.519> our

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
number C and the C stands for our

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.960 
number C and the C stands for our
capacitor<00:03:03.450> C<00:03:03.930> six<00:03:04.410> six<00:03:04.739> one<00:03:05.040> that's<00:03:05.880> the

it's Samsung power supply C and that's
the<00:03:18.510> part<00:03:18.780> number<00:03:19.079> right<00:03:19.290> there<00:03:19.530> on<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.220> you

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
the part number right there on it you

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.330 
the part number right there on it you
see<00:03:20.579> that<00:03:21.560> so<00:03:22.560> here's<00:03:22.739> another<00:03:22.950> thing<00:03:23.100> here's

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
see that so here's another thing here's

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.979 
see that so here's another thing here's
another<00:03:23.910> capacitor<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.450> don't<00:03:24.600> know<00:03:24.660> what<00:03:24.810> kind

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
another capacitor I don't know what kind

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.120 
another capacitor I don't know what kind
of<00:03:25.019> technician<00:03:25.500> did<00:03:25.620> this<00:03:25.799> but<00:03:25.980> they

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
of technician did this but they

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.250 
of technician did this but they
shouldn't<00:03:26.340> have<00:03:26.400> done<00:03:26.610> it<00:03:26.730> like<00:03:26.850> that<00:03:27.260> they

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
shouldn't have done it like that they

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.170 
shouldn't have done it like that they
should<00:03:28.530> have<00:03:28.680> just<00:03:29.160> put<00:03:29.370> in<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.549> capacitors

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
should have just put in the capacitors

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.490 
should have just put in the capacitors
right<00:03:30.450> in<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.660> spots<00:03:30.930> where<00:03:31.110> they<00:03:31.230> work

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
right in the spots where they work

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.190 
right in the spots where they work
should<00:03:31.829> be<00:03:32.010> but<00:03:32.820> I<00:03:32.850> guess<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.269> capacitors

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
should be but I guess the capacitors

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.680 
should be but I guess the capacitors
popped<00:03:34.560> in<00:03:34.799> there<00:03:34.980> because<00:03:35.130> this<00:03:36.030> heatsink<00:03:36.570> is

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
popped in there because this heatsink is

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.910 
popped in there because this heatsink is
hot<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.079> this<00:03:37.260> heatsink<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.100> hot<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:39.920> these

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
hot and this heatsink is hot and these

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.470 
hot and this heatsink is hot and these
capacitors<00:03:41.489> are<00:03:41.670> heat<00:03:41.880> temperature

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
capacitors are heat temperature

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.100 
capacitors are heat temperature
sensitive<00:03:42.959> so<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.980> probably<00:03:44.220> caused<00:03:45.030> them<00:03:45.930> to

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
sensitive so it probably caused them to

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.369 
sensitive so it probably caused them to
get<00:03:46.230> baked<00:03:46.530> faster<00:03:47.040> than<00:03:47.190> they<00:03:47.340> should<00:03:47.610> and

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
get baked faster than they should and

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.940 
get baked faster than they should and
capacitors<00:03:49.379> popped

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
capacitors popped

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.449 
capacitors popped
you<00:03:50.790> know<00:03:51.200> within<00:03:52.200> their<00:03:52.440> lifespan<00:03:52.920> under<00:03:53.340> the

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
you know within their lifespan under the

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.390 
you know within their lifespan under the
lifespan<00:03:53.790> they<00:03:54.420> should<00:03:54.630> have<00:03:54.750> lasted<00:03:55.140> so<00:03:56.099> the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
lifespan they should have lasted so the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.010 
lifespan they should have lasted so the
part<00:03:56.670> here's<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.300> model<00:03:57.599> number<00:03:57.810> right<00:03:57.989> there

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
part here's the model number right there

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.199 
part here's the model number right there
for<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.709> part<00:03:59.280> board<00:03:59.610> it<00:04:00.450> shined<00:04:01.230> light<00:04:01.410> lower

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
for the part board it shined light lower

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.699 
for the part board it shined light lower
right<00:04:03.209> there<00:04:03.540> that's<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.110> part<00:04:04.440> number<00:04:04.680> for

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
right there that's the part number for

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.570 
right there that's the part number for
the<00:04:05.010> capacitor<00:04:05.610> board<00:04:07.010> so<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.100> would<00:04:08.400> get

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
the capacitor board so you would get

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.150 
the capacitor board so you would get
that<00:04:08.760> board<00:04:09.060> order<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.110> just<00:04:10.620> pop<00:04:10.860> it<00:04:11.040> in

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
that board order it and just pop it in

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.180 
that board order it and just pop it in
and<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:12.150> should<00:04:12.239> be<00:04:12.360> fine<00:04:12.630> but<00:04:13.290> it's<00:04:13.590> more<00:04:13.920> like

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
and it should be fine but it's more like

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.370 
and it should be fine but it's more like
they<00:04:14.910> shouldn't<00:04:15.239> have<00:04:15.300> put<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.690> heatsinks

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
they shouldn't have put the heatsinks

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.259 
they shouldn't have put the heatsinks
between<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.739> capacitors<00:04:17.750> and<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:20.269> person

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
between the capacitors and the person

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.760 
between the capacitors and the person
who<00:04:21.359> repaired<00:04:21.750> this<00:04:21.900> last<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.350> couple<00:04:22.590> years

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
who repaired this last a couple years

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.230 
who repaired this last a couple years
ago<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.040> few<00:04:23.190> years<00:04:23.370> ago<00:04:23.460> how<00:04:23.639> long<00:04:23.850> ago<00:04:24.000> was<00:04:24.210> it

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
ago a few years ago how long ago was it

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.050 
ago a few years ago how long ago was it
a<00:04:24.510> few<00:04:24.720> years<00:04:24.900> ago<00:04:25.020> four<00:04:25.800> years<00:04:25.979> ago<00:04:26.130> at<00:04:26.700> last<00:04:26.910> a

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
a few years ago four years ago at last a

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.260 
a few years ago four years ago at last a
pretty<00:04:27.240> long<00:04:27.389> time<00:04:27.600> like<00:04:27.990> like<00:04:28.260> that<00:04:28.290> but<00:04:29.190> uh

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
pretty long time like like that but uh

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.490 
pretty long time like like that but uh
yeah<00:04:30.270> then<00:04:30.750> you<00:04:30.840> don't<00:04:30.990> do<00:04:31.110> it<00:04:31.139> like<00:04:31.260> that<00:04:31.350> you

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
yeah then you don't do it like that you

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.050 
yeah then you don't do it like that you
would<00:04:31.770> just<00:04:31.919> replace<00:04:32.370> it<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.669> just<00:04:32.820> put<00:04:32.970> it

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
would just replace it and just put it

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.570 
would just replace it and just put it
back<00:04:33.150> into<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.510> circuitry<00:04:34.220> but<00:04:35.220> you<00:04:35.370> can't

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
back into the circuitry but you can't

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.040 
back into the circuitry but you can't
really<00:04:35.700> do<00:04:35.850> anything<00:04:36.060> with<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.540> design<00:04:36.900> of

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
really do anything with the design of

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.930 
really do anything with the design of
the<00:04:37.139> circuit<00:04:37.470> board<00:04:37.680> it's<00:04:38.250> kind<00:04:38.460> of<00:04:38.490> like<00:04:38.669> you

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
the circuit board it's kind of like you

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.219 
the circuit board it's kind of like you
stuck<00:04:39.240> what<00:04:39.389> you<00:04:39.510> get<00:04:39.750> what<00:04:39.930> you<00:04:40.020> get<00:04:41.750> but<00:04:42.750> uh<00:04:42.810> I

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
stuck what you get what you get but uh I

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:44.930 
stuck what you get what you get but uh I
mean<00:04:43.500> it's<00:04:43.800> pretty<00:04:43.950> amazing<00:04:44.070> that<00:04:44.460> it<00:04:44.639> lasted

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
mean it's pretty amazing that it lasted

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.090 
mean it's pretty amazing that it lasted
that<00:04:44.970> long<00:04:45.440> so<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:46.500> just<00:04:46.740> replace<00:04:47.070> that

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
that long so you just replace that

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.969 
that long so you just replace that
capacitor<00:04:47.700> and<00:04:47.760> that<00:04:47.820> capacitor<00:04:48.419> is<00:04:48.979> there's

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
capacitor and that capacitor is there's

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.210 
capacitor and that capacitor is there's
a<00:04:50.070> temperature<00:04:50.639> thing<00:04:50.910> on<00:04:51.090> here<00:04:51.330> is<00:04:52.220> shinola

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
a temperature thing on here is shinola

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.969 
a temperature thing on here is shinola
higher<00:04:53.930> yeah<00:04:54.930> there's<00:04:55.169> a<00:04:55.260> temperature<00:04:55.650> it's

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
higher yeah there's a temperature it's

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.130 
higher yeah there's a temperature it's
it's<00:04:56.130> a<00:04:56.220> 105<00:04:57.000> Celsius<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:58.580> then<00:04:59.580> where's<00:04:59.940> the

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
it's a 105 Celsius and then where's the

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.290 
it's a 105 Celsius and then where's the
capacitor<00:05:01.140> rated<00:05:01.550> kind<00:05:02.550> of<00:05:02.640> hard<00:05:02.789> to<00:05:02.880> see<00:05:03.120> that

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
capacitor rated kind of hard to see that

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:10.330 
capacitor rated kind of hard to see that
it's<00:05:03.560> a<00:05:04.560> two<00:05:04.919> hundred<00:05:06.620> twenty<00:05:07.620> two<00:05:07.650> hundred

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.610 

microfarads<00:05:11.340> yep<00:05:12.210> 2200<00:05:13.020> microfarad

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.360 

if<00:05:16.620> you<00:05:16.740> read<00:05:16.919> on<00:05:17.070> the<00:05:17.100> bottom<00:05:17.610> it's<00:05:18.330> a<00:05:19.370> 2200

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
if you read on the bottom it's a 2200

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:26.029 
if you read on the bottom it's a 2200
microfarad<00:05:20.780> 10<00:05:21.780> volt<00:05:23.810> so<00:05:24.810> what<00:05:25.410> I<00:05:25.470> would<00:05:25.650> do<00:05:25.830> is

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
microfarad 10 volt so what I would do is

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.150 
microfarad 10 volt so what I would do is
I<00:05:26.250> would<00:05:26.280> get<00:05:26.610> a<00:05:26.669> capacitor<00:05:27.390> that's<00:05:28.160> 2200

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
I would get a capacitor that's 2200

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.200 
I would get a capacitor that's 2200
microfarad<00:05:29.660> maybe<00:05:30.660> 25<00:05:31.590> volt<00:05:31.830> or<00:05:32.430> 10<00:05:33.000> volt

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
microfarad maybe 25 volt or 10 volt

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.500 
microfarad maybe 25 volt or 10 volt
that's<00:05:33.750> fine<00:05:34.370> the<00:05:35.370> voltage<00:05:35.729> rating<00:05:36.240> is

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
that's fine the voltage rating is

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.790 
that's fine the voltage rating is
basically<00:05:36.840> how<00:05:36.990> much<00:05:37.110> it<00:05:37.260> can<00:05:37.350> handle<00:05:37.620> up<00:05:37.740> to

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
basically how much it can handle up to

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.510 
basically how much it can handle up to
and<00:05:38.190> then<00:05:39.000> I<00:05:39.150> would<00:05:39.180> do<00:05:39.419> a<00:05:39.450> higher<00:05:39.750> temperature

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
and then I would do a higher temperature

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.000 
and then I would do a higher temperature
instead<00:05:41.520> of<00:05:41.640> 105<00:05:42.180> Celsius<00:05:42.780> I<00:05:42.990> would<00:05:43.800> do

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
instead of 105 Celsius I would do

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.400 
instead of 105 Celsius I would do
something<00:05:44.250> higher<00:05:44.550> than<00:05:44.580> 105<00:05:45.300> so<00:05:45.660> it<00:05:46.229> could

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
something higher than 105 so it could

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.290 
something higher than 105 so it could
withstand<00:05:46.560> a<00:05:47.130> higher<00:05:47.400> temperature<00:05:47.789> because

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
withstand a higher temperature because

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.629 
withstand a higher temperature because
it's<00:05:48.450> between<00:05:48.600> the<00:05:48.840> two<00:05:48.960> heatsink<00:05:49.410> it's<00:05:50.400> in<00:05:50.580> a

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
it's between the two heatsink it's in a

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.620 
it's between the two heatsink it's in a
hot<00:05:50.820> spot<00:05:51.090> basically<00:05:51.570> and<00:05:53.120> that<00:05:54.120> should<00:05:54.389> fix

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
hot spot basically and that should fix

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.279 
hot spot basically and that should fix
it<00:05:55.320> from<00:05:55.530> popping<00:05:55.919> in<00:05:56.010> the<00:05:56.070> future<00:05:57.289> that's

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
it from popping in the future that's

00:05:58.289 --> 00:05:59.719 
it from popping in the future that's
what<00:05:58.530> these<00:05:58.650> guys<00:05:58.710> did<00:05:59.099> looks<00:05:59.340> like<00:05:59.460> they<00:05:59.610> put

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
what these guys did looks like they put

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.390 
what these guys did looks like they put
a<00:05:59.789> 35<00:06:00.270> volt<00:06:00.570> capacitor<00:06:01.380> and<00:06:02.010> they<00:06:02.130> couldn't

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
a 35 volt capacitor and they couldn't

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.440 
a 35 volt capacitor and they couldn't
fit<00:06:02.669> it<00:06:02.789> in<00:06:02.909> there

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
fit it in there

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.420 
fit it in there
I<00:06:03.860> think<00:06:04.860> the<00:06:04.980> original<00:06:05.160> ones<00:06:05.550> were<00:06:06.020> ten<00:06:07.020> volt

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
I think the original ones were ten volt

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.630 
I think the original ones were ten volt
and<00:06:08.430> this<00:06:08.580> is<00:06:08.640> a<00:06:09.410> what<00:06:10.410> is<00:06:10.530> this<00:06:10.830> these<00:06:11.370> are<00:06:11.610> a

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
and this is a what is this these are a

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.270 
and this is a what is this these are a
hundred<00:06:12.090> I<00:06:12.510> think<00:06:13.290> the<00:06:13.560> ones<00:06:13.800> that<00:06:13.920> popped

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
hundred I think the ones that popped

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.250 
hundred I think the ones that popped
were<00:06:15.000> a<00:06:15.540> hundred<00:06:16.260> microfarad<00:06:17.420> no<00:06:18.420> 2200

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
were a hundred microfarad no 2200

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.950 
were a hundred microfarad no 2200
microfarad<00:06:19.880> yeah<00:06:20.880> I<00:06:20.910> think<00:06:21.000> there<00:06:21.210> were<00:06:21.300> 2200

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
microfarad yeah I think there were 2200

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.440 
microfarad yeah I think there were 2200
microfarad<00:06:22.200> 10<00:06:23.130> volt<00:06:23.370> and<00:06:23.610> they<00:06:24.030> replaced

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
microfarad 10 volt and they replaced

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.820 
microfarad 10 volt and they replaced
them<00:06:24.690> and<00:06:24.900> they<00:06:24.960> couldn't<00:06:25.110> fit<00:06:25.350> it<00:06:25.470> in<00:06:25.590> there

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
them and they couldn't fit it in there

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.640 
them and they couldn't fit it in there
and<00:06:26.010> now<00:06:26.940> there<00:06:27.210> are<00:06:27.240> they<00:06:27.840> upgraded<00:06:28.260> it<00:06:28.470> to<00:06:28.500> a

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
and now there are they upgraded it to a

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.860 
and now there are they upgraded it to a
35<00:06:29.100> volt<00:06:29.370> which<00:06:29.580> lasted<00:06:30.000> it<00:06:30.120> still<00:06:30.360> works<00:06:30.570> this

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
35 volt which lasted it still works this

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.010 
35 volt which lasted it still works this
is<00:06:31.050> still<00:06:31.230> good<00:06:31.380> capacitors<00:06:32.160> they<00:06:32.520> just

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
is still good capacitors they just

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.480 
is still good capacitors they just
couldn't<00:06:34.020> fit<00:06:34.200> it<00:06:34.320> in<00:06:34.440> there<00:06:34.620> so<00:06:34.980> that's<00:06:35.340> what

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
couldn't fit it in there so that's what

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.580 
couldn't fit it in there so that's what
they<00:06:35.610> did<00:06:35.930> they<00:06:36.930> could<00:06:37.110> have<00:06:37.200> done<00:06:37.320> a<00:06:37.380> little

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
they did they could have done a little

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.180 
they did they could have done a little
bit<00:06:37.710> better<00:06:37.770> job<00:06:38.750> except<00:06:39.750> like<00:06:39.990> electric<00:06:40.980> tape

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
bit better job except like electric tape

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.730 
bit better job except like electric tape
I<00:06:41.460> don't<00:06:42.240> know<00:06:42.300> anyway<00:06:42.840> that's<00:06:43.260> how<00:06:43.380> you<00:06:43.500> fix

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
I don't know anyway that's how you fix

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.430 
I don't know anyway that's how you fix
it<00:06:44.010> if<00:06:44.520> you<00:06:44.670> replace<00:06:45.030> those<00:06:45.510> capacitors<00:06:46.110> it's

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
it if you replace those capacitors it's

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.680 
it if you replace those capacitors it's
like<00:06:46.590> three<00:06:46.860> we<00:06:47.580> got<00:06:47.700> one<00:06:47.940> right<00:06:48.150> there<00:06:48.450> and

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
like three we got one right there and

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:54.950 
like three we got one right there and
it's<00:06:49.530> C<00:06:50.630> 624<00:06:51.630> C<00:06:52.470> six<00:06:52.980> six<00:06:53.280> one<00:06:53.640> and<00:06:53.910> all<00:06:54.720> the<00:06:54.840> one

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
it's C 624 C six six one and all the one

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.170 
it's C 624 C six six one and all the one
I<00:06:54.990> can't<00:06:55.290> read<00:06:55.440> because<00:06:55.710> there's<00:06:55.980> gunk<00:06:56.280> in<00:06:56.490> the

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
I can't read because there's gunk in the

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.140 
I can't read because there's gunk in the
way<00:06:58.430> but<00:06:59.430> I<00:06:59.460> think<00:06:59.730> they're<00:06:59.850> all<00:06:59.970> the<00:07:00.000> same

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.150 
way but I think they're all the same

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.640 
way but I think they're all the same
rating<00:07:02.030> so<00:07:03.030> anyway<00:07:03.300> a<00:07:03.330> post<00:07:04.230> comment

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
rating so anyway a post comment

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.620 
rating so anyway a post comment

so<00:07:07.320> if<00:07:07.590> you<00:07:07.800> replace<00:07:07.950> those<00:07:08.250> three<00:07:08.460> capacitors

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:08.970 
so if you replace those three capacitors

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.100 
so if you replace those three capacitors
you<00:07:09.150> should<00:07:09.330> be<00:07:09.420> in<00:07:09.480> good<00:07:09.600> shape<00:07:09.660> and<00:07:10.020> they're

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110 
you should be in good shape and they're

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.000 
you should be in good shape and they're
22<00:07:10.410> mm<00:07:10.650> 20<00:07:11.340> to<00:07:11.430> 100<00:07:11.760> microfarads<00:07:12.530> 10<00:07:13.530> volt<00:07:13.770> but

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.010 
22 mm 20 to 100 microfarads 10 volt but

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.560 
22 mm 20 to 100 microfarads 10 volt but
I<00:07:14.070> would<00:07:14.190> increase<00:07:14.520> it<00:07:14.730> a<00:07:14.910> little<00:07:15.120> higher<00:07:15.300> you

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:15.570 
I would increase it a little higher you

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.900 
I would increase it a little higher you
could<00:07:16.020> do<00:07:16.170> a<00:07:16.590> higher<00:07:16.950> temperature<00:07:17.340> as<00:07:17.730> well

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:17.910 
could do a higher temperature as well

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.870 
could do a higher temperature as well
but<00:07:18.780> keep<00:07:19.080> it<00:07:19.170> at<00:07:19.290> 2200<00:07:19.920> microfarad<00:07:20.160> and<00:07:20.490> also

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 
but keep it at 2200 microfarad and also

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.030 
but keep it at 2200 microfarad and also
by<00:07:21.060> the<00:07:21.120> way<00:07:21.270> if<00:07:21.480> your<00:07:21.800> capacitors<00:07:22.800> are<00:07:22.920> not

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:23.040 
by the way if your capacitors are not

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.740 
by the way if your capacitors are not
swollen<00:07:23.490> or<00:07:23.580> bulged<00:07:23.940> they<00:07:24.390> could<00:07:24.540> still<00:07:24.720> be

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:24.750 
swollen or bulged they could still be

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.230 
swollen or bulged they could still be
bad<00:07:25.020> some<00:07:25.290> bad<00:07:25.500> capacitors<00:07:26.030> sometimes<00:07:27.030> look

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 
bad some bad capacitors sometimes look

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.440 
bad some bad capacitors sometimes look
good<00:07:27.420> but<00:07:27.870> are<00:07:27.990> actually<00:07:28.200> indeed<00:07:28.680> bad<00:07:29.160> and

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:29.450 
good but are actually indeed bad and

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.660 
good but are actually indeed bad and
they're<00:07:30.450> right<00:07:30.660> there<00:07:30.870> in<00:07:30.960> the<00:07:31.050> power<00:07:31.200> supply

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:31.670 
they're right there in the power supply

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.030 
they're right there in the power supply
thanks<00:07:32.670> for<00:07:32.760> watching
