00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
hey YouTube kayak DIY here and right now

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.120 
hey YouTube kayak DIY here and right now
I'm<00:00:16.049> going<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.260> show<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.440> how<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.710> can<00:00:16.890> take<00:00:17.100> a

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
I'm going to show you how you can take a

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.370 
I'm going to show you how you can take a
simple<00:00:17.430> cutting<00:00:17.789> board<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.270> convert<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.170> into

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
simple cutting board and convert it into

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.970 
simple cutting board and convert it into
an<00:00:19.859> anchor<00:00:20.340> real<00:00:20.609> setup<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.350> here

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
an anchor real setup so this here

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.120 
an anchor real setup so this here
basically<00:00:23.369> imitates<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.689> very<00:00:24.960> popular<00:00:25.350> yak

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
basically imitates the very popular yak

attack Sidewinder
anchor<00:00:28.590> setup<00:00:29.029> so<00:00:30.029> there's<00:00:30.359> two<00:00:30.539> different

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
anchor setup so there's two different

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.780 
anchor setup so there's two different
ways<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.960> mount<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.949> I'm<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.640> show

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
ways to mount this and I'm going to show

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.490 
ways to mount this and I'm going to show
you<00:00:32.850> both<00:00:33.090> ways<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.899> video<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:37.170> here's<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
you both ways in this video so here's a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.600 
you both ways in this video so here's a
quick<00:00:37.800> look<00:00:38.070> at<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:40.969> cutting<00:00:41.969> board<00:00:42.500> anchor

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
quick look at a cutting board anchor

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.790 
quick look at a cutting board anchor
setup<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.300> here<00:00:46.079> was<00:00:46.230> made<00:00:46.440> out<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
setup so this here was made out of a

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.750 
setup so this here was made out of a
cutting<00:00:47.070> board<00:00:47.340> from<00:00:48.000> Walmart

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.260 

you

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.580 

and<00:01:01.490> it<00:01:02.490> was<00:01:02.700> squared<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.810> course<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.410> was

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:04.590 
and it was squared of course this was

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.290 
and it was squared of course this was
just<00:01:04.800> a<00:01:06.530> rectangle<00:01:07.530> piece<00:01:07.800> here<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.550> we

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
just a rectangle piece here and we

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.920 
just a rectangle piece here and we
notched<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.870> out<00:01:10.050> and<00:01:10.940> then<00:01:11.940> we<00:01:12.390> did<00:01:12.540> cut<00:01:12.810> it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
notched it out and then we did cut it

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.630 
notched it out and then we did cut it
some<00:01:13.110> excess<00:01:13.500> off<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.890> was<00:01:14.010> about<00:01:14.190> that<00:01:14.430> much

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
some excess off it was about that much

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.590 
some excess off it was about that much
longer<00:01:14.910> we<00:01:15.360> did<00:01:15.540> cut<00:01:15.780> some<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.110> off<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
longer we did cut some of that off and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.660 
longer we did cut some of that off and
we<00:01:18.600> then<00:01:19.050> put<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.530> little<00:01:19.830> notch<00:01:20.010> here<00:01:20.370> to

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
we then put this little notch here to

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.360 
we then put this little notch here to
anchor<00:01:21.240> our<00:01:21.270> line<00:01:21.690> in<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.740> run<00:01:23.070> your<00:01:23.220> line

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
anchor our line in so you run your line

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.130 
anchor our line in so you run your line
through<00:01:23.610> there<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.090> keeps<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.540> line<00:01:24.870> from

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
through there and it keeps the line from

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.210 
through there and it keeps the line from
unraveling<00:01:25.770> off<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.130> spool<00:01:27.740> we<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.160> of

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
unraveling off the spool we have one of

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.730 
unraveling off the spool we have one of
these<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:29.580> large<00:01:30.110> carabiner<00:01:31.110> Clips<00:01:31.410> here

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
these really large carabiner Clips here

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.600 
these really large carabiner Clips here
and<00:01:32.120> then<00:01:33.120> we<00:01:33.240> put<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:34.020> Nerf<00:01:34.800> noodle<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.340> there

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
and then we put a Nerf noodle on there

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.020 
and then we put a Nerf noodle on there
and<00:01:35.850> zip-tied<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.250> what<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.610> allows<00:01:39.000> us

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
and zip-tied it and what this allows us

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.660 
and zip-tied it and what this allows us
to<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.690> it<00:01:39.869> allows<00:01:40.050> us<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.440> quickly

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
to do is it allows us to quickly

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.210 
to do is it allows us to quickly
disconnect<00:01:41.900> the<00:01:42.900> whole<00:01:43.110> entire<00:01:43.410> anchor<00:01:43.950> set

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
disconnect the whole entire anchor set

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.270 
disconnect the whole entire anchor set
up<00:01:44.600> from<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.780> kayak<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.440> can<00:01:46.650> run<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.070> on

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
up from the kayak you can run this on

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.640 
up from the kayak you can run this on
our<00:01:47.460> anchor<00:01:47.850> trolley<00:01:48.150> and<00:01:48.510> then<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.470> can

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
our anchor trolley and then we can

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.440 
our anchor trolley and then we can
quickly<00:01:50.010> disconnect<00:01:50.400> when<00:01:50.820> we<00:01:50.940> hook<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.240> large

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
quickly disconnect when we hook a large

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.170 
quickly disconnect when we hook a large
fish<00:01:51.810> just<00:01:52.740> come<00:01:53.220> back<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:53.580> the<00:01:53.640> anchor<00:01:53.970> later

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
fish just come back to the anchor later

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.060 
fish just come back to the anchor later
on<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.910> line<00:01:57.540> we're<00:01:57.780> using<00:01:57.960> here<00:01:58.260> is<00:01:58.380> paracord

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
on the line we're using here is paracord

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.700 
on the line we're using here is paracord
not<00:01:59.580> everyone<00:02:00.030> agrees<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.510> use<00:02:00.660> paracord<00:02:01.080> we

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
not everyone agrees to use paracord we

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.350 
not everyone agrees to use paracord we
happen<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.850> because<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.240> has<00:02:03.330> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
happen to like it just because it has a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.880 
happen to like it just because it has a
very<00:02:03.920> strong<00:02:04.920> tensile<00:02:05.700> strength<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.210> mean<00:02:06.360> it's

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
very strong tensile strength I mean it's

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.720 
very strong tensile strength I mean it's
550<00:02:07.890> pound<00:02:08.100> test<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.720> we<00:02:09.990> really<00:02:10.229> like<00:02:10.440> that

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 
550 pound test so we really like that

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.300 
550 pound test so we really like that
there<00:02:11.730> are<00:02:11.880> other<00:02:12.320> anchor<00:02:13.320> specific<00:02:14.010> lines

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
there are other anchor specific lines

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.020 
there are other anchor specific lines
which<00:02:14.760> are<00:02:15.150> bad<00:02:15.570> either<00:02:16.610> for<00:02:17.610> as<00:02:17.670> far<00:02:17.880> as

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
which are bad either for as far as

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.120 
which are bad either for as far as
running<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:18.780> connecting<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.470> up<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.890> the

running it and connecting it up to the
anchor<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:20.820> is<00:02:21.030> one<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.330> most<00:02:21.450> common

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
anchor this is one of the most common

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.700 
anchor this is one of the most common
acres<00:02:22.320> this<00:02:22.620> year<00:02:23.660> we<00:02:24.660> actually<00:02:25.110> use<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> zip

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
acres this year we actually use a zip

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.240 
acres this year we actually use a zip
tie<00:02:25.920> right<00:02:26.460> through<00:02:26.760> here<00:02:27.230> this<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.470> not<00:02:28.920> our

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
tie right through here this is not our

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.990 
tie right through here this is not our
original<00:02:29.700> idea<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.810> zip<00:02:31.110> tie<00:02:31.790> saw<00:02:32.790> this

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
original idea this zip tie saw this

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.059 
original idea this zip tie saw this
somewhere<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.420> don't<00:02:33.540> remember<00:02:33.900> where<00:02:34.260> but

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
somewhere I don't remember where but

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.100 
somewhere I don't remember where but
what<00:02:35.520> this<00:02:35.730> allows<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.360> do<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.690> if<00:02:36.960> you

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
what this allows you to do is if you

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.830 
what this allows you to do is if you
connect<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:38.160> anchor<00:02:38.819> line<00:02:38.970> up<00:02:39.210> to<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.480> front

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
connect the anchor line up to the front

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.740 
connect the anchor line up to the front
and<00:02:40.460> then<00:02:41.460> you<00:02:41.520> have<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.790> zip<00:02:42.000> tie<00:02:42.180> here<00:02:42.540> if

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
and then you have the zip tie here if

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.870 
and then you have the zip tie here if
you<00:02:42.930> were<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.260> ever<00:02:43.410> get<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.710> snag<00:02:44.190> let's<00:02:44.670> say

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
you were to ever get a snag let's say

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.460 
you were to ever get a snag let's say
and<00:02:45.210> one<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.540> these<00:02:45.630> prongs<00:02:45.990> would<00:02:46.290> not

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
and one of these prongs would not

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.680 
and one of these prongs would not
release<00:02:47.100> or<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.610> absolutely<00:02:48.240> couldn't<00:02:48.480> get

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
release or you absolutely couldn't get

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.990 
release or you absolutely couldn't get
the<00:02:48.780> anchor<00:02:49.110> up<00:02:49.290> if<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.310> use<00:02:50.340> some<00:02:50.760> really

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
the anchor up if you use some really

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.220 
the anchor up if you use some really
quick<00:02:51.390> jerks<00:02:52.460> with<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.610> line<00:02:53.819> on<00:02:54.180> on<00:02:54.750> this

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
quick jerks with the line on on this

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.920 
quick jerks with the line on on this
anchor<00:02:55.650> setup<00:02:56.040> you'll<00:02:56.700> break<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.300> zip<00:02:57.720> tie

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
anchor setup you'll break the zip tie

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.350 
anchor setup you'll break the zip tie
and<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.800> will<00:02:58.980> allow<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.550> pick<00:03:00.000> up<00:03:00.180> from

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
and that will allow it to pick up from

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.300 
and that will allow it to pick up from
this<00:03:00.600> end<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.440> will<00:03:01.530> fold<00:03:01.890> in<00:03:02.130> those

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
this end and it will fold in those

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.580 
this end and it will fold in those
problems<00:03:03.470> so<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:05.300> is<00:03:06.300> just<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.780> quick<00:03:06.959> look<00:03:07.260> at

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
problems so that is just a quick look at

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.360 
problems so that is just a quick look at
the<00:03:08.430> anchor<00:03:08.670> setup<00:03:09.380> so<00:03:10.380> here's<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.710> look<00:03:10.980> at<00:03:11.160> the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
the anchor setup so here's a look at the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.460 
the anchor setup so here's a look at the
Yakutat<00:03:12.000> Sidewinder<00:03:12.900> mountain

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
Yakutat Sidewinder mountain

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.370 
Yakutat Sidewinder mountain
to<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.620> track<00:03:14.040> setup<00:03:15.030> this<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.140> one<00:03:16.290> that

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
to a track setup this is the one that

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.770 
to a track setup this is the one that
you<00:03:16.530> could<00:03:16.650> buy<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.220> then<00:03:17.880> here's<00:03:18.210> a<00:03:18.270> look<00:03:18.540> at

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
you could buy and then here's a look at

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.860 
you could buy and then here's a look at
ours<00:03:19.170> so<00:03:20.040> as<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.490> can<00:03:20.610> see<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:21.180> stuck<00:03:21.660> out

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
ours so as you can see it stuck out

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.440 
ours so as you can see it stuck out
quite<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.230> ways<00:03:22.700> what<00:03:23.700> we<00:03:23.820> could<00:03:24.000> have<00:03:24.030> done<00:03:24.300> is

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
quite a ways what we could have done is

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.700 
quite a ways what we could have done is
we<00:03:24.630> could<00:03:24.780> have<00:03:24.810> made<00:03:25.050> it<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.290> little<00:03:25.530> bit

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
we could have made it a little bit

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.790 
we could have made it a little bit
shorter<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:27.080> that<00:03:28.080> probably<00:03:28.530> would<00:03:28.710> have

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
shorter and that probably would have

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.090 
shorter and that probably would have
worked<00:03:29.040> out<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.220> little<00:03:29.430> bit<00:03:29.640> better<00:03:30.080> but<00:03:31.100> what

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
worked out a little bit better but what

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.800 
worked out a little bit better but what
we<00:03:32.250> have<00:03:32.460> here<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:33.030> we<00:03:33.390> have<00:03:33.560> two<00:03:34.560> toilet<00:03:35.310> bolts

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
we have here is we have two toilet bolts

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.000 
we have here is we have two toilet bolts
that<00:03:36.810> we<00:03:37.020> cut<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.890> extra<00:03:38.310> length<00:03:38.490> off<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:39.030> and

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
that we cut the extra length off of and

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.070 
that we cut the extra length off of and
1/4<00:03:41.010> inch<00:03:41.190> knobs<00:03:41.640> from<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.180> woodworking<00:03:42.840> kit

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
1/4 inch knobs from a woodworking kit

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.740 
1/4 inch knobs from a woodworking kit
and<00:03:43.430> they're<00:03:44.430> just<00:03:44.670> running<00:03:45.240> through<00:03:45.540> the

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
and they're just running through the

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.510 
and they're just running through the
cutting<00:03:46.140> board<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:46.530> that's<00:03:46.680> what<00:03:46.890> secures<00:03:47.340> it

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
cutting board and that's what secures it

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.900 
cutting board and that's what secures it
thanks<00:03:48.390> for<00:03:48.420> watching
