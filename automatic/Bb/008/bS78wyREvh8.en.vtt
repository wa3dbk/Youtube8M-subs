00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.460
 Hi guys here is the river one more time 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.470
 as some people asked me to 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.900
 respect to cedars that the use 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.730
 I decided to make this video to talk a 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.800
 little about them 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.140
 in the video description I will leave a 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.829
 list of links to download the Sesi 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.140
 ons is either ons or adhons as they are 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.420
 known among Brazilians are 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.610
 small programs developed by 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.829
 own players that allow 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.489
 customize the client interface of the 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.880
 game 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.800
 for information despite the breeze 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.620
 do not take responsibility 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.750
 it allows the development and use of 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.790
 cedars 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.790
 there is a huge variety of gifts for 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.739
 the most diverse functions 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.020
 many of them are really useful 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.750
 displaying in a friendly and accessible way 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.360
 information that is sometimes not available 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.180
 view of the player because on the one 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.200
 good but for another not so much 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.549
 I'll explain when I started playing or 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.259
 discovered the years 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.149
 I ended up getting excited about the idea of 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.340
 to be able to customize an interface 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.990
 way I wanted to and I started 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.450
 install any edson you think 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.600
 interesting without any criteria 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.709
 in the end I ended up with a clogged interface 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.899
 adwares are the ones I did not need 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:38.149
 the problem of a polluted interface is 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.039
 that she's more annoying than helping 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.100
 it is very easy to end up with a lot of 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.350
 bars and colors scattered around the screen 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.770
 ultimately only serve to 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.109
 to draw your attention to what is important 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.369
 When choosing the years, we should 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.450
 question what it really is 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.639
 required 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.609
 the fewer elements on the screen can 

00:01:55.639 --> 00:02:01.189
 the easier it will be to focus on 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:03.829
 What's happening inside the game? 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.959
 another factor to be considered is that the 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.069
 memory and processing consoles . 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.679
 computer 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.190
 depending on your computer this may 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.040
 make the game slower and heavier 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.500
 also the less you use less 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.920
 problems will have the release of fish 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.920
 points 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.739
 this as the cesÃ£o are developed by 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.870
 there is no way to know when or if 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.970
 will be authorized 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.940
 obviously that does not mean that 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.310
 we should not use it from an album only 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.209
 I recommend to be a little careful 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.170
 To the eye drops it is clear that these 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.400
 points 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.410
 Let's go straight to the bears. 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:52.160
 that help me directly 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:54.470
 men in fights and displays of CODAU 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.100
 skills in icons in action bar 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.049
 is very useful and practical mainly 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.600
 for not needing bars and friends 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:07.549
 these do not require any configuration 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:11.959
 to use it just install and activate play 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:15.380
 box display the icons of skills and then 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.930
 above the nem players the numbers 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.940
 showing the remaining time duration is 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.510
 the man who be working together 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.670
 complete banks also requires no 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.970
 great configuration for using it 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.670
 although depending on the case it may be 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:36.040
 interesting to customize a little more 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:39.140
 certainly no cuts are needed 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.359
 cuts is the edson i use to monitor 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.150
 the gifts and to show the belly 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.190
 conjuration display the gifts in a bar 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.120
 time just above the chicken of the 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.150
 character 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.130
 one of the differentials is that it exhibited only the 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.609
 trend at the moment of 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.859
 conjuring up a pretty useful skill 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.200
 for team cast practice 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.670
 conjure up skills in sequence 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.650
 behind the other 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.319
 I had to spend a little time 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.440
 the settings of the room that 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.540
 sometimes they are not very clear to let 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.660
 I did it exactly the way I wanted it 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.090
 in any case I believe it is possible 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:21.530
 use without necessarily having to 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:24.960
 reconfigures it targueta passista 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.139
 displays extra franz from the tanks or 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.430
 any group member you want 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.129
 useful to see the targets of the 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.840
 tank also needs to be configured to 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:35.819
 leave it the way I wanted to 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.719
 in your configuration is not very 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:39.529
 complicated 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:43.669
 if that is the case, it is entirely possible 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:47.490
 use it with the default settings 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:50.729
 target health percentage is not good 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.979
 simple but extremely useful exhibits 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.900
 frame the remaining amount due in 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.719
 target percentage 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.349
 changes color when you get 20% of 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:00.560
 life 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:03.930
 the settings are very simple 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.719
 basically it is only necessary to position it 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.719
 and adjust the size 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:12.870
 the IQA or hours and hours is a 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:14.219
 substitute which is the classic aura 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.919
 Unfortunately I did not find any 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:19.409
 updated version for mop 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.419
 I really like this year it works 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:23.520
 to monitor anything you 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:26.610
 want inside the game the way it 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.699
 you want to use images and colors 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:32.449
 to monitor proxy servers. 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:35.370
 care any information available 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:38.129
 at the moment I used to use it for me 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.159
 warn when points out and monitor 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:43.319
 35 incantation proxy 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:46.319
 unfortunately it is one of the most complex of 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.800
 if set does not acknowledge without setting 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:49.560
 it 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.750
 this is not indicated for those who do not 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:58.110
 likes to waste time messing around 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:06:00.539
 bartender settings recently 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.490
 I stopped using the bartender and went back to 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:04.800
 use the default action word from the 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.589
 interface of the game not because it 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.419
 some problem with it just for being 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:12.629
 trying to reduce the number of years that 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:14.370
 use anyway this was very 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:17.039
 interesting that allows you to customize the 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.439
 action bar any way you want 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.839
 the only one however is that in fights with bar 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:24.779
 special actions if you are 

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:27.449
 outdated may end up not working 

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:30.060
 causing some difficulties 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.990
 during the fight it is also necessary 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.150
 spend some time 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:38.310
 appearing depending on the degree of 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:40.500
 Ladder customization is edson 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.540
 that I currently use to monitor my 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.360
 gps and group 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:48.090
 I used it recently before using the 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.870
 icloud that is very similar and does the same 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.420
 thing 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.100
 I ended up opting for each one only to 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.310
 that it is slightly lighter than the 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:59.040
 aftermath but both are good choices 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.590
 worth mentioning that it does not monitor 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.290
 just from the ps but everything that happens 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.060
 during a fight there are no great 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:10.410
 settings to make 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:14.430
 unless you want to change your appearance or 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:16.470
 in 3 is edson that monitors threats from 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.370
 group and shows who is with water 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.040
 target 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.950
 as nowadays the game will have option 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.870
 itself shows its level of threat 

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.100
 I do not think this is one of the 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.720
 essential 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.750
 despite the option of the game you have 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:33.540
 limited mainly useful 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.850
 for tanks and fights that requires a 

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.450
 greater care with the generation of threat 

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:41.310
 also does not require many configurations 

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:43.430
 only positioning and adjustment of 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.630
 dimensions 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.340
 these are the gods who helped me 

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.700
 directly in combat 

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:52.410
 I hope this video has been useful 

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.360
 if there is any doubt, post the 

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.900
 comments that I'll try to solve 

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.300
 hours 

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.510
 Thank you for watching and until the next 

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.510
 video
