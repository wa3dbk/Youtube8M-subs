00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
to be honest with you

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.820 
to be honest with you
I<00:02:20.300> was<00:02:21.300> raised<00:02:21.570> in<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.900> States

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
I was raised in the States

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.820 
I was raised in the States
went<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.340> church<00:02:23.400> Korean<00:02:24.170> Church<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.470> that's

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
went to church Korean Church so that's

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.660 
went to church Korean Church so that's
how<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.010> speak<00:02:26.280> Korean<00:02:26.660> until<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.690> was<00:02:28.160> in<00:02:29.160> my<00:02:29.310> 20s

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
how I speak Korean until I was in my 20s

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.970 
how I speak Korean until I was in my 20s
like<00:02:29.880> probably<00:02:30.780> 21<00:02:31.260> 22<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:33.210> I<00:02:33.860> got<00:02:34.860> to

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
like probably 21 22 and so I got to

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.650 
like probably 21 22 and so I got to
speak<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.400> Korean<00:02:35.760> language<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.540> the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
speak the Korean language and the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.660 
speak the Korean language and the
culture<00:02:36.810> but<00:02:37.230> what<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:37.980> never<00:02:38.250> really

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
culture but what I never really

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.060 
culture but what I never really
understood<00:02:38.750> was<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.930> fine<00:02:40.230> subtleties<00:02:41.040> of

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
understood was the fine subtleties of

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.750 
understood was the fine subtleties of
the<00:02:42.000> Korean<00:02:42.480> cultures<00:02:43.040> hinting<00:02:44.040> ability<00:02:44.580> or

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
the Korean cultures hinting ability or

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.610 
the Korean cultures hinting ability or
the<00:02:44.880> implication<00:02:45.510> ability<00:02:48.440> looking<00:02:49.440> back<00:02:49.590> on

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
the implication ability looking back on

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.199 
the implication ability looking back on
it<00:02:49.860> now<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.340> know<00:02:50.430> more<00:02:50.730> about<00:02:51.030> how

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
it now that I know more about how

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.360 
it now that I know more about how
Koreans<00:02:51.810> imply<00:02:52.320> things<00:02:52.590> without<00:02:52.830> saying<00:02:53.130> them

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
Koreans imply things without saying them

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.010 
Koreans imply things without saying them
I<00:02:54.110> look<00:02:55.110> back<00:02:55.290> in<00:02:55.640> several<00:02:56.640> Korean<00:02:57.330> women

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
I look back in several Korean women

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.510 
I look back in several Korean women

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
in me because they were far too subtle

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.150 
in me because they were far too subtle
their<00:03:03.090> hints<00:03:03.360> were<00:03:03.480> really<00:03:04.110> really<00:03:04.380> too
