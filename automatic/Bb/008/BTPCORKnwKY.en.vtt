make<00:01:27.979> it<00:01:28.189> very<00:01:28.220> very<00:01:28.610> difficult<00:01:28.880> for<00:01:29.420> just

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
make it very very difficult for just

the right in her backswing so far over
her<00:01:37.880> right<00:01:38.180> foot<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:38.979> that<00:01:39.979> proves<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.399> be<00:01:40.460> the

her right foot and that proves to be the
case<00:01:40.880> Rene's<00:01:41.570> biggest<00:01:42.140> faults<00:01:42.590> I<00:01:42.740> read<00:01:43.130> the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
case Rene's biggest faults I read the

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.980 
case Rene's biggest faults I read the
top<00:01:43.490> in<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.700> golf<00:01:43.880> ball<00:01:44.149> are<00:01:44.299> hitting<00:01:44.509> too<00:01:44.720> far

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
top in the golf ball are hitting too far

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.499 
top in the golf ball are hitting too far
behind<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.500> ball<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:45.890> both<00:01:46.549> that<00:01:47.119> exact

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
behind the ball and both that exact

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.060 
behind the ball and both that exact
movement<00:01:47.930> here<00:01:48.110> is<00:01:48.380> what<00:01:48.590> what<00:01:48.890> exactly

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
movement here is what what exactly

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.010 
movement here is what what exactly
happened<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:49.939> a<00:01:49.969> body<00:01:50.240> weight<00:01:50.479> just<00:01:50.750> doesn't

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
happened so a body weight just doesn't

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.760 
happened so a body weight just doesn't
have<00:01:51.200> time<00:01:51.469> to<00:01:51.530> get<00:01:52.040> back<00:01:52.219> onto<00:01:52.460> a<00:01:52.610> left<00:01:53.770> now

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
have time to get back onto a left now

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.380 
have time to get back onto a left now
and<00:01:54.950> again<00:01:55.070> it<00:01:55.189> does<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:55.640> she<00:01:55.729> hit<00:01:55.880> some<00:01:56.090> great

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
and again it does and she hit some great

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.569 
and again it does and she hit some great
golf<00:01:56.570> shots<00:01:56.930> but<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.320> was<00:01:57.740> too<00:01:58.100> much<00:01:58.310> of<00:01:58.490> a

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
golf shots but it was too much of a

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.039 
golf shots but it was too much of a
lottery<00:01:58.820> it<00:01:59.090> wasn't<00:01:59.360> happening<00:01:59.659> consistently

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
lottery it wasn't happening consistently

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.469 
lottery it wasn't happening consistently
enough<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.159> that's<00:02:01.490> exactly<00:02:02.060> what<00:02:02.210> I<00:02:02.270> really

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
enough and that's exactly what I really

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.569 
enough and that's exactly what I really
wanted<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.869> work<00:02:03.079> on<00:02:03.320> said<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.619> consistency

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
wanted to work on said the consistency

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.700 
wanted to work on said the consistency
factor<00:02:04.939> of<00:02:05.030> her<00:02:05.149> hitting<00:02:05.420> some<00:02:05.630> golf<00:02:05.750> shots<00:02:06.049> so

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
factor of her hitting some golf shots so

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.290 
factor of her hitting some golf shots so
I've<00:02:06.979> actually<00:02:07.130> used<00:02:07.340> here<00:02:07.670> just<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.030> swing

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
I've actually used here just the swing

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.969 
I've actually used here just the swing
playing<00:02:08.600> perfect<00:02:09.080> too<00:02:09.229> which<00:02:09.350> is<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.530> problem

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
playing perfect too which is a problem

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.800

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
the front view so you can see this it's

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.420 
the front view so you can see this it's
actually<00:02:19.790> quite<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.750> way<00:02:20.989> away<00:02:21.020> from<00:02:21.830> her<00:02:21.950> setup

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
actually quite a way away from her setup

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.220 
actually quite a way away from her setup
position<00:02:22.580> but<00:02:23.510> what<00:02:23.690> it's<00:02:23.810> doing<00:02:23.870> it's

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
position but what it's doing it's

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.190 
position but what it's doing it's
helping<00:02:24.650> her<00:02:24.830> visualized<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.970> more<00:02:26.239> central<00:02:26.750> so

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
helping her visualized a more central so

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
to stop your swing and start again and

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.640 
to stop your swing and start again and
this<00:02:34.850> was<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.090> best<00:02:35.239> one<00:02:35.450> by<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.630> million<00:02:36.440> mile

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650

over the golf ball it's perfect as she
turns<00:02:46.130> better<00:02:46.400> there's<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.849> tiny<00:02:47.269> bit<00:02:47.599> of
