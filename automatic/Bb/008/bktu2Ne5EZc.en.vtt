00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.380
 It is a continuation of the tire man taira today 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.930
 This time 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:15.440
 I would like to explain the drainage of tires 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:21.130
 Now of the tire 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.130
 Since I prepared samples etc. , I would like to explain a little with this 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.630
 This is a common radial tire for passenger cars 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.090
 The 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.090
 As this also but now it's three minutes 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.980
 To the place where drainage Zono 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.059
 In the neck of 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.360
 Koyama I am now in there if there Gong 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.030
 Though I made a color on purpose , I put a color in yellow 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:52.070
 It intends this 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:56.060
 The company and slip sign to say after the comfort woman who was a little excited 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.110
 It shows that you can not ride any more than this because it became a fixed pair 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.720
 What are you doing? 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:06.300
 And 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:06.300
 Just this when I got off from the direction of the horizontal rather than the surface of the tire 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.260
 There is a postscript sign 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.490
 Aso-kun , yeah 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.259
 There is emphasis I have this mark Tteyuu indicator 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.640
 And we will Tagu' here N this triangle in this way 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.030
 Excuse me 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.610
 It shows in the wind that there is a mark at the drainage ditch 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.760
 This is 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:36.440
 If you look at the whole here a little, there will always be six places in the Fire a collection 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:39.830
 123 4 o 6 and 6 places have the purpose of this indicator 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.880
 Ono There's a thick drain there 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.880
 1.6 mm of 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.490
 It will be that there is a small mountain and 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.490
 Well this 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.340
 I see and do tire check but 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.970
 It is one end, yes 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.940
 Well, if there are 4 columns this time, 4 columns 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.470
 6 places 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:09.009
 Re eventually 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:14.230
 Conditions be six 24 locations of the four columns this is not connected to any one place 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.140
 Is not made to the judgment of the fact that good bad using that was hair 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.850
 And a 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:24.000
 The drainage groove 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.920
 Yes combed groove This is drainage but you There are number is different in but you are reading this now 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.060
 There are three types of 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:34.650
 Excuse me 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:35.430
 The tire is manufactured as if it plays a role now because it is a thick drainage within the same contact surface 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.500
 Manufacturer 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:43.140
 The rest is of production 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.040
 I'm such that there is this difference by product also says that each hobby that of the thick column 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.100
 I will 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.530
 My hobbies are against Shimizu 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.580
 Aiiya 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.880
 Indicator yeah yeah 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.210
 It means that there is a slip sign 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.210
 Because 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:08.460
 This part is 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:13.860
 This is an auxiliary ditch There is no such thing as that slip sign in the auxiliary ditch 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:17.190
 Sometimes I get questions a a 1.6 mm in this kind of place 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:21.900
 Kedomo I also do some when it is said that say Is that measure I 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:25.280
 It is not a place to measure a certain inhabitant of wards, and if it is planned to the last with that hobbies 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.280
 It will be said that 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:34.090
 I think a little by extension and one box car and rv car from here 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:40.190
 The center of gravity of the star is high a 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:45.310
 A that the outside of the wear in the car say so It is a car of box type for the strongly out such a car 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.310
 It is something that is called a child called rb tire which I took measures though 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:54.960
 If it is something like this, the auxiliary ditch is not cut here 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.620
 So Well if there even is a difference also with a variety by this tire 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.700
 a 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:04.020
 Now 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:08.720
 It's like this, like the remaining grooves in the tire will not get shallow 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.720
 I think that you often look at the message type 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:21.910
 That strange slip sign for me 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:25.060
 I usually see quite on their own look of it is those who say that'm very to me is firm 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:29.840
 All means because you appropriate advice 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:35.200
 Those who live in Hachioji and those around Hachioji 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.280
 Than me will check if that firmly'll put your voice 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.620
 Drainage gutter today 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.169
 To Nishiyano 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.169
