00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:19.150
 The letter is now received 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:22.360
 as if so politely focused elegant 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.770
 intimidating 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.750
 you have other things besides work 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.430
 interests what is with them 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.440
 I would like to know more about her 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.310
 There is not really much about me 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.310
 Experienced look at me 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:44.030
 I do 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:46.280
 anastacia christian she noticed the 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.379
 can leave eyes 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.000
 I want to see her face that betrays 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.960
 me what you might think they are 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.360
 So a control freak 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.969
 I keep everything about the control with 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.969
 style can not be boring 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.910
 you do not play fair 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.910
 I've never 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.170
 let me into your life i had in 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.330
 live a serious start that's all 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.780
 what you need to know 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.000
 My taste is very special 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.540
 would not you understand then clear 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.540
 me up 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.659
 I do not know if I can be like that 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.219
 he needs me 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.219
 I keep away from me 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.680
 do you want to go 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.509
 mainz 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.929
 what if I stay what happens then 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.390
 she had 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.870
 hello friends and sincerely 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.400
 come with jbk day just now 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.560
 at the second German trailer to the 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.300
 movie fifty shades of gray and that is 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.160
 that a novel bestseller filming 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.480
 and the book already had that 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.370
 people divided into two groups the 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.540
 One of them just liked this book absolutely 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.740
 the others liked this book 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.090
 not at all 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.380
 For me, the question now arises 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.820
 Which of these two groups will I become 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.350
 Ultimately counting me when I get that 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.030
 basically I have to watch 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.770
 Just say that the coach is quite good 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.270
 I especially like it 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.190
 this very cinema attracted definitely 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.600
 pretty good to this christian gray 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.670
 these scenes simply went well 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.770
 come pretty cool and how 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.940
 much atmosphere over fallen as well 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.050
 me also the actors on the 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.090
 one side just this woman the very 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.410
 shy and yet somehow very 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.210
 act mysteriously on the other 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.770
 just the performer of christian 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.510
 Ragger here very flawless and above all 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.700
 so pretty with that familiar face 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.750
 fits well in this role and 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.850
 Overall, I always have such a bit 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.290
 that great gatsby feeling about this 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.790
 very rich people do not talk about 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.680
 he knows so much about his secrets 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.860
 then gradually on deck 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.460
 but that's a little something 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.480
 psychological and again I was 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.310
 the feeling that could be a bit 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.420
 be and become psychic anyway 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.650
 yes curious what the movie 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.270
 ultimately has to offer 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.590
 basically I have to say that 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.760
 this trailer but also hard where 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.650
 I ask myself a little bit okay 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.230
 not that to see that now 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.480
 Psycho thing drift off insofar there is 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.470
 just a good one from me 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.880
 mittelpunkt number namely seven out of ten 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.470
 possible points for this trailer 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.510
 So I am very interested in 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.040
 this strip I'm curious what the 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.930
 film from a book does what 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.610
 completely has two sides where just people 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.959
 say that is absolutely cool and others 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.980
 People say the book appeals to me 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.019
 not just not at all 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.790
 curious as the movie in the end so 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.530
 a book works and what ultimately 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.519
 for the film is made of it now 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.870
 But I'm curious to your opinion 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.310
 what do you think of this second one? 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.030
 trailer please write me down in 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.800
 the comments 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.989
 otherwise that and now here on the 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.220
 nkwd because here you can all of a sudden 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.540
 social media left click as well 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.470
 can you subscribe me under if 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.090
 namely want to support otherwise 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.560
 is it as always to another 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.700
 Criticism and here comes how to 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.260

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.550
