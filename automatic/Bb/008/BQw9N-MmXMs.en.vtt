00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
didn't think the door was going to be

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.700 
didn't think the door was going to be
acting<00:00:32.790> very<00:00:32.910> much<00:00:33.149> longer<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.719> don't<00:00:34.530> see

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
acting very much longer I don't see

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.740

Chelsea<00:00:35.160> ammonia<00:00:35.550> I'd<00:00:35.730> now<00:00:35.910> dropping<00:00:36.480> too

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
Chelsea ammonia I'd now dropping too

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.900 
Chelsea ammonia I'd now dropping too
many<00:00:36.899> points<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.320> don't<00:00:37.530> think<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.950> with<00:00:38.850> all

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
many points I don't think that with all

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.160 
many points I don't think that with all
due<00:00:39.059> respect<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.360> don't<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.600> ask<00:00:39.750> them<00:00:39.930> really

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
due respect I don't we ask them really

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.110 
due respect I don't we ask them really
did<00:00:41.040> enough<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.309> win<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.730> game<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.059> know

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
did enough to win that game you know

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.650 
did enough to win that game you know
yeah<00:00:42.360> wasn't<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.870> greatest<00:00:42.989> performance<00:00:43.680> I

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
yeah wasn't the greatest performance I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.180 
yeah wasn't the greatest performance I
think<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.960> think<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.500> be<00:00:46.590> fair<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
think I think to be fair that the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.889 
think I think to be fair that the
resultant<00:00:47.789> midweight<00:00:48.120> will<00:00:48.570> probably

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
resultant midweight will probably

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.330 
resultant midweight will probably
concentrate<00:00:49.379> their<00:00:49.559> minds<00:00:49.710> even<00:00:49.920> more<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
concentrate their minds even more on the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.860 
concentrate their minds even more on the
Premiership<00:00:50.789> because<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.090> now<00:00:51.210> odds<00:00:51.449> are<00:00:51.660> that

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
Premiership because it now odds are that

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.410 
Premiership because it now odds are that
it's<00:00:52.680> great<00:00:52.890> there's<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> huge<00:00:53.789> possibility<00:00:54.030> i

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
it's great there's a huge possibility i

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.970 
it's great there's a huge possibility i
think<00:00:54.570> they<00:00:54.690> want<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.989> six<00:00:55.230> percent<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.829> get

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
think they want a six percent to get

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.430 
think they want a six percent to get
through<00:00:56.780> that<00:00:57.780> they'll<00:00:57.960> go<00:00:58.079> out<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.379> this

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
through that they'll go out of this

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.779 
through that they'll go out of this
competition<00:00:58.649> now<00:00:59.039> i<00:00:59.070> don't<00:00:59.309> think<00:00:59.579> it's<00:00:59.699> as

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
competition now i don't think it's as

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.189 
competition now i don't think it's as
clear<00:01:00.000> cut<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.480> think<00:01:00.660> Arsenal<00:01:01.020> you

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
clear cut as that I think Arsenal you

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.569 
clear cut as that I think Arsenal you
know<00:01:01.469> with<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.859> place<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.250> they've<00:01:02.370> gotten

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
know with the place that they've gotten

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.250 
know with the place that they've gotten
a<00:01:02.640> break<00:01:02.760> Michaels<00:01:03.359> bar<00:01:03.570> son<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> few<00:01:03.989> problems

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
a break Michaels bar son a few problems

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.550 
a break Michaels bar son a few problems
but<00:01:04.409> that's<00:01:05.309> nothing<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:05.850> their<00:01:06.560> arsenal

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
but that's nothing in all their arsenal

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.200 
but that's nothing in all their arsenal
will<00:01:07.680> look<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.130> game<00:01:08.400> they'll<00:01:08.820> be

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.610 
against
Barcelona<00:02:13.129> yeah<00:02:13.930> it's<00:02:14.930> not<00:02:15.140> as<00:02:15.230> clear-cut<00:02:15.440> as

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
Barcelona yeah it's not as clear-cut as

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.470 
Barcelona yeah it's not as clear-cut as
we<00:02:15.799> make<00:02:15.980> out<00:02:16.190> but<00:02:16.519> it's<00:02:16.640> very<00:02:16.760> difficult<00:02:17.269> to

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
we make out but it's very difficult to

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.300 
we make out but it's very difficult to
look<00:02:17.629> at<00:02:17.750> past<00:02:17.900> yes<00:02:18.500> dost<00:02:18.739> certainly<00:02:19.190> isn't

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
look at past yes dost certainly isn't

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.619 
look at past yes dost certainly isn't
even<00:02:19.670> though<00:02:19.819> they've<00:02:20.030> got<00:02:20.180> those<00:02:20.330> injuries

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
even though they've got those injuries

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.750 
even though they've got those injuries
it<00:02:20.780> doesn't<00:02:21.140> really<00:02:21.319> sway<00:02:21.680> us<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:22.129> back<00:02:22.519> our

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
it doesn't really sway us to back our

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.800 
it doesn't really sway us to back our
walls<00:02:22.940> on<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.209> hand<00:02:23.360> okay<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:23.540> think<00:02:23.659> you

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
walls on the hand okay I think you

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.479 
walls on the hand okay I think you
notice<00:02:24.080> when<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.620> played<00:02:24.799> arsenal<00:02:25.099> played

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
notice when you played arsenal played

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.220 
notice when you played arsenal played
wolves<00:02:25.790> at<00:02:25.940> wolves<00:02:26.269> yeah<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:26.959> they<00:02:27.049> won't

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
wolves at wolves yeah and they won't

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.300 
wolves at wolves yeah and they won't
fall<00:02:27.409> now<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.650> mean<00:02:27.860> it's<00:02:27.980> still<00:02:28.010> very

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
fall now I mean it's still very

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.190 
fall now I mean it's still very
