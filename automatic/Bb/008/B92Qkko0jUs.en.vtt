00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:32.790
 the beauty 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:48.360
 today I'll teach you how to do 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:01:11.550
 a water pump and other materials 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:01:20.690
 along the river is a very close friend and I 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:20.690
 I want the video anything my 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:44.270
 based materials materials needed 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:49.799
 durepoxi batteries wired batteries 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.030
 stylus scissors tape lighter ink 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.329
 gouache 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:59.460
 but it is the motor vessel of being of a 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:04.310
 that go into the ink cover 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:09.060
 gouache or plastic pet bottle cap 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:13.640
 to make the turbine or to have it 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.739
 into the container or lid 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.260
 card also has to be this way 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.260
 everything has to go inside the container 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.210
 and the water is green so it's by 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.830
 cause of his remedy 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.830
 This is lupi. 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:43.850
 I will not use glue super bonder cover 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:48.380
 pen or metal tube to be part of 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.810
 suction and protective materials 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.910
 build the bomb 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:03:02.780
 so let's start then we need the 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:07.430
 the engine of a pet bottle cap that 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.280
 we can use or it is just the container of 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.800
 gouache paint 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.560
 so let's cut the right size 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:20.750
 Can you use a saw? 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:24.850
 but you can also use a knife and 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:38.270
 cut her 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:41.660
 so we'll cut it out here but it will 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:52.160
 it is better to cut lower than 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:55.280
 this will make a hole in the middle and pens already 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.040
 cut as big as you want 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.060
 so let's make a hole here but there's 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.060
 be of the same size 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:10.010
 So guys, after you've already made a 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:17.960
 enough hole to put here done 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:20.620
 a medium drill and then you will paste 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.620
 on here 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:32.410
 something else I've already said that can be 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.410
 the card is very hard 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.970
 very hard this here was back of a 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.840
 which is very perfect is because we have 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:50.120
 This entry to fit 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:53.790
 Then just pass the line and it's beauty. 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:05:06.060
 So one of you is going to do it too. 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:22.940
 This is because the and then just put all 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:22.940
 the set that just to hold the hive 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:35.490
 glue piece helps an adult 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:38.160
 I do this because the person in charge and this 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:48.770
 also limitation 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:54.390
 bond bonded or not and then just do it 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:58.680
 this and paste this part on the engine that 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:07.980
 It reminds me a bit of a turbo and now I 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:11.300
 I'll leave it here on the weak battery and 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:15.360
 when you 're ready, come back 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:22.290
 I discovered something up so you guys 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:23.880
 They'll put a lid on it, it 's cool, he 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:26.700
 it's this way the way we 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:32.900
 It looks like a shift, but now it has 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:36.260
 that 's all you need because now 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:43.070
 and here it is 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:46.780
 they made the water for him 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.780
 the exact amount 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:59.170
 Look at the speed that Brazil no longer 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.170
 I can lean more 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:10.070
 He plays well and plays more than just 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.780
 will fall out of the sink 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:22.580
 I do not think there's any problem in the eye. 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:25.180
 Engine does not look strong, it can make a 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.180
 safari 

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:47.870
 sometimes you can read but he already 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:49.970
 Do not lift more like the video then 

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:55.040
 You already know how to help me.
