recording or not but you can flip it
like<00:02:08.239> that<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:13.459> then<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.670> can<00:02:14.880> do<00:02:15.060> landscape

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
like that and then you can do landscape

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.979 
like that and then you can do landscape
or<00:02:15.840> portrait<00:02:15.870> or<00:02:17.209> you<00:02:18.209> can<00:02:18.420> set<00:02:18.660> up<00:02:18.780> multiple

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
or portrait or you can set up multiple

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.759 
or portrait or you can set up multiple
displays<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.819> can<00:02:21.060> do<00:02:21.390> dual<00:02:21.780> monitor<00:02:22.290> try

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
displays so you can do dual monitor try

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.460 
displays so you can do dual monitor try
monitor<00:02:23.190> quad<00:02:23.489> monitor<00:02:23.940> all<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.299> stuff<00:02:24.569> then

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
monitor quad monitor all that stuff then

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.670 
monitor quad monitor all that stuff then
you<00:02:25.560> can<00:02:25.739> do<00:02:25.910> stereoscopic<00:02:26.910> 3d<00:02:27.049> which<00:02:28.049> is<00:02:28.319> only

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
you can do stereoscopic 3d which is only

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.420 
you can do stereoscopic 3d which is only
if<00:02:29.220> your<00:02:29.400> monitors<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.450> graphics<00:02:31.110> card

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
if your monitors and graphics card

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.570 
if your monitors and graphics card
support<00:02:32.430> 3d<00:02:33.799> then<00:02:34.799> you<00:02:34.920> could<00:02:35.100> do<00:02:35.220> game

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
support 3d then you could do game

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.690 
support 3d then you could do game
compatibility<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:36.959> can<00:02:37.200> see<00:02:37.470> what<00:02:38.400> games

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
compatibility so you can see what games

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.940 
compatibility so you can see what games
you've<00:02:38.940> got<00:02:39.239> or<00:02:39.630> what<00:02:40.319> games<00:02:40.560> would<00:02:40.739> work

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
you've got or what games would work

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.309 
you've got or what games would work
great<00:02:41.250> with<00:02:43.790> ya<00:02:44.790> with<00:02:45.360> this<00:02:45.600> bear<00:02:46.049> with<00:02:46.200> your
