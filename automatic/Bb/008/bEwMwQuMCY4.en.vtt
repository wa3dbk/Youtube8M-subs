so that pretty much all you can't copy
and<00:05:26.070> paste<00:05:26.370> by<00:05:26.730> using<00:05:28.100> control-c<00:05:29.100> or<00:05:29.970> ctrl<00:05:30.630> V

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
and paste by using control-c or ctrl V

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.310 
and paste by using control-c or ctrl V
to<00:05:30.900> taste<00:05:31.169> that's<00:05:31.710> too<00:05:31.950> bad<00:05:32.100> but<00:05:32.460> well<00:05:33.330> and<00:05:33.990> you

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
to taste that's too bad but well and you

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.640 
to taste that's too bad but well and you
cannot<00:05:34.680> use<00:05:35.190> ctrl<00:05:35.790> P<00:05:36.240> and<00:05:36.690> stuff<00:05:37.110> to<00:05:37.410> print

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
cannot use ctrl P and stuff to print

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.370 
cannot use ctrl P and stuff to print
from<00:05:38.010> the<00:05:38.910> keyboard<00:05:39.210> as<00:05:39.510> well<00:05:39.540> so<00:05:40.020> you<00:05:40.080> have<00:05:40.230> to

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
from the keyboard as well so you have to

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.840 
from the keyboard as well so you have to
do<00:05:40.470> all<00:05:40.500> efforts<00:05:40.980> screen<00:05:42.020> but<00:05:43.020> anyway<00:05:43.700> go<00:05:44.700> back

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
do all efforts screen but anyway go back

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.790 
do all efforts screen but anyway go back
home<00:05:45.030> screen<00:05:46.580> I<00:05:48.050> suggest<00:05:49.050> using<00:05:49.350> a<00:05:49.560> keyboard

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800
