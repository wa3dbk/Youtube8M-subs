most<00:03:10.829> efficient<00:03:11.430> setup<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:12.000> we've<00:03:12.239> tested

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
most efficient setup is we've tested

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.720 
most efficient setup is we've tested
having<00:03:13.230> guys<00:03:13.409> mow<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.859> lawn<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.280> trim<00:03:14.579> the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
having guys mow the lawn and trim the

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.879 
having guys mow the lawn and trim the
bushes<00:03:15.030> at<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.180> same<00:03:15.480> time<00:03:15.720> we<00:03:16.440> have<00:03:16.560> figured

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
bushes at the same time we have figured

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.890 
bushes at the same time we have figured
out<00:03:17.040> what<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.310> fastest<00:03:17.940> most<00:03:18.239> efficient

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
out what the fastest most efficient

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.289 
out what the fastest most efficient
highest-quality<00:03:19.709> way<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.340> do<00:03:20.549> this<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:21.060> and

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
highest-quality way to do this is and

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:22.879 
highest-quality way to do this is and
that's<00:03:21.660> exactly<00:03:21.959> what<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.379> get<00:03:22.500> from<00:03:22.739> us
