00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:16.640
 I already shot a video about this there I 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.820
 Added file already format ringtone 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.730
 just found on the internet downloaded and 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:29.189
 through aytyuns added today I will show 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:32.309
 somewhat simpler option with 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.000
 using the program oh tuls here such 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.719
 program 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.550
 you can download it on our website 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:44.180
 there for windows 32 bit and 60 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.390
 four-bit there are two files 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.020
 install this program but you must 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.460
 stand 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.579
 Aytyuns and preferably banjour who 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.100
 installed along with this because 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.000
 sometimes the program swears at this banjur 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.250
 although it continues to work and so 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.470
 proceed 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.330
 i downloaded mp3 music one 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:20.360
 file show you just for example 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:23.360
 I launch the altus program and here it is 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.360
 booted up 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:40.680
 For the price and the device I have an iphone 4s waiting 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.280
 when it â€™s determined but our 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.460
 device 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.750
 everyone showed the program in English 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.409
 language, I think it's okay 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.670
 all phone information here you can 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.530
 With this program many operations 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.060
 produce with your phone in volume 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.860
 including applications 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.680
 and download media files separately 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.870

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.300
