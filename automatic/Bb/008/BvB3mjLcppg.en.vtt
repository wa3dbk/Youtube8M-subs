last<00:00:22.590> time<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:22.980> asked<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.340> what<00:00:23.490> makes<00:00:23.760> this

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
last time we asked you what makes this

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.120 
last time we asked you what makes this
fortune-tellers<00:00:24.930> fish<00:00:25.230> curl<00:00:25.650> up

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
fortune-tellers fish curl up

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.220 
fortune-tellers fish curl up
well<00:00:26.670> whatever<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.090> says<00:00:27.420> on<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> packet<00:00:28.050> it's

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
well whatever it says on the packet it's

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.529 
well whatever it says on the packet it's
nothing<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.890> do<00:00:29.039> with<00:00:29.070> love<00:00:29.640> passion<00:00:30.330> or

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
nothing to do with love passion or

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.269 
nothing to do with love passion or
jealousy<00:00:31.140> it's<00:00:31.590> really<00:00:32.009> much<00:00:32.250> more

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
jealousy it's really much more

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.440 
jealousy it's really much more
scientific<00:00:33.320> heat<00:00:34.320> makes<00:00:34.920> things<00:00:35.280> expand<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
scientific heat makes things expand and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.080 
scientific heat makes things expand and
some<00:00:36.840> things<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.530> celluloid<00:00:38.160> expand

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
some things like celluloid expand

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.270 
some things like celluloid expand
enormously<00:00:39.420> when<00:00:39.989> they're<00:00:40.170> heated<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.739> facts

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
enormously when they're heated in facts

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.180 
enormously when they're heated in facts
six<00:00:41.550> times<00:00:41.879> more<00:00:42.030> than<00:00:42.239> most<00:00:42.600> metals<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
six times more than most metals so the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.190 
six times more than most metals so the
warmth<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.700> my<00:00:44.760> hand<00:00:45.270> causes<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.989> molecules

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
warmth of my hand causes the molecules

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.529 
warmth of my hand causes the molecules
on<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> underside<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.610> fish<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.120> stretch

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
on the underside of the fish to stretch

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.080 
on the underside of the fish to stretch
but<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> molecules<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> top<00:00:50.370> side<00:00:50.640> don't

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
but the molecules on the top side don't

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.500 
but the molecules on the top side don't
and<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> fish<00:00:52.350> curls<00:00:52.829> over<00:00:53.430> now<00:00:54.300> there

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
and so the fish curls over now there

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.350 
and so the fish curls over now there
isn't<00:00:54.809> much<00:00:55.020> passion<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.980> plate<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:57.120> if

isn't much passion in a plate but if

isn't much passion in a plate but if
it's<00:00:57.539> warm<00:00:57.840> enough<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:59.280> fortune-tellers

eliminating all them we've had to come
to<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:25.990> conclusion<00:05:26.380> it<00:05:26.500> must<00:05:26.620> be<00:05:26.860> the<00:05:27.010> diet

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
to the conclusion it must be the diet

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.880 
to the conclusion it must be the diet
yeah<00:05:27.970> the<00:05:28.390> significance<00:05:28.990> of<00:05:29.080> that<00:05:29.140> is<00:05:29.560> that

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
yeah the significance of that is that

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.520 
yeah the significance of that is that
there<00:05:30.430> was<00:05:30.610> a<00:05:30.640> sudden<00:05:30.970> change<00:05:31.120> of<00:05:31.720> diet<00:05:32.230> if<00:05:32.410> you

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
there was a sudden change of diet if you

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.020 
there was a sudden change of diet if you
just<00:05:32.710> bear<00:05:32.860> in<00:05:32.950> mind<00:05:32.980> the<00:05:33.310> anglers<00:05:33.610> bite<00:05:33.790> makes

to<00:06:38.409> fish<00:06:38.699> from<00:06:39.699> the<00:06:39.789> previous<00:06:40.210> years<00:06:40.599> and

00:06:40.829 --> 00:06:40.839 
to fish from the previous years and

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:42.480 
to fish from the previous years and
that's<00:06:41.499> when<00:06:41.680> you<00:06:41.740> started<00:06:42.099> feeding<00:06:42.339> them

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
that's when you started feeding them

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.399 
that's when you started feeding them
large<00:06:42.969> quantities<00:06:43.479> of<00:06:43.509> port<00:06:43.839> luncheon<00:06:44.229> meat

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:44.409 
large quantities of port luncheon meat

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:46.889 
large quantities of port luncheon meat
that<00:06:44.800> is<00:06:44.860> right<00:06:45.249> yeah<00:06:45.550> well<00:06:46.240> it's<00:06:46.539> a<00:06:46.749> very

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:46.899 
that is right yeah well it's a very

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:49.110 
that is right yeah well it's a very
interesting<00:06:47.020> theory<00:06:47.740> and<00:06:48.159> also<00:06:48.789> rather<00:06:48.999> a

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
interesting theory and also rather a

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.499 
interesting theory and also rather a
worrying<00:06:49.569> one<00:06:49.809> yeah<00:06:50.969> ray<00:06:51.969> and<00:06:52.300> the<00:06:52.389> other

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:52.509 
worrying one yeah ray and the other

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:54.059 
worrying one yeah ray and the other
fisherman<00:06:52.990> wouldn't<00:06:53.499> describe<00:06:53.830> themselves

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:54.069 
fisherman wouldn't describe themselves

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:56.459 
fisherman wouldn't describe themselves
as<00:06:54.459> scientists<00:06:54.999> but<00:06:55.749> they've<00:06:55.930> taken<00:06:56.259> a

00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:56.469 
as scientists but they've taken a

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:58.980 
as scientists but they've taken a
scientific<00:06:57.129> approach<00:06:57.990> observation

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
scientific approach observation

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.559 
scientific approach observation
measurement<00:06:59.229> and<00:06:59.800> collection<00:07:00.249> of<00:07:00.339> data

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:00.569 
measurement and collection of data

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:02.820 
measurement and collection of data
followed<00:07:01.569> by<00:07:01.719> thought<00:07:02.020> about<00:07:02.229> a<00:07:02.289> possible

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
followed by thought about a possible

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.309 
followed by thought about a possible
theory<00:07:03.569> scientists<00:07:04.569> work<00:07:04.719> in<00:07:04.839> just<00:07:04.990> the<00:07:05.169> same

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 
theory scientists work in just the same

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:08.790 
theory scientists work in just the same
way<00:07:05.379> as<00:07:06.129> yet<00:07:06.969> there<00:07:07.569> is<00:07:07.689> no<00:07:07.899> official<00:07:08.379> Theory

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
way as yet there is no official Theory

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.040 
way as yet there is no official Theory
the<00:07:09.370> for<00:07:09.610> scientific<00:07:10.209> experiment<00:07:10.899> would<00:07:10.990> be

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050 
the for scientific experiment would be

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.499 
the for scientific experiment would be
needed<00:07:11.469> with<00:07:11.649> fish<00:07:12.009> on<00:07:12.189> different<00:07:12.550> diets<00:07:12.759> in

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:13.509 
needed with fish on different diets in

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:15.300 
needed with fish on different diets in
order<00:07:13.749> to<00:07:13.839> establish<00:07:14.009> exactly<00:07:15.009> what<00:07:15.159> the

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.310 
order to establish exactly what the

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.610 
order to establish exactly what the
cause<00:07:15.490> is

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 
cause is

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.409 
cause is
of<00:07:17.620> course<00:07:17.860> you<00:07:18.279> don't<00:07:18.399> eat<00:07:18.610> barb<00:07:18.909> or<00:07:19.120> you

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:19.419 
of course you don't eat barb or you

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:21.719 
of course you don't eat barb or you
always<00:07:19.779> put<00:07:19.990> the<00:07:20.110> bank<00:07:20.349> how<00:07:21.309> would<00:07:21.490> you<00:07:21.580> like

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:21.729 
always put the bank how would you like

become<00:07:43.410> interested<00:07:43.830> in<00:07:44.220> Natural<00:07:44.550> History<00:07:44.910> oh

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:45.030 
become interested in Natural History oh

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.510 
become interested in Natural History oh
my<00:07:45.360> father<00:07:45.630> interested<00:07:46.470> me<00:07:46.650> in<00:07:46.950> Natural
