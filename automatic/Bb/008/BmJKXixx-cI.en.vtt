00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.830
 to make a recipe and let's do 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.830
 something that had corn that we are going to make 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.010
 today then commemorating May 25 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:26.420
 let's make empanadas de humita 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.890
 we are going to place 300 grams of flour that 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.610
 it can be in this case I did it with 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.640
 integral flour we are going to put 8 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:38.800
 tablespoons of oil 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.800
 then a splash of vinegar 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.070
 a little bit of salt 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.320
 and a little pepper 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:53.040
 how much water are we going to put to 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.040
 this preparation 150 milliliters of water 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:01.429
 It comes out as to put together two tapas 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.820
 two pie disks we would leave half 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:06.950
 hour resting the dough in the refrigerator 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.690
 we will find that we have it 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.610
 you always have to put it for example in 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.700
 order so that the part of 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.260
 see I above with a light dusting 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.260
 flour we stretch 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:30.259
 we leave it finite 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.259
 how much and 2 millimeters 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.340
 and we started cutting because I'm going to do 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.340
 a lot bigger pancakes 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.880
 ah 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.939
 and what we are doing is the following 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.600
 movement looks 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:53.470
 I'm stepping on it 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:57.790
 but I'm leaving a surface in the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.100
 base of approximately 7 centimeters of 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.930
 diameter 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.150
 let's do the other one over there is 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.340
 It is necessary that in the crease stick with a 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.959
 little bit of water 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:14.819
 now in a source that is oiled and 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:17.340
 let's put the baskets this is a 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.760
 Minute oven one second and oven 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.760
 maximum 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.420
 what I 'm going to teach you now is to do 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:28.250
 a healthy white sauce at 100 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:33.750
 milliliters of milk a tablespoon 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:36.900
 full of corn starch well let's go 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.410
 make 200 milliliters of milk then 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.850
 I put 2 heaping tablespoons 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:48.170
 of corn starch we grab the milk 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.170
 a trickle first 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.990
 complete in this case until 200 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.990
 milliliters 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.010
 this preparation if it goes to the fire we go 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:14.190
 the corn in the sea what in the common corn 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.190
 it's a vegetable however when you 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.490
 take it out of the sea and dry it is a 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:24.900
 cereal I 'll tell you how we have to 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:28.800
 prepare the yellow stepped corn shopping 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.550
 the package yes and you have to leave it 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.890
 soak well 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.830
 all night and once everything is already 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.290
 Soak it two or three times but wash it 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:44.890
 with that boil very well here we have 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.890
 this is the this yellow corn 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.710
 all right 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.110
 with the white sauce is to season the 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.810
 what is the secret of a white sauce 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.630
 the nutmeg and what else are we going 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.520
 put very little salt this is the time to 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.970
 add the fat we are going to 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.770
 put a little olive oil 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.820
 we add oil 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.820
 a little bit of salt 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:17.000
 and the nutmeg once we already have 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.780
 the white sauce prepared we are going to 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.540
 add 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.540
 the yellow corn stepped on 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.430
 then it's like we bleach it a 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.980
 little in the oven and you see that 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.780
 directly what good are armed 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.780
 we add is of the preparation 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:45.360
 the res in masters until it reaches well yes 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:48.910
 and directly here you know that we add 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:53.169
 a little bit of grated mozzarella 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:57.070
 if it is lean better and if not how many 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:05:01.330
 I'm going to put one 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:03.910
 slice of tomato and top the mozzarella 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.720
 and this is going to go to the oven 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:11.140
 You put 300 grams of wholemeal flour 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:16.240
 150 milliliters of water salt a little bit of 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:19.720
 lemon pepper or vinegar and also 8 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.660
 tablespoons of oil to masses until 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:26.380
 you get a well homogenous mass you leave it 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:30.100
 rest in the refrigerator and then the 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:33.370
 stretches with stick you cut the circles 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.520
 for our eagerness once 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:40.720
 armed the same the white ones in the 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:44.410
 oven soak corn stepped yellow it 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:47.680
 boil until well blended to 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:50.290
 the white sauce a spoonful of starch 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.920
 of corn per 100 milliliters of milk 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.600
 skimmed then once cooked you 're going 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.350
 add the fat that is going to be 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:03.760
 oil that is optional and spice up the 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:05.740
 well with nutmeg and very little salt 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.500
 then you have to assemble the 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:12.190
 baskets together with the filling 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:15.280
 and I'll use the lean grated for 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.740
 that an option is well or tasty 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.470
 alternative is to put a slice of 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:25.290
 tomato very well here we finished 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.290
