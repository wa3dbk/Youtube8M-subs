boat<00:00:31.019> rots<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.700> that<00:00:32.700> wouldn't<00:00:32.940> be<00:00:33.030> cool

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
boat rots and that wouldn't be cool

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:53.120 
boat rots and that wouldn't be cool
after<00:00:33.450> all<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.870> work

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.530 

spreading<00:00:54.130> the<00:00:54.160> epoxy<00:00:54.760> the<00:00:54.880> process<00:00:55.360> is

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
spreading the epoxy the process is

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.020 
spreading the epoxy the process is
pretty<00:00:55.690> much<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.020> same<00:00:56.410> throughout<00:00:57.030> just

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
pretty much the same throughout just

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.790 
pretty much the same throughout just
pour<00:00:58.300> a<00:00:58.330> pile<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:58.630> you<00:00:58.990> start<00:00:59.290> using<00:00:59.470> a

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
pour a pile and you start using a

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.840 
pour a pile and you start using a
squeegee<00:01:00.340> to<00:01:00.520> spread<00:01:00.880> the<00:01:01.000> stuff<00:01:01.210> out<00:01:02.700> see<00:01:03.700> the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
squeegee to spread the stuff out see the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.390 
squeegee to spread the stuff out see the
layers<00:01:04.059> or<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:04.809> layers<00:01:04.989> really<00:01:05.440> thin<00:01:05.710> takes

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
layers or the layers really thin takes

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.250 
layers or the layers really thin takes
almost<00:01:06.610> nothing<00:01:07.000> to<00:01:07.240> get<00:01:07.360> that<00:01:07.570> initial<00:01:07.810> code

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
almost nothing to get that initial code

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.880 
almost nothing to get that initial code
in<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:10.270> then<00:01:10.510> if<00:01:10.630> you<00:01:10.750> have<00:01:10.900> extra<00:01:11.260> you<00:01:11.860> can

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
in and then if you have extra you can

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.590 
in and then if you have extra you can
just<00:01:12.220> kind<00:01:12.430> of<00:01:12.490> spread<00:01:12.760> it<00:01:12.910> out<00:01:13.030> throughout

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
just kind of spread it out throughout

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.620 
just kind of spread it out throughout
because<00:01:14.580> you're<00:01:15.580> not<00:01:15.700> going<00:01:15.910> to<00:01:15.970> have<00:01:16.150> way<00:01:16.570> too

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
because you're not going to have way too

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.719 
because you're not going to have way too
much<00:01:16.990> unless<00:01:17.530> it's<00:01:17.770> big<00:01:17.979> glob<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:18.520> you're<00:01:18.640> not

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
much unless it's big glob and you're not

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.100 
much unless it's big glob and you're not
going<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:18.940> have<00:01:19.119> wait<00:01:19.330> you<00:01:19.479> little<00:01:19.660> unless<00:01:19.990> you
