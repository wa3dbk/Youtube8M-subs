that's<00:02:21.450> unique<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.080> product<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.739> that<00:02:22.770> it

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
that's unique to this product is that it

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.699 
that's unique to this product is that it
has<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.190> stylist<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.750> when<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.380> pull<00:02:25.590> the

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
has a stylist so when you pull the

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.229 
has a stylist so when you pull the
stylus<00:02:26.130> out<00:02:27.680> it<00:02:28.680> automatically<00:02:29.280> launches<00:02:29.880> the

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
stylus out it automatically launches the

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.090 
stylus out it automatically launches the
stylus<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.320> what<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:31.980> can<00:02:32.160> do<00:02:32.400> here<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:34.100> you

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
stylus and what you can do here is you

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.640 
stylus and what you can do here is you
can<00:02:35.250> be<00:02:35.400> able<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.820> take<00:02:36.360> notes<00:02:36.630> directly<00:02:37.020> but

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
can be able to take notes directly but

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.560 
can be able to take notes directly but
the<00:02:37.770> really<00:02:37.950> good<00:02:38.160> thing<00:02:38.370> about<00:02:38.489> this<00:02:38.940> stylus

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
the really good thing about this stylus

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.259 
the really good thing about this stylus
is<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.230> has<00:02:40.440> very<00:02:40.800> very<00:02:41.070> low<00:02:41.280> latency<00:02:41.820> so

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
is that it has very very low latency so

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.820 
is that it has very very low latency so
I<00:02:42.299> could<00:02:42.510> scribble<00:02:42.900> very<00:02:43.140> fast<00:02:43.440> on<00:02:43.650> this

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
I could scribble very fast on this

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.660 
I could scribble very fast on this
screen<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.640> it's<00:02:45.150> not<00:02:45.330> going<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.540> fall<00:02:45.780> behind

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
screen and it's not going to fall behind

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.720 
screen and it's not going to fall behind
so<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.940> can<00:02:48.239> also<00:02:48.450> erase<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.370> but<00:02:50.370> what's<00:02:50.519> even

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
so I can also erase this but what's even

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.300 
so I can also erase this but what's even
better<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:51.390> that<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.989> does<00:02:52.200> primer<00:02:52.680> rejection

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
better is that it does primer rejection

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.630 
better is that it does primer rejection
so<00:02:53.910> i<00:02:53.940> can<00:02:54.239> write<00:02:54.510> directly<00:02:54.950> while<00:02:55.950> resting<00:02:56.370> my

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
so i can write directly while resting my

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.060 
so i can write directly while resting my
hand<00:02:56.880> on<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.360> screen<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.870> still<00:02:58.590> keep<00:02:58.769> very

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
hand on the screen and still keep very

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.360 
hand on the screen and still keep very
very<00:02:59.370> low<00:02:59.580> latency<00:03:00.410> notice<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.590> capacitive

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
very low latency notice is a capacitive

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.090 
very low latency notice is a capacitive
touch<00:03:02.580> stylus<00:03:02.880> or<00:03:03.269> is<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.540> special

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
touch stylus or is it a special

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.540 
touch stylus or is it a special
digitizer<00:03:05.100> touch<00:03:05.910> stylus

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:16.300 

so<00:03:13.930> this<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:14.959> that<00:03:15.290> standard<00:03:15.740> capacitive

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
so this is that standard capacitive

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.250 
so this is that standard capacitive
touch<00:03:16.490> stylus<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:17.420> some<00:03:17.660> of<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.810> other<00:03:17.959> tools

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
touch stylus so some of the other tools

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.960 
touch stylus so some of the other tools
that<00:03:18.410> are<00:03:18.440> included<00:03:18.800> in<00:03:19.040> this<00:03:19.160> device<00:03:19.670> is

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
that are included in this device is

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.530 
that are included in this device is
obviously<00:03:20.360> some<00:03:21.280> great<00:03:22.280> functionality<00:03:22.819> if<00:03:23.300> I

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
obviously some great functionality if I

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.410 
obviously some great functionality if I
look<00:03:23.750> at<00:03:24.069> if<00:03:25.069> I'm<00:03:25.340> browsing<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.940> web<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.330> I

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
look at if I'm browsing the web and I

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.910 
look at if I'm browsing the web and I
see<00:03:26.600> something<00:03:26.959> that's<00:03:27.050> interesting<00:03:27.650> that<00:03:27.890> i

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
see something that's interesting that i

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.380 
see something that's interesting that i
would<00:03:28.100> like<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.400> snip<00:03:28.700> and<00:03:28.850> send<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:29.209> some

would like to snip and send to some

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.930 
would like to snip and send to some
friends<00:03:29.750> i<00:03:29.930> can<00:03:30.410> last<00:03:30.650> through<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.010> area<00:03:31.730> of

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
friends i can last through the area of

send that out as well or I could say
that<00:03:55.310> it's<00:03:55.670> an<00:03:55.790> image<00:03:57.670> it<00:03:58.670> doesn't<00:03:59.090> matter

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
that it's an image it doesn't matter

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.259 
that it's an image it doesn't matter
what's<00:03:59.569> behind<00:03:59.780> this<00:04:00.140> I<00:04:00.319> could<00:04:00.590> do<00:04:00.739> that<00:04:00.769> same

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
what's behind this I could do that same

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.059 
what's behind this I could do that same
functionality<00:04:02.269> even<00:04:03.019> on<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.260> home<00:04:03.470> screen<00:04:03.650> so

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
functionality even on the home screen so

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.530 
functionality even on the home screen so
if<00:04:04.160> i<00:04:04.250> wanted<00:04:04.519> to<00:04:04.640> highlight<00:04:04.850> something<00:04:05.269> on

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
if i wanted to highlight something on

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.300 
if i wanted to highlight something on
the<00:04:05.660> particular<00:04:05.930> home<00:04:06.350> screen<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:06.890> highlight

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
the particular home screen and highlight

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.490 
the particular home screen and highlight
i<00:04:07.519> could<00:04:07.970> do<00:04:08.090> that<00:04:08.269> and<00:04:08.540> I<00:04:08.660> could<00:04:08.870> send<00:04:09.170> or<00:04:09.470> I

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
i could do that and I could send or I
