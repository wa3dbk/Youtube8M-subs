00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
two and I'm actually getting one of them

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.749 
two and I'm actually getting one of them
fixed<00:04:42.319> here<00:04:42.830> within<00:04:43.009> the<00:04:43.129> next<00:04:43.159> couple<00:04:43.340> weeks

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
fixed here within the next couple weeks

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.879 
fixed here within the next couple weeks
but<00:04:44.360> they<00:04:44.509> were<00:04:44.599> the<00:04:44.689> older<00:04:44.960> versions<00:04:45.349> and

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
but they were the older versions and

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.149 
but they were the older versions and
they<00:04:46.759> were<00:04:46.819> pretty<00:04:47.090> much<00:04:47.330> my<00:04:47.509> fault<00:04:47.599> so<00:04:48.259> except

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159 
they were pretty much my fault so except

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:50.499 
they were pretty much my fault so except
for<00:04:49.280> one<00:04:49.400> of<00:04:49.460> them<00:04:49.610> one<00:04:49.759> of<00:04:49.789> them<00:04:49.909> wasn't<00:04:50.180> the

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
for one of them one of them wasn't the

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:53.260 
for one of them one of them wasn't the
other<00:04:50.629> one<00:04:50.840> was<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.830> most<00:04:52.159> recent<00:04:52.580> one<00:04:52.610> so

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
other one was the most recent one so

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.939 
other one was the most recent one so
they<00:04:53.840> are<00:04:53.960> kind<00:04:53.990> of<00:04:54.199> prone<00:04:54.409> to<00:04:54.530> breaking

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
they are kind of prone to breaking

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.010 
they are kind of prone to breaking
they're<00:04:55.069> not<00:04:55.189> the<00:04:55.310> most<00:04:55.340> durable<00:04:55.909> but<00:04:56.210> I<00:04:56.449> can

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
they're not the most durable but I can

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.600 
they're not the most durable but I can
say<00:04:57.800> a<00:04:57.830> lot<00:04:57.889> of<00:04:58.069> really<00:04:58.219> good<00:04:58.310> things<00:04:58.370> about

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
say a lot of really good things about

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.510

action is just I think it's the best
crankbait<00:05:22.639> action<00:05:23.029> out<00:05:23.150> there<00:05:23.210> and<00:05:23.599> it's

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
crankbait action out there and it's

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.290 
crankbait action out there and it's
extremely<00:05:24.139> light<00:05:24.439> with<00:05:24.680> the<00:05:24.860> EV<00:05:25.279> a<00:05:25.310> foam<00:05:25.639> grip

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
extremely light with the EV a foam grip

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.189
