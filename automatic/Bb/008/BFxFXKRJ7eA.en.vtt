defense begins d4 f5 and here white has
many<00:00:29.029> options<00:00:30.029> at<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.660> disposal<00:00:32.239> here<00:00:33.239> we're

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
many options at the disposal here we're

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.510 
many options at the disposal here we're
going<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> look<00:00:33.809> at<00:00:34.309> Bishop<00:00:35.309> g5<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:37.250> in<00:00:38.250> this

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
going to look at Bishop g5 and in this

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.209 
going to look at Bishop g5 and in this
trap<00:00:38.899> we'll<00:00:39.899> see<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> couple<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.649> options<00:00:40.829> for

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
trap we'll see a couple of options for

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.970 
trap we'll see a couple of options for
black<00:00:41.570> but<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.719> really<00:00:42.930> when<00:00:43.469> black<00:00:43.710> plays

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
black but it's really when black plays

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.440 
black but it's really when black plays
very<00:00:44.879> aggressively<00:00:46.250> seeking<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.610> push<00:00:48.149> and

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
very aggressively seeking to push and

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.439 
very aggressively seeking to push and
trap<00:00:49.320> wise<00:00:50.219> dark<00:00:50.640> square<00:00:50.940> bishop<00:00:52.640> so<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
trap wise dark square bishop so the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.950 
trap wise dark square bishop so the
truck<00:00:54.660> continues<00:00:55.340> h6

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
truck continues h6

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:08.090 
truck continues h6
Bishop<00:00:57.960> h4<00:00:59.420> g5<00:01:01.579> Bishop<00:01:02.579> g3<00:01:04.610> f4<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.950> in<00:01:07.950> this

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
Bishop h4 g5 Bishop g3 f4 and in this

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.170 
Bishop h4 g5 Bishop g3 f4 and in this
position<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.909> seems<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:09.720> White<00:01:10.470> has<00:01:11.250> lost

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
position it seems as if White has lost

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.219 
position it seems as if White has lost
their<00:01:12.600> dark<00:01:12.869> square<00:01:13.140> bishop<00:01:14.630> however<00:01:15.630> if<00:01:15.930> we

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
their dark square bishop however if we

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.670 
their dark square bishop however if we
look<00:01:16.259> at<00:01:16.590> blacks<00:01:16.890> King<00:01:17.400> side<00:01:17.670> pawns<00:01:18.470> we<00:01:19.470> can

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
look at blacks King side pawns we can

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.539 
look at blacks King side pawns we can
see<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.700> their<00:01:21.210> King<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.750> very<00:01:22.530> exposed<00:01:23.130> on

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
see that their King is very exposed on

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:33.200 
see that their King is very exposed on
this<00:01:24.299> diagonal<00:01:25.759> so<00:01:29.180> ìiî<00:01:30.180> ìiî<00:01:31.850> opens<00:01:32.850> up<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
this diagonal so ìiî ìiî opens up the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.690 
this diagonal so ìiî ìiî opens up the
immediate<00:01:33.750> threat<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.680> checkmate<00:01:35.570> with<00:01:36.570> queen

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
immediate threat of checkmate with queen

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.450 
immediate threat of checkmate with queen
h5<00:01:39.020> exploiting<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.229> horribly<00:01:41.189> weak

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
h5 exploiting this horribly weak

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.139 
h5 exploiting this horribly weak
diagonal<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.630> what<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.770> black<00:01:47.130> do<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.850> this

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
diagonal so what can black do in this

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.830 
diagonal so what can black do in this
situation<00:01:49.579> well<00:01:50.579> let's<00:01:51.000> take<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> look<00:01:51.509> at<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
situation well let's take a look at the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.230 
situation well let's take a look at the
diagram<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.009> consider<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.790> challenges

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
diagram and consider the challenges

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.780 
diagram and consider the challenges
facing<00:01:54.570> black<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.229> white<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.490> threats

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
facing black and white and the threats

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.080 
facing black and white and the threats
that<00:01:57.119> are<00:01:57.630> present<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.140> board<00:01:59.000> at<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
that are present on the board at the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.789 
that are present on the board at the
moment<00:02:00.420> there's<00:02:00.689> an<00:02:00.780> imminent<00:02:01.200> threat<00:02:01.560> of

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
moment there's an imminent threat of

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.800 
moment there's an imminent threat of
queen<00:02:02.490> h5<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.840> black<00:02:04.140> must<00:02:04.590> do<00:02:04.770> something<00:02:05.040> to

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
queen h5 so black must do something to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.170 
queen h5 so black must do something to
protect<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.619> square<00:02:10.069> black<00:02:11.069> also<00:02:11.370> has<00:02:11.640> one

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
protect this square black also has one

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.500 
protect this square black also has one
eye<00:02:12.209> on<00:02:12.750> capturing<00:02:13.470> this<00:02:14.069> dark<00:02:14.760> square<00:02:15.030> Bishop

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
eye on capturing this dark square Bishop

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.110 
eye on capturing this dark square Bishop
on<00:02:16.250> g3<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:20.040> let's<00:02:20.879> first<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.300> all<00:02:21.420> consider<00:02:22.020> a

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
on g3 so let's first of all consider a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.150 
on g3 so let's first of all consider a
black<00:02:24.120> player<00:02:24.510> who<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.080> perhaps<00:02:25.620> at<00:02:25.980> least

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
black player who is perhaps at least

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.290 
black player who is perhaps at least
somewhat<00:02:26.700> defensively<00:02:27.270> minded<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:28.069> looks

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
somewhat defensively minded and looks

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.300 
somewhat defensively minded and looks
defending<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.959> main<00:02:31.230> threat<00:02:31.620> rather<00:02:32.099> than

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
defending the main threat rather than

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.500 
defending the main threat rather than
continuing<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.360> attempt<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.959> trap<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.470> bishop

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
continuing to attempt to trap the bishop

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.790 
continuing to attempt to trap the bishop
so<00:02:36.510> here<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:37.050> can<00:02:37.290> consider<00:02:38.569> 5<00:02:39.569> Knight<00:02:40.140> f6<00:02:40.500> and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
so here we can consider 5 Knight f6 and

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.839 
so here we can consider 5 Knight f6 and
here<00:02:43.800> we<00:02:44.099> can<00:02:44.280> see<00:02:44.489> that<00:02:45.030> white<00:02:45.450> can<00:02:45.720> simply

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
here we can see that white can simply

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:54.470 
here we can see that white can simply
play<00:02:47.849> a<00:02:48.150> takes<00:02:49.019> f4<00:02:50.510> G<00:02:51.510> takes<00:02:51.780> f<00:02:51.900> 4<00:02:53.060> Bishop<00:02:54.060> takes

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
play a takes f4 G takes f 4 Bishop takes

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.259 
play a takes f4 G takes f 4 Bishop takes
f4<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.680> white<00:02:56.550> is<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:56.940> clear<00:02:57.300> pawn<00:02:57.629> up<00:02:59.269> black

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
f4 and white is a clear pawn up black

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.589 
f4 and white is a clear pawn up black
still<00:03:00.599> has<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:01.290> liability<00:03:02.159> on<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:03.150> diagonal

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
still has a liability on this diagonal

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.149 
still has a liability on this diagonal
which<00:03:04.140> could<00:03:04.409> be<00:03:04.530> exploited

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
which could be exploited

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.250 
which could be exploited
perhaps<00:03:05.670> with<00:03:06.590> Bishop<00:03:07.590> e2<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:09.260> obviously

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
perhaps with Bishop e2 and obviously

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.630 
perhaps with Bishop e2 and obviously
blacks<00:03:10.860> King<00:03:11.340> side<00:03:11.670> is<00:03:13.040> decimated<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.250> we'll

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
blacks King side is decimated and we'll

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.050 
blacks King side is decimated and we'll
be<00:03:14.730> forced<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:16.099> reconsider<00:03:17.099> their<00:03:17.310> castling

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
be forced to reconsider their castling

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.309 
be forced to reconsider their castling
options<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.750> Castle<00:03:19.739> queenside<00:03:20.959> so<00:03:21.959> for<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
options and Castle queenside so for the

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.990 
options and Castle queenside so for the
average<00:03:22.409> of<00:03:22.709> Dutch<00:03:22.860> player<00:03:23.190> this<00:03:23.730> is

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
average of Dutch player this is

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.869 
average of Dutch player this is
uncomfortable<00:03:24.540> at<00:03:25.110> best<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.860> of<00:03:26.220> course<00:03:26.459> they

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
uncomfortable at best and of course they
