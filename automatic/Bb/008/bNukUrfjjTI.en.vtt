action it waddles quite well one issue

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.549 
action it waddles quite well one issue
that<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.600> at<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.899> particular<00:00:40.079> version

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
that I have at this particular version

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.970 
that I have at this particular version
this<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.129> three<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.520> half<00:00:41.730> inch<00:00:41.969> version

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
this is a three and a half inch version

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.049 
this is a three and a half inch version
was<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.430> thickness<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:46.700> you<00:00:47.700> know<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
was the thickness of this you know the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.990 
was the thickness of this you know the
back<00:00:48.840> end<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> tail<00:00:49.410> here<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.680> as<00:00:50.190> a

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
back end of the tail here and as a

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.080 
back end of the tail here and as a
result<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.170> tail<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:53.430> paddle<00:00:53.879> part

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
result of that the tail the paddle part

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.389 
result of that the tail the paddle part
ripped<00:00:54.600> off<00:00:54.890> sooner<00:00:55.890> than<00:00:56.039> we<00:00:56.190> would<00:00:56.309> have

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
ripped off sooner than we would have

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.099 
ripped off sooner than we would have
expected<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.329> number<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.719> instances<00:00:58.699> I<00:01:00.109> did

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
expected in a number of instances I did

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.110 
expected in a number of instances I did
not<00:01:01.320> use<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.800> four<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> half<00:01:02.190> inch<00:01:02.609> version

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
not use the four and a half inch version

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.899 
not use the four and a half inch version
of<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> swimmin<00:01:03.719> fluke<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.460> my<00:01:05.460> thoughts<00:01:05.729> are

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
of the swimmin fluke but my thoughts are

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.429 
of the swimmin fluke but my thoughts are
if<00:01:06.060> it's<00:01:06.180> bigger<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.750> might<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> more

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
if it's bigger it might have a more

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.010 
if it's bigger it might have a more
strong<00:01:07.830> tail<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.640> perhaps<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.240> better<00:01:09.810> all

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
strong tail and perhaps a better all

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.700 
strong tail and perhaps a better all
overall<00:01:10.409> beat<00:01:11.689> we<00:01:12.689> did<00:01:12.869> get<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.290> lot<00:01:13.590> of

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
overall beat we did get a lot of

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.890 
overall beat we did get a lot of
attention<00:01:13.950> with<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.520> guy<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
attention with this guy it's just the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.820 
attention with this guy it's just the
durability<00:01:16.470> was<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.619> factor<00:01:18.140> there<00:01:19.140> are<00:01:19.380> ten<00:01:19.710> in

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
durability was a factor there are ten in

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.010 
durability was a factor there are ten in
the<00:01:19.920> package<00:01:20.310> which<00:01:21.180> traditionally<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:21.750> be<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the package which traditionally can be a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.320 
the package which traditionally can be a
good<00:01:22.290> number<00:01:22.619> relevant<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.520> other<00:01:23.939> baits<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
good number relevant to other baits you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.289 
good number relevant to other baits you
buy<00:01:24.799> but<00:01:25.799> overall<00:01:26.159> does<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.700> longevity<00:01:26.880> and

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
buy but overall does the longevity and

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.719 
buy but overall does the longevity and
the<00:01:27.630> fact<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.159> they're<00:01:29.159> only<00:01:29.280> ten<00:01:29.579> I'll

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the fact that they're only ten I'll

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.069 
the fact that they're only ten I'll
probably<00:01:30.030> expect<00:01:30.329> like<00:01:30.450> fifteen<00:01:30.810> or<00:01:30.840> sixteen

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
probably expect like fifteen or sixteen

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.240 
probably expect like fifteen or sixteen
would<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> good<00:01:31.740> number<00:01:31.890> for<00:01:32.040> this

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
would be a good number for this

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.340 
would be a good number for this
packaging<00:01:32.729> didn't<00:01:33.689> think<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.869> was<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> best

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
packaging didn't think it was the best

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.580 
packaging didn't think it was the best
value<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> money<00:01:35.390> for<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.509> reason<00:01:36.869> I'm

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
value of the money for that reason I'm

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.520 
value of the money for that reason I'm
going<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.860> give<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.159> 3<00:01:38.579> out<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.759> 5<00:01:38.909> rating<00:01:39.530> I

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
going to give this a 3 out of 5 rating I

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.550 
going to give this a 3 out of 5 rating I
am<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> big<00:01:41.549> fan<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.790> zoom<00:01:42.450> products<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:43.380> this

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
am a big fan of zoom products but this

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.740 
am a big fan of zoom products but this
one<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:43.799> didn't<00:01:44.340> seem<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.610> sit<00:01:45.479> right<00:01:45.659> with

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
one just didn't seem to sit right with

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.330 
one just didn't seem to sit right with
me<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.140> would<00:01:46.409> probably<00:01:46.890> go<00:01:46.950> with<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.100> number<00:01:47.159> of

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
me I would probably go with a number of

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.960 
me I would probably go with a number of
other<00:01:47.840> types<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.960> lures<00:01:49.460> in<00:01:50.460> advance<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.880> this

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
other types of lures in advance of this

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.170
