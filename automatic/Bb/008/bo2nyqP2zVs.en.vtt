00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 r was playing me in alone they tell me 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.190
 that I should always follow the goal but 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.670
 but I do not want to pop because I should 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.410
 follow the goal jimmy your question is very 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.600
 interesting and has one more answer 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.820
 simple of what you think to follow the goal 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.400
 it is not a rule nor does it say that it is 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.350
 the best way to do it but think about it 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.660
 there are millions of people who do not know 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.439
 they know playing on rooftop equipment 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.330
 random 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.399
 these teams need synergy to 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.340
 win and there's no time to put on 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.290
 agreement and do a whole strategy like that 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.899
 that the easiest way is to have a plan 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.809
 roughly and this is where it comes in 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.910
 the goal to follow the goal is to give your 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.530
 team that synergy and that the taking of 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.770
 decisions within the game be 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.510
 much faster if you do not follow the goal 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.510
 the synergy of your team will go down to 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.680
 the floors will be distrustful of you 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.690
 possibly someone else simply you 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.430
 try like troll maybe you are trying 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.379
 a new strategy that works for you 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.539
 sometime but your team is not 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.970
 aware of this strategy and in the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.100
 team fights this can prove very 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.210
 and it will be reflected in your number 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.250
 defeats 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.800
 maybe playing as a team of 5 against 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.750
 5 this could coordinate after all 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.270
 they know each other and have enough time 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.280
 to get those energy but in alone 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.030
 not 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.640
 and now I understand 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.540
 what is the goal and why is it 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:32.310
 important and good and my luck in your 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.310
 next games and until next time 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.240
 Y 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.159
 do not
