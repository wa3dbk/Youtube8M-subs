started disassembling the panel and ran
across<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.490> breaker<00:00:23.850> with<00:00:24.090> these<00:00:24.240> little

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
across this breaker with these little

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.980 
across this breaker with these little
jumper<00:00:24.869> wires<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:26.100> load<00:00:26.550> side<00:00:26.850> of<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.210> are

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
jumper wires on the load side of the are

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.060 
jumper wires on the load side of the are
I'm<00:00:28.170> sorry<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.560> line<00:00:28.740> side<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.310> breaker

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
I'm sorry the line side of the breaker

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.260 
I'm sorry the line side of the breaker
obviously<00:00:32.070> somebody<00:00:32.460> got<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.790> here<00:00:32.940> kind<00:00:33.150> of

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
obviously somebody got in here kind of

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.990 
obviously somebody got in here kind of
knew<00:00:33.390> what<00:00:33.510> they<00:00:33.629> were<00:00:33.690> doing<00:00:34.160> you<00:00:35.160> know<00:00:35.820> that

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000

knew what they were doing you know that
they<00:00:36.120> had<00:00:36.360> big<00:00:37.320> cojones<00:00:37.879> they<00:00:38.879> ran<00:00:39.660> out<00:00:39.809> of

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
they had big cojones they ran out of

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.840 
they had big cojones they ran out of
buss<00:00:40.440> spacing<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.489> they<00:00:41.640> just

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
buss spacing in here so they just

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.250 
buss spacing in here so they just
figured<00:00:42.149> well<00:00:42.300> let's<00:00:42.420> just<00:00:42.809> go<00:00:42.930> ahead<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
figured well let's just go ahead and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.900 
figured well let's just go ahead and
jump<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.649> up<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> line<00:00:44.160> side<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.700> meter

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
jump it up to the line side of the meter

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.880 
jump it up to the line side of the meter
now<00:00:45.090> keep<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.480> mind<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.899> was<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.140> hundred<00:00:46.620> amp

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
now keep in mind this was a hundred amp

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.270 
now keep in mind this was a hundred amp
panel<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.579> hundred<00:00:48.540> amp<00:00:48.690> meter<00:00:48.960> with<00:00:49.739> number<00:00:50.070> 10

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
panel a hundred amp meter with number 10

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.190 
panel a hundred amp meter with number 10
wires<00:00:50.550> feeding<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.180> 30<00:00:51.450> amp<00:00:51.690> two-pole

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
wires feeding the 30 amp two-pole

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.220 
wires feeding the 30 amp two-pole
breaker<00:00:52.700> so<00:00:53.700> that's<00:00:54.450> you're<00:00:54.870> getting<00:00:55.200> a

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
breaker so that's you're getting a

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.139 
breaker so that's you're getting a
hundred<00:00:55.410> amps<00:00:55.829> going<00:00:56.040> through<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.850> number

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
hundred amps going through that number

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.830 
hundred amps going through that number
ten<00:00:57.360> wire<00:00:57.600> right<00:00:57.870> there

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
ten wire right there

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.779 
ten wire right there
so<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:01.170> started<00:01:01.680> disassembling<00:01:02.309> everything

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
so I started disassembling everything

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.779 
so I started disassembling everything
and<00:01:03.470> that's<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.739> load<00:01:04.949> side<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.520> out<00:01:05.640> to

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:05.789 
and that's the load side going out to

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:08.029 
and that's the load side going out to
the<00:01:05.880> water<00:01:06.090> heater<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.780> started<00:01:07.710> tracing

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039 
the water heater and started tracing

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.380 
the water heater and started tracing
these<00:01:08.160> wires<00:01:08.460> out<00:01:09.259> and<00:01:10.850> going<00:01:11.850> back<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.270> in

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
these wires out and going back up in

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.510 
these wires out and going back up in
there<00:01:12.630> I'm<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:13.020> like<00:01:13.229> okay<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:14.160> am<00:01:14.250> i<00:01:14.369> up

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.490 
against next year well I got the rest of
the<00:01:18.149> breakers<00:01:18.479> cut<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.020> there<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.380> of

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
the breakers cut out of there and out of

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.710 
the breakers cut out of there and out of
my<00:01:19.590> way<00:01:19.800> and<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.940> can<00:01:21.060> see<00:01:21.240> where<00:01:21.390> they<00:01:21.479> tied

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.300 
my way and you can see where they tied
right<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> load<00:01:22.380> side<00:01:22.679> of<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.009> panel

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
right to the load side of this panel

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.270 
right to the load side of this panel
right<00:01:23.910> to<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.149> load<00:01:24.360> side<00:01:24.660> of<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.869> meter

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
right to the load side of the meter

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.169 
right to the load side of the meter
unbelievable<00:01:26.280> how<00:01:26.819> do<00:01:26.880> people<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.509> stuff
