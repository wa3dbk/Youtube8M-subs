so<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.229> take<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.439> lizard<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.070> if<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.610> zoom<00:01:53.909> in

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
so if we take a lizard and if we zoom in

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.389 
so if we take a lizard and if we zoom in
in<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> body<00:01:54.960> go<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.409> hand<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.009> then<00:01:56.159> go<00:01:56.369> to

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
in the body go to hand and then go to

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.670 
in the body go to hand and then go to
more<00:01:56.909> more<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.420> micro<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.869> nano<00:01:58.020> scale<00:01:58.409> but

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
more more in micro and nano scale but

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.920 
more more in micro and nano scale but
you'll<00:01:58.799> see<00:01:59.009> lots<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.460> hairs<00:01:59.820> divided<00:02:00.810> and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
you'll see lots of hairs divided and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.050 
you'll see lots of hairs divided and
subdivided<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.829> nana's<00:02:02.159> killed<00:02:02.430> two<00:02:02.850> more

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
subdivided to nana's killed two more

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.810 
subdivided to nana's killed two more
hairy<00:02:03.329> structures<00:02:04.399> here<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.460> have<00:02:05.790> some

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
hairy structures here I have some

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.839 
hairy structures here I have some
pictures<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.630> geckos<00:02:07.320> hands<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:08.220> will<00:02:08.399> see<00:02:08.610> if

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
pictures of geckos hands you will see if

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.609 
pictures of geckos hands you will see if
we<00:02:09.030> take<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.239> look<00:02:09.360> at<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.660> maybe<00:02:10.319> see<00:02:10.590> some

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
we take a look at it maybe see some

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.720 
we take a look at it maybe see some
tapes<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.610> hand<00:02:11.849> but<00:02:12.599> are<00:02:12.870> they<00:02:13.080> real

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
tapes on the hand but are they real

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.630 
tapes on the hand but are they real
really<00:02:14.000> take<00:02:14.239> no<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.900> don't<00:02:15.290> think<00:02:15.349> so<00:02:15.530> so<00:02:16.280> if

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
really take no I don't think so so if

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.059 
really take no I don't think so so if
you<00:02:17.060> take<00:02:17.300> a<00:02:17.569> finger<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.379> legaia<00:02:18.680> kill<00:02:18.890> and

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
you take a finger of legaia kill and

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.250 
you take a finger of legaia kill and
take<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.220> fingerprint<00:02:19.819> of<00:02:19.940> that<00:02:20.150> you'd<00:02:20.959> be<00:02:21.080> on

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
take a fingerprint of that you'd be on

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.960 
take a fingerprint of that you'd be on
the<00:02:21.349> fingerprint<00:02:21.980> they<00:02:22.129> will<00:02:22.340> have<00:02:22.519> lots<00:02:22.849> of

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
the fingerprint they will have lots of

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.330 
the fingerprint they will have lots of
dust<00:02:23.209> some<00:02:23.810> contest<00:02:24.290> doctors<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.159> it's

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
dust some contest doctors so it's

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.520 
dust some contest doctors so it's
showing<00:02:25.670> us<00:02:25.849> that<00:02:26.090> ok<00:02:26.269> I<00:02:26.420> have<00:02:26.780> some<00:02:27.019> contents

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
showing us that ok I have some contents

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.860 
showing us that ok I have some contents
Harry<00:02:27.769> structured<00:02:28.310> there<00:02:28.519> that<00:02:29.030> if<00:02:29.269> i<00:02:29.390> zoom<00:02:29.420> in

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
Harry structured there that if i zoom in

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.830 
Harry structured there that if i zoom in
there's<00:02:30.110> 300<00:02:31.040> every<00:02:31.310> more<00:02:31.549> then<00:02:32.239> you<00:02:32.450> will<00:02:32.629> see

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
there's 300 every more then you will see

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.410 
there's 300 every more then you will see
there<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.379> those<00:02:34.099> tapes<00:02:34.489> are<00:02:34.700> basically

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
there that those tapes are basically

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.360 
there that those tapes are basically
some<00:02:35.780> contents<00:02:36.650> here<00:02:36.860> is<00:02:37.040> that<00:02:37.220> they<00:02:37.340> are

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
some contents here is that they are

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.220 
some contents here is that they are
divided<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.060> subdivided<00:02:38.239> more<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.049> more

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
divided and subdivided more and more

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.800 
divided and subdivided more and more
exactly<00:02:39.890> like<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.280> contest<00:02:40.910> forest<00:02:41.329> in<00:02:41.540> near

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
exactly like the contest forest in near

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.330 
exactly like the contest forest in near
the<00:02:41.959> land<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.530> have<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:42.860> pictures<00:02:43.159> here

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
the land that I have the pictures here

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.399 
the land that I have the pictures here
for<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:43.579> so<00:02:44.360> they<00:02:44.510> have<00:02:44.690> lots<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:45.110> hairs

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
for you so they have lots of hairs

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.650 
for you so they have lots of hairs
they're<00:02:45.860> smaller<00:02:46.790> small<00:02:47.090> like<00:02:47.299> the<00:02:47.420> leaves

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
they're smaller small like the leaves

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.539 
they're smaller small like the leaves
that<00:02:47.959> these<00:02:48.440> hairs<00:02:48.709> are<00:02:48.920> making<00:02:49.340> some

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
that these hairs are making some

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.610 
that these hairs are making some
connections<00:02:50.060> with<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:50.450> surface<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.260> they

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
connections with the surface and they

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.069 
connections with the surface and they
are<00:02:51.739> having<00:02:52.160> some<00:02:52.400> tiny<00:02:53.090> forces<00:02:53.810> like

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
are having some tiny forces like

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.199 
are having some tiny forces like
intermolecular<00:02:54.590> forces<00:02:55.190> calling<00:02:55.640> mandibles

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
intermolecular forces calling mandibles

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.839 
intermolecular forces calling mandibles
it's<00:02:56.989> not<00:02:57.200> too<00:02:57.379> much<00:02:57.560> but<00:02:58.040> having<00:02:58.459> lots<00:02:58.700> of

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
it's not too much but having lots of

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.970 
it's not too much but having lots of
them<00:02:59.060> tons<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.690> millions<00:03:00.049> of<00:03:00.230> them<00:03:00.410> in<00:03:00.620> van

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
them tons of millions of them in van

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.640 
them tons of millions of them in van
gecko<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.609> will<00:03:01.879> be<00:03:02.390> quite<00:03:02.660> a<00:03:02.780> large<00:03:03.079> one<00:03:03.410> to

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
gecko it will be quite a large one to

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.979 
gecko it will be quite a large one to
handling<00:03:04.160> echoes<00:03:04.549> rate<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.450> even<00:03:05.720> more<00:03:05.959> than

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
handling echoes rate and even more than

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.960 
handling echoes rate and even more than
that<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:07.010> interesting<00:03:07.489> thing<00:03:07.519> is<00:03:07.910> that

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
that and the interesting thing is that

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.180 
that and the interesting thing is that
thing<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.650> directional<00:03:09.650> because<00:03:10.040> it's

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
thing is directional because it's

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.819 
thing is directional because it's
related<00:03:10.579> to<00:03:10.609> the<00:03:10.790> contact<00:03:11.209> area<00:03:11.500> so<00:03:12.500> that's

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
related to the contact area so that's

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.979 
related to the contact area so that's
how<00:03:13.160> Waco<00:03:13.549> is<00:03:13.790> using<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.299> attach<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.900> detach

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
how Waco is using to attach and detach

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.009 
how Waco is using to attach and detach
the<00:03:15.349> surfaces<00:03:15.859> so<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.489> gecko<00:03:17.000> but<00:03:17.299> he<00:03:17.660> wants<00:03:17.989> to

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
the surfaces so a gecko but he wants to

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.289 
the surfaces so a gecko but he wants to
attach<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.769> something<00:03:18.799> if<00:03:19.609> you<00:03:19.730> put<00:03:19.970> his<00:03:20.090> hand

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
attach to something if you put his hand

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.870 
attach to something if you put his hand
it's<00:03:20.630> lacking<00:03:20.900> like<00:03:21.139> this<00:03:21.349> till<00:03:22.160> is<00:03:22.340> attaching

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
it's lacking like this till is attaching

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.909 
it's lacking like this till is attaching
to<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.000> thing<00:03:23.239> and<00:03:23.389> then<00:03:23.750> when<00:03:23.989> his<00:03:24.230> changing

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:24.919 
to the thing and then when his changing

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:26.979 
to the thing and then when his changing
the<00:03:25.069> angle<00:03:25.190> of<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:25.700> fingers<00:03:26.120> here<00:03:26.630> we<00:03:26.750> go<00:03:26.930> to

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
the angle of the fingers here we go to

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.020 
the angle of the fingers here we go to
detach<00:03:27.319> angle<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:27.919> its<00:03:28.160> hands<00:03:28.549> will<00:03:28.760> go<00:03:28.910> off

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
detach angle and its hands will go off

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.729 
detach angle and its hands will go off
and<00:03:29.299> they<00:03:29.329> gamble<00:03:29.750> attached<00:03:30.079> and<00:03:30.319> continue

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
and they gamble attached and continue

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.740 
and they gamble attached and continue
like<00:03:30.919> that<00:03:30.950> that's<00:03:31.700> why<00:03:32.000> we're<00:03:32.180> calling<00:03:32.389> it

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
like that that's why we're calling it

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.009 
like that that's why we're calling it
fuel<00:03:33.109> economy<00:03:33.709> structure<00:03:34.459> so<00:03:35.030> they're<00:03:35.569> really

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
fuel economy structure so they're really

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.289 
fuel economy structure so they're really
good<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:36.319> attaching<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.829> detacher<00:03:37.160> if<00:03:37.940> a<00:03:38.120> gay

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
good to attaching a detacher if a gay

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.180 
good to attaching a detacher if a gay
could<00:03:38.480> jump<00:03:38.750> from<00:03:38.989> one<00:03:39.200> lead<00:03:39.470> in<00:03:39.590> a<00:03:39.709> create<00:03:40.010> to

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
could jump from one lead in a create to

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.460 
could jump from one lead in a create to
the<00:03:40.310> other<00:03:40.459> live<00:03:40.760> he<00:03:41.540> can<00:03:41.750> handle<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.169> whole

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
the other live he can handle the whole

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.319 
the other live he can handle the whole
weight<00:03:42.799> with<00:03:43.010> only<00:03:43.250> one<00:03:43.519> hand<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:43.910> even

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
weight with only one hand and even

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.059 
weight with only one hand and even
that's<00:03:44.510> handed<00:03:44.900> enough<00:03:45.200> for<00:03:45.410> handling<00:03:45.799> four

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
that's handed enough for handling four

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.470 
that's handed enough for handling four
times<00:03:46.310> of<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.579> weight<00:03:46.760> of<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.030> whole<00:03:47.209> body

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
times of the weight of the whole body

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.199 
times of the weight of the whole body
and<00:03:48.190> that's<00:03:49.190> quite<00:03:49.519> interesting<00:03:49.700> for<00:03:50.180> me

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
and that's quite interesting for me

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.300 
and that's quite interesting for me
another<00:03:50.959> interesting<00:03:51.200> phenomena<00:03:52.069> about

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
another interesting phenomena about

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.280 
another interesting phenomena about
geckos<00:03:52.940> is<00:03:53.359> that<00:03:53.480> they<00:03:53.599> are<00:03:53.690> super<00:03:53.900> clean

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
geckos is that they are super clean

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.229 
geckos is that they are super clean
maybe<00:03:54.889> we<00:03:55.160> see<00:03:55.370> them<00:03:55.549> as<00:03:55.639> their<00:03:55.880> two<00:03:56.030> things

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
maybe we see them as their two things

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.819 
maybe we see them as their two things
but<00:03:56.450> they<00:03:56.569> are<00:03:56.660> really<00:03:56.840> clean<00:03:57.260> their

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
but they are really clean their

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.530 
but they are really clean their
structure<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.519> body<00:03:58.700> structure<00:03:59.060> is<00:03:59.299> somehow

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
structure the body structure is somehow

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.390 
structure the body structure is somehow
that<00:03:59.720> after<00:04:00.260> two<00:04:00.440> or<00:04:00.470> three<00:04:00.560> safety<00:04:01.190> will

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
that after two or three safety will

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.940 
that after two or three safety will
repel<00:04:02.120> all<00:04:02.359> the<00:04:02.569> doors<00:04:02.840> and<00:04:03.079> other<00:04:03.319> external

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
repel all the doors and other external

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.400 
repel all the doors and other external
particles<00:04:04.579> on<00:04:04.669> the<00:04:04.700> body<00:04:04.970> so<00:04:05.900> back<00:04:06.109> in<00:04:06.290> two

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410

vols<00:05:01.090> we're<00:05:01.690> having<00:05:02.110> some<00:05:02.349> cars<00:05:02.650> a<00:05:02.919> new<00:05:03.159> method

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
vols we're having some cars a new method

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.580 
vols we're having some cars a new method
of<00:05:03.669> transportation<00:05:04.120> that<00:05:04.690> can<00:05:05.169> seal<00:05:05.409> the

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
of transportation that can seal the

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.719 
of transportation that can seal the
roofs<00:05:05.830> or<00:05:06.150> even<00:05:07.150> going<00:05:08.020> vertical<00:05:08.590> surfaces<00:05:09.069> so

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
roofs or even going vertical surfaces so

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.450 
roofs or even going vertical surfaces so
this<00:05:09.940> is<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.240> final<00:05:10.720> advice<00:05:11.500> everybody<00:05:12.130> we

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
this is the final advice everybody we

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.370 
this is the final advice everybody we
need<00:05:12.639> to<00:05:12.849> keep<00:05:13.030> moving<00:05:13.240> forward<00:05:13.569> even<00:05:13.960> if<00:05:14.229> they

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
need to keep moving forward even if they

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.680 
need to keep moving forward even if they
cannot<00:05:14.650> run<00:05:14.889> we<00:05:15.130> cannot<00:05:15.400> walk<00:05:15.669> we<00:05:16.120> can<00:05:16.300> stick

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
cannot run we cannot walk we can stick

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.259 
cannot run we cannot walk we can stick
like<00:05:16.900> a<00:05:16.930> gecko<00:05:17.229> and<00:05:17.849> go<00:05:18.849> slowly<00:05:19.569> slowly
