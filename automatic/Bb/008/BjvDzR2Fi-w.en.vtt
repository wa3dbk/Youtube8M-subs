picked it up on sale it was actually a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.889 
picked it up on sale it was actually a
code<00:00:31.710> before<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.309> thing<00:00:32.520> even<00:00:32.759> came<00:00:33.000> out<00:00:33.180> you

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899

of<00:00:46.620> going<00:00:47.340> off<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.700> material<00:00:48.030> actually

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300

the stand at night wherever it may be if

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.560 
the stand at night wherever it may be if
it<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.250> gonna<00:01:35.610> make<00:01:35.790> another<00:01:36.000> one<00:01:36.119> for<00:01:36.210> my<00:01:36.329> desk

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
it is gonna make another one for my desk

it is gonna make another one for my desk
at<00:01:37.020> work<00:01:38.570> before<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.630> do<00:01:39.780> actually<00:01:39.930> dig<00:01:40.200> in

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
at work before we do actually dig in

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.450 
at work before we do actually dig in
here<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.680> has<00:01:40.799> some<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.130> features<00:01:41.400> you

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
here so it has some of the features you

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.889 
here so it has some of the features you
can<00:01:41.640> see<00:01:41.820> here<00:01:42.060> they're<00:01:42.420> saying<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:42.810> a

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
can see here they're saying it's a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.480 
can see here they're saying it's a
comfortable<00:01:43.259> viewing<00:01:43.770> angle<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.399> use

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
comfortable viewing angle so if you use

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.980 
comfortable viewing angle so if you use
it<00:01:44.579> as<00:01:44.670> an<00:01:44.759> alarm<00:01:45.000> whatever<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.540> may<00:01:45.659> be<00:01:45.689> or<00:01:45.840> if

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
it as an alarm whatever it may be or if

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.030 
it as an alarm whatever it may be or if
you<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.170> want<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.439> roll<00:01:46.649> out<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.799> bed<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you just want to roll out of bed and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.950 
you just want to roll out of bed and
glance<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.909> see<00:01:48.119> what's<00:01:48.299> there<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:48.899> a

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
glance and see what's there so it's a

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.730 
glance and see what's there so it's a
45-degree<00:01:49.740> angle<00:01:50.149> it<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.810> believe<00:01:52.380> yeah

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
45-degree angle it is I believe yeah

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.260 
45-degree angle it is I believe yeah
it's<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:52.979> easy<00:01:53.009> install<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.149> basically

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
it's so easy install you just basically

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.950 
it's so easy install you just basically
pop<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:55.009> magnetic<00:01:56.009> wireless<00:01:56.430> charger<00:01:56.759> in

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
pop that magnetic wireless charger in

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.830 
pop that magnetic wireless charger in
and<00:01:57.960> you're<00:01:58.110> good<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.290> go

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
and you're good to go

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.100 
and you're good to go
there's<00:02:00.830> not<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:00.979> lot<00:02:01.100> of<00:02:01.190> weight<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.640> box

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
there's not a lot of weight to the box

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.130 
there's not a lot of weight to the box
which<00:02:03.159> sure<00:02:04.159> this<00:02:04.310> is<00:02:04.400> aluminum<00:02:04.930> as<00:02:05.930> you<00:02:06.020> can

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
which sure this is aluminum as you can

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.510 
which sure this is aluminum as you can
hear<00:02:06.350> it<00:02:06.619> is<00:02:06.710> definitely<00:02:07.070> luminal<00:02:07.310> but<00:02:07.400> it's

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
hear it is definitely luminal but it's

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.779 
hear it is definitely luminal but it's
very<00:02:07.700> thin<00:02:08.119> very<00:02:08.720> light<00:02:09.020> I'm<00:02:09.860> hoping<00:02:10.190> it<00:02:10.340> has

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
very thin very light I'm hoping it has

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.860 
very thin very light I'm hoping it has
enough<00:02:11.030> weight<00:02:11.240> there<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.750> actually

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
enough weight there that it actually

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.050 
enough weight there that it actually
does<00:02:12.200> work<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.740> use<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.400> charger<00:02:13.970> that

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
does work so you use the charger that

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.090 
does work so you use the charger that
you<00:02:14.180> already<00:02:14.420> have<00:02:14.810> for<00:02:15.590> your<00:02:15.680> Apple<00:02:15.980> watch

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
you already have for your Apple watch

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.070 
you already have for your Apple watch
and<00:02:16.790> again<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.150> basically<00:02:17.480> place<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:17.870> up<00:02:17.959> in

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
and again you basically place it up in

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.570 
and again you basically place it up in
here<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.410> stainless<00:02:18.650> steel<00:02:18.830> in<00:02:19.100> my<00:02:19.130> case<00:02:19.430> will

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
here the stainless steel in my case will

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.670 
here the stainless steel in my case will
be<00:02:19.670> sitting<00:02:19.880> on<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.090> back<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:21.140> cord<00:02:21.380> will<00:02:21.500> run

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
be sitting on the back the cord will run

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.100 
be sitting on the back the cord will run
down<00:02:21.920> here<00:02:22.310> through<00:02:22.940> this<00:02:23.090> hole<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.750> then<00:02:23.989> up

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
down here through this hole and then up

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.020 
down here through this hole and then up
to<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.319> wall<00:02:24.590> adapter<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.520> dongle<00:02:25.850> if<00:02:25.940> you

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
to the wall adapter the dongle if you

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.600 
to the wall adapter the dongle if you
will<00:02:26.180> for<00:02:26.930> feet<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.260> bottom<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:28.040> stop<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.459> from

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
will for feet the bottom to stop it from

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.670 
will for feet the bottom to stop it from
making<00:02:28.850> any<00:02:28.940> kind<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.180> crazy<00:02:29.510> noise<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.319> then

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
making any kind of crazy noise and then

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.970 
making any kind of crazy noise and then
as<00:02:31.069> you<00:02:31.190> can<00:02:31.310> see<00:02:31.520> here<00:02:31.930> watched<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.320> designed

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
as you can see here watched and designed

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.430 
as you can see here watched and designed
by<00:02:34.070> speaking<00:02:34.459> in<00:02:34.640> Irvine<00:02:35.000> California<00:02:35.030> so<00:02:35.720> made

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
by speaking in Irvine California so made

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.530 
by speaking in Irvine California so made
in<00:02:36.530> Korea<00:02:36.739> though<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.220> very<00:02:37.519> very<00:02:38.150> similar<00:02:38.360> to

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
in Korea though so very very similar to

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.210 
in Korea though so very very similar to
how<00:02:38.630> Apple<00:02:38.989> does<00:02:39.019> things<00:02:39.380> there<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:40.100> then

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
how Apple does things there and then

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.800 
how Apple does things there and then
aside<00:02:40.519> from<00:02:40.550> that<00:02:40.910> they<00:02:41.450> give<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.720> the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
aside from that they give you the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.800 
aside from that they give you the
instructions<00:02:42.380> in<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.590> box<00:02:43.450> as<00:02:44.450> well<00:02:44.569> as<00:02:44.690> a

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
instructions in the box as well as a

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.690 
instructions in the box as well as a
product<00:02:45.110> serial<00:02:45.709> code<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.370> they<00:02:46.459> give<00:02:46.580> you<00:02:46.640> the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
product serial code so they give you the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.860 
product serial code so they give you the
instructions<00:02:46.880> in<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.180> box<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.569> basically

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
instructions in the box and basically

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.690 
instructions in the box and basically
how<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.200> set<00:02:48.769> this<00:02:48.920> guy<00:02:49.040> up<00:02:49.160> which<00:02:49.459> again<00:02:49.640> I

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
how to set this guy up which again I

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.059 
how to set this guy up which again I
just<00:02:49.790> explained<00:02:50.360> more<00:02:50.720> or<00:02:50.810> less<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.680> let's<00:02:51.890> go

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
just explained more or less so let's go

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.520 
just explained more or less so let's go
and<00:02:52.370> get<00:02:52.610> this<00:02:52.880> fully<00:02:53.390> set<00:02:53.720> up<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:54.260> we'll<00:02:54.380> see

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
and get this fully set up and we'll see

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.930 
and get this fully set up and we'll see
how<00:02:54.620> it<00:02:54.739> works<00:02:54.890> all<00:02:55.430> right<00:02:55.459> so<00:02:55.640> I've<00:02:55.730> stopped

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
how it works all right so I've stopped

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.030 
how it works all right so I've stopped
the<00:02:55.970> stand<00:02:56.330> we<00:02:56.480> are<00:02:56.600> now<00:02:56.840> looking<00:02:57.650> at<00:02:57.980> the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
the stand we are now looking at the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.590 
the stand we are now looking at the
nightstand<00:02:58.640> view<00:02:58.819> basically<00:02:59.180> so<00:02:59.420> as<00:02:59.569> I

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
nightstand view basically so as I

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.840 
nightstand view basically so as I
mentioned<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.800> wire<00:03:01.069> actually<00:03:01.370> runs<00:03:01.700> up

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
mentioned the wire actually runs up

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.970 
mentioned the wire actually runs up
through<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.120> slot<00:03:02.330> here<00:03:02.600> it's<00:03:03.530> down<00:03:03.709> plugged

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
through the slot here it's down plugged

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.740 
through the slot here it's down plugged
into<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.280> wall<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:04.730> then<00:03:05.150> again<00:03:05.390> that<00:03:05.540> I<00:03:05.600> have

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
into the wall and then again that I have

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.030 
into the wall and then again that I have
this<00:03:05.810> stainless<00:03:05.989> steel<00:03:06.260> version<00:03:06.620> so<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.829> back

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
this stainless steel version so the back

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.979 
this stainless steel version so the back
is<00:03:07.070> stainless<00:03:07.459> but<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.299> actual<00:03:08.510> induction

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
is stainless but the actual induction

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.050 
is stainless but the actual induction
charging<00:03:09.019> just<00:03:09.590> plugs<00:03:09.829> right<00:03:09.920> in<00:03:10.220> it's

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
charging just plugs right in it's

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.819 
charging just plugs right in it's
basically<00:03:11.329> a<00:03:11.420> rubber<00:03:11.720> grommet<00:03:12.110> that<00:03:12.350> more<00:03:12.769> or

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
basically a rubber grommet that more or

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.890 
basically a rubber grommet that more or
less<00:03:12.860> slides<00:03:13.220> into<00:03:13.459> so<00:03:13.790> we're<00:03:14.480> gonna<00:03:14.600> take<00:03:14.810> the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
less slides into so we're gonna take the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.410 
less slides into so we're gonna take the
watch<00:03:15.049> off<00:03:15.290> now<00:03:15.820> and<00:03:16.820> we'll<00:03:16.940> see<00:03:17.150> how<00:03:17.299> it

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
watch off now and we'll see how it

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.390 
watch off now and we'll see how it
discharges<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.049> how<00:03:18.140> it<00:03:18.230> looks<00:03:18.410> so<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:19.220> just

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
discharges and how it looks so it just

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.250 
discharges and how it looks so it just
sticks<00:03:19.880> right<00:03:20.000> on<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.570> did<00:03:20.690> move<00:03:20.870> it's<00:03:21.110> not

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
sticks right on it did move it's not

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.229 
sticks right on it did move it's not
very<00:03:21.470> heavy<00:03:21.680> again<00:03:22.220> it's<00:03:22.340> not<00:03:22.489> really<00:03:22.760> the

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
very heavy again it's not really the

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.420 
very heavy again it's not really the
heaviest<00:03:23.570> stand<00:03:23.840> out<00:03:24.019> there<00:03:24.230> but<00:03:25.010> now<00:03:25.130> I<00:03:25.160> can

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
heaviest stand out there but now I can

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.210 
heaviest stand out there but now I can
have<00:03:25.610> this<00:03:25.790> just<00:03:26.090> like<00:03:26.269> this<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:26.840> from<00:03:27.799> I'm<00:03:28.100> a

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
have this just like this and from I'm a

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.349 
have this just like this and from I'm a
little<00:03:28.400> bit<00:03:28.489> higher<00:03:28.640> than<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.820> camera

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
little bit higher than the camera

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.720 
little bit higher than the camera
my<00:03:29.510> head's<00:03:29.690> probably<00:03:30.109> about<00:03:30.400> five<00:03:31.400> inches<00:03:31.640> or

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
my head's probably about five inches or

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.910 
my head's probably about five inches or
so<00:03:31.880> above<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.269> camera<00:03:32.510> but<00:03:32.750> my<00:03:32.959> view<00:03:33.380> is<00:03:33.620> a<00:03:33.650> lot

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
so above the camera but my view is a lot

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.229 
so above the camera but my view is a lot
better<00:03:34.100> than<00:03:34.370> what<00:03:34.489> you're<00:03:34.640> actually<00:03:34.670> seeing

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
better than what you're actually seeing

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.449 
better than what you're actually seeing
if<00:03:35.510> it's<00:03:35.690> laying<00:03:35.900> down<00:03:36.170> flat<00:03:36.530> that<00:03:37.160> sort<00:03:37.430> of

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
if it's laying down flat that sort of

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.000 
if it's laying down flat that sort of
thing<00:03:37.640> so<00:03:37.670> you<00:03:38.359> can<00:03:38.510> have<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:38.750> watch<00:03:39.010> like

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
thing so you can have the watch like

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.069 
thing so you can have the watch like
this<00:03:40.480> once<00:03:41.480> then<00:03:41.630> when<00:03:41.720> you're<00:03:41.810> done<00:03:41.930> the
