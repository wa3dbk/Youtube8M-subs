00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:07.149

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.880
hi I'm Joe Weisenfelder with cars that
come here with the 2009 Honda Fit

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.460
it's been redesigned the second
generation here in this country

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.939
the Fed is a subcompact its one level
below the Honda Civic

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.020
a little bit cheaper and a little bit
smaller

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.930
dont like the Civic which comes as a
coupe or four door sedan this only comes

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.340
as a four-door hatchback

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.930
and it comes with the mystifying
advertising line

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.780
the pic his goal not the fit is ago but
the pic goes just

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.159
the fit is go I think I might've figured
this out

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:42.570
if you're new to this if you need a
driving here modeled

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.170
if you push on this thing here on the
right the fit is go

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.430
if you push on this one and center the
fittest stop

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.110
now the appeal something like the pit is
the best way to save on gas is to buy a

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.059
smaller car so just because people are
downsizing from a larger car doesn't

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.369
mean they want a crappy car

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:03.729
so something like the Fed which is small
on the outside pretty big on the inside

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.379
is actually pretty nice on the inside

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.470
might be a good alternative as a family
vehicle

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.210
so we decide we try it out with our very
own family it's not a real family it's

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.530
the car back on family

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.640
Karzai come family member Jackie Brennan
from communications

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.159
how does the fit fit it's a little bit
Peyton here but overall not too bad

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.840
your right leg room I have pretty good
leg room your eye

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.119
with headroom to get not even close
touching here's junior

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.689
it's Colin bird Karzai Comintern

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.850
you look like you're a little bit more
squeezed in there

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.560
%uh yeah I'm a little bit bigger so this
is a bit slow down

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.719
about headroom have rooms fine alright
Allegro

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.109
that's good right now yeah proceed is
not all the way

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.159
up back all right now what's happening
um

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.659
my at my legs are touching the Cedar
hurts a little it hurts a little

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.659
that's what interns are four let's go
for a ride now I gotta say as the driver

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.940
with four people in the car

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.970
even though it's a small four-cylinder
1.5 liter

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.830
pretty efficient at the powers pretty
good it helps that this one as the

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.209
manual transmission even automax
available

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.769
up Jackie how was the ride the back and
think it's a battle with that crazy in

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.620
there was a love it's not but overall I
was pretty comfortable

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.670
and we went over some %ah rough pavement
how to feel

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.879
and a little bumpy bumpier than I was
used to but

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.879
of I mean it livable for a short trip
short trips on an offshore chips make

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.489
for a a good family car

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.299
but Colin your turn what what you think
about the ride quality

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.310
million was comfortable so long as going
on over any

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.180
bombs separate shop so you think the
average family cars gonna ride better

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.900
yes all right sir Gersh multi media
coordinator you rode in the back and the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.430
front

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.510
your thoughts well I'm small so

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.010
it was doable for me by it other than a
bigger I don't think I would be as

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.689
comfortable

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.750
%uh is the fifth go it's a no go for me

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.970
the fit is no go finish this sentence

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.579
the fit is go

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.260
in some convinced Jackie

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.120
is the fifth go at we have one goal we
have one

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.390
go and one no go so I guess the answer
to the question is

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.140
but you're considering a fit as a family
car the fit is

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.360
worth considering for additional
information on this car
