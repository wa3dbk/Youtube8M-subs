00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.140
 why - -30- - 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.760
 -30- 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.430
 -30- - 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.459
 -30- - -30- 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.589
 -30- -30- - 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.219
 -30- 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.850
 -30- - 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.949
 -30- 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.570
 the presence of six months 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.069
 but represents sahara 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:25.949
 I claim that I bought an old man from the world in 6 min but nothing 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.550
 will pass - natixis should do there is no neighborhood my wrong it's free 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.989
 my opinion is a high age there is no doubt we try early this month 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.200
 - quite normally 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.450
 the first time we do here 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.010
 - confessor 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.860
 I'm pretty sure - in case of deviation from fans also mazembe are 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.410
 certainly not less - pichot in China where mamadou dia tourÃ© 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.020
 I'm not a dictator - the swine flu, however, no document 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.570
 the controversy provoked - on two nights in a row that's it for the fun is 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.460
 managed in trance 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.840
 something is buying a good naughty tower 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.080
 no propaganda to the glory of every image too 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.450
 in this context a convention for the second 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.650
 the works for the tramway I have nothing transpired must be put in 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.050
 anger I had not put to reason 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.320
 by Roman Rigaux the head of state has too many 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.880
 in this school 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.540
 when we go too far 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.680
 winner 6-1 - about 25% 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.380
 I go in the dust - too pretentious but he also received Tuesday 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.330
 I have the opposite style we do not know too much in this success she responds 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.390
 so power after registration we talked because they do not let go 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.910
 in the good holding of the scholarship chif attention however we think that 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.230
 I'm starting to pay 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.170
 - we're going all the fans in less - charles-de-gaulle - - thomas bouchet on 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.400
 did not doubt me but I did not find a point - August 8 jijel in all 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.310
 case-to-point 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.850
 but I did not find one - but luckily the week goes on
