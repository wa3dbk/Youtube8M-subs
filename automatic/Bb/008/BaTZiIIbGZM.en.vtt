00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.109
 okay it's first of all to tradition 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.250
 the atmosphere 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.899
 but also the diocese 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:11.989
 Monaco 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:17.269
 among them three kilometers across the city so that's a thing that 160 km 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:18.999
 in total 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.409
 thanks to a small straight line 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:23.550
 this direction 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.289
 overtaking possibilities 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.429
 the maximum speed of 2,186 km 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:29.769
 the voice so it's worth it 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.769
 respecting the faith of simulators for a circuit tour 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.220
 first turn is a very important recourse 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.590
 ten years ago I was not very good 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.470
 it's very important to stand out because 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.560
 this turn conditions the whole climb 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.960
 I like this place 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.900
 on top 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.250
 with very little visibility in the world in a delightful left turn 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.950
 denouncing the right 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.900
 we owe this idea 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.170
 I was right there because of a big bump 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.220
 for the car can take off 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.540
 to keep it because 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.230
 then we brake for both very heavy turns 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.110
 we arrive in the viewfinder 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.200
 for young bhp are especially because 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.000
 the atmosphere is fantastic we have a lot of turns right that 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.670
 are linked with the second porter who is very important because 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.570
 conditions everything 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.479
 I'm left something not very well-known have reformed these guys there 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.630
 here is history 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.050
 how to get out of the tunnel is to arrive at full in the port of monaco 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.160
 it's really great exact needs and also to prove to skeptics 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.200
 big braking 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.240
 rank the left 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.540
 from the pool to more than 100 km per day 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.640
 the euro still has a month 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.570
 another chicane but before long with big bins and it is 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.220
 found in manchester 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.360
 then we arrive at las vegas this penultimate corner 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.970
 as important 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.440
 and the last corner of the museum 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.090
 jean-marc four letter 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.900
 able to make a good time here in Monaco
