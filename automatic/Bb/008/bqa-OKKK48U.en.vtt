00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
of analysis and discussion yeah I think

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.220 
of analysis and discussion yeah I think
that<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:51.180> can't<00:02:51.420> fail<00:02:51.780> but<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.230> be<00:02:54.230> more

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
that you can't fail but to be more

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.020 
that you can't fail but to be more
information<00:02:55.290> better<00:02:56.100> information<00:02:56.490> better

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.350 
fascination for me this week have been
on<00:03:17.130> this<00:03:17.220> pro-life<00:03:17.670> since<00:03:17.880> obviously<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.239> work

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
on this pro-life since obviously I work

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.660 
on this pro-life since obviously I work
in<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.690> media<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:19.650> work<00:03:20.160> obviously<00:03:20.400> with

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
in the media I work obviously with

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.710 
in the media I work obviously with
England<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:22.190> it's<00:03:23.190> just<00:03:23.370> improves<00:03:24.330> knowledge

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
England and it's just improves knowledge

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.820 
England and it's just improves knowledge
I<00:03:24.870> think<00:03:25.080> that<00:03:25.170> when<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.410> work<00:03:25.590> in

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
I think that when you work in

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.040 
I think that when you work in
broadcasting<00:03:26.900> particularly<00:03:27.900> as<00:03:27.959> an

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
broadcasting particularly as an

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.360 
broadcasting particularly as an
ex-player<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.739> should<00:03:28.950> come<00:03:29.130> on<00:03:29.190> these

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
ex-player you should come on these

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.250 
ex-player you should come on these
courses<00:03:29.880> why<00:03:30.510> wouldn't<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:30.900> come<00:03:30.989> on<00:03:31.110> these

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
courses why wouldn't you come on these

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.770 
courses why wouldn't you come on these
courses<00:03:31.739> because<00:03:32.489> even<00:03:33.390> if<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.540> don't

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
courses because even if you don't

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.220 
courses because even if you don't
believe<00:03:34.110> in<00:03:34.440> quote<00:03:35.400> getting<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.850> certificate

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
believe in quote getting the certificate

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.449 
believe in quote getting the certificate
