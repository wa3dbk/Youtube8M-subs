00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.500
 imposing their tendencies on the catwalk 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.500
 let's see 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.120

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.870
 a woman who excels in any 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.900
 Place of bea 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.940
 even when the catwalk in a show does not 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.940
 It has to be seen as a trend 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.370
 international under a concept with a 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.840
 style that mine is always the 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.540
 rhinestones being elegant and sober me 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.180
 I've always gotten our 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.369
 circle is small and the stores 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.350
 fabrics are the technicians then always 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.420
 tried to vary that the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.500
 fabrics with the other designers and I do 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.200
 a mix I want to be free from 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.920
 that regulation of that line and we have 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.480

 at night even so you do not see it 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.119
 to give height and comfort 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.090

 I have had these events and with more pleasure 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:40.299
 Colombia will catch me and will let me 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.640
 I went to many fashion events very 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:47.049
 important in Colombia that you have to 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:50.680
 dream that they get into the head of 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.900
 that they are going to be able to achieve it and 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.269
 Well, the most beautiful thing of all is 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.370
 do what one else likes to get 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.370
 in the happy the time one is 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.390
 designing or doing the things of 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.840
 heart 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:13.660
 and many many cons 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.109
 and a lot of dancing 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.780
 with a lot of air 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.959
 I was born in Colombia I've been designing 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.469
 since I'm 8 years old I'm 30 years old 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.330
 designing I started designing super child me 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:31.229
 designed to my own things and I the 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.879
 they sent to do and they took to tailor and 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.520
 tailors shirts to make me 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:37.650
 the clothes already later as at 12 or 13 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.120
 years I started to design for my 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.830
 schoolmates because they did 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.409
 charity parades and schools and 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.960
 charity parades and at that age they 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:49.349
 designed my schoolmates today 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.659
 we saw a collection inspired by the 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.419
 Body painting of ethnic groups in Bera 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:57.539
 Colombian that is called equip 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:05:00.259
 then it was an extraction of the 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:03.870
 symbology of embera body painting 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:05.699
 applied to these summer silhouettes that 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.660
 I developed for this collection the 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:11.060
 always on stage 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.910
 they are like that they are a staging not me 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.140
 like the conventional girls parade 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.840
 that come and go 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.730
 I like to involve the public more 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.650
 make them feel a little closer to what 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.690
 I do it because it because 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.250
 already tired of crashing not trying 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.670
 to always imitate the same and doing 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:32.090
 always the same then they are not left 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:34.580
 more remedy than doing something later and 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.860
 throw yourself because it's the only one 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.390
 so you can not tell if 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.390
 something can get to work golden 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.670
 from my channel he is always worried 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.350
 to highlight the Ecuadorian talent is 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.780
 why you are enjoying 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.810
 that special and there is a woman who supports 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:00.230
 Ours is the godmother of this 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.730
 event and bombay unique that fashion has 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.100
 to see a lot with everything that is a 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.840
 industry around that is not only 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.880
 fashion but everything that the work of 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.520
 those of the artisans of the designers 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.260
 what they do is create that industry 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.400
 that generates a lot of work employment for 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.440
 all and at the same time tourism 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.740
 also me 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.420
 attractive to attract beauty but at 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.730
 same time what it generates around 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:26.300
 that's a lot more than just what 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:29.300
 that you see in the end you need a lot 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:32.090
 to the equator and promote and motivate and 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:35.860
 help and support in every way the 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:39.140
 designers artists the support should be 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.760
 constant to have promotion and that 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:45.620
 know the equator through our 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:48.500
 artists in every sense you have to put on 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.330
 the shirt and feel safe and not 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.190
 think that what is outside is better 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.810
 that what is ours is the problem that 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.610
 we always have for the outside one is 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.010
 better because he is Ecuadorian then 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:02.030
 less the opposite our quality is 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:03.650

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.990
