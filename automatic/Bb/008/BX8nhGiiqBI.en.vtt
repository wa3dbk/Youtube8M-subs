thing to note about rentree pods is that

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.180 
thing to note about rentree pods is that
even<00:01:24.820> if<00:01:25.000> it's<00:01:25.180> in<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.450> process<00:01:25.870> of<00:01:25.960> landing

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
even if it's in the process of landing

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.219 
even if it's in the process of landing
like<00:01:27.190> right<00:01:27.400> here<00:01:27.729> and<00:01:28.030> you<00:01:28.689> can<00:01:28.780> see<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:28.990> door

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
like right here and you can see the door

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.810 
like right here and you can see the door
opening<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:29.950> pod<00:01:30.219> starting<00:01:30.549> to<00:01:30.610> come<00:01:30.700> out

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
opening and the pod starting to come out

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.149 
opening and the pod starting to come out
but<00:01:31.719> even<00:01:31.869> if<00:01:32.079> you<00:01:32.170> take<00:01:32.350> it<00:01:32.469> out<00:01:32.619> and<00:01:32.649> the<00:01:32.920> pods

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
but even if you take it out and the pods

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.679 
but even if you take it out and the pods
haven't<00:01:33.549> cleared<00:01:33.789> their<00:01:34.030> entry<00:01:34.299> pot<00:01:34.479> the

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
haven't cleared their entry pot the

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.330 
haven't cleared their entry pot the
explosion<00:01:35.170> will<00:01:35.350> take<00:01:35.590> out<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.890> battle<00:01:36.159> pods

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
explosion will take out the battle pods

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.459

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
so even if you see one that is really

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.679 
so even if you see one that is really
close<00:01:38.619> to<00:01:38.680> landing<00:01:39.159> or<00:01:39.340> has<00:01:39.490> landed<00:01:39.880> don't
