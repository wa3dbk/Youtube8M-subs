because i think its a good indication on

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.660 
because i think its a good indication on
single<00:03:42.880> core<00:03:43.150> threading<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.670> graphical

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
single core threading and graphical

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:54.410 
single core threading and graphical
capabilities<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:50.700> it's<00:03:51.700> running<00:03:51.970> off<00:03:52.090> of<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.420> a

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
capabilities so it's running off of a a

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.410 
capabilities so it's running off of a a
portable<00:03:55.420> hard<00:03:55.630> drive<00:03:56.670> it<00:03:57.670> should<00:03:58.270> be<00:03:58.390> just

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
portable hard drive it should be just

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:15.450 
portable hard drive it should be just
about<00:03:58.720> as<00:03:58.930> fast<00:03:59.230> ah
