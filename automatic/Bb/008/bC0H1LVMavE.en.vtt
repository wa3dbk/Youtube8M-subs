00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.970
 [Music] 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.719
 manuel and why so many years without wanting 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.070
 sing their own sevillanas because 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.910
 they cost a lot of work but of many 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.119
 years 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.470
 you have described sevillanas for almost 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.990
 everyone who sing them during 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.520
 many thousands of sevillanas and 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.470
 he never wanted to record a record with his 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.360
 songs until very few years ago 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:33.340
 in Scandinavia they also sing them 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.750
 I have received from authors of editors not 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.059
 you see many times we have seen of 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.569
 scandinavia where are you going to put bridge and 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.300
 say land friends and Icelandic people and 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:45.380
 because I did not want to record them 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.080
 because I think the author 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.700
 the composer should give it to the 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.400
 artist who is the one who has to succeed 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:57.640
 the composer like you know always 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:00.610
 has been totally behind the life 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.739
 then I dared to be in the Seville 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.700
 but I think the author the writer 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:09.550
 of the poet has to write in compose 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.230
 so that other people succeed because 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.070
 it's the most human 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:19.260
 yes because it's the end of a poet is not 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.280
 to be made famous 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:26.160
 and there you have how many we have the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.500
 best in the world because they speak maybe in 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.690
 England scarpi for me the best 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.220
 of the world the best poet in the world 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.350
 Flame Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.689
 On the other hand, because 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:43.030
 I think starved to death penalty and 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:52.630
 it's like you have to die in my case it 's 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:56.140
 different because I am the author I do not 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.700
 I am, I am a small composer who 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.100
 I love music and model the 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.619
 music we abused the composer a bit 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.009
 if they feel comfortable tonight I think 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:09.310
 that on some occasion or has composed 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.989
 sing some sevillanas with airs or 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.760
 with sones reminiscent of teeth that 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.909
 true courses 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.909
 yes 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.050
 that the most beautiful thing in the world is a 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.920
 harmony 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.740
 but harmony not only music 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:30.100
 the west if there is no harmony does not exist 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:33.100
 nothing like the harmony of a love 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.850
 a couple like not have harmony because 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.850
 know what happens 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.500
 then everything that makes harmony in 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:58.190
 colorful the beautiful and this seed 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:58.190
 [Music] 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:06.280
 and every year 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:10.560
 [Music] 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.560
 the same friends 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.170
 and every year 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.820
 the same friends 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:35.600
 [Music] 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.290
 and all hope 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.600
 what 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:04:02.259
 [Applause] 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:04:02.259
 [Music] 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.960
 no longer water 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.960
 [Music] 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.300
 and I go 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:21.190
 [Music] 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.850
 so possible 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.490
 if it was possible I understand too much 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.330
 night we are close to 12 in the 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.330
 Holy Thursday night 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.460
 well, suggest me sevilla 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.190
 habit you know that in this world there 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.280
 always a lot of criticism and I made a 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.250
 thing in which I left Seville and 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.069
 I'm traveling a lot but not for me 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.949
 personal gain of that great composer ni 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:56.160
 earn money that I do not have any peseta 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:59.280
 but only for the simple reason that 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:03.990
 that is, what I say, not you, do not get angry 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.060
 seville because if I left you not me 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.100
 I carry you in my core I thought 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.800
 to my spain to the root of the guadalquivir 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.670
 double for me the biggest thing that there is is 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.280
 lifetime 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.180
 I believe that you sang joaquín the 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.150
 song 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.150
 the sevillana but de sevilla 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.389
 and for me it is the most appropriate to tell 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.960
 for me it is the most appropriate I feel 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:33.720
 that one for water and I listen to you 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.280
 I'm going to sing it the Sevillian is 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.820
 sevilla has one thing that only has 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.420
 Seville 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:43.290
 not only from the Cape to Seville but also 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.290
 all Sevillians 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:50.390
 unquestionably I am Andalusian 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.580
 although once in a while I'm a 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.080
 slightly thinner to the voice 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:00.480
 but never 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.480
 [Music] 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.510
 sevilla has one thing 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.610
 [Music] 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.570

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.350

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.360
 [Music] 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.480
 a laugh and a pity 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:31.400
 and the Virgin Macarena 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.400
 it is also to revive 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:37.930
 which is also from Seville 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.560
 [Music] 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.169
