 Hello everyone and welcome to the chain "Motifs de Embroidery" 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.020
 In this Creative Workshop # 2 we will create a Christmas sock. 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.000
 To make this tutorial, you will need: 

00:00:10.181 --> 00:00:12.181
 Red felt, 

00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:13.440
 white 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.760
 a little piece of green felt, 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.440
 and brown felt. 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.920
 20 cm of red ribbon 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.236
 1 pen 

00:00:21.236 --> 00:00:23.079
 1 pair of scissors 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:24.901
 Pins without heads 

00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:26.534
 A big piece of cardboard 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.260
 (Here this old calendar will do very well) 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.900
 And of course a sewing and embroidery machine 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.540
 Start by drawing a large sock on the piece of cardboard, which you will then cut out, 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.880
 to create a tracking template. 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.200
 Do not forget to make the heel, and the top edge of the sock. 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.560
 Using the template, draw your sock twice on the red felt and cut out your pieces. 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.420
 Now cut out the top edge and heel of your cardboard template. 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.340
 Draw your heel on a piece of green felt, 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.440
 and the rim of the sock on white felt. 

00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:02.235
 /! \ ATTENTION, for the white rectangle, 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.280
 allow 2 cm more on the upper and lower edges, 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.234
 be 4 cm more total, 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.820
 in order to make an invisible seam, 

00:01:10.848 --> 00:01:12.848
 that we will see in the next step. 

00:01:12.848 --> 00:01:16.200
 Bring your brown felt and your red felt, 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.720
 and go to the embroidery of the appliqué we created in a previous tutorial, 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.840
 you will find here (see box) 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.560
 and you can download in the description of the video. 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.400
 You can of course choose your own appliqué, 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.214
 or your own embroidery pattern. 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.960
 Bring the white felt and embroider the name of the child or person in red, 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.700
 in a fancy font, 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.480
 and do not hesitate to embroider in a large size of character. 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.400
 Sew the green heel with thread on the sock, 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.860
 you can for example take a nice zig-zag point, 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.480
 Sew the white upper edge with white thread on the top of the sock in this way: 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.080
 - Place your white rectangle, embroidery against the sock and text, upside down, down the sock in this way. 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.900
 And sew. 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.820
 - Then return your white rectangle to the place, 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.260
 and fold the excess behind the sock. 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.780
 Loop with the ribbon and place this way with a pin. 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.640
 Place the two socks, facing each other, 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.420
 and sew the edges leaving obviously the top of the sock free to be able to return it 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.600
 and finally, flip your sock 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.220
 The sock is finished. 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.780
 You can decorate your sock with some additional details such as sewn beads, 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.386
 or small adhesive rhinestones. 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.580
