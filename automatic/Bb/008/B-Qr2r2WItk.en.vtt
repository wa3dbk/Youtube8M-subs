00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
their tripod they set up and they take a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.260 
their tripod they set up and they take a
picture<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.840> room<00:00:31.080> but<00:00:31.710> almost

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
picture of a room but almost

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.850 
picture of a room but almost
unconsciously<00:00:33.270> they<00:00:33.809> tend<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.200> angle<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
unconsciously they tend to angle the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.729 
unconsciously they tend to angle the
camera<00:00:35.070> down<00:00:35.790> towards<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.420> floor<00:00:36.559> I'm<00:00:37.559> not

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
camera down towards the floor I'm not

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.979 
camera down towards the floor I'm not
entirely<00:00:38.160> sure<00:00:38.370> why<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.000> but<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.690> think<00:00:39.899> it

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
entirely sure why that is but I think it

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.110 
entirely sure why that is but I think it
has<00:00:40.079> something<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.440> do<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:40.770> with<00:00:41.430> thinking

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
has something to do with with thinking

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.959 
has something to do with with thinking
that<00:00:42.840> if<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.170> show<00:00:43.410> more<00:00:43.680> floor<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.610> will<00:00:44.760> show

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
that if you show more floor it will show

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.270 
that if you show more floor it will show
more<00:00:45.210> space<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:46.410> basically<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.010> went<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
more space but basically I went to a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.770 
more space but basically I went to a
house<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.239> wanted<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.510> give<00:00:48.690> an

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
house and I just wanted to give an

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.420 
house and I just wanted to give an
example<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.739> difference<00:00:49.920> between

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
example of the difference between

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.910 
example of the difference between
looking<00:00:50.579> into<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> room<00:00:51.360> versus<00:00:51.989> looking<00:00:52.320> down

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
looking into a room versus looking down

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.209 
looking into a room versus looking down
into<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.460> room<00:00:53.840> so<00:00:54.840> here<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> couple<00:00:56.129> of

get of that wall sometimes walls are
good<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.790> include<00:02:34.910> because<00:02:35.330> they<00:02:35.420> show<00:02:35.630> you

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
good to include because they show you

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.470 
good to include because they show you
the<00:02:36.530> edge<00:02:36.680> of<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.010> room<00:02:37.220> when<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.060> look<00:02:38.270> down

the edge of the room when you look down
everything<00:02:39.290> once<00:02:40.070> again<00:02:40.190> it<00:02:40.700> doesn't<00:02:41.210> help<00:02:41.600> it

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
everything once again it doesn't help it

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.860 
everything once again it doesn't help it
doesn't<00:02:41.780> everything<00:02:42.560> is<00:02:42.680> just<00:02:42.860> distorted<00:02:43.250> and

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
doesn't everything is just distorted and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.770 
doesn't everything is just distorted and
then<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.990> last<00:02:45.140> one<00:02:45.350> that<00:02:45.500> I<00:02:45.680> had<00:02:46.060> just<00:02:47.060> thrown

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
then the last one that I had just thrown

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.200 
then the last one that I had just thrown
up<00:02:47.990> here<00:02:48.200> is<00:02:48.350> a<00:02:48.920> kitchen<00:02:49.220> shot<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:49.850> this<00:02:50.090> is

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
up here is a kitchen shot and this is

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.080 
up here is a kitchen shot and this is
what<00:02:50.330> happens<00:02:50.630> when<00:02:50.690> we<00:02:50.900> look<00:02:51.080> down<00:02:51.590> again

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
what happens when we look down again

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.030 
what happens when we look down again
once<00:02:53.090> again<00:02:53.150> nothing<00:02:53.900> is<00:02:54.050> gained<00:02:54.380> by<00:02:54.560> looking

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
once again nothing is gained by looking

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.280 
once again nothing is gained by looking
down<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.640> space<00:02:55.970> doesn't<00:02:56.330> look<00:02:56.660> any<00:02:56.840> larger

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
down the space doesn't look any larger
