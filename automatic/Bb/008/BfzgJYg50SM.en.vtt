00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 and hello again with you vital bull 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.810
 and the program is mutual stretching and 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.570
 today pulled us here these here 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.320
 wonderful smooth columns that 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.990
 were tail in 1800 some 70 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.689
 look some powerful huge yes and 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.520
 What are you looking at absol? 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:23.189
 the waters are not columns made there well about 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.550
 there is a hub that 50 years ago generally at 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.789
 aging 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.580
 where then were the machines that could 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.010
 make such cool smooth and huge 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.860
 columns by you u still have them somehow 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.390
 made awesome the truth about what I mean 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.430
 I'm telling you today 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.700
 there are always many many 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.530
 different things that you just used to 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.540
 blinked eyes for him for what he is 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.879
 another pillar of Alexandria he stands there 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.870
 Yes, it is still much cooler and packages 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:56.710
 a huge thing to which costs not even 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:00.190
 fixed to the ground it just stands 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.110
 standing and described and she she ran all 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.659
 near time she was afraid that she would fall 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.180
 where 200 years ago were such 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.390
 technology like the alexandrian pillar 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.520
 or here these are on the lot yes well we are to this 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.050
 accustomed to do not ask the question one 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.030
 where they come from we take it as 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.560
 given though impossible to yourself 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.619
 present machines that could 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.750
 turn these things on 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.509
 carefully in your life your life 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.000
 for sure today there is a huge mass 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.610
 a lot of things that we get amazing 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.700
 by its texture the new film is not used to 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.380
 pay attention to them that with you 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.890
 must happen you must have 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:42.130
 revelation him sites insights this such 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.079
 thing that opens up new knowledge if 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.049
 you evolve as expanding 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.210
 the universe which is man but everyone
