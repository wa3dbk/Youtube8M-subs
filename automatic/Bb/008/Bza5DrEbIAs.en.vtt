00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.970
 On August 21, 2014 I decided to 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.680
 create a youtube channel on channel where 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.019
 to be able to put together the two things that most 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.730
 they like formula 1 and videos a day 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.590
 Next edit and record the video of 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.300
 who is max verstappen a video that 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.279
 was about not going up because I did not 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.589
 had just convinced neither my voice nor the 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.449
 video style the video fit and upload 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:22.220
 more videos a test a theory 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.619
 conspiracy to the 'fourth millennium' and a 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.359
 normative video I started very seriously at 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.189
 channel but in this last video of the 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.349
 regulations I put a little joke a 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.300
 joke that he liked so much that I started to put 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.580
 more jokes from the videos until I 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.170
 I decided to make a video completely of 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.150
 called humor that sure you will have 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.160
 seen the three best pilots of the 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.260
 formula one was there when you saw your 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.360
 reactions when I decided that my channel 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.740
 It would be humorous but it happened great 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.210
 writing scripts and it seems that 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.250
 you also had a great time 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.140
 watching the videos and from there everything 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.610
 it was perfect every time it was more people 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.840
 that went through the canal and left a 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.850
 comment and people followed 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.380
 subscribing and I joined with great 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.329
 followers of formula 1 to form 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.430
 the podcast and the show in this podcast in 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.440
 direct though that only six months ago 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.329
 less than six months since you created the 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.280
 channel and with only six months we have 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:07.700
