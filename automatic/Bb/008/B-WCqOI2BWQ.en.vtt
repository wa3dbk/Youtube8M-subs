00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.370
 hello dear friends with you amway921 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.960
 this video we will talk about the novelty 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.259
 novelty of the third level of the Soviet light 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.960
 tank t-70 if literally in a nutshell 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.779
 tell you what does he look like here 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.230
 it is as if it did not seem right away but it 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.630
 really really can titanium 34 fine 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.269
 frontal armor is very good and slopes 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.760
 towers break it in our third 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.470
 level something like that because without 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.750
 small at the third level so many tanks 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.300
 that go find something in them 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.030
 unusual and this one here is the very 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.040
 because his frontal armor is 35 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.309
 perfect tilting millimeters 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.739
 rational bottom armorlinist 45 and here 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.250
 this here mechvod slot even more reinforced 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.610
 55 millimeters plus we have towers 50 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.739
 millimeters mask and 35 millimeters all 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.989
 circle tower plus reinforced welded 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.350
 the seams that is to say he is like that 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.640
 like a small 54x plus such here 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.100
 motorcycle view of his tower from the edge 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.510
 but sadness is that we have 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.400
 here how are you pissed fours in 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.600
 the number is very, very thin with it 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.720
 even thinner than feed 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.110
 15h millimeters i.e. 15 years old punch 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.020
 everything is just high - explosive cumulative guns 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.140
 shells everything punches us here and 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.549
 all that remains is to dance 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.580
 to dance to hold in the enemy 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.220
 exclusively forehead straight in style 54 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.590
 but we all know about it we simulate that 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.909
 tank and what about guns here 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.200
 the only gun that makes sense 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.229
 put the gun forty five 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.970
 millimeter in t42 and it differs 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.340
 perhaps the fact that it is quite accurate 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.170
 among all on the track level tanks 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.509
 the accuracy is only this 7 it is pretty 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.920
 rare and can be confident 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.619
 say that this is one of the most accurate 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.689
 guns on the third level but all the rest 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.979
 parameters as if to go there with 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.810
 her damage is also very good 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.540
 comfortable but they are not particularly 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.070
 stand out and as if all by itself 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.130
 other parameters data gun too 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.930
 somehow here especially hp as at all too 230 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.570
 they are not many not enough 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.849
 review 310 and here it is still a tank 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.380
 Soviet people tend to have such 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.810
 that's there for 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.430
 but what about the acceleration dynamics? 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.190
 we have here 16 and 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.530
 61 feed the carriages of something not 100% 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.620
 up to 17 will rise at one hundred percent 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.560
 crew but top speed 45 forward 18 back 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.960
 what to say funny tank like 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.570
 he is so strong to me that even 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.030
 the first fight that I spent on it is 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.310
 until the only fight we will see 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.530
 everything what I say so 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.230
 I keep on, but what about tactics? 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.700
 applying this apparatus in battles this 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.280
 just need to know one thing 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.070
 never show your board to anyone 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.110
 to all keep only forehead plus 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.240
 a little bit this forehead dock you 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.520
 pay on the panel damage as I will 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.860
 get up here is the very first duel which 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.040
 right now with another one 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.620
 t-70 and how to finish before the duel 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.900
 well you literally see them once in this 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.300
 because it makes all the difference because he gets up 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.550
 just right and I turned a little 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.080
 hull and already punch me will be much 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.070
 harder because reduced armor 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.830
 will increase here I wait for the same on 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.170
 comrade and he will now appear t-70 then 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.300
 I have no problems with the pro gun 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.050
 no, she almost has time 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.760
 come down to the moment as soon as 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.740
 2 and 8 seconds recharge ends 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.110
 but I will remind you for the type in this tank 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.820
 In this battle I have not completely the 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.020
 there is a recharge time maybe 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.720
 two and a half seconds 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.510
 well or something like that the only problem is 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.790
 shooting at t-70 is that he has a gun 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.680
 comes down quite a long time after all 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.540
 mixing 2 and 3 seconds for such 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.380
 a little damage and such as it were, and not 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.320
 large levels 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.910
 where all the fights are literally 1 1 1 there 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:55.430
 in a minute in five minutes everyone is already dead 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.320
 that always needs to come down to the end 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.020
 and even shooting at 100 meters is already 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.300
 a little problem well and here i'm leaving for 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.310
 opponents without leaving the board only 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.240
 forehead and all they shoot at me 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.640
 bounces off I'll show you very much myself 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.220
 cope with the offender over 1 and 6 and we 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.900
 look at the traces of non-penetration that 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.730
 will be present at the front of 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.070
 my tank after how great it all 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.079
 bounced just lovely 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.570
 to tank on it is very convenient because 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.490
 the tower is on his left yes and not by 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.560
 the call center is often at the wrong corner 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.870
 that it is necessary to make successful 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.630
 somehow expose their vulnerable parts 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.670
 under t8s 2 which apparently stands there with 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.010
 howitzer and it is likely to get from 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.080
 him as it should but therefore i'm here 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.440
 tried to act carefully did not get rid 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.360
 from the enemy with the help of the team so what 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.880
 It is worth saying of course there would be us 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.810
 We watch this battle 3 levels and in general on what 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.790
 70 still get their battles 5 level 3 4 and 5 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.710
 drown and when we meet in battle 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.140
 some tezh so 5 already for example 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:02.280
 kv-1 here already arises 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:04.380
 much more of a problem in battles 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.090
 high level for this tank of course 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.350
 pleasure will be a minimum because 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.200
 we will need to act very 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.320
 carefully because with our armor we already 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.300
 did not surprise many high-level tanks 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.030
 Well, the speed of course, too, because 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.400
 even this tank and light but it feels 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.230
 it's as though the average it 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.240
 Lov Kapa average tank less 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.790
 what that is and speed as if 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.250
 also not very much but anyway 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:32.190
 for level 3 battles 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.690
 this tank is just beautiful and i want 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.400
 say that is really the very first 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.550
 my fight as soon as I sat down to check 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.600
 given tanchik it is just as convenient 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.590
 lay in my hand 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.960
 Well, here are the results literally 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.720
 even from the first fight I can definitely give you 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.200
 guarantee that if you like tank 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.720
 t-54 soviet ninth level and for 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.510
 entertainment entertains e70 for you, too, will 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.340
 very interesting find exactly 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:03.419
 This tank did not like the most 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:06.300
 among all the novelties on the Soviet light 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.590
 by squat from all other three well 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.229
 more precisely in the aggregate 3 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.110
 if all the other two are obtained well 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.430
 he looks just beautiful 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.760
 outwardly, please have the most for me 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.190
 its such a tower turtle is very 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.140
 like tortoise shells but because of you 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.210
 I like all that when he is 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.310
 someone who is very strong 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.800
 you can use and hide weak we 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.690
 we can already do it 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.360
 By the end, I unfortunately did not dare to go 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.789
 for the second t-70 and in vain thought you would kill 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.130
 literally there in seconds but he is alive and 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:40.130
 alive and therefore forced to seize the base 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.710
 and this house any and end well on this 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.449
 not over the game thank goodness you can 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.190
 at any time convenient for you 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:48.560
 play in this tank get the most 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.870
 pleasures and probably remember me for 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.430
 what I told you all about him 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:56.319
 thank you for your attention subscribe to 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.319
