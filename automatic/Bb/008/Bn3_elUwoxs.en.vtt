 changes let's say icons appeared 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.980

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.230
 icons of stats and also the main ones 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.550
 is changing font and size 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.949
 fonts immediately make a reservation that shift is not 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.600
 Support Cyrillic and for installation 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.149
 On Russian server you will need 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.270
 download a separate shift and replace it 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:45.950
 in the folder with the mod, well, let's get started 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.950
 download foxy version 63 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.100
 unpacking my 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.100
 any folder 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.670
 first thing you need to do it 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.670
 remove general director do the legacy. 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.280
 and we do not need it yet and do not need it 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.560
 during installation it will be added for 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.260
 future patches 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.660
 then we open our manager 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.930
 the directory we have already specified therefore 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:20.660
 problems with this do not drag the folder into 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.380
 raw manager and choose the maximum 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.150
 values ​​are many questions 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.880
 exists about this and very much 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.300
 people do not see problems with it 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.869
 the maximum is 161 166 naturally 166 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.840
 we choose as much as possible as in 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:43.600
 last time all but half board default 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:47.619
 . then where we select the value 00 062 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.619
 Now we find him edmund 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.920
 About titanium bar, here it is half a leopard default. 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:07.200
 then 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.200
 choose the value 00 062 call 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:22.000
 I was not ready to put a tick file so 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:22.000
 all now we go into the league of legends 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.020
 create custom game 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.560
 we do n't care 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.840
 also many questions on installation and 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.280
 more precisely 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:16.220
 people installs from the interface but he 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.519
 is installed incorrectly first by itself 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.150
 The main thing is to check the numbers when installing 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:30.099
 must be the maximum value 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:32.930
 except dejarse leopard default. then the second 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.350
 install but nothing with the interface 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.000
 happening or changing slightly 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.190
 maybe we used nerves 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.810
 odorgone program manager 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.810
 located on the same site 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.400
 developers gland hole profane on 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:54.830
 naturally go to this site 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.110
 You should not download this link or 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:03.799
 what's the other only binary 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:06.500
 we all check the user interface lot 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:09.829
 running problems also happen 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.310
 if not disabled hilda them a chance here 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:15.170
 she's the problem you don't see x caught 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.100
 his champion problem again 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:25.060
 solved answer publications made sense 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:26.990
 everything is in place everything remains as before 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.810
 only changed icons 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:34.580
 mappings instead of lettering 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.690
 the rest is left before this 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.340
 moment the developer is working on 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:46.450
 changing the store interface therefore 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.450
