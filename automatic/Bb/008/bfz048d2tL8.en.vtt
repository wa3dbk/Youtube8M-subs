00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 There are really people who address themselves 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.430
 to everything possible 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.400
 For example, I said that 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.160
 samsung nx200 has a autofocus from 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.690
 sunshine too slow and have 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.040
 accordingly very many very 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.420
 nice negative comments on it 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.350
 what I actually get here five 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.640
 sunshine well i know criticism leave 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.260
 I also liked it accordingly 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.420
 i just talked to samsung on the 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.580
 ifa mb here in berlin such a pine 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.510
 beforehand event that was there 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.519
 it's a couple of interesting ones 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.230
 information to anticipate it her 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.759
 I was right but I was right 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:40.649
 So check it out 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:42.480
 but she has learned immediately 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.129
 topple the autofocus so that was the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.870
 biggest criticism at all 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.950
 review the topic processing again 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.960
 because I criticized that up here 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.850
 everything seems a bit clear like 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.870
 and not as direct as metal there too 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.670
 I have with samsung again about it 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.770
 spoken on the ifa mb and her 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.629
 it was really magnesium 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.180
 but it is the plastering they act have 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.329
 because of very long production process 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.530
 gewerkelt 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.480
 that you really have magnesium like that 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.489
 can work and from the outside is yes 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.080
 Bringing a great shape is really 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.000
 how plastic works worked very well 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.590
 We fell for it themselves 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.030
 samsung germany has again and 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.220
 cover here built up around safely 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.630
 So are the gavelers from South Korea 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.040
 get no real info on how 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.450
 that really looks like that 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.740
 accordingly samsung cordial 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.390
 congratulations your engineers have real 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.920
 good work is done partially 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.020
 really easy the paving 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.250
 magnesium things accordingly 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.939
 processing quality but still one 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.990
 small plus 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.540
 I think that is definitely 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.310
 more robust than plaster but it works just fine 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.000
 kind of so good but as I said 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.000
 a plus point 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.350
 So comes directly to the autofocus because 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.780
 wait for them all very excited says 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.580
 at least that's waiting for it 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.830
 scarcely 600 mb had the firmware update 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.000
 provided android was 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.710
 Thanks must be a whole lot with 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 be updated and that has too 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.590
 really brought now it can also 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.540
 confirm the other message 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.430
 autofocus is really very very very 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.319
 has become very good at the camera and is 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.569
 I'm really quick with my now 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.950
 hand here just keep it focused 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.420
 really nice and fast 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.100
 again in the other direction 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.150
 a lot of good work done together and 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.250
 now it is really on the 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.510
 level of other system cameras apart 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.800
 maybe by recognizing her mw's 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.800
 but rather such a negative example 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.250
 after we process the topic 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.940
 our autofocus is already clear 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.220
 to have 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.780
 still know what a topic control what 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.100
 she always went that is yes here with 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.810
 also to focus on that 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.520
 touchdisplay and on one right 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.940
 trigger but also rate of course 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.010
 button what's new is that if you 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.720
 again just the possibility with 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.880
 pinch to zoom that was there before unfortunately 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.680
 not even that can be synonymous with the 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.030
 first firmware update first purely what 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.620
 however, I do not think so well 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.910
 works like the Canon cameras 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.440
 we are much further what I am 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.640
 in samsung has the 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.190
 actually much more experience in the 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.290
 area touch operation as know and 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.880
 of course , this 16 9 display 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.590
 at least I am the last time 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.720
 Of course, very, very nice 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.520
 unsuitable for that somehow pinch 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.620
 to zoom because it is just 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.880
 just insanely small in height and 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.410
 you have those down here as well 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.930
 So that's how it works and how it works 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.220
 is totally modest in here so me 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.260
 It's not so good because I'm here 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.860
 said out there that already there 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.330
 whole time 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.290
 So there might be a little something left 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.340
 it must be better , above all else 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.570
 become more sensitive 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.570
 I do not like it that way 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.940
 after the last update 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.680
 on the subject of autofocus processing and 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.150
 Also to control or Samsung update 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.410
 and we have an update oil 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.500
 have come again now 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.360
 Update from the conclusion enough update no matter we 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.970
 have said before the samsung exotics 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.800
 have total sunshine autofocus 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.850
 now even revise processing 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.500
 has become really good 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.360
 the 600 mb firmware update was good 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.100
 invested accordingly came now the 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.140
 nx200 is really recommendable 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.250
 a good system camera can become with 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.960
 keep up with the competition 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.460
 There are a few cameras they can do this 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.960
 or better for example the know 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.130
 you as a 100 de in the area of control 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.870
 it works better too 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.660
 more beautiful video autofocus especially with 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.860
 the stm objective in turn panasonic gf 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.000
 6 for example has in the field 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.830
 equipment even more 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.790
 offer and synonymous with the film mode otherwise 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.770
 but the samsung is really a good one 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.880
 camera which still bothers me and now 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.430
 really meanwhile the biggest 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.810
 horse foot in the film yes she has no 35 mm 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.700
 input for microphones 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.050
 that's just a shame for movies 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.500
 Actually the video is really not 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.030
 bad 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.040
 especially now in after the update also 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.630
 once again in things autofocus but 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.680
 just no microphone input so there has 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.370
 So you do not go to the wrong place 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.350
 saved up 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:16.860
 too bad a pity because as I said 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.860
 a good camera has become sunshine 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:31.270
 One then put that is something focus 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.180
 sounds weird but that's the way it is
