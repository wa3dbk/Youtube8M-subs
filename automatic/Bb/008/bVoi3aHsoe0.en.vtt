on<00:01:42.220> this<00:01:42.370> these<00:01:42.850> vines<00:01:43.180> that<00:01:43.330> I<00:01:43.420> got<00:01:43.570> set<00:01:43.780> up

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
on this these vines that I got set up

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.380 
on this these vines that I got set up
installed<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.340> big<00:01:45.460> fan<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:45.909> there<00:01:46.060> it<00:01:46.120> eats<00:01:46.240> an

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
installed a big fan and there it eats an

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.940 
installed a big fan and there it eats an
airflow<00:01:46.690> to<00:01:47.140> help<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.380> plant<00:01:47.590> feel<00:01:47.830> a<00:01:47.860> little

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
airflow to help the plant feel a little

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.320 
airflow to help the plant feel a little
bit<00:01:48.070> better<00:01:48.220> and<00:01:49.210> hopefully<00:01:50.880> keep<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.060> scale

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
bit better and hopefully keep the scale

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.120 
bit better and hopefully keep the scale
from<00:01:52.540> getting<00:01:53.170> out<00:01:53.260> of<00:01:53.290> hand<00:01:53.380> but<00:01:53.740> we'll<00:01:53.950> see

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
from getting out of hand but we'll see

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.510 
from getting out of hand but we'll see
how<00:01:54.159> that<00:01:54.280> works

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
how that works

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.660 
how that works
anyway<00:01:58.979> plants<00:01:59.979> are<00:02:00.070> doing<00:02:00.160> really<00:02:00.400> good<00:02:00.610> in

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
anyway plants are doing really good in

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.300 
anyway plants are doing really good in
there<00:02:00.910> so
