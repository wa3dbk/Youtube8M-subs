them<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.960> be<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.350> does<00:00:25.500> look<00:00:25.680> fairly<00:00:25.949> close

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
them to be and it does look fairly close

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.349 
them to be and it does look fairly close
to<00:00:26.400> us<00:00:26.550> oddly<00:00:27.269> enough<00:00:28.820> but<00:00:29.820> I'm<00:00:29.939> not<00:00:30.119> entirely

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
to us oddly enough but I'm not entirely

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.120 
to us oddly enough but I'm not entirely
sure<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> very<00:00:31.260> strong<00:00:31.500> suspicion<00:00:32.099> that

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
sure I have a very strong suspicion that

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.400 
sure I have a very strong suspicion that
this<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:34.340> toy<00:00:35.340> only<00:00:35.730> figure<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.329> mean<00:00:37.230> not

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
this is a toy only figure I mean not

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.720 
this is a toy only figure I mean not
appearing<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.890> movie<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.190> could<00:00:38.309> be<00:00:38.579> wrong

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
appearing in the movie I could be wrong

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.850 
appearing in the movie I could be wrong
but<00:00:38.790> I'm<00:00:39.210> pretty<00:00:39.719> sure<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.649> not

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
but I'm pretty sure this is this is not

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.170 
but I'm pretty sure this is this is not
going<00:00:41.040> character<00:00:41.579> not<00:00:41.730> appearing<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.149> the

completely out Oh actually first take
that<00:01:07.799> back<00:01:08.010> first<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.340> want<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.700> lift

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
that back first you want to do is lift

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.260 
that back first you want to do is lift
this<00:01:09.060> trunk<00:01:09.360> up<00:01:09.770> now<00:01:10.770> lift<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.100> up<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.460> push<00:01:12.150> it

this trunk up now lift it up and push it
all<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.390> way<00:01:12.510> up<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.470> then<00:01:13.590> split

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
all the way up like that and then split

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.510 
all the way up like that and then split
these<00:01:14.070> out<00:01:14.340> right<00:01:14.549> there<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:16.520> and

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
these out right there just like that and

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.679 
these out right there just like that and
then<00:01:18.030> split<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> legs<00:01:18.689> apart<00:01:20.150> down<00:01:21.150> here<00:01:21.450> and

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
then split the legs apart down here and

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.539 
then split the legs apart down here and
at<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.530> point<00:01:22.710> what<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.920> usually<00:01:23.100> do<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.369> I

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
at this point what I usually do is I

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.460 
at this point what I usually do is I
reach<00:01:23.700> back<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.210> flip<00:01:24.450> these<00:01:24.630> hood

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
reach back here and I flip these hood

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.340 
reach back here and I flip these hood
pieces<00:01:25.860> out<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.610> little<00:01:26.640> bit<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:28.170> they'll

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
pieces out just a little bit so they'll

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.840 
pieces out just a little bit so they'll
fold<00:01:28.560> up<00:01:28.770> properly<00:01:29.159> otherwise<00:01:29.310> they'll<00:01:29.729> get

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
fold up properly otherwise they'll get

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.850 
fold up properly otherwise they'll get
when<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.090> fold<00:01:30.270> these<00:01:30.450> pieces<00:01:30.840> back<00:01:31.140> they

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
when you fold these pieces back they

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.800 
when you fold these pieces back they
tend<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.250> get<00:01:32.340> caught<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.790> pop<00:01:33.150> off<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.600> fly

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
tend to get caught and pop off and fly

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.210 
tend to get caught and pop off and fly
off<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.229> if<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.439> have<00:01:34.560> those<00:01:34.680> out<00:01:34.860> just<00:01:35.130> a

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
off so if you have those out just a

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.100 
off so if you have those out just a
little<00:01:35.250> bit<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.360> then<00:01:36.390> fold<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.840> feet

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
little bit you can then fold the feet

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.410 
little bit you can then fold the feet
down<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.310> see<00:01:38.490> how<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.729> pace<00:01:38.939> rests

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
down and you can see how that pace rests

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.950 
down and you can see how that pace rests
over<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:43.280> over<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> hood<00:01:44.490> piece<00:01:44.700> there<00:01:44.960> I'm

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
over that over the hood piece there I'm

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.450 
over that over the hood piece there I'm
flipped<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.380> his<00:01:46.470> feet<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.920> his<00:01:47.009> heels

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.640 

do<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.580> same<00:01:51.790> on<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:52.090> Sun<00:01:52.330> again<00:01:52.930> you<00:01:53.320> see<00:01:53.500> how

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
do the same on the Sun again you see how

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.370 
do the same on the Sun again you see how
you<00:01:54.549> want<00:01:54.760> that<00:01:54.909> piece<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.270> sit<00:01:55.479> outside<00:01:55.780> that

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
you want that piece to sit outside that

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.920 
you want that piece to sit outside that
hole<00:01:56.619> if<00:01:56.799> it<00:01:56.890> gets<00:01:57.070> stuck<00:01:57.340> in<00:01:57.520> there<00:01:57.930> sometimes

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
hole if it gets stuck in there sometimes

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:08.180 
hole if it gets stuck in there sometimes
it'll<00:01:59.500> pop<00:01:59.799> right<00:01:59.830> off

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.460
