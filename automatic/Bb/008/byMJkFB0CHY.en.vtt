00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
for a TV the world is thinking when we

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.900 
for a TV the world is thinking when we
talk<00:00:08.370> about<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:09.030> as<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.019> single<00:00:10.440> person<00:00:10.920> it

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
talk about you as a single person it

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.829 
talk about you as a single person it
turns<00:00:12.179> out<00:00:12.389> that's<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.349> first<00:00:13.620> misstep<00:00:14.839> you

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
turns out that's the first misstep you

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.620 
turns out that's the first misstep you
are<00:00:16.020> not<00:00:16.199> one<00:00:16.470> thing<00:00:16.940> people<00:00:17.940> are<00:00:18.330> are<00:00:18.570> a

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
are not one thing people are are a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.210 
are not one thing people are are a
multiplicity<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.740> different<00:00:20.100> things

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
multiplicity of different things

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.679 
multiplicity of different things
happening<00:00:20.640> inside<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.029> brain<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.359> right<00:00:21.570> way

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
happening inside the brain the right way

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:22.759 
happening inside the brain the right way
to<00:00:21.750> think<00:00:21.840> about<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.230> brain<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.619> like<00:00:22.740> a

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
to think about the brain is like a

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:23.870 
to think about the brain is like a
parliament<00:00:23.400> where<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.730> different

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
parliament where you have different

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.330 
parliament where you have different
political<00:00:24.180> parties<00:00:24.500> that<00:00:25.500> are<00:00:25.560> all<00:00:25.769> battling

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
political parties that are all battling

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.519 
political parties that are all battling
it<00:00:26.490> out<00:00:26.580> at<00:00:26.880> any<00:00:27.029> given<00:00:27.330> time<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.230> first

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
it out at any given time so the first

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.080 
it out at any given time so the first
mistake<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.160> think<00:00:29.429> has<00:00:29.519> been<00:00:29.699> made<00:00:29.880> for

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
mistake that I think has been made for

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.780 
mistake that I think has been made for
the<00:00:30.179> last<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.779> know<00:00:31.399> century<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.460> when<00:00:32.669> people

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
the last you know century is when people

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.069 
the last you know century is when people
think<00:00:33.120> about<00:00:33.300> how<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.809> brain<00:00:34.020> actually

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
think about how the brain actually

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.840 
think about how the brain actually
operates<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.070> think<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.610> as<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
operates is to think of it as a as a

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.090 
operates is to think of it as a as a
single<00:00:36.660> device<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.469> know<00:00:37.559> sort<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.860> one

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
fact what you have are all these

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.330

competing<00:00:42.719> networks<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.530> brain<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:44.280> are

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
competing networks in the brain that are

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.040 
competing networks in the brain that are

right it's all you but you have these

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.500 
right it's all you but you have these
different<00:01:11.670> networks<00:01:11.939> some<00:01:12.119> are<00:01:12.210> involved<00:01:12.479> in

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
different networks some are involved in

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.060 
different networks some are involved in
short-term<00:01:12.869> decision<00:01:13.409> making<00:01:13.770> some<00:01:13.979> are

short-term decision making some are
involved<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.549> longer-term<00:01:15.140> abstractions<00:01:16.140> and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
involved in longer-term abstractions and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.590 
involved in longer-term abstractions and
they're<00:01:17.369> always<00:01:17.549> fighting<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.210> out<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
they're always fighting it out and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.060 
they're always fighting it out and
battling<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:19.170> each<00:01:19.320> other<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.860> think

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
battling with each other and I think

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.719 
battling with each other and I think
that's<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:20.700> that's<00:01:21.060> really<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:22.700> what<00:01:23.700> I

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
that's I think that's really the what I

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.090 
that's I think that's really the what I
see<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> framework<00:01:24.900> that's<00:01:25.830> going<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
see is the framework that's going to

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.590 
see is the framework that's going to
help<00:01:26.220> us<00:01:26.430> get<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> next<00:01:27.090> step<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.540> I'll

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
help us get to the next step so I'll

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.819 
help us get to the next step so I'll
just<00:01:27.630> give<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.900> an<00:01:28.020> example<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.560> what<00:01:28.680> we've

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
just give you an example is what we've

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.160 
just give you an example is what we've
been<00:01:28.979> doing<00:01:29.490> my<00:01:29.790> lab<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.180> many<00:01:30.299> others<00:01:30.630> over

at<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> point<00:01:39.000> now<00:01:39.150> where<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.630> actually

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
at a point now where we can actually

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.510 
at a point now where we can actually
tease<00:01:40.200> these<00:01:40.439> networks<00:01:40.829> apart<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.369> start

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
tease these networks apart and start

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.620 
tease these networks apart and start
looking<00:01:41.700> at<00:01:41.939> what<00:01:42.119> are<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.299> different

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
looking at what are the different

things always fighting it out but the

key<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.770> it's<00:02:05.219> all<00:02:05.520> happening<00:02:06.409> incognito<00:02:07.409> you

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
key is it's all happening incognito you

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.350 
key is it's all happening incognito you
don't<00:02:07.829> know<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.489> right<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.000> when<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.209> go<00:02:09.300> to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
don't know this right so when you go to

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.869 
don't know this right so when you go to

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
which ice cream to get there's a lot of

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.820 
which ice cream to get there's a lot of
stuff<00:02:15.450> happening<00:02:15.840> under<00:02:16.049> there<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.349> you

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
stuff happening under there and you

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.920 
stuff happening under there and you
don't<00:02:17.010> know<00:02:17.220> why<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.610> eventually<00:02:18.150> grab<00:02:18.690> that

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
don't know why you eventually grab that

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.899 
don't know why you eventually grab that
one<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.290> not<00:02:19.379> that<00:02:19.620> one<00:02:19.799> and<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.099> essentially

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
one and not that one and so essentially

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.089 
one and not that one and so essentially
when<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.360> was<00:02:21.750> growing<00:02:22.230> as<00:02:22.440> soon<00:02:22.680> as<00:02:22.799> true<00:02:22.950> for

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
when I was growing as soon as true for

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.100 
when I was growing as soon as true for
everybody<00:02:23.400> in<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.790> room<00:02:23.909> I<00:02:24.090> expected<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:24.930> by

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
everybody in the room I expected that by

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.509 
everybody in the room I expected that by
the<00:02:25.170> year<00:02:26.180> 2011<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:27.659> would<00:02:27.870> have<00:02:27.900> robots<00:02:28.620> right

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
the year 2011 we would have robots right

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.339 
the year 2011 we would have robots right
c-3po<00:02:30.329> time<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.690> smartest<00:02:31.110> thing<00:02:31.200> we've<00:02:31.319> got

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
c-3po time the smartest thing we've got

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.589 
c-3po time the smartest thing we've got
is<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.739> Roomba<00:02:32.099> vacuum<00:02:32.129> cleaner<00:02:32.849> so<00:02:33.390> some

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
is the Roomba vacuum cleaner so some

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.539 
is the Roomba vacuum cleaner so some
went<00:02:33.810> really<00:02:33.989> wrong<00:02:34.290> here<00:02:34.349> right<00:02:34.950> hey<00:02:35.310> I

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
went really wrong here right hey I

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.910 
went really wrong here right hey I
failed<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.989> question<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:37.319> why<00:02:37.560> does<00:02:37.799> it

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
failed and the question is why does it

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.100 
failed and the question is why does it
fail<00:02:38.159> well<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.790> really<00:02:39.030> hard<00:02:39.329> problem<00:02:39.569> is

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
fail well it's a really hard problem is

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.750 
fail well it's a really hard problem is
part<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.650> thing<00:02:40.799> but<00:02:40.829> also<00:02:41.129> it's<00:02:41.430> because

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
part of the thing but also it's because

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.660 
part of the thing but also it's because
the<00:02:42.209> way<00:02:42.360> it's<00:02:42.510> always<00:02:42.629> been<00:02:42.720> approached<00:02:43.200> is

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
the way it's always been approached is

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.610 
the way it's always been approached is
ok<00:02:44.670> well<00:02:44.819> let's<00:02:44.970> crack<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.840> problem<00:02:46.260> up<00:02:46.379> into

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
ok well let's crack the problem up into

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.680 
ok well let's crack the problem up into
a<00:02:46.650> bunch<00:02:46.859> of<00:02:46.950> small<00:02:47.250> parts<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.819> each<00:02:48.239> part<00:02:48.629> of

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
a bunch of small parts and each part of

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.880 
a bunch of small parts and each part of
the<00:02:48.750> problem<00:02:49.019> if<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.349> can<00:02:49.500> solve<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.859> like

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
the problem if you can solve it like

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.160 
the problem if you can solve it like
okay<00:02:50.250> get<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.849> robot<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.150> find<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.690> block<00:02:51.870> ok

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
okay get the robot to find the block ok

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.140 
okay get the robot to find the block ok
fine<00:02:52.349> now<00:02:52.530> grab<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:52.920> block<00:02:53.310> now<00:02:53.549> stack<00:02:53.879> the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
fine now grab the block now stack the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.490 
fine now grab the block now stack the
block<00:02:54.329> you<00:02:54.690> divide<00:02:55.079> any<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.290> these<00:02:55.349> little

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
block you divide any of these little

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.690 
block you divide any of these little
parts<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:55.920> then<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.129> think<00:02:56.340> you're<00:02:56.459> done

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
parts and then you think you're done

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.789 
parts and then you think you're done
well<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.329> never<00:02:57.450> worked<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:58.049> think<00:02:58.319> the

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
well that never worked I think the

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.449 
well that never worked I think the
future<00:02:59.549> of<00:02:59.730> AI<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.209> going<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.959> lie<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.620> building

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
future of AI is going to lie in building

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.490 
future of AI is going to lie in building
machines<00:03:02.909> of<00:03:03.180> conflicting<00:03:03.900> parts<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.409> way

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
machines of conflicting parts the way

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.530 
machines of conflicting parts the way
the<00:03:04.620> brain<00:03:04.829> actually<00:03:05.099> operates<00:03:05.790> something

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
the brain actually operates something

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.839 
the brain actually operates something
more<00:03:06.720> like<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.069> that's<00:03:08.579> what<00:03:08.790> I

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849
