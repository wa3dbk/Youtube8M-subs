10 or something then for smell at all I
would<00:03:54.610> almost<00:03:55.180> double<00:03:55.840> that<00:03:56.070> so<00:03:57.070> now<00:03:57.280> when

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
would almost double that so now when

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.630 
would almost double that so now when
sometimes<00:03:58.000> type<00:03:58.870> /<00:03:59.200> smelt<00:03:59.680> it<00:03:59.980> will<00:04:00.190> work<00:04:00.400> with

sometimes type / smelt it will work with

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.270 
sometimes type / smelt it will work with
absolute<00:04:01.150> 10<00:04:01.330> more<00:04:01.450> seconds<00:04:01.959> to<00:04:02.830> finish<00:04:03.010> it

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
absolute 10 more seconds to finish it

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.150 
absolute 10 more seconds to finish it
when<00:04:03.610> they<00:04:03.790> do<00:04:03.850> sighs<00:04:04.450> smelt<00:04:04.780> all<00:04:05.010> they<00:04:06.010> have

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
to wait 20 seconds before they can smelt

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.390
