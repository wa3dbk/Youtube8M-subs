 hello to all guys from the face that not 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.010
 you never know the computer from shooting so much 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.810
 time that I did not computer instead 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.699
 don't apply it, it's what this game is 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.529
 This here is an ion this game I 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.640
 welcome is the most popular year in the world 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:28.519
 then me and tivoli and designed the 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.890
 disaster in this game excessively 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.840
 it was strong that instead it was much more 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.170
 papi is scarce of him that is used 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.360
 really justice to play and a lot 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.879
 a very listening dialogue have been neither 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.680
 all this sounds very cool a site 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.640
 of the common premise is called unreal 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.219
 tournament 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.620
 the case more than not this is a su 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.260
 a short story is not an alpha is one 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.120
 prey on kids then the graphics 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.190
 the effect they were very much on the air 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.109
 ancient of all leaving the convenient 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.280
 Latin star who based personal 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.269
 sufficient on the playability of the 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.300
 attendance of which 36 quake iii arena is 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.330
 been for us to see for ourselves that 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.330
 we have 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.160
 I remember we had to go to school 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.740
 then he would like then it was then 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.680
 that I do it so but it is not 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.590
 stand where I went up to shoot shoot 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.860
 crap tower will be this year has not 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.300
 explained listened to the right so I did not 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.270
 heard to show you girls 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.220
 however who of you has more or less the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.200
 half or however and these fans 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.710
 data then downloaded it already played 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.860
 re to the tournament and will know that this is 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.080
 a shit the poor here we are scarce 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.990
 and goal is avoided because it does not play with us 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.850
 more from how many have known for many years 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.850
 wish everyone is not in 2003 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.009
 we are 2015, I am 12 years old 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.660
 we touch minutes as a boy I tell you 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.100
 I was n't strong but I enjoyed it 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.350
 so much to play with my friends and 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.000
 we played well again we find in school 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:09.660
 through I have decided to kill use 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.540
 the computer type with that no challenge 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.340
 with the former friend's payman computer though 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.360
 we managed to run out and to graphics 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.360
 pop and or scrausa 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.190
 is the state that the buoy that we will use with 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.140
 calm club but this here is you're dead the 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.500
 beautiful beautiful thing of all power 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.460
 another hour in the gun that knows well 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.290
 that all more 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.180
 they will love if events that are not 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.940
 absolutely no skin type is not 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.730
 known no as we say of 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.280
 power-up found on the map and the 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.750
 addition to upgrades and weapons for one 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.240
 map anyway how it can take 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.830
 and therefore enough the helmet the schools 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.530
 this visit where it is enough 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.080
 balanced as a game woken up just that 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.970
 it is not balanced as an exact meaning 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.190
 that there are dying of colors 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.720
 studies that shit the fuck 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.330
 what good he was that he didn't rinse 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.130
 it's easy but it's translated was I remember 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.260
 that I always played the shock mode 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.940
 lethal that practically a dead shot e 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.250
 he shot a dead man and I don't know 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.830
 understand that i 'm doing is washing i 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.450
 walk a kind of a shot mode 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.010
 circle more teams obviously much more 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.330
 that an africa where fuck born to state 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.760
 we have always been training the 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.160
 carry if between these catches flavio 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.320
 now then ignoring the mentor flag 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.180
 they are changing the teleportation e 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.160
 so yes for quick dumps but it goes from 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.690
 that asshole 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.090
 here are some rules for example the 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.739
 plaque fee to eliminate the enemy or 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.550
 less course you have to shoot on the ground yes 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.530
 it's not crap 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.660
 yes because the shots bounce is one 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.220
 pure technique this Africa to take of 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.860
 shoot the ball you just left 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.870
 we must killed more ass you can see 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.190
 the beautiful the work made to see the sphere 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.989
 yes but if it seems to me I have not understood 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.970
 advice I fired right button and 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.860
 left on spain the ball like 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.670
 you are framing moretti up wrong 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.970
 all weapons 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.370
 a dual mode of fire that 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.170
 I know I killed him that big is understood 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.860
 this is this sphere that explodes that 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.750
 which leads 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.120
 exact is the weapon that we say the most victory 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.010
 in detail more energy also armor 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.020
 if you have it because during the map 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.000
 we are in the place of weapons in these 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.810
 there are things there was a poor life e 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.120
 armor 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.709
 obviously if you take these I am the 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.250
 a whole life if I don't take it because 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.250
 I don't take it 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.830
 don't stand behind here where you are 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.620
 from the killing it happens 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.539
 almost to the hands but if in theory if there was 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.259
 quality plan because it cannot become 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:45.330
 in addition the weapon left very strong 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:48.720
 this you have the right click mode 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.539
 of the march he received shoots of 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.610
 missiles in a row mean that before them 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.350
 loaded like this to fire me finally 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.759
 I remember that I did not come back in 2004 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.830
 it will be the way the seas for the ride to that 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.000
 same the left button turned in 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.080
 hit one more straight at 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.630
 target or if instead lieutenant has 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.330
 joked on the right button they left 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:09.150
 current ok guys meanwhile it is sold 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.099
 a massacre on games like the lady ok 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.979
 perfect then I am sixty years old 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:18.690
 there are types ethical movements are not 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:25.470
 mica means these anita state 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:27.360
 spread the mandate fucking other guys 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.060
 what i am no longer used to not 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.699
 you must never and never call call to stay 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:37.190
 never move randomly but not 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.190
 double duplicates also come in 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.459
 but what does the lateral state have 

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:44.110
 still immediately in spite of the exact side 

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:45.999
 there is the type the ex we say you 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.749
 crushed the two times I don't know 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:51.969
 what is fucking computer? 

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:56.800
 We pay 666 motorbikes here I don't understand 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:59.469
 see that you are a red circle 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.599
 on the head and to hit 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:04.629
 I do n't know no it's a statement to go 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:06.580
 a question and it is probable but excuse is 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:11.110
 probable and it is obvious that it gives title in 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:15.129
 castrocielo before shooting the ball to the 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:17.830
 ain precision works if this 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:20.439
 mode capture the flag so only 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.330
 so the ball a lot but is not that the cd 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:26.159
 with a single stroke between the ball I say how 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.159
 if we see if fishing or for morra 

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:30.659
 however bitches of the hunt 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:41.369
 here is this I 'm eliminated for dad 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:44.649
 I blew it up so the water is the 

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:45.789
 sincere use to kampala from the key from on 

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:47.619
 left button right button of 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:49.719
 teleport you see maniac staff 

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:52.770
 convulsively fine that less 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:54.430
 this agreement goes well guys 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.199
 pinguins of the match 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.599
 oh well but no wins you have always tried 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:00.009
 the ancient dawns plane knows how many of 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:03.749
 you have players that an edition 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:03.749
