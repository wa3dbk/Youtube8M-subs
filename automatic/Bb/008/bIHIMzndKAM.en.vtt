00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
didn't take that man just in this is the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.880 
didn't take that man just in this is the
gameplay<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.750> makes<00:01:15.930> me<00:01:16.049> want<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.320> believe

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
gameplay that makes me want to believe

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.190 
gameplay that makes me want to believe
that<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.970> quantity<00:01:18.240> cleaner<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.689> possible

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that the quantity cleaner is possible

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.499 
that the quantity cleaner is possible
because<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.130> get<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.490> many<00:01:20.729> kills<00:01:21.030> you

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
because if you get this many kills you

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.570 
because if you get this many kills you
can't<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> quad<00:01:22.380> nuclear<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.040> possible

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
can't get the quad nuclear it's possible

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.609 
can't get the quad nuclear it's possible
i<00:01:23.790> took<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.450> triple<00:01:24.840> nuclear<00:01:25.140> skin<00:01:25.409> class

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
i took the triple nuclear skin class

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.499 
i took the triple nuclear skin class
just<00:01:25.830> plain<00:01:26.040> really<00:01:26.759> reckless<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.270> scheme

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
just plain really reckless the scheme

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.080 
just plain really reckless the scheme
the<00:01:27.990> i<00:01:28.020> picked<00:01:28.409> up<00:01:28.560> three<00:01:28.740> level<00:01:29.130> system<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.970> i

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the i picked up three level system and i

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.370 
the i picked up three level system and i
picked<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.479> new<00:01:30.600> cut<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.869> end<00:01:31.020> i<00:01:31.110> believe
