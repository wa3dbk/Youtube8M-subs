crunchy don't pay attention to how the
top<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:22.910> my<00:02:23.060> hair<00:02:23.330> look<00:02:23.480> in<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.750> bed<00:02:23.900> like<00:02:24.140> I

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
top of my hair look in the bed like I

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.140 
top of my hair look in the bed like I
didn't<00:02:24.800> part<00:02:25.190> my<00:02:25.310> hair<00:02:25.340> correctly<00:02:25.940> when<00:02:26.090> I

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
didn't part my hair correctly when I

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.740 
didn't part my hair correctly when I
spout<00:02:26.570> it<00:02:26.840> but<00:02:27.790> it's<00:02:28.790> pretty<00:02:29.030> good<00:02:29.270> hold<00:02:29.540> it

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
spout it but it's pretty good hold it

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.440 
spout it but it's pretty good hold it
didn't<00:02:29.990> take<00:02:30.110> long<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.320> dry<00:02:31.150> maybe<00:02:32.150> three

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
didn't take long to dry maybe three

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.660 
didn't take long to dry maybe three
hours<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:33.290> dry<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:36.470> doesn't<00:02:37.070> feel<00:02:37.100> crunchy

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
hours to dry and it doesn't feel crunchy

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.850 
hours to dry and it doesn't feel crunchy
which<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.180> was<00:02:38.300> very<00:02:38.510> surprised<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.590> only

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
which I was very surprised the only

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.110 
which I was very surprised the only
thing<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.190> would<00:02:40.250> do<00:02:40.430> differently<00:02:40.820> I

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
thing that I would do differently I

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.530 
thing that I would do differently I
would<00:02:41.360> probably<00:02:42.459> from<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.580> beginning<00:02:43.970> divide

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
would probably from the beginning divide

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.120 
would probably from the beginning divide
my<00:02:44.810> hair<00:02:44.840> into<00:02:45.050> sections<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.680> apply<00:02:46.070> the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
my hair into sections and apply the

a<00:02:55.100> little<00:02:55.520> bit<00:02:55.730> too<00:02:56.270> because<00:02:57.050> it<00:02:57.200> would<00:02:57.350> be<00:02:57.380> so

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
a little bit too because it would be so

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.920 
a little bit too because it would be so
thick<00:02:58.010> but<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.550> distributes<00:02:59.300> pretty<00:02:59.720> well

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
thick but it distributes pretty well

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.420 
thick but it distributes pretty well
throughout<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.410> hair<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:01.690> it's<00:03:02.690> cheap<00:03:03.620> 799

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
throughout the hair and it's cheap 799

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.110 
throughout the hair and it's cheap 799
and<00:03:04.970> it's<00:03:05.239> so<00:03:05.360> dat<00:03:05.540> target<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:05.959> walk-ins
