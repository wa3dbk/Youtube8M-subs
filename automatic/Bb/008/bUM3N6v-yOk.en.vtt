00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 for this tablet blog.de I am currently on 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.270
 stood by trekstor on the cebit in 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.910
 Hanover 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.300
 and we have the trekstor search here 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.429
 app eyelash 11.6 at least it says 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.160
 apple is currently so is only against 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.460
 summer appears at the starting price of 349 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.320
 Euro 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.109
 the name is not final yet 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.390
 it may Eisner is 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.980
 there the next months decided 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.429
 In any case, this is an 11.6 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.779
 inches tall is windows tablet with windows 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.550
 8.1 that unfortunately can not yet 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.340
 turn on that is probably only one 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.960
 earlier prototype but still that is up 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.850
 every case at the price an exciting one 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.550
 tablet because we have the said here 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 11.6 inch display that we have 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.280
 not always on windows tablets and before 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.020
 all an aluminum back so the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.899
 Processing is pretty much done here 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.250
 It is relatively thin and feels good 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.050
 I will not fall in hand 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.590
 fast one another is just one 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.789
 Back made of aluminum and nothing going on 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.789
 here but dull one sees so 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.920
 fingerprints not so fast 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.130
 This tablet wants to trekstor to 1 1 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.100
 business customer but also and pupil 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.299
 normal consumers sell and it 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.350
 makes a pretty good impression so far 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.180
 as now can see can be 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.040
 Of course, do not turn it on 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.049
 times fast to the hardware as I said 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.240
 11.6 inch display that will be 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.619
 either with a hd resolution or 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.290
 to give full hd resolution 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.610
 So either 1280 x 800 pixels or 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.869
 1120 x 1200 pixels and in there 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.689
 Also, depending on a model 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.060
 intel-atom-processor without work intel 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.130
 Core processor, for example, too 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.110
 can be found in the new macbook of apple 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.890
 So it's the same fate 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.439
 there is 149 euros are of course 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.270
 for the internet variant 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.390
 there are two gigabytes 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.670
 Memory and various internal 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.479
 memory options either 32gb or 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.840
 64gb always a little bit around the tray 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.460
 around 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.780
 we have a camera here on the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.640
 backside a hdmi exit 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.369
 it says here maybe it comes 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.410
 one more button kept saying another 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.970
 prototype 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.530
 it is probably charged with that 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.300
 Then a micro-usb port one 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.550
 sim card slot if it is also a 3g 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.620
 option give a micro sd card slot 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.000
 down here we have another connector 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.870
 For the keyboard , let's take a look 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.670
 same again 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.120
 We then have two speakers on the 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.930
 side a button a volume rocker 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.300
 and in front we have one more 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.340
 front camera a windows button here 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.510
 below, as I said everything made of aluminum 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.130
 feels really good 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.860
 the antennas are probably behind the 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.550
 plastic is plastic here installed 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.880
 even the only plastic keeps that there 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.520
 here 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.710
 trekstor more often 11.6 is exciting 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.690
 is that there is a keyboard to it 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.450
 So a notebook replacement or cling 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.000
 as notebooks to use it right with the 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.730
 variant of payment is the keyboard 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.500
 apparently by default while the 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.730
 Dogmatism is a bit different 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.940
 Otherwise we know about the wild animal 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.380
 mÃ¢con detained and a place money man 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.040
 It can not be that high either 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.990
 apart 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.610
 if you can work it will come 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.700
 but here we have so no 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.590
 Spaniards like many others 21 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.990
 see devices and so it is then 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.140
 not out, I hope at least small 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.700
 If you use the tablet with the 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.430
 keyboard dock then you have 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.310
 still on the back two standard usb 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.740
 Connections the mind patterns usb 2.0 ports 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.680
 maybe also usb 3.0 if you 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.600
 because the keyboard seems to be here 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.890
 to be relatively cool 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.870
 eat chiclet design a relatively small 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.940
 trackpad that's a pity we have 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.800
 almost always at keyboard dogs 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.260
 but good we have your part playing 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.100
 that is not so important what 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.810
 one must remember that never is 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.470
 no bluetooth keyboard that is 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.820
 practically because you have keyboard 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.060
 Do not charge separately as you can in it 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.650
 most recently with asus and 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.510
 Lenovo have seen something 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.690
 that's pretty good that you have to mention 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.090
 yes, there is a physical one here 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.950
 Connection between tablet antennas 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.380
 between tablet and doc that means one 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.010
 does not have to charge your battery that extra 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.550
 is 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.110
 tactically good that's a quick hands 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:25.520
 on video with that not quite 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:27.650
 finish trekstor surf.red winton 11.6 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.740
 There are optional 3g different 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.510
 variants with full hd display 12 and 32 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.350
 gigabyte memory and as I said 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.670
 internet or core processor makes you one 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.900
 very good impression especially if it is 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.970
 for 149 euros 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.130
 then appears as I said is only in 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.050
 summer as far as I'm an attorney 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.050
 Thank you for sending blog.de
