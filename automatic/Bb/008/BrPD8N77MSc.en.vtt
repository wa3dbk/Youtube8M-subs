 and 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:09.410
 Well, let's proceed to the analysis of the song 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.660
 repent original remembering if i don't 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:18.350
 I am mistaken in general then the first map of us is 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.370
 rooms unevenly house of norms 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.040
 naturally 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.640
 chord domain he bet as you bet 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.970
 ax cm if anyone does not understand what this 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.970
 chord c 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.960
 undertakes und act on guitar third on 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.439
 the third fret pinch 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.119
 finger 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:44.420
 all strings on the third fret middle 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:47.409
 finger put on the second string 4 frets 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.590
 the police put 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:54.509
 2 strings and then nameless and little finger 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.509
 we put on the fifth fret 3 3 strings 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.990
 and it plays on it so that there is a 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.970
 war for 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:12.340
 simple usually mushrooms i.e. 5 4 3 2 1 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.990
 can now without first shift to whom 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.990
 need hard just 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.460
 with not the sperm of this country but with 3 string 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.340
 I mean something than 3 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:39.920
 next room gi es 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:45.650
 wonders ordinary unusual chord therefore 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:48.830
 he put che usually put sets he 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.580
 differently called but ds is important to me 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.140
 it we have one weasel ends take the same 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:00.250
 like this and pinch your finger 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:03.980
 strings on the fourth fret agreed 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:08.239
 then middle finger middle finger 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:13.950
 we put on the 3rd third string of the 5th fret and on 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:17.599
 6 on 6 frets fourth and fifth string 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:22.670
 this is playing these 12 these chords 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:27.860
 your eyes are a little closer to the scales 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.860
 the chord to live with is played up such that is 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:41.070
 pull the 6th string the wind is not 3 4 6 4 3 2 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:50.690
 1 2 1 3 or 2 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:54.140
 often look know the fourth 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:04:00.370
 because this is the first 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:05.420
 the next chord we stub but without 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:08.270
 mediocre fall and yes as his choice and how 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.490
 chosen let's analyze how to take it 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.040
 forefinger, too, hold 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.590
 usual rector often im jeff figure 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.859
 breaker forefinger and then on 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.260
 third fret 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:29.210
 nameless and little finger 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:30.919
 clamp 5 4 string he takes it 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:36.919
 generally taken a man is taken 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:39.200
 afraid he is shorter than 6 6 well shorter as her 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.500
 how did he hall 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:47.810
 let's beat three of these chords at once 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:50.100
 that is, your eyes just below the horizon 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.990
 we lived 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.540
 farther 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.260
 they rest four props up to 4 cards 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.540
 Th us, it is as I showed at the beginning of what 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:06.680
 so many 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.680
 but these fingers stop shorter okay 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.870
 change for 1 mile from people and from this 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.660
 from the videotape and so on what am i 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.759
 stopped on chord g 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.120
 Something I said that we rearrange all these 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.120
 fingers 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:37.009
 accord and the company is breaking out as accurately as 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:37.009
 and hds means this wind 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.010
 at 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:48.580
 on counted and 6 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:51.490
 created 4 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.979
 In principle, you can snatch whether I want to 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.590
 personally think of as a neuroma simply 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:06:02.710
 took the guitar and so the signal immediately and so 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:06.870
 It went wrong Well, everything seems to be told 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:10.840
 told what and how to take chords 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.480
 fight before the chorus who are interested let's 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.160
 We will analyze lepila that is, we take 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.160
 chord C in C minor and 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.160
