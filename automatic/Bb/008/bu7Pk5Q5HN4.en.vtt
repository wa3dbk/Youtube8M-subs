00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
ps4 so you do not have to start over

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.200 
ps4 so you do not have to start over
which<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.620> very<00:00:55.770> convenient<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.489> mean<00:00:56.670> that

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
which is very convenient I mean that

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.229 
which is very convenient I mean that
would<00:00:57.329> be<00:00:57.420> really<00:00:57.719> dumb<00:00:57.960> if<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.199> played<00:00:58.859> on

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
would be really dumb if you played on

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.670 
would be really dumb if you played on
all<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.510> time<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.050> then<00:01:01.199> again<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.559> to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
all that time and then again you have to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.619 
all that time and then again you have to
start<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:02.010> Xbox<00:01:02.370> one<00:01:02.460> then<00:01:03.030> again<00:01:03.239> some<00:01:03.420> people

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
start on Xbox one then again some people

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.700 
start on Xbox one then again some people
might<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.080> because<00:01:04.350> they<00:01:04.500> may<00:01:04.680> have

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
might like it because they may have

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.620 
might like it because they may have
maxed<00:01:05.220> out<00:01:05.309> their<00:01:05.519> prestige<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.119> other

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
maxed out their prestige and other

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.080 
maxed out their prestige and other
consoles<00:01:07.400> but<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.430> don't<00:01:08.640> know<00:01:08.700> most<00:01:08.939> people

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
consoles but I don't know most people

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.600 
consoles but I don't know most people
would<00:01:09.270> really<00:01:09.540> enjoy<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.110> fact<00:01:10.409> also<00:01:10.710> this

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
would really enjoy this fact also this

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.500 
would really enjoy this fact also this
is<00:01:11.729> another<00:01:11.909> thing<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.119> want<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.299> talk<00:01:12.420> about

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
is another thing I want to talk about

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.300 
is another thing I want to talk about
this<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.960> something<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.380> think<00:01:13.500> gamestop

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.670 
this is something that I think gamestop
is<00:01:14.520> only<00:01:14.760> doing<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.299> what<00:01:15.960> they're<00:01:16.110> doing<00:01:16.140> is

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
is only doing and what they're doing is

another whole sixty dollars for a game

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.100 
another whole sixty dollars for a game
you<00:01:46.890> basically<00:01:47.579> already<00:01:47.939> have<00:01:48.210> except<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:49.049> on

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
you basically already have except for on

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.179 
you basically already have except for on
a<00:01:49.140> different<00:01:49.500> console<00:01:50.090> because<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:52.259> Xbox<00:01:52.890> one

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
a different console because the Xbox one

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.109 
a different console because the Xbox one
and<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.460> ps4<00:01:54.240> are<00:01:54.869> not<00:01:55.549> backwards<00:01:56.549> compatible

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
and the ps4 are not backwards compatible

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.010 
and the ps4 are not backwards compatible
that<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.329> think<00:01:57.479> that's<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.689> word<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.899> was

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
that I think that's the word I was

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.209 
that I think that's the word I was
thinking<00:01:58.079> about<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.469> okay<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.979> think<00:01:59.070> it's

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
thinking about it okay I think it's

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.340 
thinking about it okay I think it's
backwards<00:01:59.610> compatible<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.329> cannot<00:02:00.840> run<00:02:01.049> games

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
backwards compatible it cannot run games

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.550 
backwards compatible it cannot run games
off<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.860> previous<00:02:02.369> previous<00:02:03.000> consoles<00:02:03.560> so

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
off the previous previous consoles so

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.630 
off the previous previous consoles so
that<00:02:04.799> would<00:02:04.890> be<00:02:04.979> very<00:02:05.130> helpful

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
that would be very helpful

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.240 
that would be very helpful
basically<00:02:06.210> it'd<00:02:06.659> be<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.020> paying<00:02:07.290> only<00:02:07.590> $70

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
basically it'd be you paying only $70

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.820 
basically it'd be you paying only $70
instead<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.759> essentially<00:02:09.179> paying<00:02:09.390> $120<00:02:10.379> so

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
instead of essentially paying $120 so

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.110 
instead of essentially paying $120 so
would<00:02:10.920> help<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.160> out<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> lot<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.580> saving<00:02:11.970> money

saving more money even if you were to
sell<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.810> game<00:02:15.959> because<00:02:16.440> if<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.650> were<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.890> go
