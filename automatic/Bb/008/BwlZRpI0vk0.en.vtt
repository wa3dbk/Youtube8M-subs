your hosting if you need to then you

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.080 
your hosting if you need to then you

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
PHP settings and this can be really

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.080 
PHP settings and this can be really

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
hosting set up on digital ocean and

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.190 
hosting set up on digital ocean and
digitalocean<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.940> really<00:00:42.719> great<00:00:42.870> way<00:00:43.170> to

by<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.200> end<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.649> series<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.700> server

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
by the end of this series is a server

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.110 
by the end of this series is a server
that<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.690> fully<00:00:52.020> manage<00:00:52.460> you<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.489> upload

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
that you can fully manage you can upload

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.420 
that you can fully manage you can upload
to<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.110> access<00:00:55.530> with<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.800> domain<00:00:56.160> name

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
to you can access with the domain name

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.319 
to you can access with the domain name
so<00:00:56.610> we're<00:00:56.699> going<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.850> be<00:00:56.940> looking<00:00:57.210> at

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
so we're going to be looking at

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.569 
so we're going to be looking at
attaching<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> domain<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.410> our<00:00:58.500> server<00:00:58.800> and

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
attaching a domain to our server and

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.369 
attaching a domain to our server and
we'll<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.879> covering<00:01:00.210> all<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.260> you're

literally ready to go now if you're a
little<00:01:03.899> bit<00:01:04.080> worried<00:01:04.500> about<00:01:04.920> not<00:01:05.309> using<00:01:05.670> a

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
little bit worried about not using a

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.690 
little bit worried about not using a
hosting<00:01:06.210> service<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.869> GoDaddy<00:01:07.409> or<00:01:08.070> any

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
hosting service like GoDaddy or any

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.580 
hosting service like GoDaddy or any
other<00:01:08.939> solution<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.780> basically<00:01:10.290> sets

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
other solution that basically sets

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.679 
other solution that basically sets
everything<00:01:10.830> up<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.729> don't<00:01:12.479> need<00:01:12.630> to

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
everything up for you you don't need to

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.490 
everything up for you you don't need to
worry<00:01:12.960> either

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
worry either

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.920 
worry either
so<00:01:13.979> digitalocean<00:01:14.700> has<00:01:15.150> made<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.540> really<00:01:15.570> easy

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
so digitalocean has made it really easy

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.890 
so digitalocean has made it really easy
to<00:01:16.500> get<00:01:17.040> everything<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.729> need<00:01:18.090> installed<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
to get everything you need installed and

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.200 
to get everything you need installed and
working<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.070> includes<00:01:20.549> Apache<00:01:21.470> PHP

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
working so that includes Apache PHP

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.270 
working so that includes Apache PHP
MySQL<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.420> obviously<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.409> operating<00:01:25.920> system

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
MySQL and obviously the operating system

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.330 
MySQL and obviously the operating system
you're<00:01:26.400> running<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.060> something<00:01:27.390> like

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
you're running on to something like

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.429 
you're running on to something like
Linux<00:01:29.340> now<00:01:30.329> there<00:01:30.659> will<00:01:30.869> be<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.079> slight

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
Linux now there will be a slight

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.380 
Linux now there will be a slight
learning<00:01:32.130> curve<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.820> might<00:01:33.000> take<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
learning curve so it might take you a

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.020 
learning curve so it might take you a
little<00:01:33.479> longer<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.860> trust<00:01:35.250> me<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.610> will<00:01:35.759> save

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
little longer but trust me it will save

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.850 
little longer but trust me it will save
you<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> lot<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.750> time<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.320> future<00:01:37.500> by

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
you a lot of time in the future by

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.910 
you a lot of time in the future by
hosting<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.490> way<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.750> example<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:40.500> you

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
hosting this way so for example if you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.530 
hosting this way so for example if you
need<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.130> go<00:01:41.280> ahead<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.610> update<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:42.000> PHP

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
need to go ahead and update your PHP

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.690 
need to go ahead and update your PHP
version<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.770> jump<00:01:43.979> right<00:01:44.250> into<00:01:44.520> your

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
version you can jump right into your

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.960 
version you can jump right into your
server<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.390> update<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.930> yourself<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:47.610> can

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
server and update it yourself or you can

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.060 
server and update it yourself or you can
go<00:01:48.420> ahead<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.630> install<00:01:48.899> additional<00:01:49.470> services

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
go ahead and install additional services
