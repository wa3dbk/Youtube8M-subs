00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.440

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:22.060
 6 and number 6 this time let's see 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:24.310
 a video that left me in the middle or not 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.779
 I've seen it but I'm struck by the 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:33.160
 title is called do not attack us policemen 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:36.040
 garden gnomes good honestly no 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.450
 I know what it is about and I do not know if it's going to 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.940
 stop the crime I hope not 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.469
 you have crime but good to remember 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.850
 first of all you have the entire list 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.590
 Video reactions in the description 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.210
 in case you have not seen them and if any 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.160
 that catches the attention good because 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.600
 you know visit it 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.600
 and well let's start 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.190
 a police car 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.260
 we are not in school to see all 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.260
 The videos 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.720
 do not 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.610
 two 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.610
 I did not even have 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.909
 I always say with tomatito 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.750
 and what do you think 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.470
 and of course 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.150
 ok here we must highlight two things 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.019
 number 1 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.019
 the video 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.180
 It seems 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:34.440
 it looks pretty real or I would say that 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:38.550
 there are two options or a life this is 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.510
 false and is very well done 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:45.750
 because it really looks super realistic 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.100
 that of the gnomes then it is very well 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.320
 done and it is false 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.600
 or the video is true I have no idea 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.780
 the story of the video had told me 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.370
 in fact this video told me come 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.940
 Roxas told me it was a story of 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.800
 some police officers who report a car 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.810
 disappeared but I do not know very well not 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.450
 It has me very well then 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.160
 I also like if you liked the video 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.160
 has original life in the description 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.750
 and I remember that they are 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.479
 I do not know there is also the question for 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.970
 What do you think if it is true if it is 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.220
 false 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.560
 and well then, here 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.090
 let's hope you liked the 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.860

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.110
