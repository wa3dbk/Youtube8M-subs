set<00:00:54.870> seven<00:00:55.410> seven<00:00:55.829> seven<00:00:56.610> zero<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.360> were

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
set seven seven seven zero that we were

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.069 
set seven seven seven zero that we were
using<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.230> aqua<00:00:58.680> quanta<00:00:59.219> BOTS<00:01:00.079> because

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
using for the aqua quanta BOTS because

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.590 
using for the aqua quanta BOTS because
there's<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.350> skeleton<00:01:01.649> there<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.670> stole<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
there's a skeleton there so we stole the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.490 
there's a skeleton there so we stole the
skull<00:01:03.780> from<00:01:03.930> there<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.320> otherwise

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
skull from there but otherwise

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.969 
skull from there but otherwise
everything<00:01:04.949> else<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.580> from<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.970> skeleton<00:01:06.420> set

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
everything else is from the skeleton set

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
make each of the skeletons have unique

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.400 
make each of the skeletons have unique
bodies<00:02:33.710> so<00:02:34.130> I<00:02:34.520> took<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:35.300> parts<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:36.110> black

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410

bodies so I took the parts of a black
skeleton<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.190> mixed<00:02:37.580> them<00:02:37.700> onto<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.510> body<00:02:38.690> of

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
skeleton and mixed them onto the body of

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.610 
skeleton and mixed them onto the body of
a<00:02:38.960> white<00:02:39.110> skeleton<00:02:39.650> I<00:02:39.860> got<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.760> evil<00:02:41.120> eyes<00:02:42.020> and

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
a white skeleton I got the evil eyes and

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.330 
a white skeleton I got the evil eyes and
whatnot<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.270> uh<00:02:44.300> just<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:45.080> whip<00:02:45.340> just

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
whatnot this is uh just a whip just

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.670 
whatnot this is uh just a whip just
stick<00:02:47.300> it<00:02:47.420> through<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.750> hole<00:02:47.990> and<00:02:48.020> then<00:02:48.380> it

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
stick it through that hole and then it

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.140 
stick it through that hole and then it
becomes<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.430> little<00:02:50.390> more<00:02:50.540> menacing<00:02:50.870> as<00:02:51.380> a<00:02:52.150> like

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
becomes a little more menacing as a like

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.560 
becomes a little more menacing as a like
new<00:02:53.480> C<00:02:53.750> thing<00:02:54.020> to<00:02:54.290> catch<00:02:54.470> people<00:02:54.830> in<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:56.420> then

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
new C thing to catch people in and then

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.140 
new C thing to catch people in and then
he's<00:02:56.720> got<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.930> mace<00:02:57.200> for<00:02:57.590> Smasher<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.220> Irish

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
he's got a mace for Smasher and Irish

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.690 
he's got a mace for Smasher and Irish
marsh<00:02:59.600> marsh<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:02.080> gave<00:03:03.080> him<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.320> helmet

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
marsh marsh and gave him a helmet

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.430 
marsh marsh and gave him a helmet
because<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:04.850> went<00:03:05.000> with<00:03:05.180> his<00:03:05.390> sort<00:03:06.050> of<00:03:06.140> theme

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
because it went with his sort of theme

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.030 
because it went with his sort of theme
of<00:03:06.680> lines<00:03:07.190> I<00:03:07.670> think<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.710> matches<00:03:09.710> his<00:03:09.860> mace

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
of lines I think and matches his mace

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.370 
of lines I think and matches his mace
then<00:03:11.030> his<00:03:11.480> horse<00:03:11.990> is<00:03:12.230> stags

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
then his horse is stags

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.580 
then his horse is stags
so<00:03:15.380> it's<00:03:15.739> also<00:03:16.040> white<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:16.760> black<00:03:17.150> so<00:03:17.540> this<00:03:18.530> is

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
so it's also white and black so this is

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.020 
so it's also white and black so this is
the<00:03:19.010> sconce<00:03:19.730> piece<00:03:20.270> for<00:03:20.690> torches<00:03:21.730> put<00:03:22.730> two<00:03:22.940> of

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
the sconce piece for torches put two of

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.120 
the sconce piece for torches put two of
those<00:03:23.150> in<00:03:23.209> there<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.600> be<00:03:23.690> antlers<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.440> then

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
those in there to be antlers and then

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.130 
those in there to be antlers and then
these<00:03:25.340> are<00:03:25.400> some<00:03:25.610> one<00:03:26.180> by<00:03:26.330> three<00:03:26.630> slopes<00:03:26.989> that

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
these are some one by three slopes that

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.510 
these are some one by three slopes that
I<00:03:27.290> just<00:03:27.530> thought<00:03:27.910> you<00:03:28.910> know<00:03:28.940> helped<00:03:30.520> thicken

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
I just thought you know helped thicken

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.790 
I just thought you know helped thicken
out<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:31.790> body<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.090> little<00:03:32.180> bit<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.800> looked

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
out the body a little bit and looked

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.910 
out the body a little bit and looked
pretty<00:03:33.980> good<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.610> I<00:03:35.350> you<00:03:36.350> can<00:03:36.500> twist<00:03:36.739> them

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
pretty good and I you can twist them

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.470 
pretty good and I you can twist them
whichever<00:03:37.220> direction<00:03:37.580> you<00:03:37.610> want<00:03:37.820> but<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.120> made

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
whichever direction you want but I made

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.540 
whichever direction you want but I made
them<00:03:38.690> go<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:39.290> direction<00:03:39.440> of<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:39.890> legs<00:03:40.130> so

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
them go the direction of the legs so

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.810 
them go the direction of the legs so
it's<00:03:41.239> like<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.510> part<00:03:41.720> of<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:41.840> legs<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:43.790> that

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
it's like the part of the legs so that

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.630 
it's like the part of the legs so that
is<00:03:44.270> Simon<00:03:45.080> and<00:03:45.200> stags<00:03:45.709> and<00:03:47.410> then<00:03:48.410> over<00:03:49.160> here<00:03:49.190> is

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
is Simon and stags and then over here is

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.820 
is Simon and stags and then over here is
