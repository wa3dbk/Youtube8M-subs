00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:03.070
 in the year we are now sitting 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.350
 we talk something we do year case 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.350
 insanity for example here in this room 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:11.989
 supply this race 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:14.029
 so that here does not happen at the end 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:16.589
 We brought some others to the treatment. 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:18.239
 how are we going to reshuffle yesterday 

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:20.169
 did today do 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:22.070
 tarko fat so sphere 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.160
 by chance in the final most likely 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.010
 of what happens here so 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.789
 happens 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.939
 space and airports 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.779
 not lost anywhere 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.700
 and nothing happens 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.580
 she is filled man not 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.130
 Yushchenko is filling 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.320
 something I have something in it 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.370
 disappears 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.370
 what about you? 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.230
 he did not cease to perceive 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.550
 we do not notice the presence here as 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.780
 that we do not notice that we sit 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.370
 on this space and surround us here with 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.750
 you years of space 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.480
 here is the result 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.020
 i can't do anything 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.220
 only such tragedy balls leave everything 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.600
 it was without attention to know 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.050
 and this is an association talk 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.900
 but 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.110
 say so not a word March 10 fall 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.750
 that is, the vision is lost 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.320
 in this way 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.890
 because people play guides guards and 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.670
 crafts 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.530
 Sundays and do you have any practice 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.030
 so that people are not disclosed 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.750
 it is not necessary to develop its own 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.090
 because 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.409
 and what is the same thing that the struggle for closed 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.490
 the more you have such a card she wants 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.860
 turn a blind eye 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.630
 on the turn I open my eyes to Slovaks like him 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.370
 I'm already his character 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.130
 so after he is 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.990
 phase has passed the election dates do not open 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.079
 at the end of which opens and here I am 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.000
 she asked in the textbook on ii 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.120
 I remember the agent 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.120
 and this is exactly that law again, no 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.610
 know they help corporations election 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.570
 as well as deputies 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.080
 Ryazanov 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.420
 So 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.189
 what is that out? 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.510
 just a moment of throwing and ending around 320 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.570
 to tension in the province today when 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.199
 came first check 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:20.229
 such 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:22.339
 starting c regions 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.669
 Astana 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.989
 ended the euro dollar with the cast and 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.519
 still a bunch of all sorts of rules to 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.599
 population no we were looking for laying at 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.459
 dinars 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.139
 dimensions back or did not even think 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:37.469
 do it 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.899
 so in one of the rampant elements 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.649
 then we deny sergiy 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:45.379
 she does not notice her eyes brown eyes to 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.549
 break the commodity 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:48.500
 and man 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.659
 all our gates and not ours and yet 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.639
 the soldiers turn 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.550
 desire glass bell 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.920
 in the opinion of Valentina Muranova apparently not 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.879
 may not please her today 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.729
 what can't you do to open 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:05.909
 Nothing goes ahead 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:06.780
 see 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.939
 what's closed for you 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.339
 i.e. desire 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:12.349
 and cherish 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:13.449
 Tuareg 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:16.449
 then there was not there 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:20.309
 and your attention is all 2 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:22.179
 saw thou 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:23.499
 your attention 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:25.629
 we have to delay it 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.769
 that project does not solve the hryvnia 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.019
 video files for new is 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.019
 totally over the server 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.349
 because they only see what they see 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.859
 he is 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.349
 only here regardless of class 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.349
 only she is no longer dependent on the ears 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.430
 apparently feeling independent of everyone 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.019
 other senses 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.229
 how do you feel all 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:55.219
 regardless of the scope arising 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:58.219
 styles of sensations 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.599
 for this he needs in the region very yakbi 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.609
 years in perception because one 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.050
 fill your senses yourself 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.979
 and therefore who do they 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:14.949
 are such they may perceive 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.949
 feel a little better 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.120
 visitors 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.189
 in Siberia 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:25.229
 presence 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.830
 resident population 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.210
 permanent presence 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.699
 observations 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:30.889
 presence 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.379
 permanent 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:35.709
 and on how source perception 

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:38.679
 the source of all things that makes it easy 

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:40.669
 by itself 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.270
 Vasiliy 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.199
 we are all watching to be present 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.900
 in all 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.669
 absent at the same time as 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:48.639
 something 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.690
 are present as well as he and simultaneously 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.689
 missing as less 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:03.069
 feel this consistency queue 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.149
 feel his presence in general
