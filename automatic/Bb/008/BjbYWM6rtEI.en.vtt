 automatically in the fight with you 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.590
 the latter although he is not a player 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.600
 counts as if it were a more invocation 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.610
 that you control him 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.299
 he is not a vocation that stays like that 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.759

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.060
 Prospecting them adds to your then 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.240
 you count as if they had access to 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.210
 more because of my team 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:49.350
 They are also very strong but not very strong. 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.299

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:48.640
 which is acrid styles there is a good example 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.890
 You can see the dunga is very reasonable. 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.720
 not giving bad and settled with pm a 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.380
 alleged shadow of magic here for you 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.390
 I'm playing at night and I'm done with 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:11.020
 this ideal is also the 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.020
 here fool in the fight 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:27.620

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:31.790
 night revenge deals damage to area 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.790
 may vary in effect 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.680
 if this diabolical increase of the spell 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.410
 son and back at 12 per turn 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.300
 applying the 20% permanent damage and if 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.080
 would achieve the existence of the 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:49.920
 very good opponent too 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.090
 the summoned black snake strip 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.310
 resistance increasing night revenge 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:05:03.900
 cartilage you go out to get close 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:05.250
 to the opponent more here cartilage advances 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.110
 6 cells 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.790
 You come close to the others here . 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:15.150
 damage to clothes two pms here one 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:20.880
 great magic that has decreased giving 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:26.150
 apparent and increases their magic boot in 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.150
 areas far away once more 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.800
 Can you see the team is going to help? 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.100
 and so much for many people 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.480
 I hope it's not that expensive 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.060
 I also hope that the price of large 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.010
 dams in the experience 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.960
 remember one thing to blame the 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.780
 create a state so expensive so it is not the 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.630
 but they are players who put 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.030
 this price and are players who buy 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.490
 this price after all it is 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.950
 in this prey because there are people who buy 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.120
 so if you want the low price 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.510
 does not comply 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.820
 Expect to put premium on the cell phone part 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.410
 of money for the ticket but it has to 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.730
 understand that every game is paid today in 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.220
 day practically 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.780
 these games that you buy cash there are 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.900
 games that you buy from your team 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:25.150
 character like league of legends the dof 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.640
 also a game but even being paid 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.470
 paid game in a very cheap game with 12 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.780
 you put a premium medium 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:38.380
 so I think it 's an affordable amount 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:42.070
 for most people is not finish 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:45.780
 here it was just I wanted to show you 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.780

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:52.250
 the pack 1 pearl of wild moel then is 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.319

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:06.470
 teaching how it arrives at John's door. 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.599
 shadow that the latter was using 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.090
 today will be a new boss to implement a 

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:14.500
 I play a question for the character 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:17.300
 Level 190 Up 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:22.370
 so I took a labyrinth in there that 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:25.990
 I'll teach you to walk there soon. 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.990
 then even more a hug
