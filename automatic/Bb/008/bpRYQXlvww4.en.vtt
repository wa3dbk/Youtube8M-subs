00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
like integrated that into your your

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.500 
like integrated that into your your
complete<00:02:17.860> player<00:02:18.340> definitely<00:02:19.030> confidence

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
complete player definitely confidence

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.000 
complete player definitely confidence
you've<00:02:20.080> always<00:02:20.260> been<00:02:20.350> a<00:02:20.440> confident<00:02:20.860> player

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
you've always been a confident player

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.229 
you've always been a confident player
but<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.310> know<00:02:21.519> as<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:21.760> play<00:02:21.910> on<00:02:22.030> team

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
but you know as you play on team

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.479 
but you know as you play on team
definitely<00:02:22.570> become<00:02:23.049> more<00:02:23.260> confident<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.890> think

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.090 
you learned what was what it meant to be
part<00:02:26.709> of<00:02:26.799> a<00:02:26.890> vision<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:28.810> think<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.739> became

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
part of a vision and I think that became

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.550
