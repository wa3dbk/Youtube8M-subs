stay<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.359> shape<00:00:30.660> because<00:00:30.869> we<00:00:31.320> got<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.529> PC<00:00:31.740> I'm

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
stay in shape because we got the PC I'm

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.470 
stay in shape because we got the PC I'm
coming<00:00:32.160> up<00:00:32.309> we<00:00:32.550> really<00:00:32.759> want<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.969> win<00:00:33.090> that
