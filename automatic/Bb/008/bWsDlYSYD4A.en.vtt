got another iphone 4s you know you're
probably<00:00:38.070> thinking<00:00:38.250> well<00:00:38.610> why<00:00:38.820> would<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.059> do

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180

that<00:00:39.210> well<00:00:39.570> here's<00:00:40.170> why<00:00:40.379> because<00:00:40.879> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
that well here's why because the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.700 
that well here's why because the
downside<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.600> factory<00:00:43.020> unlocked<00:00:43.320> iphone

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
downside of the factory unlocked iphone

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.910 
downside of the factory unlocked iphone
4s<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:45.030> can<00:00:45.210> only<00:00:45.390> use<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.050> gsm

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
4s is that you can only use it on gsm

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.100 
4s is that you can only use it on gsm
networks<00:00:47.340> because<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.910> CDMA<00:00:48.420> radios<00:00:48.809> are

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
networks because the CDMA radios are

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.040 
networks because the CDMA radios are
disabled<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.800> there's<00:00:50.460> no<00:00:50.910> way<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.149> enable

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
disabled and there's no way to enable

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.220 
disabled and there's no way to enable
them<00:00:52.230> at<00:00:52.410> all<00:00:52.949> which<00:00:53.730> sucks<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.360> order<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
them at all which sucks so in order to

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.860 
them at all which sucks so in order to
be<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> cdma<00:00:59.969> network<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.780> buy

here's the thing though if I have a 16

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.550 
here's the thing though if I have a 16
gigabyte<00:04:12.329> device<00:04:13.049> I<00:04:13.849> can<00:04:14.849> just<00:04:15.449> stream<00:04:16.229> the

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
gigabyte device I can just stream the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.259 
gigabyte device I can just stream the

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
now i could just you could have just

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.920 
now i could just you could have just
done<00:04:23.279> that<00:04:23.310> from<00:04:23.550> my<00:04:23.700> t-mobile<00:04:24.300> iphone<00:04:24.779> the

prob

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
prob

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.370 
prob
is<00:04:25.520> though<00:04:25.820> that<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:26.060> connection<00:04:26.419> is<00:04:26.509> so<00:04:26.930> darn

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
is though that the connection is so darn

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.439 
is though that the connection is so darn
slower<00:04:27.889> am<00:04:28.370> 2g<00:04:30.310> it<00:04:31.310> wasn't<00:04:31.940> even<00:04:32.000> good<00:04:32.210> at<00:04:32.240> that

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
slower am 2g it wasn't even good at that

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.580 
slower am 2g it wasn't even good at that
so<00:04:34.270> I'll<00:04:35.270> be<00:04:35.479> able<00:04:35.539> to<00:04:35.660> do<00:04:35.780> that<00:04:35.900> now<00:04:36.110> since<00:04:36.500> i

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
so I'll be able to do that now since i

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.230 
so I'll be able to do that now since i
will<00:04:36.830> have<00:04:36.919> the<00:04:36.949> 3g<00:04:37.430> connection<00:04:37.820> because<00:04:38.120> my

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
will have the 3g connection because my

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.779 
will have the 3g connection because my
mom<00:04:38.449> has<00:04:38.660> is<00:04:39.289> actually<00:04:39.889> has<00:04:40.039> the<00:04:40.070> sprint

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
iphone it has the 3g connection and it's

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.969 
iphone it has the 3g connection and it's
good<00:04:44.630> at<00:04:44.750> streaming<00:04:45.080> iTunes<00:04:45.380> Match<00:04:45.590> you<00:04:45.919> know

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
good at streaming iTunes Match you know

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.710 
good at streaming iTunes Match you know
and<00:04:46.100> she<00:04:46.220> has<00:04:46.310> unlimited<00:04:46.669> data<00:04:46.789> so<00:04:47.180> she<00:04:47.690> just

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
and she has unlimited data so she just

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.629 
and she has unlimited data so she just
doesn't<00:04:48.110> blow<00:04:48.440> the<00:04:48.620> music<00:04:48.889> on<00:04:49.009> her<00:04:49.100> phone<00:04:49.340> she

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
doesn't blow the music on her phone she

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.189 
doesn't blow the music on her phone she
just<00:04:49.820> runs<00:04:50.300> it<00:04:50.419> through<00:04:50.449> itunes<00:04:50.630> match<00:04:50.960> and

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
just runs it through itunes match and

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.340 
just runs it through itunes match and
streams<00:04:51.530> everything<00:04:52.240> and<00:04:53.240> so<00:04:53.930> i<00:04:53.960> think<00:04:54.110> i'm

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
streams everything and so i think i'm

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.779 
streams everything and so i think i'm
going<00:04:54.440> to<00:04:54.500> do<00:04:54.590> the<00:04:54.680> same<00:04:54.860> thing<00:04:55.070> since<00:04:55.699> the

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
going to do the same thing since the

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.430 
going to do the same thing since the
data<00:04:56.090> will<00:04:56.270> be<00:04:56.330> unlimited<00:04:56.630> it's<00:04:57.050> not<00:04:57.199> going<00:04:57.350> to

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
data will be unlimited it's not going to

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.469 
data will be unlimited it's not going to
matter<00:04:57.560> how<00:04:57.889> much<00:04:58.099> i<00:04:58.220> stream<00:04:58.580> or<00:04:58.849> how<00:04:59.000> often<00:04:59.240> I

mobile uses sprint sprint coverage is a

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.740 
mobile uses sprint sprint coverage is a
lot<00:05:09.949> better<00:05:10.220> than<00:05:10.550> t-mobile<00:05:10.759> so<00:05:11.150> you<00:05:11.210> have<00:05:11.720> a

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
lot better than t-mobile so you have a

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.600 
lot better than t-mobile so you have a
lot<00:05:12.050> more<00:05:12.229> 3g<00:05:12.650> than<00:05:12.830> t-mobile<00:05:13.009> does<00:05:13.400> and

everything so you know I figured you

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.700 
everything so you know I figured you
know<00:05:16.190> what<00:05:16.430> why<00:05:16.610> not<00:05:16.639> just<00:05:16.940> make<00:05:17.060> a<00:05:17.120> switch

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
know what why not just make a switch

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.320 
know what why not just make a switch
it's<00:05:18.710> the<00:05:18.830> same<00:05:19.009> 11<00:05:19.340> in<00:05:19.460> paying<00:05:19.669> now<00:05:19.789> more

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
often so when I did get it was fast

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.960 
often so when I did get it was fast
don't<00:05:42.470> get<00:05:42.620> me<00:05:42.740> wrong<00:05:42.949> I<00:05:43.780> you<00:05:44.780> know<00:05:44.810> I<00:05:45.169> just

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
don't get me wrong I you know I just

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.159 
don't get me wrong I you know I just
it's<00:05:46.970> not<00:05:47.150> gonna<00:05:47.330> bother<00:05:47.449> me<00:05:47.720> since<00:05:47.900> I<00:05:47.990> didn't

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
it's not gonna bother me since I didn't

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.080 
it's not gonna bother me since I didn't
get<00:05:48.260> it<00:05:48.380> that<00:05:48.470> much<00:05:48.620> anyway<00:05:48.860> and<00:05:49.520> I<00:05:49.729> still<00:05:50.000> I'd

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
get it that much anyway and I still I'd

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.210 
get it that much anyway and I still I'd
be<00:05:50.210> careful<00:05:50.479> because<00:05:51.220> technically

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
be careful because technically

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.430 
be careful because technically
high-speed<00:05:52.909> data<00:05:53.150> is<00:05:53.479> for<00:05:53.900> all<00:05:54.020> intents<00:05:54.050> and

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
high-speed data is for all intents and

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.550 
high-speed data is for all intents and
purposes<00:05:54.949> a<00:05:55.009> data<00:05:55.280> cap<00:05:55.550> it's<00:05:56.289> technically<00:05:57.289> the

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
purposes a data cap it's technically the

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.370 
purposes a data cap it's technically the
same<00:05:57.770> thing<00:05:58.070> because<00:05:59.199> they<00:06:00.199> actually

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
same thing because they actually

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.620 
same thing because they actually
throttle<00:06:01.009> you<00:06:01.039> to<00:06:01.310> lower<00:06:01.669> than<00:06:01.970> 2g<00:06:02.360> so<00:06:02.509> it's

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
throttle you to lower than 2g so it's

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.839 
throttle you to lower than 2g so it's
actually<00:06:02.780> faster<00:06:03.289> just<00:06:03.740> to<00:06:03.830> disable<00:06:04.460> for<00:06:04.669> jail

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
actually faster just to disable for jail

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:06.339 
actually faster just to disable for jail
together<00:06:05.060> and<00:06:05.300> use<00:06:05.389> to<00:06:05.599> G<00:06:05.780> when<00:06:05.930> they<00:06:06.020> throttle

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:06.349 
together and use to G when they throttle

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:07.480 
together and use to G when they throttle
you<00:06:06.380> I've<00:06:06.560> never<00:06:06.710> been<00:06:06.889> throttled<00:06:07.159> but<00:06:07.370> that's

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
you I've never been throttled but that's

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.570
