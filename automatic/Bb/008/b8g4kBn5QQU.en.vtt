all<00:03:38.110> right<00:03:39.690> now<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:40.750> you<00:03:41.260> can<00:03:41.440> probably<00:03:41.680> figure

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
all right now I you can probably figure

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.330 
all right now I you can probably figure
out<00:03:42.310> how<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:42.610> is<00:03:42.670> going<00:03:42.910> to<00:03:43.060> work<00:03:43.270> I<00:03:44.340> think

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
out how this is going to work I think

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.560 
out how this is going to work I think
you<00:03:45.489> close<00:03:45.850> these<00:03:46.120> lids<00:03:46.420> blitz<00:03:47.140> there<00:03:47.410> so<00:03:47.650> no

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
you close these lids blitz there so no

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.720 
you close these lids blitz there so no
no<00:03:49.570> alien<00:03:49.989> guts<00:03:50.530> go<00:03:50.800> spewing<00:03:51.250> all<00:03:51.430> over<00:03:51.640> the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
no alien guts go spewing all over the

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.510 
no alien guts go spewing all over the
place<00:03:51.910> on<00:03:52.120> to<00:03:52.300> you<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:55.030> we<00:03:55.690> close<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:56.890> like

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
place on to you and we close it like

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:05.800 
place on to you and we close it like
that<00:03:58.230> making<00:03:59.230> up<00:04:03.870> sounds

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
that making up sounds

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:14.800 
that making up sounds
and<00:04:06.680> we<00:04:09.700> what<00:04:10.700> hell<00:04:10.880> does<00:04:11.060> is<00:04:11.180> work<00:04:13.569> this<00:04:14.569> show

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
and we what hell does is work this show

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.030 
and we what hell does is work this show
would<00:04:14.959> not<00:04:14.990> be<00:04:15.140> entertaining<00:04:15.709> if<00:04:15.800> I<00:04:15.890> actually
