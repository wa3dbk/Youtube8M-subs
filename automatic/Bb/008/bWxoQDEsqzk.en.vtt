00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.849
 we put in the last row if 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.980
 normally press a command key and 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.470
 we continued to price towards the right we 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.420
 we put in the last column if 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.699
 we press the command key and arrow 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.340

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.560
 first last column and if we press 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.560
 command and arrow that on the left the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.390
 we put in the first column well 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.840
 can see the large size that has a 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.840
 spreadsheet 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.790
 yes yes let's say my new excel and we 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.790
 let's go to preferences 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.820
 we'll see that in the general tab in the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.790
 general option that we find here 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.340
 you can see an action that puts number of 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.180
 new book sheets if I put here 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.350
 for example that they are 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.180
 three sheets and I say accept 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.309
 from now on when I open new 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.309
 book that this will contain three sheets 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.870
 aided the control key let's do 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.910
 one click to sheet number 1 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.070
 we are going to create a menu where we are going to 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.960
 allow insert a sheet 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.990
 This is how we can add leaves 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.610
 or books can also be done 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.610
 automatically with the + sign 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.700
 if we also do collateral control 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.630
 click on sheet number 2 we can also 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.759
 remove 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.100
 in this case we're going to eliminate the 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.049
 you accept 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.479
 if we place we keep tight the 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.400
 button and we move we can go back 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.350
 the position of the leaf 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.290
 and finally what we are going to do is a 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.159
 control key on sheet number 1 you 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.950
 we give the option to rename 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.020
 change the name and we put for example 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.240
 here January 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.210
 intro in this way we can go 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.859
 changing organizing and deleting leaves 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.859
