00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.430
 this sky blue two-story palace in 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.240
 classic style crowned 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.580
 Petersburg 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.920
 could have remained undone his story 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.780
 the decor is full of dramatic details 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.579
 and it all started with the fact that long before 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.189
 installation kit was purchased 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:22.679
 decorative elements of polyurethane 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.589
 installation began in June on all windows 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:27.569
 installers secured the arch we did not 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.179
 could achieve polyurethane 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:32.189
 the element stopped moving linearly then 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.980
 It has to expand and contract this is now 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.829
 slope plastered already 5 times probably and 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.280
 anyway he bursts 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.590
 Classic style does not tolerate 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.840
 The compromises marked on the decor are not 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.179
 could be out of the question in the meantime waited 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.250
 their turn the remaining part of the facade 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:48.899
 elements on it was already clear that 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.749
 no further installation possible 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.129
 some new solution was required 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:55.440
 alexart shackles offered acts 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.899
 radically discard polyurethane and 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.909
 try in the work of technology products 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.390
 fabrication which struck him on 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.560
 one of the exhibitions came with a project 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.500
 here are individual products 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.660
 in addition to the standard had to do 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.790
 various forms of facade elements from 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.280
 Styrofoam cuts titanium thread 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.470
 but without special protection the decor is fragile 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.030
 innovation is putty 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.520
 which came up in Turkey 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.010
 putty evenly covers products 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.590
 making it invulnerable to the weather and 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.540
 ultraviolet complexity of this order 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.570
 was that the shape of the products 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.210
 non-standard for quality coverage 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.610
 required to make the matrix 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.830
 matrix is ​​a form by which 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.940
 putty is applied with this 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:45.110
 matrix is respected the thickness is equal and on 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.180
 all cover the size of the product 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.590
 Decors may be different restrictions 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.570
 no large format 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.970
 or make parts that on 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.380
 site joins each other in 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.729
 the shortest time just done 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.070
 the required number of decorative 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.080
 The elements of this foam are grit 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.820
 it was originally bigger however 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.670
 item ready for painting 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.710
 above, do not do anything with it oleg 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.440
 worked with different types of décor in 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.570
 including plaster and gypsum these materials 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.700
 require laborious and careful work 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.670
 the final product is too big 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.590
 weight is something that under these elements and 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.260
 under the painted facade there is a layer 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.180
 insulation of the order of 150 millimeters if 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.860
 on this warmth hang heavy plaster 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.300
 accordingly there will be a load on the facade 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.250
 properly made 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.819
 created mounted gibson too 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.280
 worth centuries but nonetheless it is heavier 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.080
 it is longer harder to make 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.579
 mounted 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.530
 especially hard plaster falls on 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.150
 watered areas with elevated 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.459
 moisture gypsum elements not 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.250
 maintain its own weight whereas 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.870
 protected by acrylic filler 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.970
 styrofoam virtually no weight in 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.560
 unlike polyurethane polystyrene foam 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.790
 more plastic it allows you to do 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.890
 difficult specs 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.980
 and do not limit architectural intent 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.690
 here the butt made figure could 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.610
 just cut off this element like this 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.120
 here in this place he would be straight 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.950
 torez 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.590
 but these elements make it very clear 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.360
 work with angles ie we are any 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.950
 a turn here can do this 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.510
 figure element respectively here 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.000
 we decided to make it at 45 degrees 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.430
 as a tribal designer 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.500
 any worthy product has fakes 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.960
 cheap substandard after stories with 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.790
 set of expensive polyurethane order 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.910
 A new product was made only on 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.070
 based on price it was the lowest but 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.890
 when the installers took them 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.810
 it is simply there was outrage 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.020
 limits here these lines were all 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.480
 so the curves went away like this 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.160
 court this court that is violated was 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.660
 geometry is just very tough and 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.900
 decorative coating was pressed through 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.760
 a finger, that is, fingers made here such 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.709
 turnout but quietly flew away from 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.430
 of these elements but very ugly 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.950
 qualities and we had to return all 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.510
 party when a construction company carries 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.820
 warranty obligations for 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.800
 installers it is important that the quality of all 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.540
 the elements were high in the garden 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.360
 one season is enough 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.250
 all the flaws appeared today decor from 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.090
 Styrofoam helped not to break deadlines 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.430
 montage 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.390
 the final assessment builders will put 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.700
 next spring 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:17.100
 however , polystyrene has every chance 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.100
 that the exam will be given perfectly
