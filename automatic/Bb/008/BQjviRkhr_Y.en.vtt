so the charging system charging system
is<00:01:01.960> a<00:01:02.020> really<00:01:02.290> cool<00:01:02.469> system<00:01:02.710> I<00:01:03.010> normally<00:01:03.340> don't

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
is a really cool system I normally don't

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.129 
is a really cool system I normally don't
like<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:03.790> proprietary<00:01:04.420> ones<00:01:04.659> but<00:01:04.989> I<00:01:05.019> actually

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:05.139 
like the proprietary ones but I actually

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:07.080 
like the proprietary ones but I actually
like<00:01:05.469> this<00:01:05.619> one<00:01:05.859> it's<00:01:06.249> a<00:01:06.310> little<00:01:06.399> magnetic<00:01:06.789> guy

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
like this one it's a little magnetic guy

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.959 
like this one it's a little magnetic guy
snaps<00:01:07.929> right<00:01:08.170> on<00:01:08.380> there<00:01:08.619> glows<00:01:09.219> red<00:01:09.369> when<00:01:09.549> it's

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969 
snaps right on there glows red when it's

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.609 
snaps right on there glows red when it's
charging<00:01:10.270> glows<00:01:10.659> green<00:01:10.689> when<00:01:11.289> it's<00:01:11.469> done

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
charging glows green when it's done

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.859 
charging glows green when it's done
charging<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.340> it's<00:01:12.670> just<00:01:12.850> usb<00:01:13.329> on<00:01:13.359> the<00:01:13.689> other

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
charging and it's just usb on the other

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.959 
charging and it's just usb on the other
end<00:01:14.109> so<00:01:14.590> it<00:01:14.649> works<00:01:14.829> really<00:01:15.039> well<00:01:15.159> really<00:01:15.700> easy

end so it works really well really easy

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:17.819 
end so it works really well really easy
to<00:01:16.209> use<00:01:16.450> you<00:01:16.779> see<00:01:16.990> how<00:01:17.049> easy<00:01:17.289> it<00:01:17.469> is<00:01:17.560> to<00:01:17.709> attach

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
to use you see how easy it is to attach

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.249 
to use you see how easy it is to attach
no<00:01:18.789> rubber<00:01:19.090> port<00:01:19.569> or<00:01:19.719> anything<00:01:19.929> like<00:01:20.200> that

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
no rubber port or anything like that

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.469 
no rubber port or anything like that
