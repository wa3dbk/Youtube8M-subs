00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.519
 hey man dating wax from hit to 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.920
 luck comes to this little tutorial 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.509
 in cinema 4d how to frame such 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.150
 the text I've always created shortly 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.580
 for example, now shows right 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.449
 easy to do and then I'll start 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.119
 directly to 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.300
 So what you need I have now 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.849
 just my texts it pretty easy 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.439
 clicking here he lets on it so times 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.420
 and pressed a bit longer 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.739
 then you click on the street maps then 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.690
 you click then just think 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.110
 a bit longer and then pick you up 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.840
 two rectangles the citation in the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.789
 Suite maps in and then we put that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.079
 upper first on 20 at one to the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.840
 to be able to adjust everything a bit 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:57.510
 You can do that now 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:02.070
 I do it 100 times, we say 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:06.150
 120 times wide and now from the beginning 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.460
 Let's see how strong his or how 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:15.350
 Great, I'm like this 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.740
 please, I say there pronet 20 is to be 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.790
 oh well 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:26.340
 we let 120 so now has the need 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:31.380
 we moved the whole center okay 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.790
 We're a bit backwards like that 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.759
 that's about the text 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.130
 matches and then we click that 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.780
 second right, the whole is now 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.159
 only for how long and looks 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.740
 height 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.859
 so that can be adjusted now 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.770
 you're with me all the way 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.939
 it fits in with one can be quiet 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.030
 make it even wider 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.159
 and yes what you have to do with it now 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.679
 is the whole thing forming one clicks on 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.130
 The street maps at the end of growth 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.299
 that is currently set to 100 on 0 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.799
 pressed control and clicks 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.099
 this little circle is next to here 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.799
 to make keyframe I open it now 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.959
 30 and then set the whole to 100 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.510
 and makes it flow like that again 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.340
 control and click inflow kreml 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:25.799
 kreistage RÃ¶mer then quite the whole 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:28.079
 Things are forming like that now 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.760
 he still asked that the whole thing 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.879
 Things are turning now, for example 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:37.319
 you can do that now so it's on 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:41.430
 start then if 230 is that is here 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:47.879
 at 0 key frame and then rotates the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:50.780
 at 100 to 160 once again so 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.780
 whole looks like this now 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.940
 quite simple 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.650
 You can now go back to the 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.319
 click street maps and grow 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.730
 start once you make a key frame 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:06.030
 before zero, then you go 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.530
 portraits and makes us 100 and 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.690
 you can put back in gear can me 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.130
 now already a couple of times yes and 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.130
 then the room disappears again 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.900
 that was it from this one 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.310
 tutorial more is not there to show you 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.080
 can now access the suite for 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.069
 For example, a texture pack here for 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.790
 example gold material looks the whole 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:29.580
 actually pretty nice too 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.200
 and yes , that's pretty easy 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.630
 explained and quite easy to copy 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.430
 I hope you liked it if so 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.930
 just let it be easier than 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.580
 any further suggestions 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.350
 I would like to have tutorials 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.209
 I have the suggestion of the couple 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.670
 getting to be more and I thought before 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.810
 the panels do you do that okay again 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.180
 I hope you all have it now 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.530
 further helped to be up to the 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.530
 Next time and out there people
