00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.370 

I<00:00:10.790> remember<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.969> first<00:00:12.150> time<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.719> saw<00:00:13.049> that

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
I remember the first time I saw that

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.810 
I remember the first time I saw that
NASA<00:00:14.340> picture<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.150> Earth<00:00:16.430> taken<00:00:17.430> over<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
NASA picture of Earth taken over the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.290 
NASA picture of Earth taken over the
moon

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.310 

that<00:00:20.900> picture<00:00:22.210> somehow<00:00:23.210> had<00:00:23.509> the<00:00:23.660> capacity<00:00:23.810> to

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
that picture somehow had the capacity to

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.349 
that picture somehow had the capacity to
just<00:00:24.740> wrench<00:00:25.279> your<00:00:25.460> mind<00:00:25.699> around<00:00:26.060> so<00:00:26.300> you

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
just wrench your mind around so you

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.659 
just wrench your mind around so you
thought<00:00:26.660> about<00:00:26.840> things<00:00:27.019> in<00:00:27.199> a<00:00:27.259> different<00:00:27.289> way

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
thought about things in a different way

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.139 
thought about things in a different way
our<00:00:28.669> curves<00:00:29.090> did<00:00:29.300> that<00:00:29.480> for<00:00:29.779> a<00:00:29.810> lot<00:00:29.930> of<00:00:29.960> people

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:31.149 
our curves did that for a lot of people

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.210 
our curves did that for a lot of people
for<00:00:32.149> the<00:00:32.239> first<00:00:32.509> time<00:00:32.780> they<00:00:33.140> could<00:00:33.559> start<00:00:34.070> to

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
for the first time they could start to

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.889 
for the first time they could start to
see<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:34.519> future<00:00:34.730> consequences<00:00:35.210> of<00:00:35.660> what<00:00:35.780> they

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
see the future consequences of what they

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:37.810 
see the future consequences of what they
were<00:00:35.960> doing<00:00:36.290> now<00:00:36.470> and<00:00:36.769> for<00:00:37.309> many<00:00:37.430> people<00:00:37.519> that

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
were doing now and for many people that

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.370 
were doing now and for many people that
was<00:00:37.970> really<00:00:38.210> shocking

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.570 

I<00:00:41.730> went<00:00:42.730> to<00:00:43.090> the<00:00:43.240> first<00:00:43.650> presentation<00:00:44.650> I

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
I went to the first presentation I

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.610 
I went to the first presentation I
thought<00:00:46.240> it<00:00:46.450> was<00:00:46.630> polling<00:00:47.640> powerful<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
thought it was polling powerful the

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.680 
thought it was polling powerful the
thesis<00:00:51.220> that<00:00:52.030> growth<00:00:52.660> had<00:00:53.230> to<00:00:53.470> be<00:00:53.620> limited<00:00:54.190> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
thesis that growth had to be limited to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.300 
thesis that growth had to be limited to
preserve<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:56.260> quality<00:00:56.560> of<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.190> environment

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
preserve the quality of the environment

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.100 
preserve the quality of the environment
the<00:00:58.210> quality<00:00:58.780> of<00:00:58.930> life<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.760> this<00:01:01.150> is<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.750> thing

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
the quality of life so this is the thing

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.720 
the quality of life so this is the thing
that<00:01:02.560> I<00:01:02.980> still<00:01:03.400> agree<00:01:03.790> with<00:01:03.880> today<00:01:05.400> there<00:01:06.400> are

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
that I still agree with today there are

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.490 
that I still agree with today there are
limits<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:07.479> growth<00:01:07.630> when<00:01:08.050> we're<00:01:08.200> bumping

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
limits to growth when we're bumping

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:22.430 
limits to growth when we're bumping
against<00:01:09.100> them<00:01:09.430> right<00:01:09.940> now

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.960
