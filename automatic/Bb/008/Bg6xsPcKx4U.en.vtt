00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:08.250
 hi how are you I bring you a new 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.170
 video and it's about what there is and how 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.789
 microsoft organized after I made 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.169
 the last video is we created the 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.150
 spring I said why not make a 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.280
 spring organization so I'm going to 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.110
 start with this part so this is how this 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.920
 of my closet love and if you want to see how 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.720
 is staying and some tips continue with me 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.670
 the first type that I give them is that they go 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.350
 taking out all the classes but one section 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.610
 at the same time because if they take out all the cream that 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.770
 it will give you a can and they will not continue 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.230
 ordering and what they do not need to vote what 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.760
 in the trash and organize my shoes and 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.559
 I did it by colors I think it's a lot 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.629
 I'm easier to find a person 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.100
 who loves shoes I do not know about you 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.260
 I have to revise it in some way 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.950
 but I like them more just a little more 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.960
 I keep them expensive in their homes 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.520
 now we go for the portfolios for that 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.290
 I'm going to use this basket that I bought 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.970
 in almost from time to time but they sell it 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.590
 in several parts and I'm going to put the 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.180
 smaller wallets the handles tablets 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.100
 check the before you put them because 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.960
 he still does not leave things there sometimes 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.610
 can find up silver and 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.430
 worry about leaving the most used 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.290
 up with tibet is that if they have 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.610
 more formed or harder portfolios of 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.380
 if you leave them separately because 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.920
 probably if they crush them they will lose 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.810
 the way and they will look pretty 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.460
 Another way to make your little things is 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.720
 buy these transparent boxes at 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.880
 that you can put the name with 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.649
 down and used in this case the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.360
 first I put things related to the 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.759
 make up so you want the mercat of 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.070
 name and the other I put my product like this 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.049
 as art because you know that a 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.000
 sometimes one will get attacked artistic and 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.580
 he does not know where things are so 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.230
 so it's much easier to find them and you 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.330
 sees much more ordered in the process 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.890
 on the other side of the closet use the 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.710
 top part to leave some shoes 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.750
 that are not so much my heels and down 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.430
 always messes up and the truth that 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.710
 this piece of furniture did not have a pedestal but 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.600
 As I can not leave out the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.070
 I'm using inside the closet I put 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.250
 the house of gender with things that do not 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.440
 I want to have the piece stretched and more 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.000
 this part is a little bit more complicated 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.860
 organize but a tip that I'm going to give 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.330
 is that they buy specific hangers 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.220
 for the garments in this case I'm 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.450
 showing those of skirt but there are for 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.940
 jackets for trousers for 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.090
 belts and I organize my clothes according to 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.580
 type for example hours remembering the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.890
 polerones the vests the separo blouses 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.350
 the light blouses of the dark the 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.060
 demand short front long sleeve and 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.530
 Well there are different ways of organizing 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.330
 I think it's like one gets more 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.610
 easy 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.380
 and that was for today's video I hope 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.760
 all heart that you have liked is 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.320
 short but I'm learning to 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.840
 use a new editor so 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.310
 soon there will be many surprises that 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.510
 have a nice day and see you the 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.510
 Friday our videos bye
