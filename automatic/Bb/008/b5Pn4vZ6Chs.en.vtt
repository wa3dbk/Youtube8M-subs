00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
we do is preparing the dough's as an old

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.830 
we do is preparing the dough's as an old
mixer<00:00:22.029> what<00:00:22.869> do<00:00:23.290> does<00:00:23.590> a<00:00:24.060> gentle<00:00:25.060> mixing<00:00:25.599> the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
mixer what do does a gentle mixing the

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.710 
mixer what do does a gentle mixing the
slow-moving<00:00:26.680> machine<00:00:27.279> that<00:00:28.000> that's<00:00:28.360> all<00:00:28.570> we

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
slow-moving machine that that's all we

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.260 
slow-moving machine that that's all we
have<00:00:28.930> the<00:00:29.140> rest<00:00:29.320> is<00:00:29.590> done<00:00:29.920> by<00:00:30.130> hand<00:00:30.400> which<00:00:31.240> is

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
have the rest is done by hand which is

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.010 
have the rest is done by hand which is
important<00:00:32.080> because<00:00:32.199> if<00:00:32.500> you<00:00:32.860> have<00:00:33.040> a<00:00:33.070> machine

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
important because if you have a machine

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.280 
important because if you have a machine
to<00:00:35.020> divide<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:35.830> dough<00:00:36.010> then<00:00:36.760> you<00:00:36.960> squeeze<00:00:37.960> all

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
to divide the dough then you squeeze all

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.830 
to divide the dough then you squeeze all
that<00:00:38.559> air<00:00:38.890> between<00:00:39.220> produce<00:00:40.090> shoot<00:00:40.570> during

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
that air between produce shoot during

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.840 
that air between produce shoot during
your<00:00:41.080> morning<00:00:41.230> the<00:00:41.559> gas<00:00:41.769> what's<00:00:42.129> what's<00:00:42.400> ended

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
your morning the gas what's what's ended

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.180 
your morning the gas what's what's ended
in<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.180> dough<00:00:43.330> -<00:00:43.570> fermentation<00:00:44.350> will<00:00:45.040> be

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
in the dough - fermentation will be

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.340 
in the dough - fermentation will be
squeezed<00:00:45.550> other<00:00:45.820> states<00:00:46.629> so<00:00:46.870> if<00:00:46.989> you<00:00:47.080> do<00:00:47.199> that

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
squeezed other states so if you do that

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.110 
squeezed other states so if you do that
by<00:00:47.559> hand<00:00:47.800> you<00:00:47.980> can<00:00:48.010> do<00:00:48.309> a<00:00:48.340> chain<00:00:48.640> tool<00:00:48.850> it<00:00:48.969> can

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
by hand you can do a chain tool it can

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.639 
by hand you can do a chain tool it can
watch<00:00:49.360> it<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.670> will<00:00:51.700> be<00:00:51.969> started<00:00:52.450> here<00:00:52.750> we<00:00:53.620> I
