00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650

still the suede it seems to be a little
bit<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.949> softer<00:00:35.280> suede<00:00:35.489> than<00:00:35.699> the<00:00:35.790> old<00:00:35.970> Comfort

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510

bit of softer suede than the old Comfort
insoles<00:00:37.070> there's<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.159> little<00:00:38.370> bit<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.550> a

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
insoles there's a little bit of a

insoles there's a little bit of a
different<00:00:39.059> makeup<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:39.769> same<00:00:40.769> general<00:00:41.250> idea

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
different makeup but same general idea

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.799 
different makeup but same general idea

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
and then there's these shoes and these

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.710 
and then there's these shoes and these
are<00:00:49.820> taking<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> look<00:00:51.000> at<00:00:51.089> them<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.299> little<00:00:51.540> bit

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
are taking a look at them a little bit

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.060 
are taking a look at them a little bit
they<00:00:52.500> are<00:00:53.210> definitely<00:00:54.210> different<00:00:54.570> from<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
they are definitely different from the

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.829 
they are definitely different from the
last<00:00:56.070> two<00:00:56.309> versions<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.030> IDS<00:00:57.299> Eros<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
last two versions of the IDS Eros the

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.539 
last two versions of the IDS Eros the
synthetic<00:00:58.049> this<00:00:58.439> is<00:00:58.589> a<00:00:58.619> synthetic<00:00:59.159> version<00:00:59.309> I

00:00:59.539 --> 00:00:59.549 
synthetic this is a synthetic version I

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:03.740 
synthetic this is a synthetic version I
have<00:00:59.580> here<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.970> first<00:01:02.970> off<00:01:03.239> first<00:01:03.449> thing<00:01:03.659> you

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
have here so first off first thing you

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.350 
have here so first off first thing you
notice<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.290> yellow<00:01:04.559> part<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.759> somewhat

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
notice is this yellow part is somewhat

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.640 
notice is this yellow part is somewhat
rubbery<00:01:06.780> almost<00:01:07.259> is<00:01:07.439> kids<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.740> lot<00:01:07.860> firmer<00:01:08.580> than

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
rubbery almost is kids a lot firmer than

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.929 
rubbery almost is kids a lot firmer than
for<00:01:10.650> firmer<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.189> little<00:01:11.400> bit<00:01:11.520> thicker<00:01:11.790> than

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
for firmer and a little bit thicker than

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.030 
for firmer and a little bit thicker than
the<00:01:12.150> rest<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.509> the<00:01:12.600> upper<00:01:12.780> which<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> red

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the rest of the upper which is the red

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.510 
the rest of the upper which is the red
part<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.400> see<00:01:14.579> here<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:16.250> it's<00:01:17.250> definitely

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
part you see here so it's definitely

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.130 
part you see here so it's definitely
going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> help<00:01:17.880> with<00:01:18.030> some<00:01:18.150> more<00:01:18.329> lateral

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
going to help with some more lateral

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.080 
going to help with some more lateral
stability<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.680> guess<00:01:19.979> because<00:01:20.760> DITA

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
stability I guess because DITA

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.120 
stability I guess because DITA
synthetics<00:01:21.780> especially<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:22.500> adizero<00:01:22.830> has

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
synthetics especially in the adizero has

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.420 
synthetics especially in the adizero has
just<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.460> been<00:01:23.490> very<00:01:24.000> good<00:01:24.620> in<00:01:25.620> my<00:01:25.830> opinion<00:01:25.890> in

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
just not been very good in my opinion in

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.060 
just not been very good in my opinion in
comparison<00:01:26.940> to<00:01:27.140> let's<00:01:28.140> say<00:01:28.320> Nike<00:01:28.830> and<00:01:29.040> Puma

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
comparison to let's say Nike and Puma

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.710 
comparison to let's say Nike and Puma
and<00:01:29.610> even<00:01:29.850> lotto<00:01:30.030> has<00:01:30.300> some<00:01:30.480> pretty<00:01:30.630> good

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
and even lotto has some pretty good

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.300 
and even lotto has some pretty good
synthetics<00:01:31.430> um<00:01:32.510> they're<00:01:33.510> calling<00:01:33.870> this

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
synthetics um they're calling this

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.590 
synthetics um they're calling this

it has it's got these kind of hard

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.600 
it has it's got these kind of hard
angles<00:01:55.470> now<00:01:55.650> instead<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.980> being<00:01:56.070> perfectly

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
angles now instead of being perfectly

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.610 
angles now instead of being perfectly
round<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.030> just<00:01:57.690> from<00:01:57.810> squeezing<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.470> this

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
round and just from squeezing like this

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.080 
round and just from squeezing like this
I<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.890> not<00:01:58.980> only<00:01:59.100> tell<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.760> a<00:01:59.820> little<00:01:59.970> bit

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
I can not only tell it's a little bit

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.810 
I can not only tell it's a little bit
stiffer<00:02:00.480> saying<00:02:01.470> used<00:02:01.620> to<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.550> they<00:02:02.670> also

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
stiffer saying used to be and they also

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.730 
stiffer saying used to be and they also
talked<00:02:03.120> about<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.660> sub<00:02:04.140> pattern<00:02:04.470> being<00:02:04.680> a

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
talked about the sub pattern being a

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.500 
talked about the sub pattern being a
little<00:02:04.920> bit<00:02:05.010> different<00:02:05.400> I<00:02:05.580> already<00:02:06.270> kind<00:02:06.390> of

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
little bit different I already kind of

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.510 
little bit different I already kind of
put<00:02:06.990> these<00:02:07.140> side<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.500> side<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.399> only

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
put these side to side and the only

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.980 
put these side to side and the only
difference<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:09.000> could<00:02:09.149> really<00:02:09.360> make<00:02:09.420> up<00:02:09.750> was

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
difference I could really make up was

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.470 
difference I could really make up was
these<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:11.190> little<00:02:11.490> extra<00:02:11.820> curve<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.330> see

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
these this little extra curve you see

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.720 
these this little extra curve you see
here<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.020> two<00:02:13.320> front<00:02:13.620> sights<00:02:13.860> other<00:02:14.550> than
