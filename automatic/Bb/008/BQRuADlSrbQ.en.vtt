00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello, I'm a year teacher, reveals with 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.599
 In this class we will study the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.380
 parallelepiped rectangles from a 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:17.010
 more about the areas and 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.289
 diagonals of parallelepipeds and also the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.050
 cubes that are a particular case that 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.170
 It's worth noting then I'm leaving. 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.470
 this image of the parallelepiped in 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:34.410
 to say then that the measures the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.780
 dimensions are abec calculated to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.390
 surface of this parallelepiped 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.649
 I can vote tite I have this face 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.670
 of the anti front it measures the base and 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.930
 tall 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.120
 yesterday for example sometimes and current vice 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.670
 happens twice because I have a 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.320
 face to 5 just like this one from the front 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.960
 I have back there 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.170
 so I'm going to multiply by two and then I 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:10.170
 somo with Saturday the side here tb times 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:13.170
 and times two too but the base is here 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.790
 underneath that sometimes b that also the cap 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.790
 the times b 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:27.229
 since then the surface area will be 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:34.890
 just organizing a little better 2 a b 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:37.920
 but two to be two more bc or with 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.079
 appears in various materials in books and 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.100
 books 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:51.030
 taking into evidence two double 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:53.549
 ab but to be more bc remembering there that 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.689
 Of course, it does not make any difference. 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.299
 which dimension do you choose 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.210
 specifically for you ab or c 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.180
 only need to maintain throughout the study the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.520
 same choice and now I will do 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.520
 It's a style to study a little 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.690
 diagonals of themselves to the team of 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.120
 rectangle and I came back 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.270
 to find out how much this diagonal is worth 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.450
 great uncle that the highlight in green 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.210
 It is calling May with this measure 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.700
 good for this before but I'll go 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.590
 calculate how much that measures the diagonal 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.050
 this false underneath the base 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.850
 knowing the art if we unite to the height and 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.970
 away from the base we have an angle of 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.860
 90 degrees and then I have that measure in 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.140
 tall height that is c 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.830
 and this one down the so-called de 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.500
 diagonal of the face as this 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.130
 here the other side is b 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.300
 I have this right triangle here in 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.370
 face 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.590
 What I can apply Pythagoras and then I 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:05.070
 I have to square is equal to square 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:08.340
 but the square in squares and squares 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.150
 are the hicks here in this triangle of 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.520
 low 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.990
 looking now at the triangle above me 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.390
 I'm from capital to squared is equal to 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:22.890
 from small to square 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:26.520
 but to the good square I have to 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.550
 put equal to the square better 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.790
 then replaced the lowercase d with the 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:37.200
 second square of the second equation 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.810
 there to try and find a way a way 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.090
 to discover the unenlightened here that 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.650
 was a goal from the beginning then the 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:52.200
 People will stick with square b but the 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:55.230
 square in the place of the one charged plus his 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.900
 square organizing a little bit better 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.720
 We arrive in a capital is the root 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:05.160
 from squared 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:11.250
 But from the square but its square 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:13.140
 taking both sides and this is the second 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.410
 still important in the first part 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.609
 of the lesson that the study in parallelepiped 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.530
 the parallelepiped straight rectangles 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.130
 make everything look good now I'm looking for 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.070
 mouth which is a particular case there remarkable 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.260
 do mhep tango and okubo a 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.440
 document difference it has all the 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:39.330
 equal edges with the same measure 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:41.880
 congruent with the same measure did not 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.720
 accept the first surface area 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:49.710
 area of ​​the cube will be equal to 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.220
 to six times the area of ​​a face that is the 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.220
 square 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.830
 the first considers only consideration 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.960
 simple and can even be checked 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.110
 from that expression that people 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:08.340
 found the first part of the class of two 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.140
 Sometimes you know more about yourself but it's more 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.340
 interesting now I'm going to do a study 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:20.910
 to find out how much this diagonal is worth 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:25.820
 here's the cube doing the same thing as me 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.820
 I did there in the previous part of the class 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:32.150
 ready now after organizing 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:35.240
 I have a tiny squared design 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:39.919
 equal to the square 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:46.310
 but square or square drawing 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:50.540
 is equal to 2 squared and the 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:55.030
 square drawing view charged by theme 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:06:03.740
 detected is also equal to the square 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:10.610
 drawing less square then two more to the 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:15.710
 square to the charged is equal to 3 ainha 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:25.520
 square and consequently drawing is 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:28.610
 equal to the root of 3 good it 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.760
 recapitulating the lesson we did 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:35.180
 a study of the parallelepiped rectangles 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.460
 in which we find an expression that is 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:41.570
 well another study of the surface area 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:44.419
 of the parallelepiped and also a 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:48.280
 another diagonal expression for 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:48.280
 diagonal of separating from the dr team 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.060
 after that we did a study 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.919
 similar to cubes and we also discovered 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.729
 an expression for the surface area 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:07:02.050
 of the cube and one to the diagonal of the cube 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:05.150
 internal diagonal and this larger diagonal 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.510
 I'm a teacher, I'm bevilacqua, I hope. 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.510
 has helped
