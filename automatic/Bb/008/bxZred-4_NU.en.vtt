did<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.439> know<00:01:04.619> bathroom<00:01:05.339> scales<00:01:05.700> actually

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
did you know bathroom scales actually

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.260 
did you know bathroom scales actually
measure<00:01:06.570> force<00:01:06.930> not<00:01:07.409> mass<00:01:07.790> inside<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.000> scale

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
measure force not mass inside the scale

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.149 
measure force not mass inside the scale
there's<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> spring<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.380> stretches<00:01:10.860> when<00:01:11.040> you

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
there's a spring that stretches when you

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.270 
there's a spring that stretches when you
stand<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:12.350> gravity<00:01:13.350> pulls<00:01:13.650> down<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:14.070> people

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
stand on it gravity pulls down on people

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.950 
stand on it gravity pulls down on people
with<00:01:14.580> more<00:01:14.820> mass<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> spring<00:01:15.840> is

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
with more mass so the spring is

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:24.200 
with more mass so the spring is
stretched<00:01:16.170> more<00:01:18.860> bathroom<00:01:19.860> scales<00:01:23.210> thanks

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
stretched more bathroom scales thanks

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:55.670 
stretched more bathroom scales thanks
