really<00:00:22.680> don't<00:00:22.890> know<00:00:23.090> what<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.119> do<00:00:24.240> know<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.600> it

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
really don't know what I do know is it

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.870 
really don't know what I do know is it
certainly<00:00:25.890> has<00:00:26.130> its<00:00:26.660> share<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.720> problems<00:00:28.880> this

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
certainly has its share of problems this

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.780 
certainly has its share of problems this
is<00:00:30.060> what<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.300> looked<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.539> originally<00:00:31.070> and<00:00:32.070> I

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
is what it looked like originally and I

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.819 
is what it looked like originally and I
think<00:00:33.059> it's<00:00:33.180> kind<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.450> obvious<00:00:33.660> why<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.380> made

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
think it's kind of obvious why it made

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.080 
think it's kind of obvious why it made
it<00:00:35.040> now<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:36.180> obvious<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:37.559> us<00:00:37.710> because<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:38.940> are

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
it now it's obvious to us because we are

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.779 
it now it's obvious to us because we are
intelligent<00:00:39.390> people<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:41.960> don't<00:00:42.960> think<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.500> need

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789
