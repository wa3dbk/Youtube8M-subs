00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.030
 Who tell you who is talking fast? 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.340
 and bringing you another video of gt 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.250
 so with online and today I'll show 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.260
 for you a way to get 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.480
 money and rp imitated the infinite in a 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.099
 only race guys better than drugs 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.640
 This is what you have to have a little bit 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.710
 of patience to mind is you will leave 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.120
 The way she was here she's 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.370
 The only thing that changes here is the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.649
 car category was super even me 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.390
 I said something in compact but I said no 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.620
 it was super the way it is because 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.370
 should give more fp 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.530
 The rp varies depending on your levo. 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.559
 so the amount of ipi since 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.699
 She's alone, it's better to play alone. 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.230
 to hrp 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.989
 So how was the quantity? 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.020
 of rp is proportional to its level 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.430
 for example if you are in and the level 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.070
 very low 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.880
 the amount of rp you will 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.729
 win 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:14.280
 time then you will see just r 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.950
 average penalty of 850 rp amil the team 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.700
 depending on the south are you were low 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.170
 7 Then it is little is to think so there is 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.030
 bit the staff but for those who are in the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.420
 present at level 5 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.770
 but this race well 850 rtp 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.930
 It's a lot of people, so it's 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.880
 proportional to their level of here soon 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.979
 man, we have a detour here, you go. 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.950
 making deviations here has fiber on hold 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.260
 for this video tension is there you go 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.810
 apply this 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.790
 there are things here that are learning 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.890
 When are you going to do the race? 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.980
 now for example if you are in the light the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.010
 which is not my case and the level to 110 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:59.570
 you can see on the screen who is in the 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:02.660
 level 110 earn an average of 3,000 rp 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.450
 I won three thousand rp 's a lot if you 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.050
 you have a higher level you will earn 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.630
 up to 44 thousand five hundred rp the maximum 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.000
 saw it was 4,500 rpm né 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.520
 So it can be so I 'm talking here. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.650
 video is now recalled up to 4,500 rp 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.390
 means that you will earn R 4,500 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.360
 rpm beauty gallery is not only you and 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.680
 following the scheme that I am doing 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.600
 pick up the books clothes she has some 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.690
 parts to it for some parts yet 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.690
 It's getting crowded but it's part and 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.880
 is the level of difficulty of a 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.860
 run gives more rp 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.650
 it seems that when you publish on your 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.700
 club already has someone who investigates and 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.410
 end there 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.420
 The amount of rp you will earn 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.760
 is no bug's it is to have 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.900
 these rockets still do not know why you 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.900
 play alone 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.640
 it's a minute and forty 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.470
 about this race 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.970
 Let's see how long it will last and I 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.760
 I did the last time I was with a 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.920
 compact car was rapped on and 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.930
 it is slow compared to the way 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.070
 so I recommend you guys do with 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.290
 the ones around or with the adr or com em ti ti 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.140
 I particularly prefer more 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.140
 accentuated because I found it very fast but 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.790
 if you want you can make the car 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.950
 you can make it you want only 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.610
 that the faster your car 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.989
 the beauty better guys 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.989
 so come on we are here 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.740
 there in the front people who now see us 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.890
 It's 32 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.630
 We've already taken 32 checkpoint piglet technique 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.370
 almost bursting that his motor with 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.750
 That giant snore like you two are. 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.500
 listening 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.120
 It's a deafening noise Aquino headset 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.650
 I think you're listening so loud. 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.880
 So, but from my ear here is a 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.860
 very loud noise 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.440
 I do not even know if I'm kidding with you. 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.540
 Then you can let go of these missiles. 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.720
 there the amount of items you use 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.190
 one thing also catches someone who is the 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.600
 rb7 just be careful not to die that not 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.600
 I almost died now that I died. 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.680
 other detail guys there forward have 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:26.360
 plus one has a very large ramp that 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.440
 nor can you see in the picture of the race 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.700
 What were you doing to start the race? 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.560
 the image of a giant ramp galley 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.110
 So that's how it is that time you go. 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.090
 to get from this broad TV that I did not 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.330
 The first time I played with him is that 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.160
 was the 12th time the game was the 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.380
 compact car like I already told you 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.160
 pencil on that car here came out in that 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.080
 update is now and still did not get 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.000
 active climb that in the 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.720
 Sayings are safe, Brazilians explain. 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.720
 of books 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:06.830
 Let's try to put this inclusion around. 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.540
 of the surroundings now with Raphael 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.490
 soriano so if you do not have 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.800
 got too easy guys 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.070
 before starting the ramp and leaving through the bush 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.480
 Take a little trip and get out here. 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.640
 minutes and 50 seconds 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.540
 let's continue this race on average 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.500
 four seconds almost gusmão pardon 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.240
 four minutes 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:31.610
 I did it in three minutes and 56 seconds 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.810
 there are 2,940 of money and 2,250 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.260
 drp 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:39.620
 As I said the rp varies I did it and gave it 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:42.470
 three thousand now I made of 2,250 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:46.690
 So people are not at all right. 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:49.820
 understood why it is so now of 2,250 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.980
 I had given three thousand before, so it's like that. 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.750
 now you have to do it until you get a 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.130
 time it will work crowd beauty 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.910
 so that's it, I hope you 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.740
 have enjoyed 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.260
