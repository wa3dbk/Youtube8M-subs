00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
not wasting money these days because we

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.530 
not wasting money these days because we
don't<00:04:33.260> know<00:04:33.350> how<00:04:33.530> long<00:04:33.590> this<00:04:34.420> economy<00:04:35.420> is<00:04:35.480> it

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540
