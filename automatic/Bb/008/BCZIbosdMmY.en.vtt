00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.950
 Good day to all 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.270
 and I want a series of videos about clicking 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.060
 bundeswehr knife 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.880
 German army from victorinox 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.410
 we will talk first 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.349
 pushups on e100 8 millimeters in 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.960
 the next part of this video will talk on 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:35.340
 111 millimeter cousins and since 108 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.989
 This knife was called into service 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.360
 Germany back in 1976 Germany 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.800
 placed an order for production back in 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.450
 75 a year later the knives went to series 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.780
 it lasted not so long wanted 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.570
 there the Germans would have realized that it was too expensive 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.640
 fully produce knives in switzerland and 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.990
 decided that they would just buy 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.880
 spare part victorox 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.840
 and they will be collected in their homeland 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.689
 Germany and it worked out the price of a woman 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.900
 dropped costing fell but to 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.610
 Unfortunately , the quality fell 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.869
 the company which was engaged in the assembly of knives 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.200
 in Germany could not afford 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.969
 such quality control which 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.329
 provided the company quiz 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:24.509
 but it suited the Germans and so 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:27.869
 lasted quite a long time in 2003 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.759
 this knife up need to be fully written off and 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.439
 this one came to replace him 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.719
 accordingly after when before the knife 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.270
 there was a complete listing of the tender was announced 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.310
 and our pretty quickly scattered 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.579
 the whole world and it is not surprising to see 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.679
 can you tell the river a lot of money 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.140
 he is asked for ridiculously little from about 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.510
 500 to 1000 rubles 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.909
 and accordingly plus minus it depends 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.080
 from the state if the state is perfect 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.930
 they never used it 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.180
 respectively for our mouth somewhere 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.640
 1200 probably a thousand rubles if they 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.590
 enjoyed and whichever 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.580
 how intense was the price used 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.800
 varies from 300 to 700 rubles from me 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.750
 probably one of the worst exhibits 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.170
 because it's pretty hard now 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.620
 to find 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:20.980
 as you can see enjoyed and very 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.980
 active and special care once received 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.950
 many collectors and just lovers 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.140
 knives cleaned up such a pattern and not 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.209
 just because of the price but also because it can 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.570
 kind of ingenious let me explain 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:40.280
 why I think so and not only you 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:42.470
 can see a knife double row but carries 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.000
 currently functional 3 row knife and this 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.320
 really extremely positive 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.040
 affects the cost 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.420
 manufacturing its compactness 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.120
 let's talk about the functionality of the knife 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.799
 let's start as usual with the dimensions of the length of the knife 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.959
 one hundred and eight millimeters 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.489
 rather unusual option usually 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.090
 victorinox company 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:05.780
 today produces either alabaster chair 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.970
 one millimeter millimeters either 91 you 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.500
 can see here is a 91mm knife 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.770
 as they see next 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.350
 blade length stand is 82 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.090
 I have a little less than a millimeter so 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.840
 like a knife already stochili order 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.030
 but somehow ideally he builds 82 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.840
 millimeter 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:31.090
 known to crap 88 grams 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.350
 as for tools start yourself 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.709
 our big rather long closing 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.970
 as there is no retainer on the knife 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.830
 probably one of the requirements of what was 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.130
 so that it does not work out on the hands and in 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.030
 Basically the way it is 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.110
 next most important tool 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.780
 this knife 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:55.870
 This is such a thing here is drinking 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.510
 opener also file you can 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.580
 see here who can opener 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.830
 for opening bottles and cans 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.650
 cans at the end is implied 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.680
 the screwdriver is set here by the saw 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.140
 there is also a tree on this side 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.020
 diamond plating how to make a file 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.120
 pretty solid can be used as 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.370
 nail file as a simple file 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.530
 as small as you can see 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.169
 the instrument was very saturated and 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.270
 it is he who saves one row to save 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.930
 money on production and saves space 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:33.729
 in my pocket, I am, because of this thing, this knife 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:36.340
 Do as many means then have the world 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:39.520
 corkscrew to pretty big 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.979
 now what can pressing 13 no here 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.450
 classic to today 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.490
 on black pressing the stage 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.229
 millimeter you can see on 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.380
 German more turns 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.490
 they are thicker and the corkscrew is generally more massive 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.080
 I do not know how much 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.199
 it's bad how much more convenient to work 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.259
 so that the same anyway 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:03.250
 the tool is more reliable as it seems to me 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:05.380
 also here there is an awl awl is also very 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.270
 big now again this did not see them 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.610
 there is a notch on the side 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.620
 that is, they can not just pierce 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.190
 but also produce some twisting 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.220
 movement of course there is no gun for 6 2 6 me 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.500
 this omission seems to be because 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:24.699
 it was possible to sew in field conditions but 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.960
 unfortunately this is not there 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:29.199
 lanyard hole 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.110
 pretty simple it could still 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:35.860
 more convenient to use the knife on the dies 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.720
 and notches which olya g10 as is customary 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.349
 now call but it's just notches 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.530
 so for example in wet weather and when 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:46.560
 hands dirty the knife didn't slip quite 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:50.620
 deep well cling 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.750
 how can this be said even after three 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.430
 over the years but still you formed 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.919
 you can be a great helper 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.560
 travel or just wax on nature 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.719
 even in quality and disi click here even 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.880
 It can be considered for those who 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:05.909
 will not interfere with saw in daily 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.909
 wearing 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:13.270
 in the second part of this video we will talk 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:15.250
 about the second knife of the Bundeswehr, of course 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.430
 I want to thank the multitool dot ru for 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.070
 help in organizing this video 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.470
 go to the site great prices and good 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:26.330
 range 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.330
 see you all in the second part
