00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
so these are a couple of progressions

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.720 
so these are a couple of progressions
with<00:00:08.180> the<00:00:08.570> edges<00:00:08.870> of<00:00:08.990> the<00:00:09.110> hand<00:00:09.349> that<00:00:10.309> I<00:00:10.459> like

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
with the edges of the hand that I like

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.100 
with the edges of the hand that I like
to<00:00:10.879> do<00:00:10.969> I<00:00:11.000> like<00:00:11.090> to<00:00:11.240> practice<00:00:11.480> on<00:00:11.840> something

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
to do I like to practice on something

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.160 
to do I like to practice on something
like<00:00:12.350> this<00:00:12.639> the<00:00:13.639> first<00:00:13.789> one<00:00:14.090> is<00:00:14.389> one<00:00:14.900> of<00:00:15.020> the

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
like this the first one is one of the

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.680 
like this the first one is one of the
world<00:00:15.740> war<00:00:15.889> ii<00:00:16.039> combatives<00:00:16.580> ones<00:00:16.850> and<00:00:17.119> for

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
world war ii combatives ones and for

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.359 
world war ii combatives ones and for
this<00:00:17.810> one<00:00:18.080> I'm<00:00:18.439> going<00:00:18.500> to<00:00:18.650> be<00:00:18.770> using<00:00:19.070> the<00:00:19.189> into

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
this one I'm going to be using the into

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.130 
this one I'm going to be using the into
the<00:00:19.490> hand<00:00:19.670> I'm<00:00:19.760> gonna<00:00:19.880> be<00:00:20.029> hitting<00:00:20.180> back<00:00:20.869> end

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
the hand I'm gonna be hitting back end

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.570 
the hand I'm gonna be hitting back end
this<00:00:21.320> way<00:00:21.499> towards<00:00:21.919> the<00:00:22.009> side<00:00:22.189> of<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:22.400> neck

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
this way towards the side of the neck

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.939 
this way towards the side of the neck
this<00:00:23.480> next<00:00:24.259> one<00:00:24.380> is<00:00:24.410> going<00:00:24.529> to<00:00:24.710> be<00:00:24.800> off<00:00:24.919> the

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
this next one is going to be off the

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.769 
this next one is going to be off the
back<00:00:25.310> end<00:00:25.579> and<00:00:25.820> it's<00:00:26.240> going<00:00:26.329> to<00:00:26.390> be<00:00:26.539> chopping

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
back end and it's going to be chopping

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.140 
back end and it's going to be chopping
down<00:00:27.019> onto<00:00:27.380> the<00:00:27.499> collarbone<00:00:28.339> first<00:00:28.759> on<00:00:28.970> this

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
down onto the collarbone first on this

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.970 
down onto the collarbone first on this
side<00:00:29.329> and<00:00:29.749> then<00:00:30.019> on<00:00:30.109> this<00:00:30.259> side<00:00:30.320> start<00:00:30.710> coming

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
side and then on this side start coming

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.280 
side and then on this side start coming
here<00:00:34.120> I'm<00:00:35.120> going<00:00:35.300> to<00:00:35.390> repeat<00:00:35.810> it<00:00:35.870> on<00:00:36.110> the<00:00:36.170> other

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
here I'm going to repeat it on the other

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.900 
here I'm going to repeat it on the other
side<00:00:36.500> I'm<00:00:36.980> going<00:00:37.160> to<00:00:37.250> be<00:00:37.399> hitting<00:00:42.910> repeating

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
side I'm going to be hitting repeating

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.549 
side I'm going to be hitting repeating
so<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.660> reason<00:00:44.870> that<00:00:44.899> like<00:00:45.140> this<00:00:45.260> one<00:00:45.440> is

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
so the reason that like this one is

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.069 
so the reason that like this one is
because<00:00:45.590> you<00:00:45.920> get<00:00:46.070> to<00:00:46.219> work<00:00:46.399> really<00:00:47.390> getting

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
because you get to work really getting

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.540 
because you get to work really getting
used<00:00:48.199> to<00:00:48.260> hitting<00:00:48.559> something<00:00:48.800> with<00:00:49.129> the<00:00:49.309> edges

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
used to hitting something with the edges

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.700 
used to hitting something with the edges
of<00:00:49.670> your<00:00:49.699> hand<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:50.300> because<00:00:51.019> it<00:00:51.320> has<00:00:51.500> this

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
of your hand and because it has this

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.880 
of your hand and because it has this
kind<00:00:51.980> of<00:00:52.840> timing<00:00:53.840> or<00:00:53.989> one<00:00:54.260> moves<00:00:54.530> right<00:00:54.710> into

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
kind of timing or one moves right into

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.189 
kind of timing or one moves right into
the<00:00:55.100> other<00:00:55.309> you<00:00:55.820> can<00:00:55.969> do<00:00:56.090> it<00:00:56.210> continuously<00:00:56.390> and

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
the other you can do it continuously and

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.340 
the other you can do it continuously and
add<00:00:57.890> little<00:00:58.190> variations<00:00:58.760> in<00:00:58.940> and<00:00:59.260> change<00:01:00.260> the

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
add little variations in and change the

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.110 
add little variations in and change the
speed<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:00.949> rhythm<00:01:01.070> things<00:01:01.550> like<00:01:01.730> that<00:01:01.910> so

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
speed and rhythm things like that so

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.990 
speed and rhythm things like that so
here<00:01:02.480> I'll<00:01:03.320> do<00:01:03.530> it<00:01:03.679> a<00:01:03.769> little<00:01:03.920> bit<00:01:04.190> just

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
here I'll do it a little bit just

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:27.069 
here I'll do it a little bit just
cycling<00:01:05.900> through<00:01:05.960> several<00:01:06.950> times<00:01:26.079> the

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
cycling through several times the

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.289 
cycling through several times the
backhand<00:01:27.530> downtown<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:28.579> then<00:01:28.700> going<00:01:29.270> back

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
backhand downtown and then going back

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.090 
backhand downtown and then going back
like<00:01:29.659> that<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.259> other<00:01:30.290> one<00:01:30.619> is<00:01:30.740> more<00:01:30.920> of<00:01:30.979> a

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
like that the other one is more of a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.630 
like that the other one is more of a
Kempo<00:01:32.710> combination<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:33.829> motions<00:01:34.189> in<00:01:34.280> this<00:01:34.460> one

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
Kempo combination of motions in this one

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.120 
Kempo combination of motions in this one
I'm<00:01:35.000> going<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.390> be<00:01:35.600> working<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:36.680> forehand

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
I'm going to be working the forehand

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.920 
I'm going to be working the forehand
chopping<00:01:37.909> motion<00:01:38.060> as<00:01:38.360> well<00:01:38.509> so<00:01:38.689> I'm<00:01:38.750> going<00:01:38.869> to

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
chopping motion as well so I'm going to

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.590 
chopping motion as well so I'm going to
be<00:01:39.020> hitting

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
be hitting

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.969 
be hitting
one<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:41.100> then<00:01:41.700> across<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.770> next

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
one and then across this one to the next

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.080 
one and then across this one to the next
one<00:01:44.070> that's<00:01:44.220> going<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.460> jumping<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.970> little

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
one that's going to be jumping a little

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.510 
one that's going to be jumping a little
like<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.509> three<00:01:46.439> towards<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> groin<00:01:47.189> and

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
like this three towards the groin and

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.370 
like this three towards the groin and
the<00:01:48.000> follow-up<00:01:48.390> fund<00:01:48.690> is<00:01:48.810> just<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.290> be

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the follow-up fund is just going to be

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.010 
the follow-up fund is just going to be
from<00:01:49.590> here<00:01:49.830> coming<00:01:50.700> up<00:01:50.820> underneath<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.990> chin

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
from here coming up underneath the chin

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.320 
from here coming up underneath the chin
this<00:01:53.009> one<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.340> kind<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.610> tricky<00:01:53.940> because<00:01:54.060> that

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
this one is kind of tricky because that

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.630 
this one is kind of tricky because that
to<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:54.600> fit<00:01:55.080> into<00:01:55.320> kind<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.040> small<00:01:56.310> area

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
to get fit into kind of a small area

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.330 
to get fit into kind of a small area
here<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:58.080> particular<00:01:58.649> dummy<00:01:59.009> if<00:01:59.220> you

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
here and this particular dummy if you

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.370 
here and this particular dummy if you
hit<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> chin<00:01:59.880> on<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.810> really<00:02:01.049> hurts

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
hit the chin on it it really hurts

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.529 
hit the chin on it it really hurts
because<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.950> used<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.190> have<00:02:02.340> some<00:02:02.610> some<00:02:03.420> kind

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
because it used to have some some kind

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:04.940 
because it used to have some some kind
of<00:02:03.690> a<00:02:03.810> face<00:02:04.020> here<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.560> doesn't<00:02:04.799> have<00:02:04.920> that

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
of a face here and it doesn't have that

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.249 
of a face here and it doesn't have that
anymore<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:06.539> not<00:02:06.659> actually<00:02:06.990> designed

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
anymore and it's not actually designed

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.840 
anymore and it's not actually designed
to<00:02:07.320> hit<00:02:07.470> all<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> parts<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.369> kind<00:02:08.759> of

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
to hit all the parts of it I kind of

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.940 
to hit all the parts of it I kind of
like<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.060> because<00:02:09.209> it's<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.720> solid<00:02:10.080> plastic<00:02:10.289> you

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
like it because it's a solid plastic you

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.170 
like it because it's a solid plastic you
get<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.220> work<00:02:11.370> on<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.610> conditioning<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
get to work on the conditioning of the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.030 
get to work on the conditioning of the
hands<00:02:12.660> just<00:02:13.200> on<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.560> very<00:02:13.769> less<00:02:14.010> time

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
hands just on this very less time

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.979 
hands just on this very less time
sometimes<00:02:14.550> you'll<00:02:14.670> hit<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.970> chin<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:15.780> there's

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
sometimes you'll hit the chin so there's

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.930 
sometimes you'll hit the chin so there's
progression<00:02:16.380> there<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.709> here<00:02:19.700> will<00:02:20.700> be<00:02:20.790> on

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
progression there of you here will be on

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.940 
progression there of you here will be on
the<00:02:21.060> other<00:02:21.180> side<00:02:21.480> here<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:23.900> like<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.140> so

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
the other side here just like that so

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.770 
the other side here just like that so
those<00:02:26.100> are<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.340> two<00:02:26.519> drills<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.150> do<00:02:27.269> using

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
those are the two drills that I do using

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.900 
those are the two drills that I do using
the<00:02:27.870> edges<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.319> hand<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.280> Sisko<00:02:29.640> is

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
the edges of the hand and the Sisko is

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.699 
the edges of the hand and the Sisko is
going<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.360> work<00:02:30.569> pretty<00:02:31.019> much<00:02:31.260> all<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.500> angles

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
going to work pretty much all the angles

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.289 
going to work pretty much all the angles
you're<00:02:31.830> going<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.010> do<00:02:32.130> for<00:02:32.370> him<00:02:32.580> here<00:02:33.410> back<00:02:34.410> in

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
you're going to do for him here back in

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.590 
you're going to do for him here back in
downward<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:36.569> then<00:02:36.870> striking<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.890> way

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
downward and then striking this way

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.459 
downward and then striking this way
towards<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.750> groin<00:02:39.900> okay<00:02:40.830> that's<00:02:41.310> all
