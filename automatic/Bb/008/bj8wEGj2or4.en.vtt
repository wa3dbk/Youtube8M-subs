00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.859
 a small demonstration of the work of the new 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.150
 composer so small 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.840
 test stand 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.269
 here there are two other different channels a lot 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.830
 channel to block 3 by plus one by 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.470
 minus plus two channels for turn signals 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.039
 his channel on the way out let's show 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.180
 work means there is a rise plus on 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.560
 controlling them its smoothly scatters 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.059
 remove the controller plus them about 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.910
 turns off means again this further 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.879
 channel blocking by plus here is one of 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.820
 mean when we get it just their plus 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.390
 connect concrete gas for example for a while 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.899
 In the afternoon we want to help Danik. 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.629
 only we are constantly on to 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.199
 plus five seconds later , his spirit go out 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.480
 and went out to us smoothly clean through 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.570
 the second you turn on also smoothly 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:07.880
 I can once again prove 5 seconds waiting 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:11.659
 dashing off further let's say we 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:17.100
 one channel is turned on and we want 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:19.890
 change it to another means this 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.310
 one second we change the channel lock and 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.869
 before Fion flare up I collected a minus 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.460
 connected the new channel back again to 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.860
 inflames because less than a second 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.210
 passes remove the ace before the hill inflame 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.340
 this is done in order if 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.000
 let's say you are driving in the evening with 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.250
 included neighbor want far again 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.890
 same blink it is possible there neighbors 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.070
 disappears hell does not appear but 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.649
 to exclude those here can do 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.360
 delay one second well and last 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.840
 mode of operation is the mode of operation with 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.950
 turn signal means again connect 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.190
 blocking by plus or besides any 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.810
 general lock 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:10.170
 one of them so that it goes out 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.850
 further we have two channels here for 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.390
 turn signals in blue and green blue 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.770
 black stripe green black stripe 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.170
 here are spirits marked blue and green 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.000
 blue respectively 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.570
 black stripe corresponds to blue 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.900
 pumpkin 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.300
 Well, green grains mean when we 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.280
 We start to give a positive pulse and 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:36.100
 one of the hyphae lights up on the wire 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.470
 does not light up smoothly but how would we 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.700
 do not need much we especially run 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.260
 turn signal here I do it now yes and 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.430
 turn off turn nick through a half 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:52.480
 the second of that went out again blink 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.510
 yourself everything is fine we try another 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.570
 channel well, just in case 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:03.220
 again blink for what turns on 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.710
 rights and then just right not reserved 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.120
 probably the contact disappears and the last 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.830
 what wanted to show you can change 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.280
 brightness is present on the board 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.739
 small adapter 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.220
 switch here we switch one of 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.680
 positions and now light up easily on 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:27.070
 full brightness and before that it was 50 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:31.980
 percent off back think 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.980
 the difference is noticeable in general and all
