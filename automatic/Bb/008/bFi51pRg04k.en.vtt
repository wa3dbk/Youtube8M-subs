00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.760
 hi friends today we are going to prepare some 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.950
 healthy sea bass in the traditional way and 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.200
 we are going to accompany some potatoes 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.089
 how poor to prepare our seabass 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.730
 we are going to need 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:17.490
 2 seabass that I already have here clean of 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.580
 guts and well cleaned of scales already 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.920
 Ready to prepare a bag of salt 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.800
 to bake about two and a half kilos 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.170
 an egg white and a little water 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.390
 to moisten our salt to make 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.180
 the potatoes to the poor thing we are going to need 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.910
 two medium potatoes or three two 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.130
 tender chives a green pepper and 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.320
 Abundant oil for frying and a little 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.140
 Salt 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.630
 to prepare 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.640
 the lobina sala can I have prepared a 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.850
 tray and I lined it with paper 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.000
 aluminum and now I'm going to put in a bowl 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.790
 a little less than half the salt for 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.239
 make the bed where the 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.239
 divine 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.170
 well that salt I'm going to moisten the one of 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.000
 it needs to be put all the water only 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.000
 moisten the salt that I have gives me 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.650
 so we can see that they have enough 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.630
 humidity 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.250
 soaked 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.250
 we are going to deposit it down 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.990
 to make a uniform bed 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.670
 we will place our seabass these 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.450
 as it is very big we are going to put a 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.510
 little diagonally 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.410
 and this is the opposite 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.410
 separated 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.780
 and now to make the cover 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.550
 here 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.240
 and we are going to add it to the salt that is going to 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.060
 make the clear that then the layer of 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.490
 top crust and peel off 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.830
 very good in our coils a little bit of 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.750
 Patience will go mixing it 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.260
 are all all well integrated with the 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.040
 blood we also put a trickle of 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.989
 Water 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.989
 so that it also stays currency 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.720
 although this huge spoke in all this 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.220
 pile of salt the fish in the cables 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.760
 beside that we have not forgiven him 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.890
 Notify any type of dressing 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.450
 then if we want to aromatize the outside it 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.720
 You can put a little oil 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.569
 little olive pure of your destiny that 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.680
 we want 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.760
 and with this mixture we're going to cover 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.629
 making it a 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.629
 in the bed 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.280
 I already have the sea bass well covered 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.950
 tight all sides so that 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.010
 is a good crust and I will put 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.160
 preheating the oven to 200 degrees 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.010
 will need 200 degrees the time of 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.260
 20 minutes per kilo between the two will be 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.620
 as a kilo and a half with which about 30 o 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.349
 35 minutes of oven will need the 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.180
 any observed and meanwhile 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.519
 let's go preparing our potatoes 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.799
 in the end I have only used two 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.379
 potatoes and an onion and a half I've 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.030
 cut a little bit chubby the 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.579
 julienne onion and the peppers 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.219
 also be no longer I already have everything 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.519
 well chopped I'm going to put a little bit of 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:37.519
 Salt 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.140
 and I already have the hot oil and I'm going to 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.030
 influence the oil now we will lower it 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.470
 the temperature we want it to go 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.470
 cooking rather on a low flame 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:00.890
 two 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.890
 let's go doing everything 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.349
 once we have it well impregnated 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.090
 With the oil, we will try to remove it 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.590
 the minimum so that they do not break 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.499
 our potatoes because they lead to 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.609
 very very tender appointments and for them to come out 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:18.609
 as whole as possible 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.980
 they are going to cook covered that we are going to 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.710
 put as a lid and it will be on fire 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.310
 medium about 20 minutes are going to take 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.430
 to be done 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.250
 we already have the oven preheated to 200 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.669
 degrees and we will have it for about 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.669
 30 minutes 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:43.880
 at the same temperature at 200 rural 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.890
 the 30 minutes have passed and we have 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.890
 list our salaries to salt 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.880
 let's do 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.010
 it has been crusted, it is seen that 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.830
 cracks and then if that indicates 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.350
 also that the potatoes are already made 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.850
 to the poor thing I have had them to fire very very 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.230
 low and sant compete has left 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.030
 perfect 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:10.400
 now we drain them as much as possible 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.400
 oil I will put them or we can serve 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.820
 let's go turning 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.750
 I'm going to break the salt crust 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:27.359
 here you have to have a little bit of 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:27.359
 patience 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.730
 by putting the clear we have managed to 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.120
 the scab is on top come out in a 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.120
 piece 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.490
 and now with care we will go withdrawing 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.490
 the slab of the sides 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:16.719
 with care and patience let's go 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.719
 extracting all our course 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.330
 good 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:38.210
 to retire in the corner 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:41.620
 that comes out whole so we see that it has 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.620
 cooked perfectly 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.580
 we try to take away all the 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:56.210
 thorn we see so the more 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.830
 clean them out easier 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.250
 eat 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.180
 and the same operation with careful that 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.950
 stay the skin 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.950
 here the salt sticks 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.750
 well we have already extracted 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.480
 the two loins of our sea bass we're going 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.139
 to put the potatoes to a side and a 

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.949
 little thread of oil 

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:40.340
 we discover everything possible the tastings of 

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:40.340
 our oil 

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:50.729
 and now the moon we put a drop of 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.729
 extra virgin oil 

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:56.889
 and it's delicious now we'll take the 

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:59.590
 another one and we can not take it anymore 

00:07:56.889 --> 00:08:01.770
 wonderful and yummy you try it 

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.770
 will love
