at<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.260> moment<00:01:13.500> because<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:15.229> don't<00:01:16.229> know<00:01:16.290> I

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
at the moment because I don't know I

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.050 
at the moment because I don't know I
guess<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.830> guess<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.159> best<00:01:17.369> way<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.580> describe

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
guess I guess the best way to describe

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.330 
guess I guess the best way to describe
it<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.330> I'm<00:01:18.689> pretty<00:01:18.930> much<00:01:19.110> like<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> fat<00:01:19.650> kid<00:01:19.920> at

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
it is I'm pretty much like a fat kid at

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.630 
it is I'm pretty much like a fat kid at
a<00:01:20.400> buffet<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.590> you<00:01:22.590> know<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.860> can't<00:01:23.310> like

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
same time which is probably isn't the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.020 
same time which is probably isn't the
best<00:02:08.379> way<00:02:08.769> to<00:02:08.799> do<00:02:09.039> it<00:02:09.190> but<00:02:09.369> that's<00:02:09.640> just<00:02:09.789> how<00:02:09.970> I

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
best way to do it but that's just how I

but anyways montage wise it's really
time-consuming

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
time-consuming

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.020 
time-consuming
