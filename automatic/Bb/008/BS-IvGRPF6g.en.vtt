00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.170 
is my mod mic follow-up so when I
originally<00:00:22.890> unbox<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.580> mod<00:00:23.760> mic<00:00:23.970> which<00:00:24.150> is

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
originally unbox the mod mic which is

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.450 
originally unbox the mod mic which is
the<00:00:24.510> detachable<00:00:25.260> microphone<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.250> can

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
the detachable microphone that you can

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.730 
the detachable microphone that you can
put<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> side<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.269> any<00:00:27.510> headphones<00:00:28.080> as<00:00:28.320> you

put on the side of any headphones as you

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.109 
put on the side of any headphones as you
guys<00:00:28.949> will<00:00:29.099> probably<00:00:29.519> know<00:00:29.670> if<00:00:29.820> you've<00:00:29.970> been

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
guys will probably know if you've been

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.970 
guys will probably know if you've been
watching<00:00:30.449> me<00:00:30.539> for<00:00:30.570> any<00:00:30.900> period<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.380> time<00:00:31.439> I'm

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
watching me for any period of time I'm

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.700 
watching me for any period of time I'm
not<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> huge<00:00:32.880> fan<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.180> most<00:00:33.660> gaming<00:00:34.170> headsets

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
not a huge fan of most gaming headsets

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.100 
not a huge fan of most gaming headsets
because<00:00:35.460> generally<00:00:35.940> speaking<00:00:36.210> they<00:00:36.570> skimp<00:00:36.960> on

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
because generally speaking they skimp on

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.830 
because generally speaking they skimp on
the<00:00:37.530> actual<00:00:37.890> audio<00:00:38.160> quality<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:39.180> order<00:00:39.540> to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the actual audio quality in order to

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.240 
the actual audio quality in order to
tack<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> mic<00:00:40.559> onto<00:00:40.980> them

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
tack a mic onto them

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.490 
tack a mic onto them
so<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.760> often<00:00:42.090> recommend<00:00:42.420> people<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:43.230> is

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
so what I often recommend people do is

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.619 
so what I often recommend people do is
use<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> pair<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.370> headphones<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.390> case

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
use a pair of headphones in this case

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.869 
use a pair of headphones in this case
these<00:00:45.840> are<00:00:45.899> sennheiser<00:00:46.410> HD<00:00:46.860> 5<00:00:47.039> v<00:00:47.309> 5s<00:00:47.670> which<00:00:47.760> i

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
these are sennheiser HD 5 v 5s which i

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.720 
these are sennheiser HD 5 v 5s which i
used<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.239> use<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.770> use<00:00:49.770> something<00:00:50.370> else<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
used to use and use something else as a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.459 
used to use and use something else as a
microphone<00:00:51.210> such<00:00:51.449> as<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> blue<00:00:51.930> desktop

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
microphone such as a blue desktop

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.279 
microphone such as a blue desktop
microphone<00:00:52.710> or<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.969> mod<00:00:54.180> mic<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
microphone or the mod mic this is the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.310 
microphone or the mod mic this is the
rev<00:00:55.500> 3-1<00:00:56.190> now<00:00:56.340> aside<00:00:57.120> from<00:00:57.149> promising<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
rev 3-1 now aside from promising a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.170 
rev 3-1 now aside from promising a
follow<00:00:58.530> up<00:00:58.649> back<00:00:58.949> when<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.160> did<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> unboxing<00:00:59.579> I

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
follow up back when I did the unboxing I

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.270 
follow up back when I did the unboxing I
also<00:01:00.539> made<00:01:00.809> some<00:01:00.840> mistakes<00:01:01.559> when<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.920> did<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
also made some mistakes when I did the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.130 
also made some mistakes when I did the
original<00:01:02.460> unboxing<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.329> didn't<00:01:03.870> really

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
original unboxing I didn't really

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.950 
original unboxing I didn't really
configure<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.920> right<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.430> for<00:01:05.790> example<00:01:06.330> this

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
configure it right so for example this

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.080 
configure it right so for example this
this<00:01:07.619> little<00:01:07.830> clip<00:01:08.159> right<00:01:08.340> here<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.700> actually

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
this little clip right here is actually

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.820 
this little clip right here is actually
for<00:01:09.270> clipping<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> mod<00:01:10.020> mic<00:01:10.229> itself<00:01:10.590> to

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
for clipping to the mod mic itself to

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.219 
for clipping to the mod mic itself to
reduce<00:01:11.100> stress<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.700> cable<00:01:12.090> not<00:01:12.930> for

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
reduce stress on the cable not for

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.660 
reduce stress on the cable not for
clipping<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> cord<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.250> your<00:01:14.460> other

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
clipping to the cord of your other

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.460 
clipping to the cord of your other
device<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.659> would<00:01:15.869> actually<00:01:16.200> recommend

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
device so I would actually recommend

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.440 
device so I would actually recommend
doing<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.040> some<00:01:17.070> other<00:01:17.460> way<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:18.030> also

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
doing that in some other way I also

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.120 
doing that in some other way I also
didn't<00:01:18.840> really<00:01:18.960> configure<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.619> correctly<00:01:19.979> in

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
didn't really configure it correctly in

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.649 
didn't really configure it correctly in
terms<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> positioning<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.450> want<00:01:21.600> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
terms of the positioning you want to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.640 
terms of the positioning you want to
make<00:01:21.780> sure<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.049> get<00:01:22.229> things<00:01:22.439> right

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
make sure you get things right

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.350 
make sure you get things right
beforehand<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.820> don't<00:01:23.970> want<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> kind<00:01:24.330> of

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
beforehand you don't want to kind of

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.179 
beforehand you don't want to kind of
like<00:01:24.509> bend<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.869> too<00:01:25.020> much<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.500> then<00:01:25.619> unbend<00:01:26.070> it

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
like bend it too much and then unbend it

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.550 
like bend it too much and then unbend it
and<00:01:26.340> rebend<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.060> other<00:01:27.960> than<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.229> that

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
and rebend it and other than that that

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.080 
and rebend it and other than that that
was<00:01:28.740> sort<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.070> most<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> problem<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.060> good

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
was sort of most of the problem the good

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.730 
was sort of most of the problem the good
news<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.900> second<00:01:31.380> chance<00:01:31.590> because

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
news is you have a second chance because

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.069 
news is you have a second chance because
they<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.070> include<00:01:32.640> another<00:01:33.390> little<00:01:33.780> magnetic

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
they do include another little magnetic

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.230 
they do include another little magnetic
piece<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.860> always<00:01:35.070> kind<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.400> Rika

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
piece so you can always kind of Rika

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.319 
piece so you can always kind of Rika
jigger<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.630> yourself<00:01:37.939> and<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.150> never

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
jigger it yourself and so I never

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.149 
jigger it yourself and so I never
provided<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.079> audio<00:01:40.560> sample<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.100> I

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
provided that audio sample that I

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.800 
provided that audio sample that I
promised<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.610> provide<00:01:41.850> because<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.540> was<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
