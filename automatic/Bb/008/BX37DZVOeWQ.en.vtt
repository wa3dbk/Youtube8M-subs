00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.960 
he flies around so it's kind of hard to
talk<00:02:51.519> to<00:02:51.730> him<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.120> -<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:54.730> can't<00:02:55.000> actually

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
talk to him and - you can't actually

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.150 
talk to him and - you can't actually
like<00:02:57.970> his<00:02:58.180> game<00:02:58.750> is<00:02:59.019> chase<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:01.799> it's<00:03:02.799> kind<00:03:03.100> of

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
like his game is chase so it's kind of

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.640 
like his game is chase so it's kind of
hard<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.459> grab<00:03:03.850> him<00:03:04.090> but<00:03:04.329> the<00:03:04.600> best<00:03:05.110> way<00:03:05.320> to<00:03:05.350> get

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
hard to grab him but the best way to get

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.220 
hard to grab him but the best way to get
him<00:03:05.799> like<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.880> try<00:03:07.150> this<00:03:07.209> it<00:03:07.510> doesn't<00:03:07.810> work<00:03:07.959> too

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
him like I try this it doesn't work too

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.069 
him like I try this it doesn't work too
well<00:03:08.260> but<00:03:08.680> if<00:03:08.829> you<00:03:09.100> Thunder<00:03:09.430> if<00:03:09.760> you

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
well but if you Thunder if you

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.970 
well but if you Thunder if you
Thunderbolt<00:03:11.079> him<00:03:11.230> from<00:03:11.440> a<00:03:11.560> disk

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
Thunderbolt him from a disk

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.880 
Thunderbolt him from a disk
it'll<00:03:12.700> reach<00:03:12.940> him<00:03:13.209> but<00:03:13.810> like<00:03:13.959> that<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.530> can<00:03:14.709> go

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
it'll reach him but like that you can go

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.910 
it'll reach him but like that you can go
and<00:03:15.220> talk<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.489> them<00:03:15.879> and<00:03:16.060> as<00:03:16.239> you<00:03:17.110> can<00:03:17.260> see<00:03:17.319> he

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
and talk to them and as you can see he

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.100 
and talk to them and as you can see he
will<00:03:18.069> play<00:03:18.340> chase<00:03:21.269> now<00:03:22.269> this<00:03:22.510> is<00:03:22.659> not<00:03:22.840> rigged
