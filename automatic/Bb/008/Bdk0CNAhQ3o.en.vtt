00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.809 

like<00:02:09.009> this<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:10.410> now<00:02:11.410> what<00:02:12.250> we<00:02:12.400> need<00:02:12.519> to<00:02:12.580> do

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
like this and now what we need to do

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.870 
like this and now what we need to do
when<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:13.780> put<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.140> cherries<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.860> have<00:02:15.730> to

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
when you put the cherries you have to

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.990 
when you put the cherries you have to
make<00:02:16.030> sure<00:02:16.269> you<00:02:17.170> put<00:02:17.379> them<00:02:17.530> one<00:02:17.769> behind<00:02:18.190> the

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
make sure you put them one behind the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.350 
make sure you put them one behind the
other<00:02:19.030> one<00:02:19.739> like<00:02:20.739> this

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
other one like this

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.059 
other one like this
do<00:02:22.360> not<00:02:22.540> push<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.200> end<00:02:23.349> and<00:02:23.530> try<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:23.830> put

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
do not push it to the end and try to put

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.130 
do not push it to the end and try to put
another<00:02:24.340> one<00:02:24.549> it<00:02:25.030> will<00:02:25.239> not<00:02:25.299> fit<00:02:25.660> because<00:02:25.959> it's

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
another one it will not fit because it's

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.289 
another one it will not fit because it's
going<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.349> tray<00:02:26.620> create<00:02:27.220> an<00:02:27.519> air<00:02:27.880> bubble<00:02:28.180> in

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
going to tray create an air bubble in

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:40.780 
going to tray create an air bubble in
here<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:30.480> they<00:02:31.480> will<00:02:31.630> not<00:02:31.780> fit<00:02:31.989> inside

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.420 

so<00:02:41.330> if<00:02:41.569> they<00:02:41.720> do<00:02:41.840> not<00:02:42.019> fit<00:02:42.230> try<00:02:43.190> with<00:02:43.400> another

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
so if they do not fit try with another

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.500 
so if they do not fit try with another
one<00:02:43.849> with<00:02:44.030> a<00:02:44.060> smaller<00:02:44.420> one<00:02:49.390> we're<00:02:50.390> almost

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
one with a smaller one we're almost

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.070 
one with a smaller one we're almost
there

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
there

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.050 
there
no<00:02:51.319> more<00:02:51.500> left<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:54.190> there<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.280> go<00:02:55.400> that's

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
no more left and there you go that's

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.259 
no more left and there you go that's
exactly<00:02:56.180> what<00:02:56.659> we<00:02:56.780> need<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.700> now<00:02:58.849> what's<00:02:59.060> left

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
exactly what we need and now what's left

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:14.720
