00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.069 
I'd have to think that Bray Wyatt is
going<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.640> win<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.939> one<00:01:54.210> based<00:01:54.540> off<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.780> what

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
going to win this one based off of what

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.959 
going to win this one based off of what
happened<00:01:55.470> at<00:01:55.680> battleground<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.700> what<00:01:56.820> was

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
happened at battleground and what was

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.670 
happened at battleground and what was
the<00:01:57.090> surprise<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> pleasant<00:01:58.229> surprise

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
the surprise it was a pleasant surprise

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.980 
the surprise it was a pleasant surprise
that<00:01:58.920> Chris<00:01:59.430> Jericho<00:01:59.460> won<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.659> who's<00:02:00.780> going

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
that Chris Jericho won but who's going

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.749 
that Chris Jericho won but who's going
to<00:02:01.049> come<00:02:01.229> out<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:01.530> top<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.189> outing<00:02:02.579> like<00:02:02.700> I

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
to come out on top in this outing like I

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.359 
to come out on top in this outing like I
said<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:02.969> have<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.390> go<00:02:03.509> with<00:02:03.719> Bray<00:02:04.320> Wyatt<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.009> I

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
said I have to go with Bray Wyatt and I

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.620 
said I have to go with Bray Wyatt and I
in<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.670> match<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.090> think<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.360> gonna<00:02:06.509> be

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
in a match that I think is gonna be

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.850 
in a match that I think is gonna be
better<00:02:06.869> than<00:02:06.990> their<00:02:07.350> battleground<00:02:07.619> match

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
better than their battleground match

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.960 
better than their battleground match
because<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.190> seems<00:02:08.340> like<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.520> chemistry<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.910> a

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
because it seems like the chemistry is a

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.309 
because it seems like the chemistry is a
little<00:02:09.179> off<00:02:09.300> but<00:02:09.450> we'll<00:02:09.569> get<00:02:09.690> down<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.080> in

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
little off but we'll get down to that in

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.220 
little off but we'll get down to that in
my<00:02:10.619> preview<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.129> full<00:02:11.280> analysis<00:02:11.790> the

reason I think Seth Rollins is going to

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.039 
reason I think Seth Rollins is going to
come<00:02:55.319> away<00:02:55.530> with<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:55.889> victory<00:02:56.159> and<00:02:57.049> then

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
come away with the victory and then

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.809 
come away with the victory and then
ladies<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.409> gentlemen<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.370> going<00:02:59.639> to<00:02:59.700> be

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
ladies and gentlemen it is going to be

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.349 
ladies and gentlemen it is going to be
the<00:03:00.180> Viper<00:03:00.569> Randy<00:03:01.530> Orton<00:03:01.799> going<00:03:02.489> one-on-one

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
the Viper Randy Orton going one-on-one

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.679 
the Viper Randy Orton going one-on-one
with<00:03:04.109> Roman<00:03:04.769> reigns<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.489> this<00:03:05.669> match<00:03:05.969> I'd

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
with Roman reigns and this match I'd

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:08.390 
with Roman reigns and this match I'd
like<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.049> see<00:03:07.230> Randy<00:03:07.680> Orton<00:03:07.889> actually<00:03:08.189> get<00:03:08.310> the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
like to see Randy Orton actually get the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.039 
like to see Randy Orton actually get the
victory<00:03:08.639> but<00:03:08.879> I<00:03:08.909> think<00:03:09.180> Roman<00:03:09.480> reigns<00:03:09.659> is

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
victory but I think Roman reigns is

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.300 
victory but I think Roman reigns is
ultimately<00:03:10.349> gonna<00:03:10.500> come<00:03:10.680> away<00:03:10.859> the<00:03:11.099> winner

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
ultimately gonna come away the winner

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.360 
ultimately gonna come away the winner
and<00:03:11.579> then<00:03:12.239> it<00:03:12.359> will<00:03:12.480> be<00:03:12.599> a<00:03:12.629> flag<00:03:13.349> match<00:03:13.799> it

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
and then it will be a flag match it

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.649 
and then it will be a flag match it
would<00:03:14.519> be<00:03:14.639> rusev<00:03:15.150> one-on-one<00:03:16.019> with<00:03:16.639> Jack

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
would be rusev one-on-one with Jack

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.469 
would be rusev one-on-one with Jack
Swagger<00:03:18.659> in<00:03:19.470> this<00:03:19.680> match<00:03:19.949> I<00:03:20.250> see<00:03:20.729> Jack<00:03:21.000> Swagger

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:21.479
