okay hello guys and welcome back to the
next<00:00:03.270> part<00:00:03.540> of<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.750> character<00:00:04.080> modeling

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
next part of the character modeling

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.570 
next part of the character modeling
tutorial<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:06.529> this<00:00:07.529> part<00:00:07.830> will<00:00:07.919> be<00:00:08.220> fairly

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
tutorial and this part will be fairly

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.200 
tutorial and this part will be fairly
short<00:00:08.970> that's<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.990> plan<00:00:10.639> we<00:00:11.639> just<00:00:11.880> want<00:00:12.090> to

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
short that's the plan we just want to

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.259 
short that's the plan we just want to
finish<00:00:12.540> off<00:00:12.780> this<00:00:13.440> last<00:00:13.679> part<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> hand<00:00:14.519> to

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
finish off this last part of the hand to

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.960 
finish off this last part of the hand to
leave<00:00:15.420> us<00:00:15.619> nothing<00:00:16.619> but<00:00:16.650> head<00:00:17.369> hands<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.270> feet

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
leave us nothing but head hands and feet

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.340 
leave us nothing but head hands and feet
which<00:00:20.970> are<00:00:21.150> my<00:00:21.330> opinion<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.750> most<00:00:21.960> difficult

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
which are my opinion the most difficult

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.890 
which are my opinion the most difficult
parts<00:00:22.740> will<00:00:23.070> probably<00:00:23.850> start<00:00:24.359> with<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.660> head

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
parts will probably start with the head

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.660 
parts will probably start with the head
it's<00:00:25.289> just<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.619> matter<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.890> motivation<00:00:26.519> what

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
it's just a matter of motivation what

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.779 
it's just a matter of motivation what
you<00:00:26.789> like<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.150> do<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.510> I'm<00:00:28.109> kind<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.859> tired<00:00:29.550> of

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
you like to do and I'm kind of tired of

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.209 
you like to do and I'm kind of tired of
hands<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.420> I've<00:00:31.230> actually<00:00:31.470> never<00:00:31.800> really

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
hands and I've actually never really

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.380 
hands and I've actually never really
modeled<00:00:32.579> feet<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.829> guess<00:00:34.829> I'll<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:36.090> that

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
modeled feet so I guess I'll do that

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.380 
modeled feet so I guess I'll do that
next<00:00:37.140> time<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.890> my<00:00:37.920> next<00:00:38.040> big<00:00:38.579> session<00:00:39.030> at<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
next time in my next big session at the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.850 
next time in my next big session at the
beginning<00:00:39.899> because<00:00:40.079> that's<00:00:40.410> what<00:00:40.590> I'm<00:00:40.680> one

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
beginning because that's what I'm one

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.020 
beginning because that's what I'm one
what<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.129> added<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.520> do<00:00:41.640> these<00:00:41.730> kind<00:00:42.000> of

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
what you added to do these kind of

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.299 
what you added to do these kind of
things<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.570> not<00:00:43.379> only<00:00:43.559> more<00:00:43.770> success<00:00:44.160> so

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
things I have not only more success so

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.979 
things I have not only more success so
to<00:00:47.309> begin<00:00:47.460> with<00:00:47.670> I'm<00:00:47.850> just<00:00:47.969> going<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.809> that

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
to begin with I'm just going to do that

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.660 
to begin with I'm just going to do that
where<00:00:49.230> similar<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.829> what<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.100> did<00:00:50.250> with<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
where similar to what we did with the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.110 
where similar to what we did with the
legs<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:52.110> add<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> circle<00:00:52.620> as<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.879> new

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
legs so just add a circle as a new

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.189 
legs so just add a circle as a new
object<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.690> course<00:00:54.989> with<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> versus<00:00:56.190> again<00:00:57.199> in

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
object of course with a versus again in

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.029 
object of course with a versus again in

what<00:00:59.760> well<00:01:00.059> first<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.629> make<00:01:01.140> sure<00:01:01.170> to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
what well first of all make sure to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.590 
what well first of all make sure to
Center<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.129> alt<00:01:02.460> G<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.940> will<00:01:02.969> Center<00:01:03.510> it

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
Center it so alt G you will Center it

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.359 
Center it so alt G you will Center it
for<00:01:03.780> you

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
for you

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.210 
for you
make<00:01:05.820> sure<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.000> add<00:01:06.150> mode<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:07.080> move<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.650> away

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
make sure to add mode to move it away

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.670 
make sure to add mode to move it away
from<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.670> center<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.270> well

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
from the center as well

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.320 
from the center as well
we<00:01:11.040> don't<00:01:11.220> need<00:01:11.340> proportion<00:01:11.820> anything<00:01:12.119> by<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
we don't need proportion anything by the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.210 
we don't need proportion anything by the
way<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:12.840> mirror<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:15.439> also<00:01:16.439> activating

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
way and then mirror it also activating

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.820 
way and then mirror it also activating
that<00:01:17.400> will<00:01:17.640> enable<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.180> see<00:01:18.509> if<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.650> like

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
that will enable you to see if you like

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.070 
that will enable you to see if you like
that<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.930> position<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:23.009> properly<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:24.270> where<00:01:25.020> it

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
that so position it properly to where it

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.560 
that so position it properly to where it
belongs<00:01:25.610> something<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.150> do<00:01:27.330> and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
belongs something like that to do and

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.010 
belongs something like that to do and
then<00:01:28.080> also<00:01:28.290> from<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.680> side<00:01:28.890> view<00:01:29.270> now<00:01:30.270> again

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
then also from the side view now again

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.920 
then also from the side view now again
the<00:01:31.530> workflow<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.189> use<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.360> start<00:01:33.720> by

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the workflow that I use is to start by

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.880 
the workflow that I use is to start by
extruding<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> very<00:01:35.340> end<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:37.619> hand

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
extruding it to the very end of the hand

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.539 
extruding it to the very end of the hand
or<00:01:38.100> leg<00:01:38.310> or<00:01:38.520> whatever<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.119> are<00:01:39.150> making<00:01:39.509> then

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
or leg or whatever we are making then

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.690 
or leg or whatever we are making then
adjust<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.670> from<00:01:41.820> side<00:01:42.210> view<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:43.159> really<00:01:44.159> like

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
adjust it from side view I really like

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.580 
adjust it from side view I really like
it<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.030> also<00:01:45.810> you'll<00:01:45.930> need<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.229> recalculate

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
it and also you'll need to recalculate

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.990 
it and also you'll need to recalculate
the<00:01:46.890> normals<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.460> ctrl<00:01:48.119> n<00:01:49.610> that<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.850> have

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the normals with ctrl n that can have

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.550 
the normals with ctrl n that can have
them<00:01:51.149> often<00:01:51.420> with<00:01:51.479> extrusions<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:54.470> what<00:01:55.470> do

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
them often with extrusions and what do

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.530 
them often with extrusions and what do
you<00:01:55.680> know<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.390> again<00:01:57.390> Lucas<00:01:57.899> control<00:01:58.590> our<00:01:59.540> move

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
you know is again Lucas control our move

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.350 
you know is again Lucas control our move
them<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.229> wherever<00:02:01.469> it's<00:02:01.890> needed<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.490> keep<00:02:03.210> in

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
them to wherever it's needed and keep in

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.359 
them to wherever it's needed and keep in
mind<00:02:03.570> at<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.930> point<00:02:04.079> again<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.250> a

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
mind at this point again that this is a

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.990 
mind at this point again that this is a
drawn<00:02:05.670> reference<00:02:06.149> it's<00:02:06.420> not<00:02:06.740> perfect<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.429> I

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
drawn reference it's not perfect so I

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.520 
drawn reference it's not perfect so I
have<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.360> feeling<00:02:09.660> for<00:02:09.840> example<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.259> these

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
have to feeling for example that these

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.440 
have to feeling for example that these
arms<00:02:11.129> are<00:02:11.250> kind<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.610> too<00:02:11.819> thin<00:02:12.030> but<00:02:12.209> maybe

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
arms are kind of too thin but maybe

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.140 
arms are kind of too thin but maybe
they're<00:02:12.720> alright

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
they're alright

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.440 
they're alright
so<00:02:15.150> don't<00:02:16.080> rely<00:02:16.260> too<00:02:16.440> much<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.940> basically

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
so don't rely too much that so basically

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.600 
so don't rely too much that so basically
I'm<00:02:18.630> just<00:02:18.690> creating<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.500> couple<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.130> loops<00:02:20.340> and

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
I'm just creating a couple of loops and

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.440 
I'm just creating a couple of loops and
adjusting<00:02:21.030> them<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:25.220> yeah<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:26.610> see<00:02:27.090> we<00:02:27.330> are<00:02:27.390> a

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
adjusting them and yeah so see we are a

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.810 
adjusting them and yeah so see we are a
bit<00:02:27.660> bigger<00:02:27.900> than<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.470> reference<00:02:28.790> but<00:02:29.790> I

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
bit bigger than the reference but I

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.670 
bit bigger than the reference but I
think<00:02:30.090> looking<00:02:30.330> at<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:30.630> from<00:02:30.990> this<00:02:31.410> really

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
think looking at it from this really

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.320 
think looking at it from this really
view<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:31.920> looks<00:02:32.280> good<00:02:32.490> now<00:02:34.400> we<00:02:35.400> we<00:02:35.940> could<00:02:36.150> add

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
view it looks good now we we could add

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.150 
view it looks good now we we could add
here<00:02:36.360> some<00:02:36.870> details<00:02:37.290> but<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.620> problem<00:02:38.010> is

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
here some details but the problem is

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.190 
here some details but the problem is
that<00:02:39.170> it's<00:02:40.170> not<00:02:41.010> connected<00:02:41.640> yet<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:42.200> Spartan

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
that it's not connected yet to Spartan

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.420 
that it's not connected yet to Spartan
and<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.830> connectors<00:02:44.360> exactly<00:02:45.360> on<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.810> on<00:02:46.560> the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
and the connectors exactly on the on the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.449 
and the connectors exactly on the on the
elbow<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.000> we<00:02:48.150> have<00:02:48.300> kind<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.600> difficult<00:02:49.050> times

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
elbow so we have kind of difficult times

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.090 
elbow so we have kind of difficult times
doing<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.760> without<00:02:51.410> having<00:02:52.410> problems<00:02:52.920> later

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
doing that without having problems later

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.790 
doing that without having problems later
on<00:02:53.280> connecting<00:02:53.880> those<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:54.480> actually<00:02:55.080> no

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
on connecting those so actually no

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.979 
on connecting those so actually no
details<00:02:56.220> this<00:02:56.520> time<00:02:58.820> that's<00:02:59.820> something<00:03:00.660> for

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
details this time that's something for

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.050 
details this time that's something for
later<00:03:02.870> I'm<00:03:03.870> just<00:03:04.140> going<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.440> scale<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.370> few

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
later I'm just going to scale a few

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.690 
later I'm just going to scale a few
things<00:03:06.270> along<00:03:06.930> why<00:03:07.680> because<00:03:08.130> we<00:03:08.370> haven't<00:03:08.520> done

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
things along why because we haven't done

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.180 
things along why because we haven't done
that<00:03:08.880> so<00:03:09.540> much<00:03:09.720> yet<00:03:11.600> but<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:12.900> looks<00:03:13.170> good<00:03:13.890> um

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
that so much yet but that looks good um

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.620 
that so much yet but that looks good um
so<00:03:15.200> what's<00:03:16.200> left<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.770> the<00:03:17.670> hands<00:03:18.060> obviously

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
so what's left is the hands obviously

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:27.830 
so what's left is the hands obviously
and<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:22.910> then<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.630> feet<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.080> then<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:26.840> head

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
and and then the feet and then the head

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.890 
and and then the feet and then the head
or<00:03:28.140> whichever<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.100> directions<00:03:29.820> I'm<00:03:30.510> going<00:03:30.750> to

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
or whichever the directions I'm going to

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.789 
or whichever the directions I'm going to
work<00:03:31.080> with<00:03:31.350> so<00:03:31.890> let's<00:03:32.250> spend<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.299> few<00:03:33.799> minutes

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
work with so let's spend a few minutes

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.610 
work with so let's spend a few minutes
on<00:03:35.100> analyzing<00:03:35.610> a<00:03:35.880> little<00:03:36.090> bit<00:03:36.239> here<00:03:38.480> well<00:03:39.620> this

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
on analyzing a little bit here well this

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.160 
on analyzing a little bit here well this
is<00:03:40.769> just<00:03:41.150> for<00:03:44.480> preparing<00:03:45.480> for<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.690> next<00:03:45.870> part

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
is just for preparing for the next part

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.310 
is just for preparing for the next part
so<00:03:47.160> this<00:03:47.760> point<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.090> everything<00:03:48.690> is<00:03:48.840> fine<00:03:49.079> so

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
so this point is everything is fine so

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.690 
so this point is everything is fine so
far<00:03:49.560> I'm<00:03:49.769> saving<00:03:50.130> at<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.180> point<00:03:52.640> what<00:03:53.640> I'm

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
far I'm saving at this point what I'm

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.009 
far I'm saving at this point what I'm
going<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:53.940> do<00:03:54.120> now<00:03:54.239> is<00:03:54.450> check<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.750> few<00:03:54.870> things

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
going to do now is check a few things

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.690 
going to do now is check a few things
about<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.590> reference<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.070> what<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.310> can<00:03:56.489> do

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
about the reference so what you can do

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.449 
about the reference so what you can do
to<00:03:56.910> see<00:03:57.480> whether<00:03:57.780> it's<00:03:58.049> aligned<00:03:58.380> or<00:03:58.500> not<00:03:58.680> is<00:03:58.920> to

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
to see whether it's aligned or not is to

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.130 
to see whether it's aligned or not is to
use<00:03:59.549> degrees<00:03:59.730> pencils<00:04:00.329> so<00:04:00.570> you<00:04:00.630> just<00:04:00.900> hold

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
use degrees pencils so you just hold

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.030 
use degrees pencils so you just hold
down<00:04:01.200> D<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:01.920> then<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:03.000> draw<00:04:03.660> with<00:04:04.380> your<00:04:04.739> mouse

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
down D and then you draw with your mouse

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
down D and then you draw with your mouse
line<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:06.540> didn't<00:04:07.530> press<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.829> thirty<00:04:08.549> two<00:04:08.820> times

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
line I didn't press the thirty two times

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.860 
line I didn't press the thirty two times
just<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:09.780> know<00:04:10.220> so<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.280> see<00:04:11.700> we're<00:04:12.180> quite<00:04:12.630> off

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
just you know so you see we're quite off

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.990 
just you know so you see we're quite off
from<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:17.489> center<00:04:18.500> from<00:04:19.500> from<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.700> actual

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
from the center from from the the actual

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.700 
from the center from from the the actual
height

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
height

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.360 
height
which<00:04:23.550> is<00:04:23.699> not<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:23.940> big<00:04:24.240> problem<00:04:24.960> I<00:04:24.990> mean<00:04:25.500> it's<00:04:25.889> a

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
which is not a big problem I mean it's a

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.230 
which is not a big problem I mean it's a
reference<00:04:26.729> it<00:04:27.120> was<00:04:27.240> drawn<00:04:27.570> by<00:04:27.750> hand<00:04:28.080> without

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
reference it was drawn by hand without

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.480 
reference it was drawn by hand without
checking<00:04:30.240> for<00:04:30.570> alignment<00:04:31.139> so<00:04:31.770> what<00:04:32.310> do<00:04:32.430> you

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
checking for alignment so what do you

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.980 
checking for alignment so what do you
expect<00:04:32.610> that's<00:04:33.380> again<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.530> thing<00:04:37.310> but

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
expect that's again the thing but

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.080 
expect that's again the thing but
luckily<00:04:39.990> we<00:04:40.590> have<00:04:40.800> a<00:04:40.830> few<00:04:41.250> ways<00:04:41.430> to<00:04:41.490> make

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
luckily we have a few ways to make

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.110 
luckily we have a few ways to make
things<00:04:43.020> easier<00:04:43.380> and<00:04:43.759> that's<00:04:44.759> what<00:04:44.970> we're

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
things easier and that's what we're

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.870 
things easier and that's what we're
going<00:04:45.210> to<00:04:45.270> do<00:04:45.479> now<00:04:45.630> so<00:04:46.169> I'm<00:04:46.289> marking<00:04:46.880> myself

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
going to do now so I'm marking myself

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.570 
going to do now so I'm marking myself
the<00:04:48.630> position<00:04:49.050> of<00:04:49.229> different<00:04:49.800> features<00:04:50.430> of

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
the position of different features of

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.909 
the position of different features of
the<00:04:50.699> face<00:04:50.880> so<00:04:51.750> this<00:04:51.930> is<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.199> nose<00:04:52.380> this<00:04:52.740> is<00:04:52.800> the

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
the face so this is the nose this is the

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.870 
the face so this is the nose this is the
mouth<00:04:53.250> and<00:04:53.669> that's<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.509> eyes<00:04:55.520> from<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.639> front

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
mouth and that's the eyes from the front

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.430 
mouth and that's the eyes from the front
view<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.120> since<00:04:57.539> I<00:04:57.660> said<00:04:57.870> I<00:04:57.900> would<00:04:58.110> rely<00:04:58.410> on

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
view and since I said I would rely on

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.060 
view and since I said I would rely on
the<00:04:58.590> front<00:04:58.889> view<00:04:59.070> more<00:04:59.849> than<00:05:00.060> any<00:05:00.240> other<00:05:04.070> will

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
the front view more than any other will

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.040 
the front view more than any other will
adjust<00:05:05.639> the<00:05:05.849> side<00:05:06.090> view<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.690> that<00:05:07.039> and

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
adjust the side view to that and

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.600 
adjust the side view to that and
obviously<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.289> side<00:05:10.650> view<00:05:10.800> is<00:05:10.919> a<00:05:11.009> bit<00:05:11.220> too

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
obviously the side view is a bit too

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.870 
obviously the side view is a bit too
high<00:05:11.940> so<00:05:12.900> I'll<00:05:13.590> go<00:05:13.979> down<00:05:14.190> to<00:05:14.400> background

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
high so I'll go down to background

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.589 
high so I'll go down to background
images<00:05:15.240> here<00:05:15.570> and<00:05:16.220> select<00:05:17.220> this<00:05:17.580> lower<00:05:17.970> one<00:05:18.300> I

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
images here and select this lower one I

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:20.839 
images here and select this lower one I
don't<00:05:19.050> want<00:05:19.349> to<00:05:19.500> man<00:05:19.710> to<00:05:20.190> change<00:05:20.490> it<00:05:20.639> though

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
don't want to man to change it though

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:24.200 
don't want to man to change it though
I'll<00:05:21.270> add<00:05:21.630> a<00:05:21.660> new<00:05:21.960> image<00:05:22.169> and<00:05:22.729> just<00:05:23.729> copy<00:05:24.000> the

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
I'll add a new image and just copy the

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.730 
I'll add a new image and just copy the
values<00:05:24.570> here<00:05:24.840> so<00:05:24.870> it's<00:05:25.740> like<00:05:25.800> this<00:05:26.070> value<00:05:26.490> and

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
values here so it's like this value and

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.189 
values here so it's like this value and
I<00:05:28.740> feel<00:05:29.190> slightly<00:05:29.370> here<00:05:29.789> the<00:05:29.940> image<00:05:30.180> paste<00:05:30.960> it

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
I feel slightly here the image paste it

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.779 
I feel slightly here the image paste it
in<00:05:31.349> here<00:05:31.380> so<00:05:31.830> now<00:05:32.039> we<00:05:32.099> have<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.490> same

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
in here so now we have the same

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:38.870 
in here so now we have the same
reference<00:05:34.729> just<00:05:36.139> a<00:05:37.139> second<00:05:38.039> one<00:05:38.220> so<00:05:38.550> we<00:05:38.699> can

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
reference just a second one so we can

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.610 
reference just a second one so we can
let<00:05:39.030> me<00:05:39.090> delete<00:05:39.330> this<00:05:39.539> one<00:05:39.599> and<00:05:39.840> we<00:05:40.229> still<00:05:40.440> have

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
let me delete this one and we still have

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.029 
let me delete this one and we still have
our<00:05:40.650> old<00:05:41.930> while<00:05:42.930> use<00:05:43.199> I'm<00:05:43.440> just<00:05:43.620> going<00:05:43.800> to<00:05:43.860> move

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
our old while use I'm just going to move

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.760 
our old while use I'm just going to move
it<00:05:44.190> down<00:05:44.220> and<00:05:44.760> you<00:05:44.909> see<00:05:45.120> it<00:05:45.419> fits<00:05:46.110> almost

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
it down and you see it fits almost

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.909 
it down and you see it fits almost
perfectly<00:05:47.310> so<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.539> hat<00:05:48.720> stops<00:05:49.229> about<00:05:49.500> here

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
perfectly so the hat stops about here

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.339 
perfectly so the hat stops about here
the<00:05:50.280> chin<00:05:50.520> is<00:05:50.610> here<00:05:50.880> the<00:05:51.060> mouth<00:05:51.210> is<00:05:51.389> here<00:05:51.690> the

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
the chin is here the mouth is here the

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:58.510 
the chin is here the mouth is here the
nodes<00:05:52.590> here<00:05:53.039> and<00:05:53.280> the<00:05:53.669> eyes<00:05:53.789> are<00:05:54.030> good<00:05:55.400> so

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.810 

looks<00:05:59.520> like<00:05:59.820> everything<00:06:00.360> is<00:06:00.449> set<00:06:00.960> up<00:06:00.990> for<00:06:01.820> next

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
looks like everything is set up for next

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.909 
looks like everything is set up for next
part<00:06:03.030> but<00:06:03.449> I<00:06:03.509> want<00:06:03.750> to<00:06:03.870> start<00:06:04.139> to<00:06:04.560> model<00:06:04.830> the

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
part but I want to start to model the

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.620 
part but I want to start to model the
head<00:06:07.099> it<00:06:08.099> will<00:06:08.310> probably<00:06:08.820> take<00:06:09.180> more<00:06:09.449> than

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
head it will probably take more than

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.670 
head it will probably take more than
just<00:06:09.919> part<00:06:10.919> I'll<00:06:11.400> I'll<00:06:11.940> do<00:06:12.210> my<00:06:12.330> best<00:06:12.539> to<00:06:12.870> make

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
just part I'll I'll do my best to make

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.710 
just part I'll I'll do my best to make
it<00:06:13.710> fit<00:06:14.009> as<00:06:14.370> much<00:06:14.550> detail<00:06:14.880> as<00:06:14.970> possible

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
it fit as much detail as possible

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.040 
it fit as much detail as possible
and<00:06:15.949> teach<00:06:16.949> you<00:06:17.130> well<00:06:17.490> about<00:06:17.759> it<00:06:17.940> so<00:06:18.630> we<00:06:18.870> can

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
and teach you well about it so we can

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.640 
and teach you well about it so we can
delete<00:06:19.289> the<00:06:19.680> response<00:06:20.430> layer<00:06:20.729> over<00:06:21.150> here<00:06:21.650> we

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
delete the response layer over here we

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.749 
delete the response layer over here we
don't<00:06:22.830> need<00:06:23.009> it<00:06:23.190> anymore<00:06:23.430> I<00:06:25.430> guess<00:06:26.430> that's<00:06:26.639> all

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 
don't need it anymore I guess that's all

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:31.010 
don't need it anymore I guess that's all
for<00:06:26.820> its<00:06:27.180> part<00:06:29.419> finished<00:06:30.419> up<00:06:30.570> everything
