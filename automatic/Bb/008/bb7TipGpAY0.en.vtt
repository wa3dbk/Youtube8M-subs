00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
think that it just seems to be the most

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.020 
think that it just seems to be the most
stressful<00:00:31.080> thing<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.529> everything<00:00:31.740> yeah<00:00:32.309> yeah

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
stressful thing of everything yeah yeah

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.630 
stressful thing of everything yeah yeah
it's<00:00:33.210> gotta<00:00:33.390> be<00:00:33.540> times<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.530> by<00:00:34.800> 10<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.399> those

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
it's gotta be times that by 10 and those

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.490 
it's gotta be times that by 10 and those
are<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> experiences<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.780> think<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.200> both<00:00:37.230> of

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
are the experiences I think for both of

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.110 
are the experiences I think for both of
you<00:00:37.620> being<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.980> there<00:00:38.190> as<00:00:38.309> well<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.520> think<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
you being on there as well I think the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.819 
you being on there as well I think the
worst<00:00:39.329> thing<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.899> always<00:00:40.140> have<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.649> come<00:00:40.739> up

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
worst thing you always have to come up

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:41.690 
worst thing you always have to come up
with<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.340> money

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
with the money

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:51.430 
with the money
so<00:00:41.879> you're<00:00:42.000> ringing<00:00:42.360> people<00:00:42.690> basically<00:00:42.989> big

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.450 

thing<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.800> know<00:00:52.920> you've<00:00:53.129> got<00:00:53.340> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460
