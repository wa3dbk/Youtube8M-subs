and you also want to have your lines

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.570 
and you also want to have your lines
your<00:01:06.390> lines<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.200> legs<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.740> time<00:01:07.799> so

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
your lines is in your legs this time so

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.550 
your lines is in your legs this time so
use<00:01:08.760> time<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.090> come<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> line

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
use time you come in this is a line

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.609 
use time you come in this is a line
right<00:01:11.280> here<00:01:11.580> ok<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.990> same<00:01:13.200> thing<00:01:13.439> from

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
right here ok so the same thing from

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.160 
right here ok so the same thing from
here<00:01:13.950> you're<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:14.760> now<00:01:15.119> you're<00:01:15.450> gliding<00:01:15.780> with

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
here you're just now you're gliding with

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.590 
here you're just now you're gliding with
it<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.680> you're<00:01:16.860> here<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.670> make<00:01:18.299> sure<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.509> get

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
it so you're here in make sure you get

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.560 
it so you're here in make sure you get
that<00:01:18.659> line<00:01:19.049> push<00:01:19.710> off<00:01:20.150> that's<00:01:21.150> how<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.360> go<00:01:21.509> to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
that line push off that's how you go to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.600 
that line push off that's how you go to
the<00:01:21.750> next<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.680> each<00:01:22.950> time<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.310> hit<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the next one so each time you hit the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.030 
the next one so each time you hit the
floor<00:01:23.909> with<00:01:24.060> your<00:01:24.180> heel<00:01:24.600> you're<00:01:25.320> sliding<00:01:25.650> off

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
floor with your heel you're sliding off

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.859 
floor with your heel you're sliding off
with<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.400> opposite<00:01:26.759> leg<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.420> you're<00:01:27.570> here

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
with the opposite leg so you're here

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.850 
with the opposite leg so you're here
you're<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.369> down<00:01:29.840> push<00:01:31.189> down<00:01:32.570> push<00:01:33.860> down

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
you're going down push down push down

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.359 
you're going down push down push down
now<00:01:35.610> that's<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> basics<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.290> slide<00:01:37.680> so

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
now that's the basics of that slide so

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.890 
now that's the basics of that slide so
to<00:01:38.430> speed<00:01:38.970> up<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.240> little<00:01:39.270> bit<00:01:39.570> all<00:01:39.750> you're

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.679 
also it's to look away okay so if you're
sliding<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.280> way<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:54.180> want<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.420> look<00:01:54.540> away

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
sliding this way you want to look away

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.749 
sliding this way you want to look away
because<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.530> bigger<00:01:55.710> effect<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.399> your

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
because it's a bigger effect of your

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.560 
because it's a bigger effect of your
room

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
room

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.180 
room
you<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.230> going<00:01:58.440> away<00:01:58.590> from<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:58.980> direction

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
you know going away from that direction

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.980 
you know going away from that direction
so<00:01:59.880> looks<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.240> you're<00:02:00.570> not<00:02:00.720> paying

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
so looks like you're not paying

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.230 
so looks like you're not paying
attention<00:02:01.050> to<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.729> side<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.880> you're<00:02:03.090> going

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
attention to the side that you're going

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.710 
attention to the side that you're going
to<00:02:03.620> now<00:02:04.620> the<00:02:05.130> other<00:02:05.370> one<00:02:05.520> here<00:02:06.180> you're<00:02:06.570> going

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
to now the other one here you're going

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.359 
to now the other one here you're going
to<00:02:06.780> break<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.140> down<00:02:07.260> kind<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.650> like<00:02:07.740> as<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.950> robot

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
to break it down kind of like as a robot

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.790 
to break it down kind of like as a robot
so<00:02:08.580> instead<00:02:08.880> of<00:02:08.940> being<00:02:09.270> all<00:02:09.450> relaxed<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.619> want

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
so instead of being all relaxed you want

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.100 
so instead of being all relaxed you want
to<00:02:10.860> pull<00:02:11.009> your<00:02:11.160> body<00:02:11.310> up<00:02:11.430> be<00:02:12.270> tensed<00:02:12.660> up<00:02:12.840> and

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
to pull your body up be tensed up and

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.370 
to pull your body up be tensed up and
still<00:02:13.890> move<00:02:14.459> will<00:02:15.180> move<00:02:15.390> more<00:02:15.630> like<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> robot

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
still move will move more like a robot

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.190 
still move will move more like a robot
and<00:02:16.590> you're<00:02:17.190> on<00:02:17.490> offbeat<00:02:18.360> now<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:18.959> you're<00:02:19.110> not

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
and you're on offbeat now so you're not

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.050 
and you're on offbeat now so you're not
keeping<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.590> beat<00:02:19.830> you're<00:02:20.280> not<00:02:20.430> going<00:02:20.700> hit

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
keeping the beat you're not going hit

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.110 
keeping the beat you're not going hit
hit<00:02:21.540> hit<00:02:22.140> hit<00:02:22.830> now<00:02:23.459> you're<00:02:23.700> more<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:24.060> a
