00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
around where i live and i was doing some

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.920 
around where i live and i was doing some
research<00:01:36.530> online<00:01:37.040> about<00:01:37.670> what<00:01:38.240> kind<00:01:38.510> of<00:01:38.600> glue

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
research online about what kind of glue

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.860 
research online about what kind of glue
was<00:01:39.170> really<00:01:39.560> good<00:01:39.830> for<00:01:40.460> making<00:01:40.970> phone<00:01:41.390> cases

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
was really good for making phone cases

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.260 
was really good for making phone cases
like<00:01:42.050> this<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.890> make<00:01:43.190> sure<00:01:43.460> that<00:01:43.910> nothing

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
like this to make sure that nothing

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.690 
like this to make sure that nothing
falls<00:01:44.600> off<00:01:44.870> because<00:01:45.770> in<00:01:46.010> the<00:01:46.130> past<00:01:46.310> I've<00:01:46.670> used

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
falls off because in the past I've used

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.290 
falls off because in the past I've used
like<00:01:47.210> hot<00:01:47.840> glue<00:01:48.110> guns<00:01:48.410> but<00:01:49.310> I've<00:01:49.700> found<00:01:50.090> that

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
like hot glue guns but I've found that

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.380 
like hot glue guns but I've found that
the<00:01:50.960> gems<00:01:51.890> come<00:01:52.220> off<00:01:52.370> really<00:01:52.670> easily<00:01:52.940> that<00:01:53.330> way

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
the gems come off really easily that way

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.010 
the gems come off really easily that way
because<00:01:53.810> it's<00:01:54.970> basically<00:01:55.970> hot<00:01:56.510> glue<00:01:56.780> gun

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
because it's basically hot glue gun

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.220 
because it's basically hot glue gun
hardens<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:58.040> and<00:01:58.340> it<00:01:59.120> gives<00:01:59.270> it<00:01:59.450> that<00:01:59.510> texture

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
hardens it and it gives it that texture

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.790 
hardens it and it gives it that texture
so<00:02:00.500> it's<00:02:00.860> more<00:02:01.250> easier<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.790> snap<00:02:02.090> off<00:02:02.560> but<00:02:03.560> I

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
so it's more easier to snap off but I

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.499 
so it's more easier to snap off but I
actually<00:02:04.460> ended<00:02:05.030> up<00:02:05.210> buying<00:02:05.480> this<00:02:05.870> glue<00:02:06.260> it's

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
actually ended up buying this glue it's

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
orange green and that's about it when it

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.209 
orange green and that's about it when it
comes<00:04:56.749> to<00:04:56.869> the<00:04:56.990> different<00:04:57.349> things<00:04:57.619> I<00:04:57.800> add<00:04:57.949> to

00:04:58.209 --> 00:04:58.219 
comes to the different things I add to

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:02.709 
comes to the different things I add to
this<00:04:58.369> case<00:04:59.499> um<00:05:00.639> when<00:05:01.639> it<00:05:01.759> comes<00:05:01.999> to<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.360> design

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
this case um when it comes to the design

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:06.119 
this case um when it comes to the design
of<00:05:02.749> it<00:05:03.110> I<00:05:03.349> kind<00:05:03.589> of<00:05:03.770> just<00:05:04.119> played<00:05:05.119> around<00:05:05.270> and

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:06.129 
of it I kind of just played around and

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:09.429 
of it I kind of just played around and
kind<00:05:07.129> of<00:05:07.719> experimenting<00:05:08.719> to<00:05:08.839> see<00:05:08.869> where<00:05:09.319> it

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:09.439 
kind of experimenting to see where it

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.129 
kind of experimenting to see where it
looks<00:05:09.680> good<00:05:10.240> make<00:05:11.240> sure<00:05:11.270> before<00:05:11.629> you<00:05:11.899> glue

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
looks good make sure before you glue

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.769 
looks good make sure before you glue
anything<00:05:12.709> on<00:05:12.919> to<00:05:13.339> that<00:05:13.819> you<00:05:14.059> kind<00:05:14.360> of<00:05:14.509> just

00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:14.779 
anything on to that you kind of just

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:18.820 
anything on to that you kind of just
arrange<00:05:15.430> how<00:05:16.430> you<00:05:16.490> want<00:05:16.969> your<00:05:17.319> phone<00:05:18.319> to<00:05:18.379> be

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
arrange how you want your phone to be

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.730 
arrange how you want your phone to be
and<00:05:19.539> just<00:05:20.539> make<00:05:20.930> sure<00:05:21.139> everything<00:05:21.559> looks

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
and just make sure everything looks

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.619 
and just make sure everything looks
right<00:05:22.099> before<00:05:22.490> you<00:05:22.580> start<00:05:22.879> gluing<00:05:23.300> because

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:23.629 
right before you start gluing because

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:25.389 
right before you start gluing because
you<00:05:23.749> don't<00:05:23.930> want<00:05:23.990> to<00:05:24.169> glue<00:05:24.409> something<00:05:25.129> and

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:25.399 
you don't want to glue something and

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:27.790 
you don't want to glue something and
totally<00:05:26.270> regret<00:05:26.599> at<00:05:26.719> the<00:05:26.839> next<00:05:27.110> second<00:05:27.499> so

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
totally regret at the next second so

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.309 
totally regret at the next second so
just<00:05:28.759> make<00:05:28.939> sure<00:05:28.969> you<00:05:29.419> know<00:05:29.659> the<00:05:30.020> kind<00:05:30.199> of

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 
just make sure you know the kind of

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.649 
just make sure you know the kind of
setup<00:05:30.619> you<00:05:30.860> want<00:05:31.069> for<00:05:31.249> your<00:05:31.339> phone<00:05:31.669> and<00:05:32.029> once

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:32.659 
setup you want for your phone and once

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:35.579 
setup you want for your phone and once
you<00:05:32.839> have<00:05:33.020> that<00:05:33.050> go<00:05:33.589> ahead<00:05:33.830> and<00:05:33.949> start<00:05:34.189> gluing

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:35.589 
you have that go ahead and start gluing

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:39.779 
you have that go ahead and start gluing
