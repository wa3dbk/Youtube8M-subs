00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.020 
what with this mountain so that's really
cool<00:01:31.020> hopefully<00:01:31.770> as<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> good<00:01:32.460> running<00:01:32.670> speed

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
cool hopefully as a good running speed

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.520 
cool hopefully as a good running speed
as<00:01:33.210> well<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.960> able<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.290> do

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
as well so you can be able to like do

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.190 
as well so you can be able to like do
both<00:01:35.060> but<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.299> wouldn't<00:01:36.570> imagine<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:37.049> will

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
both but I wouldn't imagine it will

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.289 
both but I wouldn't imagine it will
because<00:01:37.590> people<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.790> use<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.150> in

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
because people just use it in

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.179 
because people just use it in
battlegrounds<00:01:39.869> avail<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.229> run<00:01:40.439> across<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
battlegrounds avail to run across the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.190 
battlegrounds avail to run across the
land<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.670> water<00:01:42.060> at<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.329> same<00:01:42.540> speed<00:01:42.899> so

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
land and water at the same speed so

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.480 
land and water at the same speed so
don't<00:01:43.439> think<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.740> will<00:01:43.799> quite<00:01:44.009> work<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.250> way

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
don't think it will quite work that way

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.249 
don't think it will quite work that way
but<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.270> does<00:01:45.420> look<00:01:45.450> really<00:01:45.780> cool<00:01:46.049> it's

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
but it does look really cool it's

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.450 
but it does look really cool it's
something<00:01:46.619> we're<00:01:46.829> not<00:01:46.950> really<00:01:47.130> used<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
something we're not really used to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.840 
something we're not really used to
seeing<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.180> really<00:01:48.869> unique<00:01:49.049> model<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.820> as<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
seeing it a really unique model and as a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.460 
seeing it a really unique model and as a
mount<00:01:51.119> collector<00:01:51.509> I'm<00:01:51.659> really<00:01:52.229> looking

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
mount collector I'm really looking

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.600 
mount collector I'm really looking
forward<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.770> being<00:01:52.950> able<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.100> get<00:01:53.250> my<00:01:53.369> hands<00:01:53.520> on

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
forward to being able to get my hands on

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.590 
forward to being able to get my hands on
this<00:01:53.759> mount<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.869> looks<00:01:55.049> really<00:01:55.649> Pro

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
this mount it just looks really Pro

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.969 
this mount it just looks really Pro
definitely<00:01:57.600> something<00:01:58.350> we've<00:01:58.590> never<00:01:58.829> seen

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
definitely something we've never seen

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.990 
definitely something we've never seen
before<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.850> kinda<00:02:00.299> reminds<00:02:00.600> me<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:02.000> seller

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
before it kinda reminds me of a seller

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.789
