so<00:00:08.400> how<00:00:08.970> do<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.150> avoid<00:00:09.710> protein<00:00:10.710> overload

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
so how do you avoid protein overload

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.640 
so how do you avoid protein overload
well<00:00:12.210> first<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.900> all<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.259> want<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.500> use

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
well first of all you want to use

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.039 
well first of all you want to use
protein<00:00:14.160> treatments<00:00:14.790> especially<00:00:15.179> intense

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
protein treatments especially intense

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.439 
protein treatments especially intense
protein<00:00:16.560> treatments<00:00:17.220> only<00:00:18.029> when<00:00:18.270> it's

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
protein treatments only when it's

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.700 
protein treatments only when it's
necessary<00:00:19.010> even<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.160> cases<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.640> severe<00:00:21.000> damage

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
necessary even in cases of severe damage

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.170 
necessary even in cases of severe damage
protein<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.980> not<00:00:23.070> necessarily<00:00:23.490> be<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.789> first

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
protein and not necessarily be the first

follow protein treatments with a deep

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.530 
follow protein treatments with a deep
conditioner<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.739> can<00:00:35.010> soften<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.670> hair<00:00:35.940> if

conditioner so it can soften the hair if
you're<00:00:36.870> really<00:00:37.200> not<00:00:37.410> sure<00:00:37.829> whether<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.670> protein

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
you're really not sure whether a protein

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.090 
you're really not sure whether a protein
treatment<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.629> right<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.739> want<00:00:40.980> to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
treatment is right for you you want to

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.060 
treatment is right for you you want to
consult<00:00:41.579> your<00:00:42.149> stylist<00:00:43.110> for<00:00:43.260> recommendation

consult your stylist for recommendation

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.490 
consult your stylist for recommendation
because<00:00:44.579> protein<00:00:45.420> may<00:00:45.660> not<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.289> first

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
because protein may not be the first

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.119 
because protein may not be the first
thing

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
thing

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.389 
thing
and<00:00:47.430> if<00:00:47.700> protein<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.450> needed<00:00:49.399> your

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and if protein is needed your

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.130 
and if protein is needed your
professional<00:00:51.030> stylist<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.539> gonna<00:00:51.719> know<00:00:51.930> how

professional stylist is gonna know how

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.500 
professional stylist is gonna know how
to<00:00:52.170> balance<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.760> protein<00:00:54.270> with<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
to balance that protein with the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.410 
to balance that protein with the
moisture<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.469> don't<00:00:55.770> walk<00:00:56.219> away

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
moisture so that you don't walk away

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.170 
moisture so that you don't walk away
experiencing<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> dryness<00:00:57.890> however<00:00:58.890> if<00:00:59.489> you

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
experiencing the dryness however if you

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.100 
experiencing the dryness however if you
are<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.710> DIY<00:01:01.789> person<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.480> want<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.930> do

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
are a DIY person and you just want to do

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.969 
are a DIY person and you just want to do
it<00:01:04.140> yourself

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
it yourself

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.300 
it yourself
like<00:01:05.460> my<00:01:05.670> cousin<00:01:05.850> Sharonda<00:01:06.890> you<00:01:07.890> know<00:01:08.010> it's

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
like my cousin Sharonda you know it's

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.539 
like my cousin Sharonda you know it's
okay<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.270> take<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:10.290> risk<00:01:10.530> when<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.070> you

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
okay you take that risk when you you

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.060 
okay you take that risk when you you
know<00:01:11.580> do<00:01:11.970> things<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.810> your<00:01:12.990> hair<00:01:13.320> then<00:01:14.040> you

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
know do things with your hair then you

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.890 
know do things with your hair then you
don't<00:01:14.430> have<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> professional<00:01:14.850> involved<00:01:15.810> to

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
don't have a professional involved to

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.920 
don't have a professional involved to
really<00:01:16.020> analyze<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.570> do

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
really analyze and so if you do

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.310 
really analyze and so if you do
experience<00:01:19.320> protein<00:01:20.250> overload<00:01:21.320> basically

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
experience protein overload basically

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.920 
experience protein overload basically
the<00:01:22.500> dry<00:01:22.799> stiff<00:01:23.369> feeling<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:24.299> corrected

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the dry stiff feeling can be corrected

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.859 
the dry stiff feeling can be corrected
by<00:01:25.500> adding<00:01:26.369> moisture<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> hair<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.780> is

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
by adding moisture to the hair this is

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.080 
by adding moisture to the hair this is
why<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.320> important<00:01:28.829> initially<00:01:29.820> to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
why it's so important initially to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.380 
why it's so important initially to
balance<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.869> moisture<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.280> protein<00:01:32.729> if

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
balance the moisture and the protein if

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.539 
balance the moisture and the protein if
you<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:33.840> too<00:01:34.110> much<00:01:34.290> protein<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.159> hair

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
you have too much protein on the hair

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.120 
you have too much protein on the hair
the<00:01:36.270> only<00:01:36.509> thing<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.840> can<00:01:37.079> do<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.799> add

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the only thing you can do is add

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.090 
the only thing you can do is add
moisture<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.600> moisture<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.320> more<00:01:40.680> moisture

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
moisture and moisture and more moisture

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.300 
moisture and moisture and more moisture
to<00:01:41.579> try<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.820> penetrate<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:43.110> protein<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.070> get

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
to try to penetrate that protein and get

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.450 
to try to penetrate that protein and get
to<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.759> hair<00:01:45.049> also<00:01:46.250> experience<00:01:47.250> that

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
to the hair also experience that

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.550 
to the hair also experience that
overload<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> sign<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.509> your<00:01:48.960> hair<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.200> not

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
overload is a sign that your hair is not

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.620 
overload is a sign that your hair is not
really<00:01:49.829> damaged<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.640> doesn't<00:01:51.270> need<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
really damaged and doesn't need the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.350 
really damaged and doesn't need the
additional<00:01:51.899> protein<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.909> know<00:01:54.090> leave

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
additional protein so you know leave

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.450 
additional protein so you know leave
protein<00:01:54.990> treatments<00:01:55.500> out<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.770> your<00:01:55.920> haircare
