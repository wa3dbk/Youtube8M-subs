00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
this image was shown now if you have a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.959 
this image was shown now if you have a
look<00:00:34.200> here<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.860> kind<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.340> looks<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.760> bit<00:00:35.910> like

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
look here this kind of looks a bit like

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.180 
look here this kind of looks a bit like
the<00:00:36.360> Yeti<00:00:36.600> apart<00:00:37.350> from<00:00:37.440> if<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.860> actually<00:00:38.010> look

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the Yeti apart from if you actually look

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.819 
the Yeti apart from if you actually look
at<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.520> Yeti<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:39.059> garden<00:00:39.780> warfare<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.590> not

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
at the Yeti on garden warfare it's not

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.709 
at the Yeti on garden warfare it's not
exactly<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.340> same<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.700> arms<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.329> slightly

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
exactly the same the arms a slightly

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.660 
exactly the same the arms a slightly
bigger<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.590> seems<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.860> be<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> bit<00:00:44.190> more

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
bigger and it seems to be a bit more

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.880 
bigger and it seems to be a bit more
kind<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.239> furry<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.110> what<00:00:46.200> I'm<00:00:46.320> thinking<00:00:46.770> this

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
kind of furry so what I'm thinking this

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.040 
kind of furry so what I'm thinking this
could<00:00:47.070> possibly<00:00:47.309> be<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.539> could<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
could possibly be is it could be a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.319 
could possibly be is it could be a
future<00:00:49.559> disponible<00:00:50.250> zombie<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.879> could<00:00:51.059> spawn

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
future disponible zombie you could spawn

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.970 
future disponible zombie you could spawn
this<00:00:51.539> zombie<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.590> could<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
this zombie in and it could be like a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.310 
this zombie in and it could be like a
mini<00:00:53.280> Yeti<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:54.000> maybe<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.360> yetis<00:00:54.719> kind<00:00:55.170> of

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
mini Yeti like maybe the yetis kind of

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.560 
mini Yeti like maybe the yetis kind of
kid<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.160> could<00:00:56.309> go<00:00:56.489> around<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.270> help

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
kid and it could go around and just help

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.930 
kid and it could go around and just help
kill<00:00:58.260> or<00:00:58.500> just<00:00:58.800> freeze<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.309> enemy<00:00:59.550> plants

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
kill or just freeze the enemy plants

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.029 
kill or just freeze the enemy plants
making<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.690> easier<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.350> gardens<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
making it easier on gardens and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.920 
making it easier on gardens and
graveyards<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.670> capture<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> garden<00:01:03.510> not

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
graveyards to capture the garden not

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.660 
graveyards to capture the garden not
that<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.379> old<00:01:04.559> easier<00:01:05.070> but<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:05.519> there's

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
that it is old easier but if there's

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.250 
that it is old easier but if there's
going<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.850> new<00:01:06.000> plants<00:01:06.390> brought<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.750> as<00:01:06.900> well

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
going to new plants brought in as well

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.840 
going to new plants brought in as well
then<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.799> could<00:01:07.950> maybe<00:01:08.130> balance<00:01:08.610> out<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
then it could maybe balance out the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.660 
then it could maybe balance out the
actual<00:01:09.450> game<00:01:09.479> now<00:01:10.320> another<00:01:10.710> thing<00:01:10.830> that's<00:01:11.430> one

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
actual game now another thing that's one

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.450 
actual game now another thing that's one
pointed<00:01:12.030> out<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.720> could<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.290> imp<00:01:13.799> if<00:01:14.159> I

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
pointed out is it could be a imp if I

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.070 
pointed out is it could be a imp if I
actually<00:01:14.610> show<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.090> an<00:01:15.330> image<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.960> IMP

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
actually show you an image of the IMP

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.230 
actually show you an image of the IMP
it's<00:01:16.560> got<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> eye<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> left<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.909> small

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
it's got the eye on the left is small

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.240 
it's got the eye on the left is small
and<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> right<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.650> bigger<00:01:19.979> and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and the one on the right is bigger and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.429 
and the one on the right is bigger and
that<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.000> same<00:01:21.240> case<00:01:21.509> for<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:22.049> actual

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
that is the same case for this actual

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.249 
that is the same case for this actual
Yeti<00:01:22.740> also<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.000> arms<00:01:24.360> are<00:01:24.450> quite<00:01:24.630> small<00:01:24.840> words

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
Yeti also the arms are quite small words

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.410 
Yeti also the arms are quite small words
there<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> IMP<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.369> well<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.030> what<00:01:27.150> someone

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
there on the IMP as well so what someone

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.230 
there on the IMP as well so what someone
suggested<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.530> could<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.890> either<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
suggested is this could be either a the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.330 
suggested is this could be either a the
IMP<00:01:30.450> reskin<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:31.829> good<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> different

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
IMP reskin so it's like good a different

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.310 
IMP reskin so it's like good a different
design<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.090> or<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.659> could<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.900> brand<00:01:34.200> new

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
design to it or it could be a brand new

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.830 
design to it or it could be a brand new
imp<00:01:34.590> as<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.340> new<00:01:35.520> ability<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.689> have

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
imp as in a new ability like you have

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.780 
imp as in a new ability like you have
the<00:01:36.990> long<00:01:37.200> bomb<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the long bomb and then you have the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.270 
the long bomb and then you have the
input<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.720> could<00:01:39.900> be<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.170> new<00:01:40.200> ability<00:01:40.799> for

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
input this could be a new ability for

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.280 
input this could be a new ability for
the<00:01:41.369> ulster<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.360> there<00:01:42.540> are<00:01:42.570> many<00:01:42.899> different

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
the ulster so there are many different

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.020 
the ulster so there are many different
things<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.159> yet<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.549> could<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.850> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
things that this yet it could be I

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.819 
things that this yet it could be I
honestly<00:01:45.570> don't<00:01:45.810> think<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.560> Yeti

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
honestly don't think it's just the Yeti

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.399 
honestly don't think it's just the Yeti
that's<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.549> garden<00:01:47.909> ops<00:01:48.060> right<00:01:48.630> now<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.200> it's

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
that's in garden ops right now and it's

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.389 
that's in garden ops right now and it's
going<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.680> transferred<00:01:50.040> over<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
going to be transferred over to the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.039 
going to be transferred over to the
PlayStation<00:01:51.000> edition<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.720> what<00:01:51.869> I'm<00:01:52.020> thinking

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
PlayStation edition so what I'm thinking

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.020 
PlayStation edition so what I'm thinking
that<00:01:52.619> if<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.220> being<00:01:53.579> worked<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:53.970> right

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
that if this is being worked on right

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.480 
that if this is being worked on right
now<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.720> could<00:01:55.110> come<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:55.380> when<00:01:55.740> PlayStation

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
now it could come out when PlayStation

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.580 
now it could come out when PlayStation
is<00:01:56.579> released<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.659> do<00:01:57.719> honestly<00:01:58.049> think<00:01:58.439> this

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
is released and I do honestly think this

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.050 
is released and I do honestly think this
is<00:01:58.710> going<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.189> new<00:01:59.430> spawn<00:01:59.790> herbal<00:02:00.030> zombie

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
is going to be a new spawn herbal zombie

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.230 
is going to be a new spawn herbal zombie
or<00:02:00.750> like<00:02:01.140> someone<00:02:01.500> said<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.920> reskin<00:02:02.640> or<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.850> new

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
