combination<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.860> many<00:01:11.010> things<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.490> think

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
combination of many things I think

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.789 
combination of many things I think
firstly<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.180> must<00:01:12.240> get<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:13.500> far<00:01:13.680> as
