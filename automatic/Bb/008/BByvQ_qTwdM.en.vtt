whether<00:02:13.340> it's<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.610> box<00:02:13.820> out<00:02:14.090> drill<00:02:14.450> or<00:02:14.900> just<00:02:15.140> a

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
whether it's a box out drill or just a

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.140 
whether it's a box out drill or just a
standard<00:02:15.620> shell<00:02:15.830> drill<00:02:16.130> we<00:02:16.640> are<00:02:16.790> competing

standard shell drill we are competing

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.390 
standard shell drill we are competing
and<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:18.020> think<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:18.560> starts<00:02:18.890> with<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.130> culture

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
and I think it starts with the culture

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.940 
and I think it starts with the culture
step<00:02:19.610> but<00:02:19.850> it<00:02:19.970> definitely<00:02:20.600> comes<00:02:20.930> from<00:02:21.260> kg<00:02:21.920> and

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
step but it definitely comes from kg and

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.640 
step but it definitely comes from kg and
the<00:02:22.820> other<00:02:22.940> veteran<00:02:23.360> guys<00:02:23.510> think<00:02:24.410> you'll<00:02:24.530> of

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650
