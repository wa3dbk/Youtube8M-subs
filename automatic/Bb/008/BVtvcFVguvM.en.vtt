00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.380
 we are just getting up from amt and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.570
 but you are candidates 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.090
 the new Babies Group is an audi tt 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.719
 and we'll just take a look now 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.719
 times exactly 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.230
 premier is now the press officer 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.180
 by abt johann chassis and we do 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.410
 Just pretend that we audi tt 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.180
 would not know 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.369
 what is the known water a lot 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.619
 changed i think so go right 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.939
 The cdu is not all the third 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.910
 generation is not really 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.580
 is long in the trade 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:42.020
 base is two lies two-liter turbo 230 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.370
 ps in the standard state now has 310 ps 440th 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.020
 Newton torque 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.930
 So we are with ours now 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.880
 performance enhancement for development 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.440
 both will do the tts next time 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.790
 year we come to the already has 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.050
 customer to entertain a bit 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.559
 then of course there are versions 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.450
 from abt for the gt s as well as someday 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.369
 times for the tt rs and what models 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.030
 and always want to come blues time 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.850
 all 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.890
 the basics engine that will be what I am 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.890
 also everything at least from audi im 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.570
 Of course she has a head , too 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.060
 out of the car but why go 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.810
 you like to see if Burgenland is up 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.100
 every fall big wheels deepening the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.680
 always a relevant history 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.619
 large brake system we have installed 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.880
 and of course the bigger one too 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.680
 performances somewhere against 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.340
 Act 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.409
 In addition, the design features the 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.300
 For example, we used front for example 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.660
 the essays he's all for now 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.909
 measure bid conscious red off there 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.039
 just to show the people that 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.509
 So I did that at the time 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.979
 misfires in the side but the whole 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.690
 a bit more dynamic was from 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.500
 colored grille and 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.750
 like windshield smaller karin 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.420
 mirror cover to the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.460
 Thresholds know what's going on 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.520
 look at the design elements of the adhesive 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.970
 Elements of it now have ours 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.100
 from tt-line fixed rear spoiler village 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.290
 instead of the extendable procedure 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.010
 is now dead and he stands 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.840
 stuck in the wind 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.909
 design feature as well as helpful 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.209
 of course, logically with respect to a 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:23.110
 christ and something with fast rides 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.450
 exhaust system, of course, more important 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.860
 factor not only sounded but also around 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.129
 the whole theme just neat 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.019
 action definitely sounded definitely that is 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.700
 That's why the customers have sport coupÃ© 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.060
 Of course, the wish that one 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.060
 somewhere 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.330
 that would be the most relevant to this 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.330
 car in short form
