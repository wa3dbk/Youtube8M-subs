okay<00:01:28.500> here's<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> H<00:01:29.010> tree<00:01:29.340> which<00:01:29.580> fly<00:01:30.270> pins

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
okay here's the H tree which fly pins

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.060 
okay here's the H tree which fly pins
are<00:01:30.660> right<00:01:30.870> about<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.260> same<00:01:31.380> time<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:31.860> John

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
are right about the same time as John

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.370 
are right about the same time as John
Rick<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.880> not<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.270> size<00:01:33.510> of<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> Rick<00:01:34.050> tree

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
Rick it's not the size of the Rick tree

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.550 
Rick it's not the size of the Rick tree
but<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:35.760> persimmons<00:01:36.390> are<00:01:36.540> probably<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.140> little

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
but the persimmons are probably a little

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.520 
but the persimmons are probably a little
bit<00:01:37.800> larger<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.490> would<00:01:39.450> say<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.840> one's<00:01:39.990> split

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
bit larger I would say that one's split

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.290 
bit larger I would say that one's split
a<00:01:40.560> little<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:40.920> some<00:01:41.370> of<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.520> recent<00:01:41.820> rains<00:01:42.000> I

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
ate one of these the other night and it

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.940 
ate one of these the other night and it
was<00:01:45.030> good<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.990> at<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.260> tail<00:01:46.440> end<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.770> got<00:01:46.920> a
