decker leaf out this thing is actually

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.340 
decker leaf out this thing is actually
pretty<00:00:14.610> cool<00:00:14.820> I've<00:00:15.089> never<00:00:15.120> had<00:00:15.509> any<00:00:15.929> power

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
pretty cool I've never had any power

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.890 
pretty cool I've never had any power
tools<00:00:16.680> like<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.160> so<00:00:17.400> it's<00:00:17.520> pretty<00:00:17.670> exciting

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
tools like this so it's pretty exciting

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.840 
tools like this so it's pretty exciting
but<00:00:18.900> um<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.260> got<00:00:19.410> tired<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.830> using<00:00:19.949> my<00:00:20.130> hands<00:00:20.670> and

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
but um I got tired of using my hands and

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.230 
but um I got tired of using my hands and
manually<00:00:21.840> ripping<00:00:22.140> up<00:00:22.260> my<00:00:22.410> leaves<00:00:22.760> and<00:00:23.760> what

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
manually ripping up my leaves and what

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.509 
manually ripping up my leaves and what
happens<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.779> when<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.170> don't<00:00:25.470> grind<00:00:26.250> them<00:00:26.400> up

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
happens is when you don't grind them up

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.339 
happens is when you don't grind them up
fine<00:00:26.820> enough<00:00:27.119> they<00:00:27.359> end<00:00:27.480> up<00:00:27.630> clumping<00:00:28.170> and

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
fine enough they end up clumping and

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.349 
fine enough they end up clumping and
matting<00:00:28.740> down<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.189> your<00:00:29.310> compost<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.210> it

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
matting down in your compost and it

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.089 
matting down in your compost and it
actually<00:00:30.539> makes<00:00:30.960> everything<00:00:31.619> take<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> lot

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
actually makes everything take a lot

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.729 
actually makes everything take a lot
longer<00:00:32.250> than<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.669> needs<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.320> so<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.590> is

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
longer than it needs to so this is

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.139 
longer than it needs to so this is
definitely<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.219> tool<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.760> was<00:00:35.880> interested

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
definitely a tool that I was interested

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.450 
definitely a tool that I was interested
in<00:00:36.420> getting<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.960> help<00:00:37.140> me<00:00:37.260> out<00:00:37.380> with<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.739> is

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
in getting to help me out with that is

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.190 
in getting to help me out with that is
actually<00:00:38.640> pretty<00:00:39.090> inexpensive<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.079> I'm

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
actually pretty inexpensive and I'm

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.380 
actually pretty inexpensive and I'm
really<00:00:40.469> impressed<00:00:40.829> with<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.309> overall<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.329> you

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
really impressed with it overall so you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.049 
really impressed with it overall so you
just<00:00:42.690> have<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:42.989> vacuum<00:00:43.469> bag<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:45.000> a

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
just have this vacuum bag on it and a

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.970 
just have this vacuum bag on it and a
nice<00:00:45.239> long<00:00:45.510> extension<00:00:46.140> here<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.620> has<00:00:46.710> two

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
nice long extension here and it has two

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.610 
nice long extension here and it has two
speeds<00:00:47.340> or<00:00:47.550> whatever<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.809> don't<00:00:49.289> really<00:00:49.440> have

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
speeds or whatever I don't really have

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.170 
speeds or whatever I don't really have
too<00:00:49.800> many<00:00:49.890> complaints<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.940> let<00:00:51.090> me

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
too many complaints with it so let me

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:32.569 
too many complaints with it so let me
show<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.420> how<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.690> works

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:42.120 

all<00:01:33.579> right<00:01:33.819> sad<00:01:34.149> that<00:01:34.329> look<00:01:34.509> to<00:01:34.630> you<00:01:41.130> let's

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
all right sad that look to you let's

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.100 
all right sad that look to you let's
take<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.369> look<00:01:42.579> at<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.819> quality<00:01:43.360> of<00:01:43.539> the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
take a look at the quality of the

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:52.770 
take a look at the quality of the
shredding<00:01:44.560> from<00:01:44.740> that<00:01:44.890> first<00:01:45.130> run

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.310 

so<00:01:53.320> after<00:01:53.680> one<00:01:53.920> pass<00:01:54.220> through<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:57.340> overall

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
so after one pass through the overall

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.000 
so after one pass through the overall
shred<00:01:59.320> looks<00:01:59.620> pretty<00:01:59.890> good<00:02:00.100> I<00:02:00.160> would<00:02:00.460> say

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
shred looks pretty good I would say

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.930 
shred looks pretty good I would say
maybe<00:02:03.010> a<00:02:03.130> little<00:02:03.280> bit<00:02:03.460> bigger<00:02:03.640> than<00:02:03.880> a

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
maybe a little bit bigger than a

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.850 
maybe a little bit bigger than a
confetti<00:02:04.420> I<00:02:04.660> don't<00:02:05.020> know<00:02:05.110> but<00:02:05.470> I<00:02:05.500> think<00:02:05.560> it's

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
confetti I don't know but I think it's

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.050 
confetti I don't know but I think it's
pretty<00:02:06.310> good<00:02:06.550> to<00:02:06.670> go

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
pretty good to go

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.460 
pretty good to go
but<00:02:07.240> I'm<00:02:07.360> gonna<00:02:07.510> give<00:02:07.690> it<00:02:07.720> a<00:02:07.870> second<00:02:08.289> run

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
but I'm gonna give it a second run

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.720 
but I'm gonna give it a second run
through<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:11.410> to<00:02:11.530> see<00:02:11.709> if<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:11.950> can<00:02:12.130> get<00:02:12.490> it<00:02:12.610> even

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
through just to see if I can get it even

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.290 
through just to see if I can get it even
better

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
better

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.330 
better
but<00:02:13.750> as<00:02:13.870> right<00:02:14.140> now<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.320> wouldn't<00:02:14.950> really<00:02:15.130> be

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
but as right now I wouldn't really be

00:02:15.340 --> 00:03:19.150 
but as right now I wouldn't really be
too<00:02:15.520> mad<00:02:15.700> at<00:02:15.850> this

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:28.160 

all<00:03:20.160> right<00:03:21.080> round<00:03:22.080> two

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.020 

all<00:03:28.890> right<00:03:29.130> that's<00:03:29.370> what<00:03:29.550> I'm<00:03:29.640> talking<00:03:29.970> about

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
all right that's what I'm talking about

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.580 
all right that's what I'm talking about
that<00:03:30.860> that<00:03:31.860> is<00:03:32.100> a<00:03:32.130> nice<00:03:33.080> consistent<00:03:34.080> ground-up

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
that that is a nice consistent ground-up

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.880 
that that is a nice consistent ground-up
leaf<00:03:36.770> so<00:03:37.770> I'm<00:03:38.040> gonna<00:03:38.160> say<00:03:38.459> that<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:40.620> could<00:03:40.770> run

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
leaf so I'm gonna say that you could run

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.460 
leaf so I'm gonna say that you could run
over<00:03:41.220> your<00:03:41.310> leaves<00:03:41.580> in<00:03:41.850> one<00:03:42.030> shot<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:43.110> be<00:03:43.230> good

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
over your leaves in one shot and be good

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.590 
over your leaves in one shot and be good
but<00:03:44.310> in<00:03:44.430> two<00:03:44.610> times<00:03:44.880> you're<00:03:45.240> gonna<00:03:45.330> really

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
but in two times you're gonna really

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.930 
but in two times you're gonna really
have<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:45.990> nice<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.200> ground<00:03:46.590> up<00:03:46.800> this<00:03:47.670> is<00:03:47.790> what

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
have it nice and ground up this is what

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.290 
have it nice and ground up this is what
I<00:03:47.970> would<00:03:48.120> have<00:03:48.360> ready<00:03:48.660> for<00:03:48.930> compost<00:03:49.580> so<00:03:50.580> I'm

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
I would have ready for compost so I'm

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.130 
I would have ready for compost so I'm
gonna<00:03:51.450> start<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.870> new<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:52.350> new<00:03:52.620> round<00:03:52.860> here<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.370> new

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
gonna start a new a new round here a new
