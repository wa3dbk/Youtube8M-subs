00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.490

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:43.280

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.040
 we rode with friends in the yard 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.570
 somewhere year a3 pro staff of flowers on download 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.690
 level is good slowly but all the trick 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.750
 which you were taught were hind legs then 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.850
 moving steam was easy enough 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.710
 we still street stayed in the shower then 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.420
 have to kovatelyu such tricks such as the fact that 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.660
 would learn with anyone then it was easy 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.190
 set anywhere yes height 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.900
 not scared and could leave the trip 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.590
 anywhere if you make experiences in them 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.590
 can do them everywhere 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.530
 To be honest I thought for a long time who 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.950

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.280

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.210
 This video was even 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.810
 laurel but maybe the rivers were there style she 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.690
 It was so with a pancake how to say 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.440
 external yes she was dismissive 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.869
 this is no other way to show off 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.020
 something just laid out 13 trick and damn 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.600
 I could at least try a little bit of 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.400
 when the trouble really was 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.870

 mounted derulo 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.570
 but maybe the rivers were such hits 0 they were 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.130
 qualitatively 0 with this task a number of complex 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.470
 first encountered what to choose 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.200
 vidosa in an hour I'll just be more 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.320

 Needless to say, underline the seeds 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.799
 something interesting for myself from her but 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.960

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.320
 wishing about 1 is wrong 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.810
 the main thing is riding in joy if you 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.940
 I don't want to ride this hard for you and you 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.400
 it would be better to go there girl hot 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.840
 go or go there in the cinema then i think it 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.480
 not yours but if you like it straight 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.000
 delivers only skinny it never it 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.190
 tell me about your bike 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.660
 a couple of words and so excited about 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.390
 really a couple of words excellent speed 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.820
 so I had a question here drove 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.440
 car shoot this video I thought of one 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.780
 the question involved almost remembered 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.060
 now literally a second and if you 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.440
 could set cycling trends too 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.670
 you know a lot of trend right now free 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.120
 casters camouflage that any garbage or not 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.270
 bullshit 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.950
 who would like what awning would you have set 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:53.770
 you were so popular an important question 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.720
 trend and in my opinion everything should be just 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.430
 comfortable and if you like your footprint 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.050
 here as well as not that you will be very 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.600
 nak on it is comfortable to ride comfortably 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.420
 each color is actually here 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.160
 only now such a thing went that 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.850
 used to be popular these standard 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.160
 frames now by them how much 13 5 to 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.570
 but now they are very far away 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.100
 because but few people ride 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.900
 now here's the front trind nail center 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.360
 such a comfortable riding frame right 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.600
 Beating with them is an excellent trend in my 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.090
 Straight simplified life 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.600
 shorter geometry should move forward 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.460
 I understand this is the motto of the seeds thanks for 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.020
 attention friends see you in the following 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.760

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.800
