00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
doesn't spam it he doesn't just randomly

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.610 
doesn't spam it he doesn't just randomly
just<00:05:19.350> Bob<00:05:20.240> he<00:05:21.240> hits<00:05:21.510> it<00:05:21.690> surgically<00:05:22.170> every

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
just Bob he hits it surgically every

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.430 
just Bob he hits it surgically every
single<00:05:22.890> time<00:05:23.100> look<00:05:23.760> he<00:05:24.510> hits<00:05:24.630> another<00:05:24.990> guy<00:05:25.260> he

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
single time look he hits another guy he

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.430 
single time look he hits another guy he
is<00:05:25.500> still<00:05:25.800> not<00:05:25.980> missed<00:05:26.840> another<00:05:27.840> recon<00:05:28.320> now

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
is still not missed another recon now

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.140 
is still not missed another recon now
look<00:05:28.620> this<00:05:28.890> is<00:05:28.950> the<00:05:29.190> only<00:05:29.370> shot<00:05:29.790> that<00:05:29.820> he

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
look this is the only shot that he

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.790 
look this is the only shot that he
misses<00:05:30.420> in<00:05:30.690> the<00:05:30.810> entire<00:05:31.110> clip<00:05:31.410> that's<00:05:31.650> the

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
misses in the entire clip that's the

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.280 
misses in the entire clip that's the
only<00:05:32.220> shot<00:05:32.490> that<00:05:32.520> he<00:05:32.820> misses<00:05:33.180> and<00:05:33.270> that's<00:05:33.450> what

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
only shot that he misses and that's what

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.200 
only shot that he misses and that's what
I<00:05:34.320> think<00:05:34.590> is<00:05:34.710> most<00:05:34.890> impressive<00:05:35.670> just<00:05:35.970> with

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
I think is most impressive just with

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.750 
I think is most impressive just with
iron<00:05:36.570> sights<00:05:36.840> on<00:05:37.200> an<00:05:37.500> m40<00:05:38.010> when<00:05:38.280> you<00:05:38.370> only<00:05:38.550> miss

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
iron sights on an m40 when you only miss

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.000 
iron sights on an m40 when you only miss
one<00:05:38.790> shot<00:05:39.300> out<00:05:39.480> of<00:05:39.570> how<00:05:39.720> many<00:05:39.780> that's<00:05:40.200> I<00:05:40.500> think

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
one shot out of how many that's I think

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.010 
one shot out of how many that's I think
that's<00:05:41.250> what<00:05:41.580> makes<00:05:41.790> it<00:05:41.940> so<00:05:42.240> wonderful<00:05:42.720> for<00:05:42.750> me

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
that's what makes it so wonderful for me

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.550 
that's what makes it so wonderful for me
and<00:05:43.280> coming<00:05:44.280> in<00:05:44.400> at<00:05:44.520> number<00:05:44.730> 1<00:05:45.180> we<00:05:45.540> have<00:05:45.720> X<00:05:45.960> hoho

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
and coming in at number 1 we have X hoho

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.450 
and coming in at number 1 we have X hoho
I<00:05:46.710> don't<00:05:46.830> know<00:05:46.920> if<00:05:47.010> you<00:05:47.070> want<00:05:47.190> to<00:05:47.250> call<00:05:47.370> him

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
I don't know if you want to call him

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.220 
I don't know if you want to call him
like<00:05:47.610> optic<00:05:48.060> but<00:05:48.240> he<00:05:48.390> has<00:05:48.510> a<00:05:48.540> similar<00:05:49.020> thing

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
like optic but he has a similar thing

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.490 
like optic but he has a similar thing
going<00:05:49.530> on<00:05:50.360> okay<00:05:51.360> so<00:05:51.420> he<00:05:51.900> is<00:05:51.930> very<00:05:52.050> very

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
going on okay so he is very very

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.830 
going on okay so he is very very
accurate<00:05:53.430> with<00:05:53.580> his<00:05:53.640> m40<00:05:54.180> but<00:05:54.330> I<00:05:54.510> think<00:05:54.720> that

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
accurate with his m40 but I think that

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.180 
accurate with his m40 but I think that
goes<00:05:54.990> without<00:05:55.170> saying<00:05:55.350> that<00:05:55.740> seems<00:05:56.010> pretty

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
goes without saying that seems pretty

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.740 
goes without saying that seems pretty
obvious<00:05:56.280> to<00:05:56.670> begin<00:05:57.000> with<00:05:57.150> especially<00:05:57.180> at<00:05:57.690> the

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
obvious to begin with especially at the

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.960 
obvious to begin with especially at the
beginning<00:05:57.990> this<00:05:58.080> clip<00:05:58.350> but<00:05:58.650> what<00:05:59.550> I<00:05:59.580> want<00:05:59.880> you

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
beginning this clip but what I want you

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.220 
beginning this clip but what I want you
to<00:06:00.060> pay<00:06:00.210> attention<00:06:00.270> to<00:06:00.750> is<00:06:00.960> how<00:06:00.990> he

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
to pay attention to is how he

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.950 
to pay attention to is how he
prioritizes<00:06:02.130> his<00:06:02.460> targets<00:06:02.940> you<00:06:03.540> will<00:06:03.690> notice

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
prioritizes his targets you will notice

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.050 
prioritizes his targets you will notice
he<00:06:04.290> has<00:06:04.470> a<00:06:04.500> lot<00:06:04.830> of<00:06:04.860> open<00:06:05.190> opportunities<00:06:05.910> on

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
he has a lot of open opportunities on

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.820 
he has a lot of open opportunities on
guys<00:06:06.210> that<00:06:06.480> are<00:06:06.600> not<00:06:06.810> stationary<00:06:07.200> and<00:06:07.740> his

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
guys that are not stationary and his

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.110 
guys that are not stationary and his
decides<00:06:08.190> not<00:06:08.370> to<00:06:08.430> take<00:06:08.700> him<00:06:08.820> but<00:06:08.880> a<00:06:08.940> similar

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
decides not to take him but a similar

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.970 
decides not to take him but a similar
