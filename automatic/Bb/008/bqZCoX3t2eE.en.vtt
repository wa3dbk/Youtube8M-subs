00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.660
 healthy today we will be a new video 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:16.180
 which is called a blind deck review 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.000
 and today we will have a unique deck 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.119
 which not everyone will like the design 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.590
 so let's see what it is 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.219
 us a deck called basic dark 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.369
 horse 

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:32.829
 this deck is completely designed from scratch 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.530
 the only thing that is from basic all 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.590
 this is the top inscription buy seconds which 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.899
 we see here now the seal 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.810
 from being afraid of icl and also these 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.760
 standard inscription all the rest 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:50.230
 was developed as i said from scratch 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:53.280
 here is this woman she stock and so let's 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.050
 look at the deck itself 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.750
 the first thing we see is this 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.570
 advertising card is very unusual here 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.880
 design and not even the very beginning 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.969
 normal equipment because we 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.579
 goes as we see right here is advertising 

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:12.790
 card joker send cards and at the end too 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:15.249
 there will be a joker and again this advertising card 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.429
 advertising card 1 she repeats 

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:21.700
 front of the box but there is not much 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:24.450
 important further we have a joker let's 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:29.469
 we now compare these two jokers 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.079
 because they are not identical drawings 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:36.579
 we have the same but these are the inscriptions 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:39.159
 1 one dark second red also with us 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.219
 there is such a card that's the same 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.880
 promotion card 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.789
 to make 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.509
 double bytes so here you take 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:52.060
 glue the two faces of these advertising cards 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.520
 and all you have is ready yes women card 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.399
 and now it ’s gone 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.849
 Face cards of these cards are worked out 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.490
 absolutely from scratch they are all different exactly 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:06.729
 we have the same scheme in the deck 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.890
 ultima dec for example curator where each 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.370
 card unique not repeat with 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.590
 previous here is the same but for example 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.450
 in altima d each map created 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.800
 individual designer here we have everything 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.900
 did once 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.690
 still on and we see what we have here 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.650
 goes all from one area of ​​fiction 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.240
 vampires in horror all sorts like that 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.510
 everything is completely different there is it 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.300
 love topics and all sorts of horror too 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.330
 and we look not to reconsider 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.030
 in fact it is like i said 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.310
 deck is not for everyone that is lovers 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.590
 there are few but I definitely 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.620
 I know that there are lovers in addition 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.450
 deck of very good quality in her 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.050
 super cool cover which 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:58.750
 lets make everyone so cool 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:01.450
 manipulations that is faith different tapes 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.340
 and such from scrolling so on this 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.050
 here is our shirt so we see it not us 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.950
 symmetrical because if we take 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:15.580
 Now one card will also deploy 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.920
 parade deck knitting needle well and so how would 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.130
 all that could be told about this 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.580
 I told the deck cool and cool 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.190
 design 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.910
 up to great quality but the design will do 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.400
 I did not say the same for everyone from 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.380

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.390
