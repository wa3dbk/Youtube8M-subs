00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
originally said not too bad but I'm

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.319

definitely<00:00:37.980> looking<00:00:38.340> forward<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.090> I

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
definitely looking forward to this I

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.299 
definitely looking forward to this I
think<00:00:39.390> gaming<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> Mac<00:00:40.590> will<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:40.920> great

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
think gaming on the Mac will be great

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.209 
think gaming on the Mac will be great
through<00:00:41.670> steam<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.530> think<00:00:43.530> all<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> games<00:00:44.040> will

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
through steam I think all the games will

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.639 
through steam I think all the games will
run<00:00:44.399> very<00:00:44.730> well<00:00:44.850> if<00:00:45.210> not<00:00:45.780> better<00:00:45.840> than<00:00:46.320> some<00:00:46.559> of

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
run very well if not better than some of

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.350 
run very well if not better than some of
the<00:00:46.710> windows<00:00:47.039> games<00:00:47.280> because<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.180> mac

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the windows games because the mac

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.990 
the windows games because the mac
platform<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:49.110> runs<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.559> smoothly

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
platform just runs so smoothly

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000 
platform just runs so smoothly
especially<00:00:51.000> with<00:00:51.090> some<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> new<00:00:52.010> macbook

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
especially with some of the new macbook

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.619 
especially with some of the new macbook
pros<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.879> came<00:00:54.059> out<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.360> all<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
pros that just came out and all the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.689 
pros that just came out and all the
hardware<00:00:55.050> upgrades<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.280> added<00:00:56.579> to

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
hardware upgrades that they added to

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.549 
hardware upgrades that they added to
those<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.180> nvidia<00:00:57.600> graphics<00:00:58.050> card<00:00:58.379> in

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
those like the nvidia graphics card in

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.340 
those like the nvidia graphics card in
the<00:00:58.620> i5<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.100> i7<00:00:59.420> processors<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.989> those<00:01:01.140> things

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the i5 and i7 processors so those things

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.160 
the i5 and i7 processors so those things
should<00:01:01.620> run<00:01:01.800> very<00:01:02.250> well<00:01:02.780> now<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:03.989> those<00:01:04.110> of

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.630 
in the beginning of the steam for mac
generation<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.680> guess<00:01:40.860> we'll<00:01:41.070> call<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.430> here

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
generation I guess we'll call it here

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.030 
generation I guess we'll call it here
probably<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.810> original<00:01:42.930> valve<00:01:43.500> games<00:01:43.829> like

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
probably the original valve games like

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.760 
probably the original valve games like
half-life<00:01:44.280> portal<00:01:45.270> team<00:01:46.020> fortress<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
half-life portal team fortress and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.190 
half-life portal team fortress and
probably<00:01:47.070> all<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.430> sequels<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.200> serious

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
probably all the sequels and serious

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.310 
probably all the sequels and serious
connections<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.920> those<00:01:50.070> games<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:51.990> think

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
connections of those games so I think

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.380 
connections of those games so I think
those<00:01:52.470> games<00:01:52.710> will<00:01:52.920> run<00:01:53.250> very<00:01:53.520> well<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.970> they

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
those games will run very well and they

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.730 
those games will run very well and they
said<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.869> doesn't<00:01:55.170> matter<00:01:55.320> if<00:01:55.439> you're<00:01:55.590> on

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
said that it doesn't matter if you're on

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.280 
said that it doesn't matter if you're on
a<00:01:55.770> Mac<00:01:55.860> or<00:01:56.280> Windows<00:01:56.399> machine<00:01:57.299> you'll<00:01:58.110> be

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
a Mac or Windows machine you'll be

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.289 
a Mac or Windows machine you'll be
playing<00:01:58.619> all<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> same<00:01:59.369> server<00:01:59.700> everyone

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
playing all on the same server everyone

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.859 
playing all on the same server everyone
will<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> same<00:02:00.960> server<00:02:01.500> playing<00:02:01.950> games

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
will be on the same server playing games

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.330 
will be on the same server playing games
together<00:02:03.869> going<00:02:04.320> against<00:02:04.710> one<00:02:04.860> another<00:02:04.890> there

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
together going against one another there

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.950 
together going against one another there
won't<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> separate<00:02:06.390> mac<00:02:06.540> server<00:02:06.810> a

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
won't be like a separate mac server a

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.930 
won't be like a separate mac server a
separate<00:02:07.500> windows<00:02:07.799> server<00:02:08.069> everyone<00:02:08.819> will<00:02:08.910> be

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
separate windows server everyone will be

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.390 
separate windows server everyone will be
playing<00:02:09.420> together<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:10.979> think<00:02:11.129> that's

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
playing together so I think that's

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.220 
playing together so I think that's
pretty<00:02:11.550> much<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.790> for<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.450> steam

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
pretty much it for the steam

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.449 
pretty much it for the steam
