00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.330 
just a better card so like that guy's
just<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.390> 334<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.079> don't<00:01:37.259> play<00:01:37.380> 3344<00:01:38.189> and

just a 334 I don't play 3344 and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.179 
just a 334 I don't play 3344 and
construct<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.329> get<00:01:39.600> down<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.890> know

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
construct it so I get down so I know

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.440 
construct it so I get down so I know
that<00:01:41.220> cards<00:01:41.610> go<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> cards<00:01:41.970> good<00:01:42.030> limited

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
that cards go the cards good limited

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.700 
that cards go the cards good limited
yeah<00:01:42.659> obviously<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.380> not<00:01:43.470> going<00:01:43.590> to

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
yeah obviously but it's not going to

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.190 
yeah obviously but it's not going to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.109 
construct it over the other cars just
you<00:01:46.350> want<00:01:46.530> right<00:01:46.649> yeah<00:01:47.159> there<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.520> shriek<00:01:47.909> ma

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
you want right yeah there is shriek ma

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.109 
you want right yeah there is shriek ma
that<00:01:48.689> cards<00:01:48.979> obviously<00:01:49.979> right<00:01:50.250> what<00:01:51.000> do<00:01:51.060> you

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
that cards obviously right what do you

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.480 
that cards obviously right what do you
think<00:01:51.240> about<00:01:51.270> evoke<00:01:51.780> as<00:01:51.990> an<00:01:52.110> ability<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:53.310> in

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
think about evoke as an ability just in

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.520 
think about evoke as an ability just in
general<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:54.060> think<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.420> good<00:01:54.540> it's

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
general I think it's good it's

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.840 
general I think it's good it's
different<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.190> really<00:01:56.400> good<00:01:56.490> limited

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
different it's a really good limited

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.710 
different it's a really good limited
ability<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.180> might<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> really<00:01:57.600> good

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
ability it might be a really good

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.230 
ability it might be a really good
construction<00:01:58.049> ability<00:01:58.229> yeah<00:01:59.119> what<00:02:00.119> do<00:02:00.210> you

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
construction ability yeah what do you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.410 
construction ability yeah what do you
think<00:02:00.390> about<00:02:00.420> fallow<00:02:01.110> sage<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.770> 220<00:02:02.430> okay

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
think about fallow sage the 220 okay

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.620 
think about fallow sage the 220 okay
that<00:02:03.600> guy<00:02:03.750> um<00:02:04.790> there's<00:02:05.790> possibilities

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
that guy um there's possibilities

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.650 
that guy um there's possibilities
they're<00:02:07.140> like<00:02:07.650> average<00:02:08.429> limited<00:02:09.000> cart<00:02:09.240> goes

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
they're like average limited cart goes

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.140 
they're like average limited cart goes
to<00:02:09.810> juice<00:02:09.990> before<00:02:10.140> aren't<00:02:10.530> really<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.740> good

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
to juice before aren't really that good

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.010 
to juice before aren't really that good
there<00:02:12.150> are<00:02:12.239> definitely<00:02:12.510> possibly<00:02:12.840> has<00:02:12.930> been

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
there are definitely possibly has been

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.080 
there are definitely possibly has been
constructed<00:02:13.340> it's<00:02:14.340> kind<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:14.580> too<00:02:14.700> slow<00:02:14.880> for<00:02:14.910> an

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
constructed it's kind of too slow for an

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.390 
constructed it's kind of too slow for an
opposition<00:02:15.510> deck<00:02:15.630> for<00:02:15.810> extended<00:02:16.400> like

there's<00:02:17.610> like<00:02:17.819> applications<00:02:18.569> with<00:02:19.020> like<00:02:19.489> Oppo

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
there's like applications with like Oppo

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.960 
there's like applications with like Oppo
glare<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.470> like<00:02:22.470> record<00:02:23.100> following<00:02:23.340> using<00:02:23.850> it

today was to qualify on reading because

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.300 
today was to qualify on reading because
I<00:02:44.160> was<00:02:44.280> 20<00:02:44.550> 24<00:02:44.910> going<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.569> I<00:02:46.410> just<00:02:46.470> like<00:02:47.069> I

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
I was 20 24 going in and I just like I

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.680 
I was 20 24 going in and I just like I
don't<00:02:47.580> Li<00:02:47.670> not<00:02:47.790> calculate<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.330> reading<00:02:48.540> math

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
don't Li not calculate the reading math

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.620 
don't Li not calculate the reading math
but<00:02:49.200> i<00:02:49.230> was<00:02:49.800> thinking<00:02:50.040> like<00:02:50.069> 4050<00:02:50.970> drop<00:02:51.450> might

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
but i was thinking like 4050 drop might

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.820 
but i was thinking like 4050 drop might
be<00:02:51.720> good<00:02:51.900> but<00:02:52.110> then<00:02:52.200> i<00:02:52.260> remembered<00:02:52.560> i<00:02:52.650> won

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
be good but then i remembered i won

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.009 
be good but then i remembered i won
tunics<00:02:53.250> going<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.489> turn<00:02:53.610> on<00:02:53.730> at<00:02:53.819> gencon<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.989> i

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
tunics going to turn on at gencon so i

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.720 
tunics going to turn on at gencon so i
may<00:02:55.319> have<00:02:55.410> no<00:02:55.560> 16<00:02:55.980> k<00:02:56.130> but<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.340> may<00:02:56.459> have<00:02:56.550> lost

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
may have no 16 k but I may have lost

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.750 
may have no 16 k but I may have lost
like<00:02:57.000> 20<00:02:57.300> points<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.470> puts<00:02:58.860> me<00:02:58.950> like<00:02:59.130> 2004

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
like 20 points so that puts me like 2004

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.580 
like 20 points so that puts me like 2004
so<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.000> really<00:03:00.329> can't<00:03:00.510> 50<00:03:00.720> chopping<00:03:01.200> board<00:03:01.380> us

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
so I really can't 50 chopping board us
