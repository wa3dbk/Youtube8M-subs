00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
amumu will be quite behind so amumu

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.609

vain and myself what I'm showing now is

vain and myself what I'm showing now is
our<00:02:31.310> team<00:02:31.550> holding<00:02:31.970> tight<00:02:32.480> grip<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.020> making

our team holding tight grip and making

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.230 
our team holding tight grip and making

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240

sure we use our advantage to snowball
even<00:02:35.540> harder<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.530> just<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.430> recap<00:02:37.610> my<00:02:38.120> simple

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
even harder so just to recap my simple

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.840 
even harder so just to recap my simple
early<00:02:39.020> game<00:02:39.230> calls<00:02:39.530> allowed<00:02:40.130> us<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.400> solidify

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
early game calls allowed us to solidify

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.230 
early game calls allowed us to solidify
a<00:02:41.120> lead<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.720> ultimately<00:02:42.530> when<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.010> game

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
a lead and ultimately when the game

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.940 
a lead and ultimately when the game
Shyvana<00:02:44.240> held<00:02:44.600> her<00:02:44.840> own<00:02:45.020> against<00:02:45.500> atrox

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
Shyvana held her own against atrox

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.400 
Shyvana held her own against atrox
because<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.460> XP<00:02:46.790> advantage<00:02:47.240> amumu<00:02:48.050> was<00:02:48.230> so

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
because of the XP advantage amumu was so

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.020 
because of the XP advantage amumu was so
behind<00:02:48.710> he<00:02:48.980> couldn't<00:02:49.310> exert<00:02:49.760> as<00:02:49.970> much

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.110 
behind he couldn't exert as much
pressure<00:02:50.570> as<00:02:50.780> nautilus<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.940> malzahar<00:02:52.940> was

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
pressure as nautilus and malzahar was

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:07.750 
pressure as nautilus and malzahar was
denied<00:02:53.390> heart<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:53.990> he<00:02:54.110> couldn't<00:02:54.410> be<00:02:54.560> impactful

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.729 

now<00:03:08.420> let's<00:03:08.659> take<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.870> look<00:03:08.959> at<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.260> second<00:03:09.590> game
