episode the whole missing sister angle

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.849 
episode the whole missing sister angle
was<00:01:39.389> a<00:01:39.420> little<00:01:39.749> baffling<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.109> me<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.289> think<00:01:40.439> to

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859 
was a little baffling to me I think to

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.129 
was a little baffling to me I think to
you<00:01:40.950> as<00:01:41.039> well<00:01:41.069> because<00:01:41.880> as<00:01:42.600> far<00:01:42.869> as<00:01:42.959> I<00:01:43.049> can

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:43.139 
you as well because as far as I can

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:45.219 
you as well because as far as I can
gather<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.560> was<00:01:43.889> the<00:01:44.100> reason<00:01:44.249> that<00:01:44.490> these

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
gather that was the reason that these

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.840 
gather that was the reason that these
you<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.319> aliens<00:01:46.499> had<00:01:46.889> somehow<00:01:47.279> latched<00:01:47.609> onto

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
you know aliens had somehow latched onto

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.550 
you know aliens had somehow latched onto
this<00:01:48.060> girl<00:01:48.929> and<00:01:49.109> that's<00:01:49.259> why<00:01:49.350> they<00:01:49.439> could

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
this girl and that's why they could

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.539 
this girl and that's why they could
communicate<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:49.950> her<00:01:50.100> because<00:01:50.249> of<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
communicate with her because of the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.519 
communicate with her because of the
trauma<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.909> her<00:01:51.029> losing<00:01:51.179> her<00:01:51.359> sister<00:01:51.569> and<00:01:51.929> at

trauma of her losing her sister and at

trauma of her losing her sister and at

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the end her sister REE materializes and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.629 
the end her sister REE materializes and
was<00:01:55.259> she<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.469> that<00:01:55.560> Bush<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.889> whole<00:01:56.009> time<00:01:56.189> yeah

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
appeared very briefly the only thing

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.250 
appeared very briefly the only thing
that<00:02:11.820> was<00:02:11.940> sort<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.240> holding<00:02:12.660> together<00:02:12.870> was

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
that was sort of holding together was

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.550 
that was sort of holding together was
wit<00:02:13.800> was<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.310> stuff

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
wit was the stuff

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.740 
wit was the stuff
down<00:02:14.739> with<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.069> trees<00:02:15.340> yeah<00:02:15.760> which<00:02:16.569> were

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
down with the trees yeah which were

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.210 
down with the trees yeah which were
obviously<00:02:17.020> wasn't<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.470> particularly

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
obviously wasn't a particularly

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.589 
obviously wasn't a particularly
interesting<00:02:18.550> i<00:02:18.819> don't<00:02:19.060> think<00:02:19.270> there's<00:02:19.569> that

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
interesting i don't think there's that

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.940 
interesting i don't think there's that
thing<00:02:19.690> they<00:02:19.930> say<00:02:20.080> in<00:02:20.200> kids<00:02:20.440> films<00:02:20.620> in<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.830> like

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
thing they say in kids films in it like

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.949 
thing they say in kids films in it like
contains<00:02:21.370> my<00:02:21.580> old<00:02:21.730> peril<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.239> apparel<00:02:22.780> here

contains my old peril and apparel here

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.410 
contains my old peril and apparel here
was<00:02:23.140> very<00:02:23.410> very<00:02:23.709> mild<00:02:24.069> because<00:02:24.489> there's<00:02:25.090> no

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
was very very mild because there's no

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.140 
was very very mild because there's no
villain<00:02:26.349> as<00:02:26.530> such<00:02:26.800> there's<00:02:27.370> no<00:02:27.520> monster<00:02:27.730> it

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
villain as such there's no monster it

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.960 
villain as such there's no monster it
lacks<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.450> monster<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.989> only<00:02:29.970> recognizable

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
lacks a monster the only recognizable

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.820 
lacks a monster the only recognizable
threat<00:02:31.239> we<00:02:31.360> have<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:32.290> wolves<00:02:32.620> very

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
threat we have is the wolves very

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.770 
threat we have is the wolves very
briefly<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.430> then<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:34.030> tiger<00:02:34.390> even<00:02:34.660> more

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
briefly and then the tiger even more

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.870 
briefly and then the tiger even more
briefly<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.349> even<00:02:36.040> more<00:02:36.220> i<00:02:36.250> think<00:02:36.459> you<00:02:36.849> know

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
briefly and even more i think you know

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.430 
briefly and even more i think you know
an<00:02:37.060> even<00:02:37.269> bigger<00:02:37.420> problem<00:02:37.569> with<00:02:37.870> this<00:02:37.959> is<00:02:38.140> that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
an even bigger problem with this is that

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.630 
an even bigger problem with this is that
if<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:38.709> think<00:02:38.860> about<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.160> doctor<00:02:39.430> doesn't

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
if you think about it the doctor doesn't

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.839 
if you think about it the doctor doesn't
do<00:02:39.880> anything<00:02:40.239> he<00:02:41.019> sort<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.290> he<00:02:41.590> turns<00:02:41.890> up<00:02:42.160> kind

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
do anything he sort of he turns up kind

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.400 
do anything he sort of he turns up kind
of<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:43.209> know<00:02:43.239> runs<00:02:43.510> around<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.930> bit<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.200> then

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
of you know runs around a bit and then

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.710 
of you know runs around a bit and then
essentially<00:02:44.709> wait<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.340> he<00:02:46.090> doesn't<00:02:46.330> save<00:02:46.600> the

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
essentially wait and he doesn't save the

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.539 
essentially wait and he doesn't save the
day<00:02:46.870> he's<00:02:47.440> not<00:02:47.560> even<00:02:47.860> he's<00:02:48.069> not<00:02:48.190> in<00:02:48.280> any<00:02:48.370> way

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
day he's not even he's not in any way

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:49.710 
day he's not even he's not in any way
instrumental<00:02:48.819> to<00:02:49.150> saving<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.450> day<00:02:49.569> he<00:02:49.660> just

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
instrumental to saving the day he just

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.720 
instrumental to saving the day he just
kind<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:49.959> watches<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:51.280> world<00:02:51.430> saves

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
kind of watches and the world saves

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.030 
kind of watches and the world saves
itself<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.330> so<00:02:53.019> you<00:02:53.470> know<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.769> episode

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
itself and so you know the episode

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.460 
itself and so you know the episode
really<00:02:54.400> lacks<00:02:54.640> any<00:02:54.880> kind<00:02:55.209> of<00:02:55.330> purpose<00:02:56.200> any

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
really lacks any kind of purpose any

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.039 
really lacks any kind of purpose any
kind<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.769> driving<00:02:57.400> force<00:02:57.670> it's<00:02:58.030> just<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.569> bit<00:02:59.019> of

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
kind of driving force it's just a bit of

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.870 
kind of driving force it's just a bit of
a<00:02:59.140> pointless<00:02:59.380> run<00:02:59.620> around<00:02:59.860> that<00:03:00.160> resolves

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
a pointless run around that resolves

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.630 
a pointless run around that resolves
itself<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.420> that's<00:03:02.140> always<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.010> big<00:03:03.220> story

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
itself and that's always a big story

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.160 
itself and that's always a big story
issue<00:03:03.849> when<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.450> story<00:03:04.690> would<00:03:04.780> have<00:03:04.840> unfolded

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
issue when the story would have unfolded

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.780 
issue when the story would have unfolded
exactly<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:05.890> same<00:03:06.069> way<00:03:06.190> if<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.489> doctor

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
exactly the same way if the doctor

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.460 
exactly the same way if the doctor
wasn't<00:03:06.940> there<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.900> that's<00:03:07.959> very<00:03:08.290> much<00:03:08.410> the

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
wasn't there and that's very much the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.930 
wasn't there and that's very much the
case<00:03:08.620> within<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.130> forest<00:03:09.340> of<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.489> night<00:03:09.549> the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
case within the forest of the night the

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.180 
case within the forest of the night the
dynamic<00:03:10.420> between<00:03:10.450> Danny<00:03:11.319> and<00:03:11.440> Clara<00:03:11.860> it<00:03:12.069> was

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
dynamic between Danny and Clara it was

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.220 
dynamic between Danny and Clara it was
quite<00:03:12.459> sweet<00:03:12.940> this<00:03:13.180> week<00:03:13.420> or<00:03:13.660> you've<00:03:13.810> been<00:03:13.840> set

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
quite sweet this week or you've been set

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.170 
quite sweet this week or you've been set
up<00:03:14.470> for<00:03:14.590> decisions<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.370> think<00:03:15.580> where<00:03:15.910> Clara

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
up for decisions you think where Clara

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.759 
up for decisions you think where Clara
is<00:03:16.299> going<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.540> have<00:03:16.630> to<00:03:16.780> choose<00:03:16.989> between<00:03:17.290> Danny

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
is going to have to choose between Danny

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.280 
is going to have to choose between Danny
and<00:03:17.860> her<00:03:18.790> adventures<00:03:19.209> in<00:03:19.329> space<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:19.900> think

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
and her adventures in space I think

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.259 
and her adventures in space I think
we're<00:03:20.500> heading<00:03:20.620> for<00:03:20.799> something<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.850> little

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
we're heading for something a little

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.720 
we're heading for something a little
more<00:03:22.540> complex<00:03:22.959> than<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.769> know<00:03:23.859> just<00:03:23.890> all<00:03:24.370> who

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
more complex than you know just all who

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.410 
more complex than you know just all who
do<00:03:24.850> I<00:03:24.940> love<00:03:25.209> more<00:03:25.269> than<00:03:25.630> Annie<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.560> think<00:03:26.799> if

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
do I love more than Annie and I think if

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.120 
do I love more than Annie and I think if
Clara<00:03:28.420> leaves<00:03:29.049> if<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:29.560> when<00:03:29.680> she<00:03:29.799> does<00:03:29.920> leave

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
Clara leaves if and when she does leave

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.520 
Clara leaves if and when she does leave
it<00:03:30.340> will<00:03:30.459> be<00:03:30.489> an<00:03:31.269> outside<00:03:31.780> influence<00:03:32.140> that

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
it will be an outside influence that

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.930 
it will be an outside influence that
causes<00:03:32.859> that<00:03:32.950> rather<00:03:33.160> than<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.430> relationship

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
causes that rather than a relationship

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.000 
causes that rather than a relationship
with<00:03:34.030> Danny<00:03:34.209> and<00:03:34.480> kind<00:03:35.290> of<00:03:35.350> leads<00:03:35.530> on<00:03:35.650> so<00:03:35.829> one

Coleman<00:04:15.579> certainly<00:04:16.090> is<00:04:16.209> so<00:04:16.450> my<00:04:16.959> instinct<00:04:17.500> is

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
special and my instinct is also that
