windows seven that really isn't
optimized<00:01:35.369> for<00:01:35.520> touch<00:01:35.820> i'm<00:01:36.060> sure<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.360> was<00:01:36.479> a

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
optimized for touch i'm sure it was a

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.039 
optimized for touch i'm sure it was a
move<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:38.040> know<00:01:38.130> directed<00:01:38.549> by<00:01:38.670> costs<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:39.479> for

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
move you know directed by costs but for

this type of 1st gen product for archos
i<00:01:42.210> think<00:01:42.960> they<00:01:43.110> should<00:01:43.290> have<00:01:43.380> taken<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.920> few

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
i think they should have taken a few

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.310 
i think they should have taken a few
more<00:01:44.880> steps<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.240> get<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.540> right<00:01:45.780> i<00:01:46.049> would<00:01:46.200> have

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
more steps to get it right i would have

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.580 
more steps to get it right i would have
rather<00:01:46.350> had<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:47.159> better<00:01:47.909> product<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.720> let's

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
rather had a better product but let's

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.870 
rather had a better product but let's
take<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> look<00:01:49.950> at<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.070> product<00:01:50.399> itself<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
take a look at the product itself and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.969 
take a look at the product itself and
then<00:01:50.970> i'll<00:01:51.060> give<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.329> some<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.720> my

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
then i'll give you some of my

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.870 
then i'll give you some of my
impressions<00:01:52.979> as<00:01:53.100> opposed<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> device<00:01:53.850> like

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
impressions as opposed to a device like

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.359 
impressions as opposed to a device like
the<00:01:54.180> ipad<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.020> see<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.950> top<00:01:56.130> right

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the ipad as you can see on the top right

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.889 
the ipad as you can see on the top right
you<00:01:56.520> have<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.670> speaker<00:01:57.119> as<00:01:57.270> well<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.689> top

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
you have a speaker as well as on the top

the<00:03:29.470> removable<00:03:29.830> battery<00:03:30.520> that<00:03:30.670> I<00:03:30.730> mentioned

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
the removable battery that I mentioned

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.560 
the removable battery that I mentioned
there<00:03:31.660> is<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:32.140> stylus<00:03:32.800> which<00:03:33.100> again<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:34.150> reason

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
there is the stylus which again a reason

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.949 
there is the stylus which again a reason
that<00:03:34.600> it's<00:03:34.870> there<00:03:35.110> I<00:03:35.320> do<00:03:35.590> like<00:03:35.890> that<00:03:35.950> the

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
that it's there I do like that the

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.940 
that it's there I do like that the
kickstand<00:03:37.959> has<00:03:38.140> two<00:03:38.290> different<00:03:38.440> levels

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
kickstand has two different levels

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.400

because<00:03:39.850> it<00:03:40.570> gives<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:40.959> different<00:03:41.080> viewing

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
because it gives you different viewing

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.810 
because it gives you different viewing
angles<00:03:41.860> which<00:03:42.040> in<00:03:42.190> certain<00:03:42.340> instances

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
angles which in certain instances

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.460 
angles which in certain instances
whether<00:03:43.480> you're<00:03:43.660> in<00:03:43.780> putting<00:03:44.020> on<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.200> device

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
different angles for comfort I'm showing

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.400 
different angles for comfort I'm showing
you<00:03:48.730> here<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:49.150> port<00:03:49.390> replicator<00:03:49.870> jack<00:03:50.200> is

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
you here the port replicator jack is

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.080 
you here the port replicator jack is
right<00:03:50.590> there<00:03:50.860> and<00:03:51.190> then<00:03:51.430> on<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.640> right<00:03:51.820> side

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
we go so you can get a speed test to see

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.180 
we go so you can get a speed test to see
how<00:05:54.180> quickly<00:05:54.419> see<00:05:55.229> I<00:05:55.260> can't<00:05:55.590> start<00:05:55.860> scrolling

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
I might have to you know use the scroll

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:00.080 
I might have to you know use the scroll
bar<00:05:58.500> which<00:05:58.680> I<00:05:58.770> really<00:05:59.010> don't<00:05:59.190> want<00:05:59.340> to<00:05:59.430> do<00:05:59.550> so

bar which I really don't want to do so

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.420 
bar which I really don't want to do so
there<00:06:00.240> it<00:06:00.330> finally<00:06:00.510> starts<00:06:00.960> to<00:06:01.020> scroll<00:06:01.430> it's

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.610 
there it finally starts to scroll it's
just<00:06:02.669> painful<00:06:02.850> to<00:06:03.060> use<00:06:03.270> and<00:06:03.600> it's<00:06:03.900> that's<00:06:04.410> the

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
just painful to use and it's that's the

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.430 
just painful to use and it's that's the

it's a great concept the execution is
just<00:06:27.150> poor<00:06:27.660> and<00:06:27.900> the<00:06:28.289> touchscreen<00:06:29.389> even

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:30.389 
just poor and the touchscreen even

responding<00:06:32.520> the<00:06:32.640> touchscreen<00:06:33.180> is<00:06:33.450> the<00:06:33.870> best

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
responding the touchscreen is the best

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.910 
responding the touchscreen is the best
example<00:06:34.560> of<00:06:34.710> that<00:06:34.770> poor<00:06:35.190> execution

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.400 
iPad they simply hit the wall but you
know<00:06:55.000> in<00:06:55.180> the<00:06:55.210> future<00:06:55.450> I<00:06:55.870> look<00:06:56.110> forward<00:06:56.320> to

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:56.410 
know in the future I look forward to

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.750 
know in the future I look forward to
something<00:06:56.560> like<00:06:56.800> this<00:06:56.950> it<00:06:57.160> does<00:06:57.400> you<00:06:57.670> know

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:57.760 
something like this it does you know

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.300 
something like this it does you know
doesn't<00:06:58.510> have<00:06:58.720> to<00:06:58.960> have<00:06:59.680> the<00:06:59.890> same<00:07:00.070> feature

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.310 
doesn't have to have the same feature

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.220 
doesn't have to have the same feature
set<00:07:00.640> but<00:07:00.970> obviously<00:07:01.270> a<00:07:01.630> little<00:07:01.780> more<00:07:01.990> power

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:02.230 
set but obviously a little more power

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.260 
set but obviously a little more power
would<00:07:02.560> be<00:07:02.680> nice<00:07:02.890> it<00:07:03.160> is<00:07:03.700> missing<00:07:04.150> an

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270 
would be nice it is missing an

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.760 
would be nice it is missing an
accelerometer<00:07:04.630> I<00:07:05.050> don't<00:07:05.290> really<00:07:05.380> care<00:07:05.740> about

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770 
accelerometer I don't really care about

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.210 
accelerometer I don't really care about
that<00:07:06.010> again<00:07:07.000> that's<00:07:07.300> up<00:07:07.510> to<00:07:07.660> the<00:07:07.750> user<00:07:08.220> but

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:09.220 
that again that's up to the user but

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.880 
that again that's up to the user but
figured<00:07:09.970> it<00:07:10.060> was<00:07:10.180> worth<00:07:10.210> a<00:07:10.540> mention<00:07:10.750> but<00:07:11.080> last

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:11.890

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.130
