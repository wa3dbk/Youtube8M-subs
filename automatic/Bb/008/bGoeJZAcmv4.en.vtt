00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 And there goes everything well here is the paladin and 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.450
 I'm bringing a channel today 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.700
 character of a game that receives the same 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.519
 name is moderate tone for everyone 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.370
 crash bandicoot the story of the game is 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.949
 next bandicoot crash enamel with 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.230
 mouse a fox, I do not know what it was 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.260
 modified by neo cortec scientists 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.910
 meters of the river to be the animal and 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.430
 help you master the world 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.220
 but in these games everything happens then 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.439
 wrong price and he's nice tat 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.960
 anyway today the video will be to clarify 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.360
 some doubts that many people have 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.370
 with regard to the crash connection with 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.550
 sony 's daycare was launched by naughty 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.250
 dog in 1996 and mansou four different 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.480
 games for the playstation and three 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.629
 they were not even the one I'm showing 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.440
 now background to pass phase né and another 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.020
 of racing 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.090
 the question is what nintendo and the following 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.840
 main competitor of sony at the time 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.460
 They had that sony did not have mascots 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.460
 known worldwide 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.960
 romario by nintendo and sonic 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.939
 on the blind side 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.400
 the game of the ace was a huge success 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.659
 on the console it has nice graphics a 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.240
 very cool setting 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.130
 makes a story a lot of fun 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.909
 Funny character in very dear 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.790
 for all 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.470
 So what happened clear started to 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.720
 call the sony mascot crash is 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.299
 obvious that he was up and in the culture of 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.880
 time for a video game to have respect 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.920
 needed mascot imagine still 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.710
 he had the status or is it the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.750
 microsoft mascot or alan wake 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.060
 finally let's get back the focus of the video 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.460
 when the generation changed the crash no longer 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.490
 belong more to naughty dog ​​and yes to 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.899
 activision and it was my young people that everything 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.670
 it went by water 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.649
 besides making the game not be 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.360
 most exclusive to sony they have changed 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.130
 completely the game 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.740
 the company has a lot of good 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.899
 hands the playstation games was great 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.360
 dear so profitable for the company 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.799
 but not for those who continue because it is 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.810
 launch the games as the dynamic 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.100
 different from the first ones and did not please 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.899
 to the tones of the series 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.610
 even with the failure of the playstation 2 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.069
 Activism still had the brilliant 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.780
 wonderful idea of ​​not launching any 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.620
 freight for generation that ended in 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.560
 last year no zin 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.510
 ada neca nothing at all ok and each answer 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.519
 of the video title question 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.069
 Good if you noticed me in any 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.860
 moment you spoke of actions you have not 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.629
 has the rights to the crash so do not 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.549
 it would make sense to put a 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.340
 character of another company with a 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.230
 of your nintendo video game does not 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.760
 no sense and that's why it's wrong 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.879
 say that the character mascot 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.610
 dream he was not is not and after that never 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.989
 will be a mascot of the good sony slaughter who 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.510
 end of last year to sony finally 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.730
 bought the franchise rights of the 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.519
 character and more like the activision 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.890
 never officially confirmed it is difficult 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.810
 to tell if it's true or not what I can 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.640
 say it's a shame a franchise so 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.280
 good and promising ended up going to the streets 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.829
 wrong and ended up forgetting the fans 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.290
 It's a real shame I really like it. 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.670
 much of the crash is a pity that all this 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.280
 happened this way 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.209
 Good, that's it, guys. Thank you so much. 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.280
