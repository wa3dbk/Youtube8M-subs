00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.330 
going to do first is open up Dreamweaver
and<00:00:15.830> then<00:00:16.040> click<00:00:16.400> HTML<00:00:16.610> under<00:00:17.270> our<00:00:17.689> create<00:00:18.020> new

so after you have that just go into
design<00:00:21.770> view<00:00:21.800> and<00:00:22.220> then<00:00:22.939> go<00:00:23.090> to<00:00:23.150> insert<00:00:23.600> and

we're<00:00:27.619> just<00:00:27.710> going<00:00:27.890> to<00:00:27.949> leave<00:00:28.070> it<00:00:28.189> on<00:00:28.279> at

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
we're just going to leave it on at

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.130 
we're just going to leave it on at
insertion<00:00:28.939> point<00:00:29.390> and<00:00:29.539> then<00:00:29.630> you<00:00:29.810> just<00:00:30.050> leave

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
insertion point and then you just leave

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.290 
insertion point and then you just leave
these<00:00:30.289> other<00:00:30.500> things<00:00:30.680> blank<00:00:31.070> and<00:00:31.939> just<00:00:32.150> click

actually just going to copy this because

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.840 
actually just going to copy this because
we<00:00:40.430> can<00:00:40.580> use<00:00:40.699> that<00:00:40.820> later<00:00:41.059> for<00:00:41.360> actual<00:00:42.290> writing

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
we can use that later for actual writing

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.030 
we can use that later for actual writing

is<00:02:07.580> actually<00:02:08.090> start<00:02:08.659> typing<00:02:09.080> inside<00:02:09.409> of<00:02:09.560> this

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
is actually start typing inside of this

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.610 
is actually start typing inside of this
so<00:02:10.720> what<00:02:11.720> we're<00:02:11.810> going<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:11.989> need<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.200> do<00:02:12.379> is

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
so what we're going to need to do is

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.710 
so what we're going to need to do is
just<00:02:13.190> pretty<00:02:13.610> much<00:02:13.700> type<00:02:14.090> whatever<00:02:14.390> we<00:02:14.480> want

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
just pretty much type whatever we want

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.050 
just pretty much type whatever we want
you<00:02:15.050> can<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.350> have<00:02:15.800> copied<00:02:16.310> this<00:02:16.430> from<00:02:16.610> earlier

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
you can I have copied this from earlier

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.710 
you can I have copied this from earlier
so<00:02:17.600> I<00:02:17.660> can<00:02:18.080> just<00:02:18.230> paste

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
so I can just paste

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.630 
so I can just paste
this<00:02:18.810> over<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.170> over<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.350> over<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.740> over<00:02:19.800> but

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
this over and over and over and over but

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.010 
this over and over and over and over but
you're<00:02:21.180> going<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.330> see<00:02:21.540> we're<00:02:21.690> going<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.870> have

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
you're going to see we're going to have

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.500 
you're going to see we're going to have
a<00:02:22.050> problem<00:02:22.560> here<00:02:22.830> because<00:02:23.760> here's<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.270> end<00:02:24.390> of

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
a problem here because here's the end of

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.510 
a problem here because here's the end of
the<00:02:24.570> div<00:02:24.750> tag<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.320> then<00:02:25.560> it's<00:02:26.070> just<00:02:26.370> going<00:02:26.460> to

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
the div tag and then it's just going to

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.640 
the div tag and then it's just going to
go<00:02:26.730> out<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.620> if<00:02:28.620> we<00:02:29.520> file<00:02:30.380> save<00:02:31.380> as

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
go out of it and if we file save as

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.430 
go out of it and if we file save as
we're<00:02:32.520> going<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:34.430> save<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.580> scrollbar<00:02:36.440> I'll

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
we're going to save it a scrollbar I'll

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.500 
we're going to save it a scrollbar I'll
save<00:02:37.710> it<00:02:37.740> on<00:02:37.890> my<00:02:37.920> desktop<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.640> now<00:02:39.240> we<00:02:39.300> can

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
save it on my desktop and now we can

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.320 
save it on my desktop and now we can
preview<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.900> in<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.020> browser<00:02:41.090> I'm<00:02:42.090> going<00:02:42.240> to

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
preview it in the browser I'm going to

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.840 
preview it in the browser I'm going to
say<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.900> just<00:02:42.930> gets<00:02:43.260> super<00:02:44.100> crazy<00:02:44.430> here

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
say that it just gets super crazy here

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.300 
say that it just gets super crazy here
and<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.810> goes<00:02:45.990> past<00:02:46.290> like<00:02:46.800> here's<00:02:47.100> where<00:02:47.250> our

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
and it goes past like here's where our

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.150 
and it goes past like here's where our
div<00:02:47.790> stopped<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.780> just<00:02:48.960> keeps<00:02:49.170> going<00:02:49.380> so

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
div stopped and it just keeps going so

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.890 
div stopped and it just keeps going so
that's<00:02:50.610> not<00:02:50.760> going<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.000> work<00:02:51.120> for<00:02:51.360> us<00:02:51.480> what

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
that's not going to work for us what

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.990 
that's not going to work for us what
we're<00:02:51.990> going<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.140> do<00:02:52.380> is<00:02:52.680> we're<00:02:53.190> going<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.340> make

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
we're going to do is we're going to make

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.760 
we're going to do is we're going to make
that<00:02:54.180> scrollbar<00:02:54.720> by<00:02:54.959> going<00:02:55.230> back<00:02:55.410> into<00:02:55.620> the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
that scrollbar by going back into the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.300 
that scrollbar by going back into the
CSS<00:02:56.660> style<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.380> double<00:02:58.680> click<00:02:58.709> again<00:02:59.130> and

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
CSS style and so double click again and

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.270 
CSS style and so double click again and
then<00:02:59.850> go<00:02:59.970> down<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.330> positioning<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.110> the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
then go down to positioning in the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.620 
then go down to positioning in the
category<00:03:02.280> type<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:02.730> then<00:03:03.240> we're<00:03:03.330> going<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.540> go

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
category type and then we're going to go

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.470 
category type and then we're going to go
to<00:03:03.690> this<00:03:03.900> tab<00:03:04.110> here<00:03:04.410> which<00:03:04.560> says<00:03:04.740> overflow

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
to this tab here which says overflow

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.940 
to this tab here which says overflow
scroll<00:03:06.480> down<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.470> can<00:03:07.500> either<00:03:07.709> go<00:03:07.920> to

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
scroll down and you can either go to

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.400 
scroll down and you can either go to
scroll<00:03:08.459> which<00:03:09.090> always<00:03:09.360> shows<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.750> scrollbar

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
scroll which always shows a scrollbar

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.680 
scroll which always shows a scrollbar
or<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.980> can<00:03:11.100> go<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.250> Auto<00:03:11.520> which<00:03:11.970> adds<00:03:12.240> it<00:03:12.570> if

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
or you can go to Auto which adds it if

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.080 
or you can go to Auto which adds it if
it<00:03:12.810> needs<00:03:13.050> it<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.590> like<00:03:13.800> Auto<00:03:14.070> because<00:03:14.520> that

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
it needs it and I like Auto because that

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.250 
it needs it and I like Auto because that
way<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.240> don't<00:03:15.360> only<00:03:15.630> always<00:03:15.840> have<00:03:16.230> a

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
way you don't only always have a

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.830 
way you don't only always have a
scrollbar<00:03:16.800> there<00:03:17.130> like<00:03:17.730> it'll<00:03:18.000> be<00:03:18.300> kind<00:03:18.750> of

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
scrollbar there like it'll be kind of

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.630 
scrollbar there like it'll be kind of
blanked<00:03:19.200> out<00:03:19.320> if<00:03:19.590> if<00:03:19.890> you<00:03:20.070> don't<00:03:20.160> need<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.490> but

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
blanked out if if you don't need it but

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.520 
blanked out if if you don't need it but
I<00:03:20.790> just<00:03:20.910> don't<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:21.780> I'm<00:03:22.230> just<00:03:22.410> going

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
I just don't like that so I'm just going

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.110 
I just don't like that so I'm just going
to<00:03:22.560> click<00:03:22.739> on<00:03:22.830> Auto<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.430> I'm<00:03:23.730> going<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:23.940> click

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
to click on Auto and I'm going to click

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.250 
to click on Auto and I'm going to click
apply<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:25.430> apply<00:03:26.430> again<00:03:26.700> so<00:03:27.480> now<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:27.810> can<00:03:28.050> see

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
apply and apply again so now you can see

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.520 
apply and apply again so now you can see
that<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.800> has<00:03:29.150> taken<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.870> doesn't<00:03:31.260> show

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
that it has taken and it doesn't show

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.150 
that it has taken and it doesn't show
that<00:03:31.820> extra<00:03:32.820> type<00:03:33.060> down<00:03:33.330> there<00:03:33.540> anymore<00:03:33.750> and

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
that extra type down there anymore and

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.620 
that extra type down there anymore and
if<00:03:35.160> we<00:03:35.489> do<00:03:35.700> file<00:03:36.120> save<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:37.100> then<00:03:38.100> we<00:03:38.760> preview

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
if we do file save and then we preview

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.390 
if we do file save and then we preview
that<00:03:39.750> again<00:03:42.019> now<00:03:43.019> you<00:03:43.080> see<00:03:43.620> there<00:03:43.890> is<00:03:44.130> a

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
that again now you see there is a

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.729 
that again now you see there is a
scrollbar<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.420> we<00:03:45.959> can<00:03:46.140> scroll<00:03:46.410> through<00:03:46.470> our

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
scrollbar and we can scroll through our

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.520 
scrollbar and we can scroll through our
content<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:48.840> nice<00:03:49.019> thing<00:03:49.200> about<00:03:49.230> these

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
content and the nice thing about these

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.350 
content and the nice thing about these
div<00:03:49.769> tags<00:03:50.100> is<00:03:50.340> with<00:03:50.610> all<00:03:50.790> this<00:03:50.940> you<00:03:51.180> can

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
div tags is with all this you can

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.660 
div tags is with all this you can
actually<00:03:52.350> come<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:52.769> add<00:03:52.890> different<00:03:53.370> things

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
actually come and add different things

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.210 
actually come and add different things
to<00:03:54.090> this<00:03:54.440> I'll<00:03:55.440> probably<00:03:55.500> make<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.799> different

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
to this I'll probably make a different

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.770 
to this I'll probably make a different
tutorial<00:03:56.640> in<00:03:56.730> this<00:03:56.850> but<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.090> can<00:03:57.360> add
