a water-resistant device one of the ways
Samsung's<00:00:17.820> achieve<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.539> by<00:00:18.570> using<00:00:18.690> this

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
Samsung's achieve this is by using this

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.490 
Samsung's achieve this is by using this
flap<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.670> cover<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.000> micro<00:00:21.270> USB<00:00:21.330> 3.0<00:00:22.109> port<00:00:22.380> at

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
flap to cover the micro USB 3.0 port at

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.980 
flap to cover the micro USB 3.0 port at
the<00:00:22.560> bottom<00:00:22.859> but<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.850> after<00:00:24.630> prolonged

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
the bottom but that after prolonged

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.410 
the bottom but that after prolonged
usage<00:00:25.230> does<00:00:25.769> cause<00:00:26.099> issues<00:00:26.609> for<00:00:26.640> some<00:00:27.029> people

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
usage does cause issues for some people

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.929 
usage does cause issues for some people
so<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:28.470> might<00:00:28.650> either<00:00:28.800> come<00:00:29.099> off<00:00:29.340> all<00:00:29.670> by

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
so it might either come off all by

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.370 
so it might either come off all by
itself<00:00:30.330> or<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:31.529> might<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.070> refuse<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.820> lock

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
itself or it might just refuse to lock

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.350 
itself or it might just refuse to lock
so<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:34.920> case<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.760> video<00:00:36.059> I'm<00:00:36.180> going

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
in this video so basically just open the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.990 
in this video so basically just open the
galaxy<00:01:03.449> turn<00:01:03.899> your<00:01:04.080> phone<00:01:04.290> off

galaxy turn your phone off

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.410 
galaxy turn your phone off
open<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> back<00:01:06.270> panel<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:08.090> you<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.270> this

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
open the back panel and you see this

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.859 
open the back panel and you see this
okay<00:01:10.080> let<00:01:10.200> me<00:01:10.260> zoom<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:14.240> you<00:01:15.240> see<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.509> little

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
okay let me zoom in you see this little

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.469 
okay let me zoom in you see this little
screw<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:16.520> seemingly<00:01:17.520> Samsung<00:01:18.210> also

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
screw here seemingly Samsung also

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.810 
screw here seemingly Samsung also
realizes<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.560> might<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> problem

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
realizes that this might be a problem

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.289 
realizes that this might be a problem
and<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.210> guess<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:22.049> why<00:01:22.229> they've<00:01:22.439> left<00:01:23.299> this

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
and I guess that's why they've left this

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.499 
and I guess that's why they've left this
part<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:24.810> easy<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.820> replace

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
part really easy to replace

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.490 
part really easy to replace
so<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:28.740> remove<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> screw<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:30.350> pair<00:01:31.350> of

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
so you just remove the screw a pair of

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.429 
so you just remove the screw a pair of
tweezers<00:01:31.740> will<00:01:32.280> come<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.759> handy<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:34.170> now<00:01:34.290> I've

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439
