00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.790 
much about the overpowered guns type 95
it's<00:03:44.970> about<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.240> two<00:03:45.480> three<00:03:45.810> bullet<00:03:46.110> kill<00:03:46.320> it's

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
it's about a two three bullet kill it's

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.710 
it's about a two three bullet kill it's
a<00:03:46.950> three<00:03:47.160> round<00:03:47.280> burst<00:03:47.610> okay<00:03:48.300> i<00:03:48.330> admit<00:03:48.420> the

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
a three round burst okay i admit the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.970 
a three round burst okay i admit the
rapid<00:03:49.020> fire<00:03:49.170> was<00:03:49.350> kind<00:03:49.530> of<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.650> dumb<00:03:49.800> idea

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
rapid fire was kind of a dumb idea

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.320 
rapid fire was kind of a dumb idea
because<00:03:50.280> it's<00:03:50.400> gonna<00:03:50.520> get<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.730> lot<00:03:50.820> more<00:03:50.880> recoil

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
because it's gonna get a lot more recoil

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.380 
because it's gonna get a lot more recoil
than<00:03:51.450> that<00:03:51.720> but<00:03:51.980> it's<00:03:52.980> not<00:03:53.150> overpowered<00:03:54.150> I

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
than that but it's not overpowered I

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.140 
than that but it's not overpowered I
mean<00:03:54.840> if<00:03:54.990> even<00:03:55.890> if<00:03:55.950> it<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.130> overpowered<00:03:56.670> use<00:03:56.970> it

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
mean if even if it is overpowered use it

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.970 
mean if even if it is overpowered use it
who<00:03:57.240> cares<00:03:57.420> everyone<00:03:57.660> else<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:58.380> mean<00:03:58.890> that's

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
who cares everyone else is I mean that's

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.000 
who cares everyone else is I mean that's
just<00:03:59.190> my<00:03:59.310> view<00:03:59.370> on<00:03:59.730> it<00:04:00.200> but<00:04:01.550> L<00:04:02.550> also<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.030> fmg9<00:04:03.330> I

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
just my view on it but L also the fmg9 I

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.530 
just my view on it but L also the fmg9 I
don't<00:04:05.010> really<00:04:05.100> use<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.490> fmg9<00:04:05.760> s<00:04:06.209> unless<00:04:06.360> I'm

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
don't really use the fmg9 s unless I'm

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.470 
don't really use the fmg9 s unless I'm
mastering<00:04:06.990> them<00:04:07.170> to<00:04:07.260> get<00:04:07.350> XP<00:04:07.770> but<00:04:08.480> effigy

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
mastering them to get XP but effigy

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.120 
mastering them to get XP but effigy
they're<00:04:09.750> not<00:04:09.840> overpowering<00:04:10.410> in<00:04:10.500> my<00:04:10.650> opinion<00:04:10.920> I

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130

mean my opinion the scorpions are much

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.070 
mean my opinion the scorpions are much
more<00:04:13.350> over<00:04:13.590> power<00:04:13.800> than<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.130> fmg9<00:04:14.400> s<00:04:15.080> also

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
more over power than the fmg9 s also

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.570 
more over power than the fmg9 s also
