 the other is fashion and for our 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.880

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.070
 fashion with sonia paradise hello seniors 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.140

 four pins it's also the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.899
 founder of the ethical factory of 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.149
 montreal with a company with which 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.390
 you value responsible consumption 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.950
 and to counter the overconsumption 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.590
 also yes and a type of man the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.570
 do it yourself workshops and it's this 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.610
 we're going to do a little bit in the studio 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.899
 long season with you and for the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.969
 first chronicle we'll do some 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.510
 very simple thing but quite 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.610
 practical and pretty a crazy their eternal 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.739
 from a t-shirt with your hand 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.079
 so the goal is really to go 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.180
 progressively today the project 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.760
 we're going to be doing only requires 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.799
 cut things and then already time 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.280
 we have a variety of different 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.340
 wounds have no seam that the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.920
 chisel so in the background I have a t-shirt 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.659
 here and then we'll just come 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.070
 draw a line with the rule for good 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.720
 understand what we are putting on today 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.820
 can see the inspiration board and 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.250
 yeah that's a scarf the scarf 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.630
 eternal so-called trinity that 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.850
 found in several stores 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.890
 for about 30 35 dollars is what we 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.210
 proposes it costs only nothing is a 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.130
 t shirt that is maybe that maybe 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.490
 was used to paint t shirt 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.110
 pajamas do not wear anymore so we go 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.970
 and we start as you say parts 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.590
 min roots to remove a flexion 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.869
 of a reality is that the fabric that is 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.200
 used to make a shirt that's 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.939
 a johnny in jersey it's a type of 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.369
 knit and then it's a son who 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.229
 get tangled up on him even what that 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.810
 means that when comes the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.829
 cut unlike a fabric like the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.560
 jeans and this one will not be washing 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.660
 so we can easily cut his credit to 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.590
 do another finish 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.480
 it's super convenient here it's 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.750
 simply come and take my pretty dreams 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.690
 we must absolutely remove the small 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.370
 finish and we've already done the same 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.300
 thing with the audition yes here I place 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.550
 my rule 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.090
 I have just come plotted a line 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.500
 right and then here a chalk that gets 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.510
 finds to be a creek is a little 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.820
 similar to the racial textures in the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.560
 so do people know the house if you 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.910
 want to use a soap that has become 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.540
 a little bit even if you can 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.370
 only to do here as my vest 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.020
 there is a little not know it would not 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.450
 not been very effective it works 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.480
 less well that they have its color well 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.250
 see where is so here I created like 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.050
 of different colors in the writing in 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.820
 general a large variety of flowers 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.970
 because a wide variety of colors 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:09.910
 of tissues that exist so we take the 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.910
 create we will come to draw our line 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:19.780
 not very far urbr niche we want 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:22.239
 only come to remove the part that 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.340
 is folded in the bottom because seen 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.599
 that you 're folding back it can create a 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.549
 different texture 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.010
 it will create heaviness so you 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.829
 will not fall as well as if we leave 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.870
 on the coffee wine with the chisel is this 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.639
 that we need a specific chisel to 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.180
 sewing can be used anywhere 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.329
 who the name we need a chisel 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.419
 specific 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:46.450
 I have a confession simon 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.519
 scissors or a place where I do not 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.090
 should not shop around as 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:57.909
 responsible consumer but I froze 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:59.199
 but the legs that people but 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.299
 what are the features this 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:03.250
 that's 1.6 in the long and that's what is 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.409
 important is that it's a chisel that 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.030
 we only use for this weed have 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.150
 other members of the family did not 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.519
 do not use it for anything else it's 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.730
 that if one uses a chisel fabric 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.680
 cut paper we will come disguised the 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.630
 blade and then when we go back to the 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.949
 chisel to come cut said you are well 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.930
 there the end will be more sharp so 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.120
 we go with a lot of frustration 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.669
 and then people only have people have 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.580
 really tending to rats I'm going 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.470
 take this isolate and that well so I 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.020
 will be put aside assured that all the 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.570
 world knows that this little chisel this one 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.250
 we do not touch them exclusively for 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.539
 clothes at their level one cuts 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.000
 yes so I'm going to do a little 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:49.240
 incision so it's only to take 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 the chisel and then come to make a 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.039
 small notch ok perfect and we can 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.409
 see what it gives here now have 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.690
 a scarf precisely with his incision 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:01.539
 we see very well what it gives no 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.699
 sewing it does not get rid of a wash 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.389
 it stays like that so it's a little bit 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.759
 we want to create 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.830
 yeah then a jersey peculiarity 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.690
 is that when the shots are 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.449
 really tend to roll on itself 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:18.099
 so that adds a lot of textures so 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:19.930
 here if I'm just shooting we see 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.729
 we see immediately the texture that it 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.600
 done so we can easily use it 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.400
 at different places 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.150
 at the season behind we saw as 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.780
 easily on the back of different tee 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.240
 shirt 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.580
 here is the wonder of its details 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.220
 hands around the collar so we can 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.960
 really come create more texture to 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.300
 places that clothes are 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.000
 as rather ordinary so it's 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.620
 several variants question to embellish 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.740
 our clothes and we repeat his team 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.590
 like that yes it remains the same how 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.720
 tongue when servicing the wash the 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.390
 title does not grow more so 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.980
 it's going to stay like that and here good 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.830
 the goal is to become completely 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:04.670
 removed size and the whole line here from 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:07.970
 come off the bottom part and we're going 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:11.480
 come draw a line like just in 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:15.020
 under their mount to be able to 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:18.050
 preserve as the scarf is what a 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.120
 measure to be respected for the size of 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.470
 incisions where we go there only name is 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.960
 really lounge at the end according to the 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.790
 statistics one seeks to create but 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.790
 this one in the bottom there are different 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:31.040
 examples of which an example of the 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.960
 cord that can be created from 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.160
 of a tee shirt as such but 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.680
 how are we doing to give 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.480
 to give this effect two bodies of 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.460
 marine elite corps like this one in 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:45.050
 reality what am I going to come to do a year 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:48.050
 size about 2.5 cm wide on 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:51.290
 the whole width of the top and then when 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.370
 I want as you would go well the fabric is going 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.710
 to roll on itself 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.060
 it's going to get bigger so at this point 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.100
 there we can make a necklace that will be 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.720
 really slower than in power 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.180
 can turn twice if you want 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.460
 hence the name textile collar because it 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.340
 is like that yeah so we can see 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.780
 the facts what it does is a very 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.330
 pretty so that's really pulling 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:14.870
 like that what give this effect their 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:17.570
 scarf yes we will see also during the 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.830
 next capsule the potential in the 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.450
 bottom of which is still that we can 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.490
 use it as a decorative tool 

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.780
 as by accessories and punish 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.220
 do something else then the week 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.930
 next we're going to do cordelette 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.750
 department sorting on clothes 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:32.060
 management of the golden era a little and we're going 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.590
 do it all in the studio and it'll be 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.340
 simple for people to do it at the 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.800
 house also 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.889
 yeah it cost me nothing 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.509
 absolutely nothing yeah people can 

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:42.849
