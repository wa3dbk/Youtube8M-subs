the<00:00:34.290> feature<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:36.300> idea<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.230> could

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the feature is the idea that we could

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.729 
the feature is the idea that we could
play<00:00:38.390> MIDI<00:00:39.390> backing<00:00:39.930> tracks<00:00:40.230> through<00:00:40.710> the

generator<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.629> I've<00:00:52.410> done<00:00:53.070> an<00:00:53.219> easy<00:00:53.520> google

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.869 
generator so I've done an easy google
search<00:00:54.239> went<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> web<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.879> downloaded

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
search went to the web and downloaded

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.069 
search went to the web and downloaded

a accessory cable USB to MIDI cable I've

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.010 
a accessory cable USB to MIDI cable I've
plugged<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:07.670> not<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.119> 16<00:01:09.659> or<00:01:09.810> so

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
plugged in and not just the 16 or so

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.380 
plugged in and not just the 16 or so
loops<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.530> are<00:01:10.590> onboard<00:01:10.799> now<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:12.180> play

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
loops that are onboard now I can play

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.649 
loops that are onboard now I can play
any<00:01:13.070> MIDI<00:01:14.070> backing<00:01:14.549> tracks<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.030> downloaded<00:01:15.479> to

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
any MIDI backing tracks I downloaded to

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:37.080 
any MIDI backing tracks I downloaded to
my<00:01:15.689> laptop<00:01:16.020> here<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.159> for<00:01:17.369> instance<00:01:18.409> plug<00:01:19.409> in

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.720 

so<00:01:38.090> that's<00:01:38.300> just<00:01:38.770> scratching<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:40.190> surface<00:01:40.370> of

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
so that's just scratching the surface of

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.870 
so that's just scratching the surface of
some<00:01:40.940> of<00:01:41.030> these<00:01:41.090> possibilities<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:42.880> once

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
some of these possibilities the once

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.260 
some of these possibilities the once
again<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.210> fender<00:01:44.570> G<00:01:44.810> deck<00:01:45.050> series<00:01:45.980> is<00:01:46.850> unique

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
again the fender G deck series is unique

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.930 
again the fender G deck series is unique
because<00:01:47.480> they<00:01:47.840> have<00:01:48.110> a<00:01:48.440> MIDI<00:01:49.040> tone<00:01:49.400> generator

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
because they have a MIDI tone generator

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.790 
because they have a MIDI tone generator
on<00:01:50.150> board<00:01:50.510> so<00:01:50.870> that<00:01:51.550> allows<00:01:52.550> us<00:01:53.620> once<00:01:54.620> again

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
on board so that allows us once again

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.250 
on board so that allows us once again
almost<00:01:55.550> an<00:01:55.700> infinite<00:01:55.880> supply<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.750> these<00:01:56.930> MIDI

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
perhaps an overlooked feature that you

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.389 
perhaps an overlooked feature that you
definitely<00:02:07.640> want<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:08.000> take<00:02:08.149> advantage<00:02:08.690> of<00:02:08.869> and
