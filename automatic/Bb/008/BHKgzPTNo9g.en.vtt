 this call with this tweet us 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.160
 we will be able to hide our honor and 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.169
 also show it when we are inside 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.309
 of an application or something for example 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.349
 now you can see I am here in my 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.690
 try and I have it hidden and if I what 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.220
 I want to simply put a marty gesture 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.130
 bayton and you can see that I already have two 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.260
 then it looks very good now this one me 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.300
 I go for example here to facebook 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.850
 and I'm going to make my gesture that I have 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.890
 slide to the right I do and can they 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.419
 see a month to the doc in this case I 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.910
 it comes out a bit round because I have the 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.100
 tweet for the dow called rock there 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.170
 can you see then here we 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.320
 we can do it without any problem and 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.670
 hide our logo then that's 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.379
 well we can put some 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.280
 applications that we do not want anyone 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.530
 see or that we 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.969
 we take it as very personal and therefore not 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.649
 we want nobody to have them there 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.809
 with this tweet we are going to be able to 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.050
 hide our dock without problems this 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.940
 2 this tweet is called the word 38 and then 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.769
 has a price of one dollar since 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.300
 we installed talking a quick restart 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.680
 and in settings the cowboys where 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.360
 basically it's going to be a bit of 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.490
 customization here you can see the 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.530
 world and also to select how what 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.540
 we want to activate on home screen here 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.600
 we put the says the new normal 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.310
 of hardware this animation and 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.679
 animation when it's over and the car is 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.450
 good to see, it's basically like 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:26.509
 how we want it to come out when we open 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.740
 of the animation put it in reverse tour 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.940
 and also in inau jaime 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.800
 we have the same thing to put a little 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.750
 the design so that it does not come out after 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.179
 the way we want and here 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.830
 in activation moment we are going to 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.170
 select the activation method as 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.399
 we want our water to appear 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.990
 here in this case you can see what 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.240
 we do anywhere to be able 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:54.909
 appear or disappear our 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.909
 and see you in the next video
