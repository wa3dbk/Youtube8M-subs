00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
cover of the comic book you can see a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.560 
cover of the comic book you can see a
Spartan<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> vehicle<00:00:38.520> which<00:00:38.910> looks<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.450> be

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
Spartan on a vehicle which looks to be

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.750

like<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.780> booster<00:00:40.290> frame<00:00:40.530> from<00:00:40.890> halo<00:00:41.219> legends

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
like a booster frame from halo legends

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.670

so<00:00:42.149> maybe<00:00:42.390> there's<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.750> possibility<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.469> we

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
so maybe there's a possibility that we

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.250 
so maybe there's a possibility that we
can<00:00:43.920> fly<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.520> halo<00:00:45.000> 5<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.600> again<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.110> would

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
can fly this in halo 5 but again I would

00:00:46.260 --> 00:01:05.680 
can fly this in halo 5 but again I would
not<00:00:46.500> get<00:00:46.710> your<00:00:46.860> hopes<00:00:46.920> up<00:00:47.280> 5<00:00:47.899> 4<00:00:48.920> 3

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
new vehicles in matchmaking I think that

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.370 
new vehicles in matchmaking I think that
would<00:01:44.940> be<00:01:45.090> awesome<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:45.660> it<00:01:45.840> happened<00:01:46.260> all

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
would be awesome if it happened all

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.530 
would be awesome if it happened all
those<00:01:46.740> since<00:01:47.190> is<00:01:47.370> more<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.790> spacecraft<00:01:48.060> I'm

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
those since is more of a spacecraft I'm

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.240 
those since is more of a spacecraft I'm
not<00:01:48.810> sure<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.290> would<00:01:49.440> work<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.890> multiplayer

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
not sure if it would work in multiplayer

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.910 
not sure if it would work in multiplayer
