00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.180 
the king so I didn't really test those
out<00:02:21.769> so<00:02:22.840> in<00:02:23.840> which<00:02:24.019> are<00:02:24.230> below<00:02:24.530> again<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:28.040> it

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
out so in which are below again and it

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.640 
out so in which are below again and it
will<00:02:28.280> race<00:02:32.769> then<00:02:33.769> where's<00:02:34.130> my<00:02:34.280> perfect<00:02:34.790> I

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
will race then where's my perfect I

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.089 
will race then where's my perfect I
guess<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.769> depends<00:02:37.190> on<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.640> e<00:02:38.920> depends<00:02:39.920> on<00:02:40.010> the

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
guess it depends on the e depends on the

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:47.110 
guess it depends on the e depends on the
field<00:02:43.780> but<00:02:44.799> plant<00:02:45.799> has<00:02:46.400> like<00:02:46.549> a<00:02:46.579> lot<00:02:46.820> of<00:02:46.940> feel

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
field but plant has like a lot of feel

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.940 
field but plant has like a lot of feel
so<00:02:47.390> as<00:02:48.079> you<00:02:48.230> can<00:02:48.350> see<00:02:48.560> it's<00:02:49.250> just<00:02:49.310> got<00:02:49.579> first

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
so as you can see it's just got first

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.479 
so as you can see it's just got first
and<00:02:51.950> on<00:02:52.519> here<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.780> think<00:02:54.019> it<00:02:54.109> tells<00:02:54.260> you<00:02:54.530> like

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
and on here I think it tells you like

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.770 
and on here I think it tells you like
what<00:02:55.790> up<00:02:57.579> will<00:02:58.579> feel<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:59.030> guys<00:02:59.180> will<00:02:59.750> be

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
what up will feel you guys will be

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.390 
what up will feel you guys will be
running<00:03:00.170> on<00:03:00.319> whatever<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:01.040> I<00:03:01.100> guess<00:03:01.250> you

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
running on whatever so I guess you

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.800 
running on whatever so I guess you
triple<00:03:01.819> your<00:03:01.910> money<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.269> you<00:03:02.390> would<00:03:02.600> first

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
triple your money of you would first

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.699 
triple your money of you would first
place<00:03:03.109> you<00:03:03.440> have<00:03:03.829> a<00:03:03.920> chance<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.819> Tripoli<00:03:05.299> money

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.760 

so<00:03:09.709> this<00:03:09.920> right<00:03:10.989> oster<00:03:11.989> metals

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
so this right oster metals

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.940 
so this right oster metals
so<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:14.670> wrong<00:03:16.280> travel<00:03:17.280> Logan<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:18.860> don't<00:03:19.860> know
