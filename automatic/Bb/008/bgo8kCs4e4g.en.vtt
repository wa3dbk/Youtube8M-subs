00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
together these balls attached and a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.110 
together these balls attached and a
center<00:00:41.129> hub<00:00:42.050> I'm<00:00:43.050> going<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.789> show<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.820> how

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
center hub I'm going to show you how

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.810 
center hub I'm going to show you how
that<00:00:45.180> works<00:00:45.620> if<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.829> have<00:00:46.920> two<00:00:47.160> people<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.610> set

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
that works if you have two people to set

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.709 
that works if you have two people to set
that<00:00:47.969> up<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.390> definitely<00:00:48.570> easier<00:00:50.360> as<00:00:51.360> far<00:00:51.390> as

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
that up it's definitely easier as far as

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.950 
that up it's definitely easier as far as
holding<00:00:52.050> out<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.260> polls<00:00:52.500> goes<00:00:52.829> but<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.460> you

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
holding out the polls goes but if you

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.600 
holding out the polls goes but if you
are<00:00:54.960> setting<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.410> up<00:00:55.500> alone<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.070> definitely

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
are setting it up alone it's definitely

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.290 
are setting it up alone it's definitely
doable<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.079> pretty<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:58.920> um<00:00:59.129> it<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.270> be

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
doable that is pretty but um it can be

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.700 
doable that is pretty but um it can be
done<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:00.870> I'm<00:01:00.930> going<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.140> show<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.350> how<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.530> do

the pole and then what I want to do is
come<00:02:14.800> over<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.220> opposite<00:02:15.940> side<00:02:16.650> it's

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
come over to the opposite side it's

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.089 
come over to the opposite side it's
really<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.040> opposite<00:02:18.519> corner<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.950> do<00:02:20.950> the

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
really the opposite corner and do the

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.600 
really the opposite corner and do the
same<00:02:21.430> thing<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:23.410> I'm<00:02:23.470> going<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.680> get<00:02:24.130> this<00:02:24.280> into

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
same thing so I'm going to get this into

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:38.190 
same thing so I'm going to get this into
the<00:02:24.700> grommet<00:02:31.709> find<00:02:32.709> my<00:02:32.890> wing<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.930> might<00:02:38.110> have

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
the grommet find my wing you might have

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.690 
the grommet find my wing you might have
to<00:02:38.349> strain<00:02:38.709> things<00:02:39.010> out<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.250> little<00:02:39.459> bit

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.660 

like<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:46.819> said<00:02:47.110> it's<00:02:48.110> not<00:02:48.290> as<00:02:48.650> pretty<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.280> set<00:02:49.580> it

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
like I said it's not as pretty to set it

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.559 
like I said it's not as pretty to set it
up<00:02:49.790> with<00:02:49.970> one<00:02:50.180> person<00:02:50.390> but<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.870> can<00:02:51.050> be<00:02:51.200> done

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
up with one person but it can be done

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.740 
up with one person but it can be done
great<00:02:53.569> and<00:02:53.750> then<00:02:54.790> do<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.940> same<00:02:56.180> thing<00:02:56.450> on<00:02:56.629> the

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
great and then do the same thing on the

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:07.000 
great and then do the same thing on the
other<00:02:56.980> corners<00:03:04.000> winged<00:03:05.000> out<00:03:05.769> once<00:03:06.769> you<00:03:06.920> get

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
other corners winged out once you get

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.610 
other corners winged out once you get
the<00:03:07.160> first<00:03:07.400> two<00:03:07.640> corner<00:03:08.000> setup<00:03:08.360> it's<00:03:09.290> pretty

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
the first two corner setup it's pretty

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.490 
the first two corner setup it's pretty
easy<00:03:10.299> let's<00:03:11.299> see<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.540> tenth<00:03:11.780> standing<00:03:12.260> up<00:03:12.349> by

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
easy let's see the tenth standing up by

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.160 
easy let's see the tenth standing up by
itself<00:03:13.150> this<00:03:14.150> is<00:03:14.269> another<00:03:14.480> reason<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:14.900> it's

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
itself this is another reason that it's

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.690 
itself this is another reason that it's
really<00:03:15.440> important<00:03:15.890> to<00:03:15.950> stake<00:03:16.370> it<00:03:16.519> out<00:03:16.640> first

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
really important to stake it out first

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.240 
really important to stake it out first
otherwise<00:03:20.380> you'll<00:03:21.380> have<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:21.560> dead<00:03:21.739> body<00:03:21.920> just

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
otherwise you'll have a dead body just

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.270 
otherwise you'll have a dead body just
plot<00:03:22.610> them<00:03:22.790> all<00:03:22.910> over<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.180> place<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:25.069> from

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
plot them all over the place and from

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.130 
plot them all over the place and from
here<00:03:26.079> all<00:03:27.079> you<00:03:27.319> have<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.620> do<00:03:27.769> is<00:03:28.040> go<00:03:28.220> around<00:03:28.340> and

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:41.060
