00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
kind of different though and it will be

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.189 
kind of different though and it will be
so<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.090> idea<00:04:58.210> here<00:04:58.479> is<00:04:58.960> to<00:04:59.320> find<00:04:59.889> the<00:05:00.039> ways<00:05:01.199> to
