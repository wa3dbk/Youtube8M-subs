what samsung says is their new process

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.339 
what samsung says is their new process
of<00:01:47.489> a<00:01:47.580> new<00:01:47.819> memory<00:01:48.209> everything<00:01:49.140> comes

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:49.349 
of a new memory everything comes

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:51.469 
of a new memory everything comes
together<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.800> create<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> lag<00:01:50.670> free<00:01:51.030> experience

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
together to create a lag free experience

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.240 
together to create a lag free experience
we<00:01:51.720> really<00:01:51.989> hope<00:01:52.170> that's<00:01:52.349> the<00:01:52.500> case<00:01:52.560> because

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
we really hope that's the case because

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.919 
we really hope that's the case because
that's<00:01:53.459> been<00:01:53.640> one<00:01:53.789> of<00:01:53.819> our<00:01:54.000> major<00:01:54.269> bugbears

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
that's been one of our major bugbears

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.610 
that's been one of our major bugbears
with

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
with

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.230 
with
so<00:01:57.070> first<00:01:57.430> things<00:01:57.640> first<00:01:57.730> you've<00:01:58.060> got<00:01:58.210> the

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
so first things first you've got the

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.570 
so first things first you've got the
home<00:01:58.450> screens<00:01:58.780> you<00:01:59.440> can<00:01:59.620> pinch<00:02:00.010> out<00:02:00.280> for<00:02:00.550> a

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
home screens you can pinch out for a

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.580 
home screens you can pinch out for a
variable<00:02:01.030> number<00:02:01.210> of<00:02:01.330> home<00:02:01.600> screens<00:02:01.960> if<00:02:02.350> you

variable number of home screens if you

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.500 
variable number of home screens if you
pinch<00:02:02.830> in<00:02:03.100> from<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.430> edge<00:02:03.640> you<00:02:04.180> can<00:02:04.360> actually

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
pinch in from the edge you can actually

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.660 
pinch in from the edge you can actually
drag<00:02:05.020> elements<00:02:05.560> in<00:02:05.740> you<00:02:05.860> can<00:02:06.010> assign<00:02:06.370> these<00:02:06.610> to

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
drag elements in you can assign these to

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.210 
drag elements in you can assign these to
contacts<00:02:07.450> for<00:02:07.600> example<00:02:07.690> hold<00:02:08.680> on<00:02:08.860> with<00:02:09.070> one

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
contacts for example hold on with one

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.190 
contacts for example hold on with one
finger<00:02:09.490> to<00:02:09.790> reveal<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.149> notifications<00:02:10.960> tray

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
finger to reveal the notifications tray

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.020 
finger to reveal the notifications tray
and<00:02:11.440> you<00:02:11.770> can<00:02:11.950> expand<00:02:12.370> this<00:02:12.520> with<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> two

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
and you can expand this with a two

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.390 
and you can expand this with a two
finger<00:02:13.210> pulldown<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.170> we<00:02:14.920> can<00:02:15.100> try<00:02:15.250> that

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
finger pulldown and we can try that

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.580 
finger pulldown and we can try that
again<00:02:15.550> it's<00:02:16.180> not<00:02:16.360> working<00:02:16.750> but<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.410> can

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
again it's not working but you can

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.740 
again it's not working but you can
scroll<00:02:17.920> through<00:02:17.980> in<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.610> case<00:02:18.850> so<00:02:19.330> Samsung's

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
scroll through in that case so Samsung's

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.050 
scroll through in that case so Samsung's
made<00:02:19.990> a<00:02:20.020> change<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.890> TouchWiz<00:02:21.400> we<00:02:21.880> can

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
made a change in a TouchWiz we can

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.060 
made a change in a TouchWiz we can
shortcut<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.720> settings<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.560> you<00:02:23.620> can<00:02:23.920> see

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
shortcut to the settings and you can see

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.430 
shortcut to the settings and you can see
exactly<00:02:24.190> how<00:02:24.760> Samsung<00:02:25.240> has<00:02:25.390> organized<00:02:25.870> the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
exactly how Samsung has organized the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.290 
exactly how Samsung has organized the
settings<00:02:26.860> apparently<00:02:27.730> they've<00:02:27.880> gone<00:02:28.000> for<00:02:28.270> a

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
settings apparently they've gone for a

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.480 
settings apparently they've gone for a
cleaner<00:02:28.690> aesthetic<00:02:29.470> so<00:02:29.740> when<00:02:30.190> you're<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:30.430> a

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
cleaner aesthetic so when you're in a

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.550 
cleaner aesthetic so when you're in a
message<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.060> have<00:02:31.209> less<00:02:31.480> icons<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.350> more

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
message you have less icons and more

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.100 
message you have less icons and more
words<00:02:32.800> but<00:02:32.980> simple<00:02:33.550> words<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:34.390> instead<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.930> a

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
words but simple words so instead of a

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.830 
words but simple words so instead of a
magnifying<00:02:35.620> glass<00:02:35.709> you've<00:02:36.040> got<00:02:36.220> search<00:02:36.520> etc

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
magnifying glass you've got search etc

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.090 
magnifying glass you've got search etc
still<00:02:37.840> it's<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.200> really<00:02:38.470> simple<00:02:38.709> user

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
still it's a really simple user

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.000 
still it's a really simple user
interface<00:02:39.959> generally<00:02:40.959> speaking<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.680> it

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
interface generally speaking and it

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.070 
interface generally speaking and it
doesn't<00:02:42.340> feel<00:02:42.459> as<00:02:42.520> bloated<00:02:43.180> as<00:02:43.420> Samsung

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
doesn't feel as bloated as Samsung

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.740 
doesn't feel as bloated as Samsung
TouchWiz<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.770> all<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.490> applications<00:02:46.150> tray<00:02:46.450> as

TouchWiz of all the applications tray as

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.420 
TouchWiz of all the applications tray as
you<00:02:46.959> can<00:02:47.110> see<00:02:47.320> is<00:02:47.410> really<00:02:47.620> nicely<00:02:47.920> organized

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
you can see is really nicely organized

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.820 
you can see is really nicely organized
into<00:02:48.790> applications<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.600> folders<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.410> that's

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
into applications and folders and that's

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.620 
into applications and folders and that's
pretty<00:02:51.040> much<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.459> crux<00:02:51.760> of<00:02:51.910> it<00:02:52.000> doesn't<00:02:52.330> look

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
pretty much the crux of it doesn't look

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.420 
pretty much the crux of it doesn't look
like<00:02:52.660> there's<00:02:53.050> too<00:02:53.260> much<00:02:53.410> bloatware<00:02:54.010> on<00:02:54.160> here

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
like there's too much bloatware on here

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.190 
like there's too much bloatware on here
in<00:02:54.670> fact<00:02:55.030> there's<00:02:55.570> just<00:02:55.840> pretty<00:02:56.020> much

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
in fact there's just pretty much

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.580 
in fact there's just pretty much
s-health<00:02:56.680> s-voice<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.640> that's<00:02:58.450> about<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:59.260> if

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
s-health s-voice and that's about it if

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.590 
s-health s-voice and that's about it if
we<00:03:00.100> jump<00:03:00.489> out<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:00.970> we<00:03:01.090> can<00:03:01.239> talk<00:03:01.450> you

we jump out of that we can talk you

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.360 
we jump out of that we can talk you
