with the little abandoned houses if you

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.870 
with the little abandoned houses if you
followed<00:00:10.410> me<00:00:10.559> at<00:00:10.650> all<00:00:10.830> you<00:00:11.099> would<00:00:11.219> see<00:00:11.280> that<00:00:11.519> I

followed me at all you would see that I
changed<00:00:12.809> what<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.139> was<00:00:13.290> working<00:00:13.559> on<00:00:13.650> um<00:00:14.009> but

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
changed what I was working on um but

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.090 
changed what I was working on um but
this<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.900> point<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.260> was<00:00:16.350> at<00:00:16.529> right<00:00:16.770> before

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
this is the point I was at right before

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.240 
this is the point I was at right before
I<00:00:17.130> changed<00:00:17.609> over<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.060> my<00:00:18.390> little<00:00:18.859> sphere<00:00:19.859> globe

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
I changed over to my little sphere globe

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.720 
I changed over to my little sphere globe
thing<00:00:21.170> where<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.199> made<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.619> sphere<00:00:23.039> staff<00:00:23.310> but

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
thing where I made the sphere staff but

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.529 
thing where I made the sphere staff but
um<00:00:24.260> this<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.470> where<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.650> was<00:00:25.830> at<00:00:26.510> basically<00:00:27.510> I

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
um this is where I was at basically I

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.830 
um this is where I was at basically I
got<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.160> the<00:00:29.160> hut<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.550> generate<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.720> would

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
got the the hut to generate and it would

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.290 
got the the hut to generate and it would
randomly<00:00:31.109> pick<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> side<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.189> be<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.399> front<00:00:32.579> and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
randomly pick a side to be the front and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.240 
randomly pick a side to be the front and
this<00:00:33.930> one<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.110> happened<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:34.680> facing<00:00:34.950> this

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
this one just happened be facing this

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.060 
this one just happened be facing this
way<00:00:35.309> um<00:00:36.110> they<00:00:37.110> could<00:00:37.290> be<00:00:37.380> facing<00:00:37.590> any<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
way um they could be facing any of the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.680 
way um they could be facing any of the
four<00:00:38.309> directions<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.180> house<00:00:39.480> would

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
four directions and the house would

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.639 
four directions and the house would
adjust<00:00:40.020> itself<00:00:40.790> inside<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:42.210> order<00:00:42.329> to

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
adjust itself inside in order to

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.490 
adjust itself inside in order to
accommodate<00:00:43.649> for<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.899> so<00:00:45.899> right<00:00:46.110> now<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.289> have

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
accommodate for that so right now I have

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.180 
accommodate for that so right now I have
a<00:00:46.530> full<00:00:46.800> bag<00:00:47.039> for<00:00:47.670> torches<00:00:48.120> open<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> walls

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
a full bag for torches open the walls

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.250 
a full bag for torches open the walls
crafting<00:00:50.190> table<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.789> chest<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.300> has<00:00:52.020> some

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
crafting table in a chest that has some

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.529 
crafting table in a chest that has some
random<00:00:52.910> goodies<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.090> there<00:00:55.309> you<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.760> bunch

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
random goodies in there you have a bunch

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.290 
random goodies in there you have a bunch
of<00:00:57.660> different<00:00:57.829> stuff<00:00:58.829> based<00:00:59.190> off<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.460> mining

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
of different stuff based off of mining

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.889 
of different stuff based off of mining
so<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.629> mean<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.170> find<00:01:01.469> overs<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.899> you

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
so I mean you can find overs and you

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.390 
so I mean you can find overs and you
even<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.260> chance<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.739> like<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.369> a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
even have a chance of like one in a

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.740 
even have a chance of like one in a
hundred<00:01:05.640> chances<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.630> finding<00:01:07.729> diamondden

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
hundred chances of finding diamondden

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.480 
hundred chances of finding diamondden
but<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.930> know<00:01:10.049> these<00:01:10.320> houses<00:01:10.710> are<00:01:10.830> extremely

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
but you know these houses are extremely

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.090 
but you know these houses are extremely
rare<00:01:11.520> took<00:01:12.090> me<00:01:12.240> about<00:01:12.409> 15<00:01:13.409> minutes<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.770> find<00:01:13.950> my

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
rare took me about 15 minutes to find my

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.219 
rare took me about 15 minutes to find my
first<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:17.390> yeah<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.420> kind<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.900> set<00:01:19.049> them<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
first one so yeah I kind of set them a

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.179 
first one so yeah I kind of set them a
little<00:01:19.409> bit<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> weak<00:01:20.670> side<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:23.040> can

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
little bit on the weak side but you can

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.039 
little bit on the weak side but you can
definitely<00:01:23.340> tell<00:01:23.640> how<00:01:23.880> much<00:01:24.030> cleaner<00:01:24.780> it

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
definitely tell how much cleaner it

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.660 
definitely tell how much cleaner it
looks<00:01:25.259> when<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.950> know<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> surface

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
looks when it you know at the surface

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.850 
looks when it you know at the surface
compared<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> my<00:01:27.479> last<00:01:27.720> video<00:01:28.110> my<00:01:28.380> last<00:01:28.590> video

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
compared to my last video my last video

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.679 
compared to my last video my last video
it<00:01:28.979> was<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.220> buried<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.790> four<00:01:30.090> blocks<00:01:30.329> down

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
it was like buried like four blocks down

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.170 
it was like buried like four blocks down
in<00:01:30.900> there<00:01:31.049> um<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:32.159> added<00:01:32.430> quite<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> bit<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.000> code

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
in there um I added quite a bit of code

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.990 
in there um I added quite a bit of code
in<00:01:33.390> order<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.750> check<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> four<00:01:35.040> corners<00:01:35.430> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
in order to check the four corners and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.240 
in order to check the four corners and
to<00:01:37.369> make<00:01:38.369> sure<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.790> all<00:01:39.090> these<00:01:39.750> edges

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
to make sure that all these edges

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.120 
to make sure that all these edges
weren't<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.850> know<00:01:41.970> cut<00:01:42.329> off<00:01:42.680> right<00:01:43.680> now<00:01:43.829> I'm

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
weren't you know cut off right now I'm

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.649 
weren't you know cut off right now I'm
going<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.520> use<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.670> sphere<00:01:45.180> thing<00:01:45.420> and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
going to use that sphere thing and

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.230 
going to use that sphere thing and
trained<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:47.070> try<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.520> use<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:47.909> order<00:01:48.090> to

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
trained and try and use it in order to

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.940 
trained and try and use it in order to
create<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.930> little<00:01:49.170> bubble<00:01:49.500> around<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
create like a little bubble around the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.270 
create like a little bubble around the
house<00:01:50.149> so<00:01:51.149> let<00:01:51.270> all<00:01:51.450> these<00:01:51.680> blocks<00:01:52.680> along<00:01:52.979> this

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
house so let all these blocks along this

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.230 
house so let all these blocks along this
edge<00:01:53.579> would<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> little<00:01:54.960> bit<00:01:55.079> more<00:01:55.259> smooth

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
edge would be a little bit more smooth

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.120 
edge would be a little bit more smooth
it<00:01:57.240> probably<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.899> know<00:01:57.930> take<00:01:58.409> off<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.710> second

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
it probably you know take off the second

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.800 
it probably you know take off the second
block<00:01:59.340> across<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.909> bottom<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.509> maybe<00:02:00.719> a

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
block across the bottom and maybe a

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.219 
block across the bottom and maybe a
third<00:02:01.049> block<00:02:01.320> across<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:02.689> this<00:02:03.689> one<00:02:03.899> here

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
third block across this this one here

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.990 
third block across this this one here
the<00:02:04.649> way<00:02:04.770> i<00:02:04.799> have<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.130> set<00:02:05.159> up<00:02:05.340> right<00:02:05.610> now<00:02:05.759> is

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
the way i have it set up right now is

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.029 
the way i have it set up right now is
that<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.390> would<00:02:06.570> basically<00:02:07.200> take<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.680> highest

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
that it would basically take the highest

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.499 
that it would basically take the highest
point<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.429> louis<00:02:08.700> point<00:02:08.970> use<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:09.479> a

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
point and louis point use that as a

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.220 
point and louis point use that as a
height<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.259> create<00:02:11.009> us<00:02:11.129> like<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.879> circle

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
height and create us like a circle

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.720 
height and create us like a circle
that<00:02:13.590> would<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:13.920> know<00:02:14.010> come<00:02:14.220> out<00:02:14.250> like<00:02:14.489> this

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
that would you know come out like this

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.210 
that would you know come out like this
and<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.269> would<00:02:15.390> remove<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.810> blocks<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:17.159> are

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
and it would remove the blocks that are

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.089 
and it would remove the blocks that are
in<00:02:17.519> that<00:02:17.549> circle<00:02:18.180> there<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.629> i<00:02:19.349> think<00:02:20.010> i'm

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
in that circle there and i think i'm

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.530 
in that circle there and i think i'm
going<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.310> set<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.640> only<00:02:20.819> remove<00:02:21.480> sand<00:02:22.080> dirt

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
going to set it to only remove sand dirt

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.339 
going to set it to only remove sand dirt
and<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:25.500> know<00:02:25.560> actual<00:02:26.190> stone<00:02:26.670> stone<00:02:27.349> like

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
and you know actual stone stone like

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.030 
and you know actual stone stone like
smooth<00:02:28.590> stone<00:02:28.860> um<00:02:29.660> that<00:02:30.660> way<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:31.769> wouldn't

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
smooth stone um that way it wouldn't

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.809 
smooth stone um that way it wouldn't
look<00:02:32.190> too<00:02:33.260> awkward<00:02:34.260> like<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:35.340> would<00:02:35.489> leave<00:02:35.640> the

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
look too awkward like it would leave the

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.460 
look too awkward like it would leave the
trees<00:02:36.209> alone<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.349> would<00:02:37.500> leave<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:39.090> know

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
trees alone and it would leave you know

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.920 
trees alone and it would leave you know
pumpkins<00:02:40.470> or<00:02:40.769> any<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.540> flowers<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.810> would

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
pumpkins or any of the flowers it would

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.920 
pumpkins or any of the flowers it would
leave<00:02:43.079> those<00:02:43.290> alone<00:02:43.319> but<00:02:44.190> uh<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.870> think<00:02:45.870> it

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
leave those alone but uh I think it

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.100 
leave those alone but uh I think it
would<00:02:46.019> look<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.170> little<00:02:46.319> bit<00:02:46.470> cleaner<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:48.110> I

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
would look a little bit cleaner and I

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.300 
would look a little bit cleaner and I
don't<00:02:49.349> know<00:02:49.410> I'll<00:02:49.620> probably<00:02:49.739> work<00:02:49.980> on<00:02:50.129> that

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
don't know I'll probably work on that

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.180 
don't know I'll probably work on that
maybe<00:02:50.640> later<00:02:50.819> today<00:02:51.769> this<00:02:52.769> would<00:02:52.920> just<00:02:53.099> give

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
maybe later today this would just give

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.619 
maybe later today this would just give
you<00:02:53.310> an<00:02:53.370> idea<00:02:53.489> of<00:02:53.730> what<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.359> would<00:02:54.420> look<00:02:54.569> like

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
you an idea of what it would look like

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.949 
you an idea of what it would look like
more<00:02:55.140> so<00:02:56.420> like<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.480> cleaner<00:02:58.049> edge<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.470> this

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
more so like a cleaner edge like this

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.449 
more so like a cleaner edge like this
but<00:03:00.959> I<00:03:01.849> don't<00:03:02.849> know<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:04.160> will<00:03:05.160> figure<00:03:05.340> something

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
but I don't know I will figure something

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.709 
but I don't know I will figure something
out<00:03:06.290> hope<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.410> enjoyed
