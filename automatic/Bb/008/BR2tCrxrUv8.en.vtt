00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.620
 when you draw in perspective it's very 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.630
 important that you always know where it is 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.340
 the center of the objects because from there 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.000
 many times the 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.680
 modularity or the repetition that you can 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.660
 create of the objects then here 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.790
 we have an example of a prism in 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.190
 perspective to find the center 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.900
 let's see step by step first in the 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.210
 face in front which is the one we 're going to 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.910
 divide let's put two diagonals 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.800
 over the center of those two diagonals or 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.010
 where they intersect let's do 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.329
 one vertical and one horizontal 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.859
 obviously you are not seeing it totally 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.899
 vertical and horizontal because the 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:49.190
 perspective makes them distort 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:52.069
 these lines then let's draw then 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.469
 a diagonal at each intersection of 

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:56.089
 those four of those four parts that 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.340
 we got with the previous division 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.650
 when well with this first division 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.960
 we got four sectors of those 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.670
 we're also going to take out half or the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.130
 center rather because each 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.640
 we have this I took the opportunity to make a 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.460
 letter to no more for the ones to give some 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.340
 In particular, remember that all 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.119
 those lines should follow the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.460
 perspective in this case we are 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.229
 drawing to three vanishing points the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.690
 Third vanishing point is very slight but 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.320
 so it helps that the 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.950
 drawing we make this a little more dim 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.040
 we draw the important lines and 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.330
 we add a little color we are 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.369
 using the same color technique 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.410
 they are simply three colors or three 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.020
 shades of the same color so that 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.820
 understand that form then if 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.680
 you would have looked like that at first sight 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.869
 imagine all the work that there is of 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.350
 background regarding the division of the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.850
 piece when you're not very familiar 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.500
 with this maybe if you have to find 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.450
 those midpoints once you go 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.520
 grabbing practice on this maybe not 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.950
 can be by eye and you have what 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.830
 sufficiently precise so that 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.160
 simple view see centered the 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.260
 perforations of the letter and then that 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.000
 is the first issue how to find the 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.070
 center is actually quite simple 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.170
 you just have to be diagonal and this 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.520
 It can be applied to any face in 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.290
 this case we did in the opposite 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.920
 but it can be applied in any other 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.860
 and our next example is this one 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.940
 you see here where he repeats is a figure in 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.280
 the perspective 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.170
 well I repeat the same figure or the same 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.110
 way and it's getting smaller 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.920
 as it moves away from you then 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.080
 let's go also in order here we have the 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.880
 first prism obviously the leaks that 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.280
 they go to the right side they're pretty 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.230
 this is more than enough because the intention 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.800
 from the beginning was to repeat that form 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.360
 towards that side we find the center of 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.410
 that's why I explained that to you before 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.500
 because it's the first step here 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.690
 the next step is that going through that 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.730
 intersection or that center we're going to 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.180
 draw a leak to the side where 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.270
 we want to duplicate the objects after 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:15.050
 let's connect the bottom point 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.790
 left of that face that we divide with 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.489
 the midpoint 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.319
 on the right side of that object or if 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.000
 we were if we were repeating 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.719
 to the other side because it is this 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.519
 diagonal was well inverted where 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:34.920
 touched that green diagonal the guiding line of 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.230
 up we're going to draw a vertical line 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.450
 for 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.640
 to mark that division of the prism and 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.129
 we repeat that same sequence to do 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.310
 the other division and finish the prisms 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.680
 going to the other fugue yes then that 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.170
 is the process very simple let's 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.060
 highlight the pieces and add a little 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.090
 of color simply to distinguish 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.099
 very well the faces are becoming more 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.099
 small as you go away in the 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:04.370
 perspective this is quite simple 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.829
 when you are drawing already in the 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.610
 following exercises is not necessary 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:13.519
 that you do it as is with these steps 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.590
 but if you are doubting the repetition 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.079
 of his figures use the best is good 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.910
 do it once or twice at the beginning and 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.240
 as you go forward you can say 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.880
 letting go is this practice that is 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.010
 a little bit tedious and as I go 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.050
 advancing do it to the eye because then well 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.410
 It serves that your eye is also training 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.289
 so as not to have to do all 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.449
 those guide lines then I hope so 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.129
 that it has become very clear this is what is 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.919
 so simple you just have to find 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:46.489
 the diagonals by the centers rather 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:49.659
 and that's it then I see them in the 

00:04:46.489 --> 00:04:49.659
 next video
