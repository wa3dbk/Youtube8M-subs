insult but beneath the insole is a very
thin<00:00:24.410> layer<00:00:24.619> so<00:00:25.219> when<00:00:25.399> I<00:00:25.430> was<00:00:25.640> running<00:00:25.880> these

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
thin layer so when I was running these

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.019 
thin layer so when I was running these
and<00:00:26.570> walking<00:00:26.960> in<00:00:27.050> these<00:00:27.200> I<00:00:27.439> just<00:00:27.860> felt<00:00:28.430> like<00:00:28.520> my

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
and walking in these I just felt like my

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.630 
and walking in these I just felt like my
heel<00:00:29.419> and<00:00:29.840> my<00:00:30.020> mind<00:00:30.770> the<00:00:30.950> balls<00:00:31.160> my<00:00:31.399> feet

heel and my mind the balls my feet
started<00:00:32.509> hurting<00:00:32.750> so<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.410> first<00:00:33.649> thing<00:00:33.800> you

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
started hurting so the first thing you

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.160 
started hurting so the first thing you
notice<00:00:34.070> about<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.489> upper<00:00:34.820> is<00:00:34.969> that<00:00:35.480> it<00:00:35.989> has

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
notice about the upper is that it has

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.770 
notice about the upper is that it has
exposed<00:00:36.770> fly<00:00:37.250> wire<00:00:37.520> now<00:00:38.030> on<00:00:38.180> paper<00:00:38.390> it's

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
exposed fly wire now on paper it's

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.160 
exposed fly wire now on paper it's
supposed<00:00:39.289> to<00:00:39.500> do<00:00:39.710> a<00:00:40.010> good<00:00:40.910> job<00:00:40.970> and<00:00:41.600> contribute

supposed to do a good job and contribute

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.890 
supposed to do a good job and contribute
to<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.410> good<00:00:42.650> fit<00:00:43.010> of<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:43.520> shoe<00:00:43.790> but<00:00:44.570> it

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
to the good fit of the shoe but it

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.920 
to the good fit of the shoe but it
doesn't<00:00:45.740> it<00:00:46.160> it<00:00:46.940> actually<00:00:47.120> doesn't<00:00:47.570> tighten

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
doesn't it it actually doesn't tighten

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.510 
doesn't it it actually doesn't tighten
around<00:00:48.110> your<00:00:48.440> shoe<00:00:48.620> like<00:00:48.770> it's<00:00:49.010> supposed<00:00:49.400> to

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
around your shoe like it's supposed to

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.790 
around your shoe like it's supposed to
any<00:00:49.760> type<00:00:49.970> of<00:00:50.000> laces<00:00:50.480> now<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.110> actual

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
any type of laces now the actual

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.860 
any type of laces now the actual
operators<00:00:52.190> may<00:00:52.400> have<00:00:52.610> entered<00:00:53.000> an<00:00:53.120> engineered

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
operators may have entered an engineered

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.350 
operators may have entered an engineered
mesh<00:00:54.079> as<00:00:54.290> well<00:00:54.739> as<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:54.920> tongue<00:00:55.130> which<00:00:55.579> provide

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
mesh as well as the tongue which provide

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.560 
mesh as well as the tongue which provide
great<00:00:56.750> ventilation<00:00:57.110> for<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.560> shoe<00:00:58.540> when<00:00:59.540> I

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
great ventilation for the shoe when I

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.190 
great ventilation for the shoe when I
picked<00:00:59.899> these<00:00:59.989> up

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
picked these up

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.770 
picked these up
I<00:01:00.290> respect<00:01:00.710> skeptical<00:01:01.370> about<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:02.540> mesh

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
I respect skeptical about the mesh

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.509 
I respect skeptical about the mesh
because<00:01:03.170> I<00:01:03.200> thought<00:01:03.410> these<00:01:03.649> would<00:01:03.829> wear<00:01:04.159> down

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
because I thought these would wear down

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.539 
because I thought these would wear down
and<00:01:04.879> tear<00:01:05.180> but<00:01:06.020> I<00:01:06.259> was<00:01:06.680> proven<00:01:07.009> wrong<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:07.460> they

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
and tear but I was proven wrong and they

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.760 
and tear but I was proven wrong and they
did<00:01:07.729> a<00:01:07.790> great<00:01:08.060> job<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:08.780> overall<00:01:09.079> it's<00:01:09.409> a<00:01:09.500> great

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
did a great job so overall it's a great

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.370 
did a great job so overall it's a great
shoe<00:01:10.280> I<00:01:10.579> really<00:01:11.030> like<00:01:11.210> it<00:01:11.420> for<00:01:11.450> casual<00:01:12.110> wear

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
shoe I really like it for casual wear

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.070 
shoe I really like it for casual wear
because<00:01:13.280> this<00:01:13.490> exposed<00:01:14.060> fly<00:01:14.390> wire<00:01:14.600> as<00:01:14.810> well<00:01:14.840> as

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
because this exposed fly wire as well as

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.370 
because this exposed fly wire as well as
this<00:01:15.200> colorway<00:01:15.680> and<00:01:15.860> just<00:01:16.610> but<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.510> one<00:01:17.780> the

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
this colorway and just but the one the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.490 
this colorway and just but the one the
one<00:01:18.620> flaw<00:01:19.520> in<00:01:19.760> this<00:01:19.909> shoe<00:01:20.270> is<00:01:20.570> how<00:01:21.140> you<00:01:21.200> just

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
one flaw in this shoe is how you just

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.399 
one flaw in this shoe is how you just
step<00:01:21.860> in<00:01:22.010> it<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:22.340> they<00:01:22.520> after<00:01:22.940> you<00:01:23.420> run<00:01:23.960> for

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
step in it and they after you run for

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.530 
step in it and they after you run for
like<00:01:24.530> thirty<00:01:25.010> minutes<00:01:25.130> your<00:01:25.640> heel<00:01:25.909> and<00:01:25.940> the

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
like thirty minutes your heel and the

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.420 
like thirty minutes your heel and the
balls<00:01:26.780> of<00:01:26.960> your<00:01:26.990> feet<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:27.530> your<00:01:27.920> forefoot

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
balls of your feet and your forefoot

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.060 
balls of your feet and your forefoot
start<00:01:28.820> hurting<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:29.510> you<00:01:30.170> are<00:01:30.320> really<00:01:30.740> gonna

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
start hurting and you are really gonna

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.660 
start hurting and you are really gonna
get<00:01:31.310> sore<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:32.330> there<00:01:32.780> are<00:01:32.930> two<00:01:33.170> ways<00:01:33.440> to<00:01:33.799> solve

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
get sore so there are two ways to solve

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.870 
get sore so there are two ways to solve
that<00:01:34.850> problem<00:01:34.909> one<00:01:35.810> way<00:01:36.159> just<00:01:37.159> add<00:01:37.400> some<00:01:37.850> more

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
that problem one way just add some more

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.649 
that problem one way just add some more
cushioning

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
cushioning

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.870 
cushioning
I<00:01:38.689> mean<00:01:38.869> glue<00:01:39.260> on<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.890> full-length<00:01:40.159> Luna<00:01:40.670> line

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
I mean glue on the full-length Luna line

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.469 
I mean glue on the full-length Luna line
is<00:01:41.060> very<00:01:41.330> good<00:01:41.600> but<00:01:42.140> I<00:01:42.200> would<00:01:42.650> add<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.400> zoom<00:01:44.000> unit

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
is very good but I would add a zoom unit

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.010 
is very good but I would add a zoom unit
in<00:01:44.659> in<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:46.390> forefoot<00:01:47.390> as<00:01:47.810> well<00:01:48.260> as<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:49.159> heel

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
in in the forefoot as well as the heel

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.810 
in in the forefoot as well as the heel
but<00:01:51.020> another<00:01:51.200> way<00:01:51.409> to<00:01:51.439> solve<00:01:51.890> it<00:01:52.009> is<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:52.580> just

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
but another way to solve it is to just

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.700 
but another way to solve it is to just
get<00:01:52.939> a<00:01:53.000> thicker<00:01:53.390> insole<00:01:54.049> and<00:01:54.229> I<00:01:54.320> think<00:01:54.530> that

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
get a thicker insole and I think that

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.219 
get a thicker insole and I think that
would<00:01:54.860> be<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:56.090> more<00:01:56.299> logical<00:01:56.930> way<00:01:57.200> to

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
would be the the more logical way to

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.679 
would be the the more logical way to
solve<00:01:57.710> this<00:01:57.920> problem<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:58.909> overall<00:01:59.240> it's<00:01:59.570> a

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
solve this problem so overall it's a

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.230 
solve this problem so overall it's a

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.020 
really good shoe and give it a B+ rating
just<00:02:02.750> because<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:03.530> one<00:02:03.830> problem<00:02:04.340> of<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.790> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
just because that one problem of the the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.929 
just because that one problem of the the
heel<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:05.600> forefoot<00:02:05.799> just<00:02:06.799> just<00:02:07.729> but

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
heel and the forefoot just just but

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.300 
heel and the forefoot just just but
thicker<00:02:08.149> insole<00:02:08.599> or<00:02:08.899> some<00:02:09.500> extra<00:02:09.979> can<00:02:10.189> be

thicker insole or some extra can be

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.130 
thicker insole or some extra can be
cushioning<00:02:10.759> will<00:02:11.239> definitely<00:02:11.689> install<00:02:11.900> that

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
cushioning will definitely install that

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.729 
cushioning will definitely install that
problem

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
problem

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.250 
problem
so<00:02:13.069> somebody<00:02:13.370> on<00:02:13.640> my<00:02:13.760> channel<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.360> that<00:02:14.629> I<00:02:14.659> give

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
so somebody on my channel is that I give

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.339 
so somebody on my channel is that I give
the<00:02:16.830> shoe<00:02:17.129> a<00:02:17.400> new<00:02:17.819> suggested<00:02:18.629> retail<00:02:18.840> price

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
the shoe a new suggested retail price

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.199 
the shoe a new suggested retail price
the<00:02:20.010> original<00:02:20.129> retail<00:02:20.549> price<00:02:20.760> for<00:02:20.940> these

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
the original retail price for these

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.449 
the original retail price for these
shoes<00:02:21.450> were<00:02:21.989> $90<00:02:22.799> plus<00:02:23.040> tax

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
shoes were $90 plus tax

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.479 
shoes were $90 plus tax
now<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.120> new<00:02:24.470> retail<00:02:25.470> price<00:02:25.769> that<00:02:25.980> I'm<00:02:26.069> giving

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
now the new retail price that I'm giving

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.759 
now the new retail price that I'm giving
it<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:26.989> $65<00:02:27.989> a<00:02:28.549> $25<00:02:29.599> difference<00:02:30.599> now<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.290> say

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
it is $65 a $25 difference now I say

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.039 
it is $65 a $25 difference now I say
that<00:02:31.980> because<00:02:32.159> I<00:02:32.670> think<00:02:33.569> they<00:02:33.810> could<00:02:33.870> have

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
that because I think they could have

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.170 
that because I think they could have
added<00:02:34.290> more<00:02:34.590> cushion<00:02:35.069> I<00:02:35.129> mean<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.400> move<00:02:35.700> on<00:02:35.940> is

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
added more cushion I mean the move on is

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.449 
added more cushion I mean the move on is
great<00:02:36.540> but<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.260> think<00:02:37.290> for<00:02:37.769> this<00:02:37.860> shoe<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.340> how

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
great but I think for this shoe and how

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.820 
great but I think for this shoe and how
thin<00:02:38.849> it<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.299> how<00:02:39.450> how<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.080> performs<00:02:40.680> I

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
thin it is and how how it performs I

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.140 
thin it is and how how it performs I
think<00:02:41.010> they<00:02:41.069> should<00:02:41.280> have<00:02:41.370> added<00:02:41.730> some<00:02:41.940> more

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
think they should have added some more

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.020 
think they should have added some more
cushioning<00:02:42.690> maybe<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.290> zoom<00:02:43.650> unit<00:02:44.129> in<00:02:44.910> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
cushioning maybe a zoom unit in the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.449 
cushioning maybe a zoom unit in the
forefoot<00:02:45.569> or<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.930> healed<00:02:46.230> that'd<00:02:46.739> be<00:02:46.920> great

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
forefoot or the healed that'd be great

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.479 
forefoot or the healed that'd be great
I<00:02:47.629> also<00:02:48.629> think<00:02:48.900> they<00:02:49.019> should<00:02:49.290> add<00:02:49.500> some<00:02:49.890> better

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
I also think they should add some better

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.880 
I also think they should add some better
fly<00:02:50.940> wire<00:02:51.180> instead<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.660> like<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:51.959> kind<00:02:52.799> of

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
fly wire instead of like this kind of

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.849 
fly wire instead of like this kind of
fake<00:02:53.370> flower<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.970> would<00:02:54.269> say<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.410> doesn't

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
fake flower I would say and it doesn't

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.559 
fake flower I would say and it doesn't
tighten<00:02:56.099> around<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.640> foot<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.150> think<00:02:57.329> they

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
tighten around the foot I think they

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.080 
tighten around the foot I think they
could<00:02:57.780> invest<00:02:58.049> in<00:02:58.290> some<00:02:58.590> bare<00:02:59.310> fly<00:02:59.700> wire<00:02:59.879> some

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
could invest in some bare fly wire some

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.599 
could invest in some bare fly wire some
more<00:03:00.209> tight<00:03:00.510> fly<00:03:00.780> water<00:03:01.109> so<00:03:01.769> that's<00:03:02.129> basically

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
more tight fly water so that's basically

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.109 
more tight fly water so that's basically
it<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.109> yeah
