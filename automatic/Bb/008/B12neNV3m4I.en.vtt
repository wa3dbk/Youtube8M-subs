00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
one and oddly enough got my first one

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.040 
one and oddly enough got my first one
it's<00:00:26.519> pretty<00:00:26.730> excited<00:00:27.269> about<00:00:27.619> protein<00:00:28.619> hasty

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
it's pretty excited about protein hasty

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.160 
it's pretty excited about protein hasty
but<00:00:31.050> then<00:00:31.199> oddly<00:00:31.769> enough<00:00:32.480> later<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.690> down<00:00:33.930> in

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
but then oddly enough later on down in

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.510 
but then oddly enough later on down in
the<00:00:34.230> same<00:00:34.500> batch<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:35.070> eggs<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.579> got<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> second

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
the same batch of eggs I got a second

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.340 
the same batch of eggs I got a second
one<00:00:39.649> so<00:00:40.649> I'm<00:00:40.710> not<00:00:40.739> really<00:00:41.010> sure<00:00:42.050> what<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.200> odds

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
one so I'm not really sure what the odds

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.900 
one so I'm not really sure what the odds
are<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.360> but<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.690> pretty<00:00:46.050> crazy<00:00:47.039> so

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
are on that but that is pretty crazy so

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.400 
are on that but that is pretty crazy so
I'm<00:00:48.000> gonna<00:00:48.090> try<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.360> keep<00:00:48.600> going<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.110> see<00:00:49.320> if

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.119 
more would pop up but uh only got two
out<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.390> batch<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:04.260> still<00:01:04.530> pretty<00:01:04.710> crazy

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
out of the batch it's still pretty crazy

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.370 
out of the batch it's still pretty crazy
I'm<00:01:05.729> not<00:01:05.970> really<00:01:06.090> sure<00:01:06.330> what<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.570> odds<00:01:06.720> are<00:01:07.049> on

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
I'm not really sure what the odds are on

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.530 
I'm not really sure what the odds are on
getting<00:01:08.340> too<00:01:09.030> shiny<00:01:09.479> froakie's<00:01:11.210> almost<00:01:12.210> only

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
getting too shiny froakie's almost only

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.030 
getting too shiny froakie's almost only
two<00:01:12.750> eggs<00:01:12.990> apart<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:13.860> they<00:01:14.010> are

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
two eggs apart as you can see they are

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.890 
two eggs apart as you can see they are
two<00:01:14.400> different<00:01:14.580> ones<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.090> one<00:01:15.330> has<00:01:15.479> five

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
two different ones that one has five

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.550 
two different ones that one has five
defense

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
defense

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.800 
defense
this<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:17.430> has<00:01:17.580> four<00:01:17.610> defense<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.420> still<00:01:18.659> need

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
this one has four defense I still need

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.609 
this one has four defense I still need
to<00:01:18.869> check<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.110> IVs<00:01:20.450> but<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.259> still

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
to check that IVs but that is still

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.980 
to check that IVs but that is still
pretty<00:01:23.189> crazy<00:01:23.970> I'm<00:01:26.119> not<00:01:27.119> really<00:01:27.420> sure<00:01:27.689> if<00:01:27.840> they

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
pretty crazy I'm not really sure if they

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.080 
pretty crazy I'm not really sure if they
definitely<00:01:28.619> lower<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.100> odds<00:01:29.600> in<00:01:30.600> Gen<00:01:31.200> 6<00:01:31.560> but

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
definitely lower the odds in Gen 6 but

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.330 
definitely lower the odds in Gen 6 but
having<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.659> froakie<00:01:34.140> shiny<00:01:34.530> almost

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
having to froakie shiny almost

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.539 
having to froakie shiny almost
back-to-back<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.390> did<00:01:36.990> use<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.380> suitum<00:01:38.189> method

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
back-to-back I did use the suitum method

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.730 
back-to-back I did use the suitum method
so<00:01:38.880> maybe<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.450> helped<00:01:39.720> out<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.710> little

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
so maybe that helped out just a little

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.370 
so maybe that helped out just a little
bit<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:41.970> still<00:01:42.119> that's<00:01:42.600> that's<00:01:43.200> just

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
bit but still that's that's just

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.109 
bit but still that's that's just
outrageous<00:01:44.060> but<00:01:45.200> here's<00:01:46.200> my<00:01:46.399> jolly<00:01:47.399> protein

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
outrageous but here's my jolly protein

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.069 
outrageous but here's my jolly protein
one<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.630> got<00:01:48.840> earlier<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.930> it's<00:01:51.930> pretty

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
one that I got earlier so it's pretty

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.730 
one that I got earlier so it's pretty
crazy<00:01:52.350> what<00:01:52.500> do<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.649> guys<00:01:52.710> think<00:01:52.820> have<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
crazy what do you guys think have the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.050 
crazy what do you guys think have the
chances<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.860> getting<00:01:55.979> shinies<00:01:56.670> been

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
chances of getting shinies been

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.639 
chances of getting shinies been
drastically<00:01:58.049> lowered<00:01:58.439> or<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:58.950> just

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
drastically lowered or is this just

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.050 
drastically lowered or is this just
incredibly<00:02:01.649> lucky<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:03.060> one<00:02:05.060> alright

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
IVs and this one has a decent spread

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.920

these guys I was also wondering do you
guys<00:02:19.380> think<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.160> perhaps<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.790> time<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:21.300> day

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
guys think that perhaps the time of day

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.190 
guys think that perhaps the time of day
affects<00:02:23.250> your<00:02:23.760> chances<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.420> getting<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.960> shiny

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
affects your chances of getting a shiny

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.320 
affects your chances of getting a shiny
