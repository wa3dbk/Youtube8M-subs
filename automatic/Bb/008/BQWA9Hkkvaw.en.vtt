00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
want them to see um you can get gridlock

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.410 
want them to see um you can get gridlock
so<00:01:08.070> i'll<00:01:08.250> show<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.490> an<00:01:08.580> example<00:01:08.640> how<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.210> works

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
so i'll show you an example how it works

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.270 
so i'll show you an example how it works
you<00:01:09.930> got<00:01:10.110> your<00:01:10.439> are<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:10.860> how<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.010> works

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
you got your are you see how it works

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.480 
you got your are you see how it works
but<00:01:11.659> for<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:13.470> app<00:01:13.710> i<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.159> move<00:01:14.310> it

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
but for this app i can just move it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.810 
but for this app i can just move it
anywhere<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.299> won't<00:01:15.509> um<00:01:15.860> auto<00:01:16.860> adjust<00:01:17.220> so

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
anywhere and it won't um auto adjust so

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.990 
anywhere and it won't um auto adjust so
it<00:01:17.970> fits<00:01:18.240> into<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.570> row<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:20.520> that's<00:01:20.729> that's

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it fits into a row so that's that's

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.219 
it fits into a row so that's that's
pretty<00:01:21.150> useful<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:23.400> number<00:01:23.640> 31<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.390> kimmel

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229
