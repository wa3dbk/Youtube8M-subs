what we're going to be doing today is
taking<00:00:02.580> off<00:00:02.699> the<00:00:02.879> old<00:00:02.999> rubber<00:00:03.239> membrane<00:00:03.479> that

00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:04.109 
taking off the old rubber membrane that

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:05.690 
taking off the old rubber membrane that
we<00:00:04.470> see<00:00:04.649> on<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.830> roof<00:00:05.009> here<00:00:05.220> which<00:00:05.549> is

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
we see on the roof here which is

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.189 
board with plywood on top of it to add
some<00:00:14.580> structural<00:00:15.030> rigidity<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.720> roof<00:00:15.990> and

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
some structural rigidity to the roof and

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.460 
some structural rigidity to the roof and
then<00:00:16.890> applying<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.839> hybrid<00:00:18.839> roof<00:00:19.050> which<00:00:19.320> is

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
then applying a hybrid roof which is

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.839 
then applying a hybrid roof which is
going<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.830> include<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.400> polyurethane

product<00:00:43.650> it<00:00:44.160> really<00:00:44.400> is<00:00:44.810> but<00:00:45.810> because<00:00:46.380> of<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
product it really is but because of the

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.010 
product it really is but because of the
failure<00:00:46.740> here<00:00:47.220> happening<00:00:48.180> years<00:00:48.540> after<00:00:48.900> the

original roofing company to come back
and<00:00:53.310> do<00:00:53.400> a<00:00:53.430> warranty<00:00:53.790> repair<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.240> challenging

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
and do a warranty repair is challenging

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.410
