with<00:01:13.100> flat<00:01:13.460> crispy<00:01:14.420> hair<00:01:14.690> so<00:01:15.470> there's<00:01:15.770> no

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
with flat crispy hair so there's no

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.670 
with flat crispy hair so there's no
dimension<00:01:16.790> there's<00:01:17.090> no<00:01:18.280> springiness<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:20.680> the

dimension there's no springiness and the

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.460 
dimension there's no springiness and the
way<00:01:21.860> I<00:01:21.890> found<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.670> prevent<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.660> is<00:01:23.900> to<00:01:23.990> use<00:01:24.440> a

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
way I found to prevent that is to use a

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.830 
way I found to prevent that is to use a
pace<00:01:24.860> or<00:01:25.190> to<00:01:25.310> open<00:01:25.610> it<00:01:25.700> up<00:01:25.820> if<00:01:26.000> I<00:01:26.150> go<00:01:26.330> to<00:01:26.390> bed<00:01:26.600> and

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
pace or to open it up if I go to bed and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.880 
pace or to open it up if I go to bed and

the heat and putting in a ponytail that

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.910 
the heat and putting in a ponytail that
all<00:03:23.890> really<00:03:24.610> just<00:03:24.640> shortens<00:03:25.210> its<00:03:25.330> lifespan

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920
