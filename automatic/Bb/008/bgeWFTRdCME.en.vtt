00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.320 
trouble picking them up start from the
bottom<00:02:41.060> like<00:02:42.060> I'm<00:02:42.240> doing<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.890> push<00:02:43.890> up<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:45.150> get

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
bottom like I'm doing and push up to get

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.700 
bottom like I'm doing and push up to get
the<00:02:45.450> dried<00:02:45.690> stuff<00:02:45.960> at<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.260> bottom<00:02:46.290> because

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
the dried stuff at the bottom because

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.680 
the dried stuff at the bottom because
this<00:02:46.860> is<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.160> really<00:02:47.670> really<00:02:47.850> thick<00:02:48.180> batter<00:02:48.390> all

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
this is a really really thick batter all

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.510 
this is a really really thick batter all
right<00:02:49.970> my<00:02:50.970> oven<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.390> heated<00:02:51.870> at<00:02:52.310> 375<00:02:53.310> degrees

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
right my oven is heated at 375 degrees

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.370 
right my oven is heated at 375 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:56.510> for<00:02:57.510> these<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.810> do<00:02:57.870> use<00:02:58.230> the

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
Fahrenheit and for these I do use the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.080 
Fahrenheit and for these I do use the
convection<00:02:58.740> I<00:02:59.010> would<00:02:59.220> do<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.400> if<00:02:59.580> you've<00:02:59.850> got

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
convection I would do that if you've got

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.390 
convection I would do that if you've got
one<00:03:00.300> and<00:03:00.450> if<00:03:00.510> not<00:03:00.660> extend<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.740> baking<00:03:02.040> time<00:03:02.220> by

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
one and if not extend the baking time by

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.850 
one and if not extend the baking time by
a<00:03:02.430> couple<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.850> minutes<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.840> bake<00:03:04.170> for<00:03:04.440> 14

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
a couple of minutes so I bake for 14

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.860 
a couple of minutes so I bake for 14
minutes<00:03:05.070> with<00:03:05.430> convection<00:03:05.850> at<00:03:06.150> 375

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
minutes with convection at 375

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:18.720 
minutes with convection at 375
Fahrenheit

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.920 

if<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:20.680> stagger<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.400> pattern<00:03:21.879> of<00:03:22.090> the

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
if you stagger the pattern of the

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.660 
if you stagger the pattern of the
cookies<00:03:23.349> like<00:03:23.590> this<00:03:25.860> they<00:03:26.860> don't<00:03:27.099> tend<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.489> run

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
cookies like this they don't tend to run

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.220 
cookies like this they don't tend to run
into<00:03:27.970> each<00:03:28.120> other<00:03:28.299> as<00:03:28.540> much<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.840> as<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.080> got

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
into each other as much so as you got

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.649 
into each other as much so as you got
all<00:03:32.349> your<00:03:32.470> cookies<00:03:32.970> put<00:03:33.970> on<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.120> sheet<00:03:34.420> there

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
all your cookies put on the sheet there

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
this is a really thick dough so you will

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.400 
this is a really thick dough so you will
have<00:03:36.819> to<00:03:37.299> with<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.569> clean<00:03:37.870> hand<00:03:38.250> press<00:03:39.250> down<00:03:39.640> and

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
have to with a clean hand press down and

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.100 
have to with a clean hand press down and
sort<00:03:41.410> of<00:03:41.470> form<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:41.980> cookie<00:03:42.400> before<00:03:43.330> you<00:03:43.870> put

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
sort of form the cookie before you put

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.470 
sort of form the cookie before you put
them<00:03:44.230> in<00:03:44.379> the<00:03:44.470> oven<00:03:44.730> this<00:03:45.730> is<00:03:45.910> also<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.269> good

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
them in the oven this is also a good

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.899 
them in the oven this is also a good
time<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:48.010> take<00:03:48.159> a<00:03:48.220> look<00:03:48.489> and<00:03:48.670> if<00:03:48.760> you're

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
time to take a look and if you're

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.509 
time to take a look and if you're
missing<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.269> little<00:03:49.709> powder<00:03:50.709> from<00:03:51.099> one<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.489> the

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
missing a little powder from one to the

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.180 
missing a little powder from one to the
other<00:03:51.750> it's<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.930> lot<00:03:53.110> easier<00:03:53.140> to<00:03:53.620> even<00:03:53.950> them<00:03:54.040> out

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
other it's a lot easier to even them out

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:00.760
