shortage that they really just disappear

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.140 
shortage that they really just disappear
when<00:01:11.130> you're<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.340> bike<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.850> can't<00:01:12.030> really

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
when you're on the bike you can't really

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.810 
when you're on the bike you can't really
tell<00:01:12.360> her<00:01:12.450> there<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:14.100> tried<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.369> make<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> cut

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
tell her there you tried to make the cut

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.080 
tell her there you tried to make the cut
pretty<00:01:15.330> trim<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.680> not<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:17.250> lycra<00:01:17.880> tight

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
pretty trim so it's not like lycra tight

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.149 
pretty trim so it's not like lycra tight
but<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.479> closer<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> body<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:20.040> not

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
but it's closer to the body so it's not

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.590 
but it's closer to the body so it's not
going<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.400> flap<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:20.939> not<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.270> hook<00:01:21.420> on

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
going to flap it's not going to hook on

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.780 
going to flap it's not going to hook on
your<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:22.020> your<00:01:22.049> saddle<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> idea<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.729> that

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
your on your saddle so the idea is that

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.700 
your on your saddle so the idea is that
their<00:01:24.119> their<00:01:24.390> performance<00:01:24.869> minded<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.530> they

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
their their performance minded but they

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.130 
their their performance minded but they
also<00:01:25.799> look<00:01:26.100> good<00:01:26.220> when<00:01:26.369> you're<00:01:26.490> not<00:01:26.610> riding

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
also look good when you're not riding

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.210 
also look good when you're not riding

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
little bit after dusk then the last

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.140 
little bit after dusk then the last
piece<00:03:18.230> in<00:03:18.470> our<00:03:18.590> introductory<00:03:19.310> line<00:03:19.580> is<00:03:19.879> the

finish material it's highly breathable

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.009 
finish material it's highly breathable
highly<00:03:31.280> stretchy<00:03:31.549> great<00:03:32.420> on<00:03:32.629> the<00:03:32.780> on<00:03:32.959> the

weather facing parts of the shoulder and
the<00:03:36.920> arm<00:03:36.950> we've<00:03:37.819> got<00:03:38.000> another<00:03:38.359> solar<00:03:38.660> soft

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
the arm we've got another solar soft

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.220 
the arm we've got another solar soft
shell<00:03:39.170> fabric<00:03:39.200> it's<00:03:40.069> got<00:03:40.250> a<00:03:40.280> silica<00:03:41.230> treatment

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
shell fabric it's got a silica treatment

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.259 
shell fabric it's got a silica treatment
so<00:03:42.560> it's<00:03:42.739> unbelievably<00:03:43.489> water-resistant

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
so it's unbelievably water-resistant

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.420 
so it's unbelievably water-resistant
it's<00:03:44.420> not<00:03:44.540> quite<00:03:44.690> waterproof<00:03:45.170> means<00:03:46.160> it's

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
it's not quite waterproof means it's

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.130 
it's not quite waterproof means it's
actually<00:03:46.670> going<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:46.849> breathe<00:03:47.030> but<00:03:47.780> this<00:03:47.989> will

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
actually going to breathe but this will

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.839 
actually going to breathe but this will
shed<00:03:48.349> water<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:48.859> you<00:03:49.129> can<00:03:49.280> wear<00:03:49.430> this<00:03:49.609> in<00:03:49.760> a

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
shed water and you can wear this in a

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.670 
shed water and you can wear this in a
total<00:03:50.269> downpour<00:03:50.420> for<00:03:50.780> about<00:03:50.930> 45<00:03:51.440> minutes<00:03:51.590> to

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
total downpour for about 45 minutes to

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.199 
total downpour for about 45 minutes to
an<00:03:51.769> hour<00:03:51.890> before<00:03:52.340> it<00:03:52.400> starts<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:52.670> soak<00:03:52.910> through

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
an hour before it starts to soak through

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.000 
an hour before it starts to soak through
the<00:03:53.930> idea<00:03:54.170> here<00:03:54.349> being<00:03:54.379> again<00:03:54.769> when<00:03:54.920> you're

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
the idea here being again when you're

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.410 
the idea here being again when you're
riding<00:03:55.190> you're<00:03:55.609> not<00:03:55.730> necessarily<00:03:56.090> going<00:03:56.180> out

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
riding you're not necessarily going out

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.970 
riding you're not necessarily going out
into<00:03:56.540> full-on<00:03:56.780> downpour<00:03:57.319> but<00:03:57.560> you<00:03:57.680> might<00:03:57.829> get

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
into full-on downpour but you might get

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.289 
into full-on downpour but you might get
caught<00:03:58.190> with<00:03:58.370> some<00:03:58.489> moisture<00:03:58.879> you<00:03:59.000> might<00:03:59.150> get

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
caught with some moisture you might get

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.729 
caught with some moisture you might get
caught<00:03:59.450> brushing<00:03:59.810> up<00:03:59.870> against<00:04:00.140> Laden<00:04:00.470> firms

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
caught brushing up against Laden firms

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.440 
caught brushing up against Laden firms
and<00:04:01.310> so<00:04:01.549> this<00:04:01.670> is<00:04:01.760> going<00:04:01.849> to<00:04:01.910> shed<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.239> water

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
and so this is going to shed the water

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.140 
and so this is going to shed the water
off<00:04:02.660> to<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.870> side<00:04:03.669> again<00:04:04.669> working<00:04:04.970> with<00:04:05.090> the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
off to the side again working with the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.030 
off to the side again working with the
camelbak<00:04:05.569> or<00:04:05.720> backpack<00:04:06.139> we've<00:04:06.349> got<00:04:06.530> these

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
camelbak or backpack we've got these

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.280 
camelbak or backpack we've got these
vents<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:08.120> go<00:04:08.239> down<00:04:08.389> from<00:04:08.569> the<00:04:08.630> top<00:04:08.840> need<00:04:09.200> a

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
vents and go down from the top need a

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.580 
vents and go down from the top need a
little<00:04:09.500> pocket<00:04:10.389> or<00:04:11.389> you<00:04:11.870> can<00:04:12.019> go<00:04:12.169> up<00:04:12.349> from<00:04:12.500> the

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
little pocket or you can go up from the

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.789 
little pocket or you can go up from the
bottom<00:04:12.769> and<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:14.810> idea<00:04:15.079> with<00:04:15.200> these<00:04:15.290> vents<00:04:15.500> is

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
bottom and the idea with these vents is

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.009 
bottom and the idea with these vents is
that<00:04:15.980> when<00:04:16.760> you<00:04:16.820> open<00:04:17.090> them<00:04:17.150> up<00:04:17.329> it<00:04:17.539> expands

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
that when you open them up it expands

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.870 
that when you open them up it expands
the<00:04:18.320> volume<00:04:18.680> of<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:18.859> jacket<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.340> little<00:04:19.549> bit<00:04:19.700> so

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
the volume of the jacket a little bit so

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.089 
the volume of the jacket a little bit so
you<00:04:19.970> can<00:04:20.030> actually<00:04:20.299> get<00:04:20.599> airflow<00:04:20.900> through<00:04:21.470> the

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
you can actually get airflow through the

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:23.290 
you can actually get airflow through the
jacket<00:04:22.550> which<00:04:22.700> is<00:04:22.789> actually<00:04:23.000> going<00:04:23.090> to<00:04:23.180> help

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
jacket which is actually going to help

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.370 
jacket which is actually going to help
keep<00:04:23.419> you<00:04:23.570> cool<00:04:23.780> when<00:04:23.990> you're<00:04:24.080> in<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.229> high

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
keep you cool when you're in a high

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.050 
keep you cool when you're in a high
effort<00:04:24.560> climb<00:04:24.950> you<00:04:25.190> don't<00:04:25.310> want<00:04:25.430> to<00:04:25.490> fill<00:04:25.940> on

effort climb you don't want to fill on

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.940 
effort climb you don't want to fill on
peel<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.450> jacket<00:04:26.810> off<00:04:26.930> then<00:04:27.620> when<00:04:27.710> you<00:04:27.770> get<00:04:27.889> to

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
peel the jacket off then when you get to

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.320 
peel the jacket off then when you get to
the<00:04:28.070> top<00:04:28.099> you<00:04:28.490> can<00:04:28.610> just<00:04:28.789> sit<00:04:28.910> them<00:04:29.000> back<00:04:29.120> down

and close off the vent the excellent
breathability<00:04:33.440> of<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:33.950> fabric<00:04:34.340> will<00:04:34.430> take

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
breathability of the fabric will take

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.339 
breathability of the fabric will take
the<00:04:34.789> sweat<00:04:35.000> away<00:04:35.090> from<00:04:35.360> your<00:04:35.450> body<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:35.900> then
