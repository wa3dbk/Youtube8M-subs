 hi guys and girls how are you 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.640
 betis we are on route della sera ' 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.990
 this arid map of china rising over 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.990
 a game of team fish when 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.710
 with 21h and I'll tell you a secret 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.740
 battlefield 4 is broken everything started there 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.119
 for the year 1900 seriously the past end 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.440
 I was out of my house 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.869
 spending the weekend at my 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.490
 girlfriend and I connected before and friends I 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.350
 they said that the last update that 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.240
 had received battle 4 can be a 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.710
 fucking santa shit that there was no who 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.630
 play that there was too much and is here and 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.489
 that there were too many bullshit and that 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.399
 it was unbearable that they had decided not to 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.469
 play and they recommended me that not even 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.180
 I went to play and I arrived at my house and 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.280
 following the advice of my friends 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.250
 I did not play battlefield directly 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.890
 4 however ignoring the advice of 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.149
 my friends then I decided to update the 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.399
 game in case I wanted to throw a 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.840
 split so update it from 800 mb 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.630
 of freshness that we do not know what they bring 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.920
 certainly not solutions 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.990
 sorry uncle closes the fire then clear 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.370
 that has fire damn is happening a 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.170
 couple of days until I came up with the 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.970
 bright idea to enter to take a 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.740
 game of battlefield 4 when I entered 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.600
 then the following happened but what 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.480
 first I thought is hey uncle battlefield 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.130
 4 and can not be so broken uncle if the 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.200
 problems are connection I have never 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.180
 had a good connection therefore by 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.010
 very bad that go now does not have to go 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.360
 much worse than how I was playing until 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.950
 now therefore I have been 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.240
 enjoying the game so far because 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.940
 I will not be able to continue enjoying the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.210
 game if it goes a little bit worse is not going to 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.470
 be so alarming yet and I was 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.180
 aware that the game could be 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.320
 really very broken because I listened 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.630
 the conversations of my friends 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.430
 I listened to the tone they used and 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.869
 they reiterated again and again that they did not 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.940
 could play battle that the 4 with the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.410
 last update still I wanted to 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.720
 see them I have to see it to me I do not 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.490
 you can tell me he hears uncle if you 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.710
 strips of a bridge from part of the 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.630
 legs I have to see it I have to 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.970
 pull me off the bridge split my legs 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.130
 and tell you hey uncle was right now 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.890
 I have the kneecap in my mouth now 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.270
 now I can say uncle you were right if you 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.960
 strips of a bridge from part of the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.490
 legs but you 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.990
 so nothing I decided to play 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.610
 select one of the weapons that best 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.380
 results give me what it is like 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.050
 Carache had her with her configuration 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.209

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.950

 night and take ass efficiency 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.680
 absolute efficiency let's look for the 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.390
 efficiency let's test if really 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.030
 this is so fucked up that you can not 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.680
 play reappear I start running 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.120
 looking for an enemy I am in operation 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.280
 locker I will not be long to find me 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.200
 first when I find him I caught him 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.989
 a little clueless starts shooting 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.420
 I have the advantage it's an easy low you 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.780
 I kill no complications and the second 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.860
 to kill I die I die mysteriously 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.730
 I'm dying there's no kind of 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.569
 explanation there is nothing simply 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.879
 die 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.530
 I do not get the damage I do not get anything 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.939
 you know here when they shoot you 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.379
 puts the screen in red and that indicates 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.620
 where are the damages coming from? 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.269
 and roll all good for nothing 0 null 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.829
 closed has been do not say do not finish it 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.480
 to believe it has been a pearl 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.549
 of the game whatever or I was not 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.170
 Attentive but I would swear it is that it has not 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.060
 there was no indication whatsoever that 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.079
 Someone shot me or I do not know what the fuck 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.370
 it's been good we'll corroborate what 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.409
 what happened is to say let's continue 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.780
 playing to see if it happens again if not 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.909
 playing I keep looking for the enemy when 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.379
 I turn to find an enemy in this 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.959
 occasion the enemy had the advantage 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.359
 I got caught in panties tried to react what 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.780
 as quickly as possible and suddenly 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.609
 I die uncle 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.069
 I die again without any kind of warning 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.260
 without any kind of sense uncle is not worth 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.790
 fucking bitch who killed me 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.519
 has killed according to the clinic in the lord 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.010
 which I was pointing to surely 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.099
 This gentleman did it all with 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.040
 normal normally that is to say he saw me 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.299
 he pointed me shot and so cool what 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.189
 happens is that I do not get or the 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.659
 information that is shooting me or 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.129
 the damage is coming to me or the 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.900
 damage indicator is not reaching me 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.440
 let's not say that the only thing that comes to me 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.240
 is 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.220
 I die is the only thing that comes to me 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.800
 no no no no i say broken this is delicate 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.300
 at least delicate I'm going to continue 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.100
 playing to see what comes back if 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.200
 it happens again I turn to find 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.340
 enemies on this occasion because they will be two 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.260
 enemies that were on their backs in a 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.090
 hallway but it's worth uncle I say this is a 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.830
 low very easy here there is no type 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.900
 of complication this I do with the 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.010
 dumb TV I shit on the whore I put on 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.110
 to shoot with the carache that is not 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.030
 fails a fucking bullet that shit and of 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.030
 suddenly when I charge 1 I go to 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.480
 shoot the second die uncle say 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.960
 OK fucking uncle has killed me 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.960
 Uncle on the back fucking fucking mother 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.150
 turn off the battlefield I left the toilet end 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.370
 you did not say it with the hope of 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.530
 that they fix it again with a future 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.680
 update but come on I have not gone back to 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.920
 play and games is everything after 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.200
 10 days I did not play profile more than that 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.550
 I'm not counting in 10 days and I'm not going to 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.590
 return to play battlefield until 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.690
 there's a new update if that 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.529
 update does not arrive so do not go back to 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.569
 play battlefield I have a total of 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:07.109
 two or three videos recorded two or three 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.949
 direct that I have not gone up for vaguería 

00:05:07.109 --> 00:05:10.419
 but it's all you're going to see 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.909
 battlefield until you solve this 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.799
 problem to me this makes me not want 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:17.079
 playing this game makes it a 

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:19.149
 game that is basically a game that does not 

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:20.619
 I like that he hears that a new one comes out 

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:22.839
 patch they get an update and what 

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:24.879
 they solve therefore perfect I enchanted of 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:27.219
 life I'm looking forward to playing again 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:29.229
 I have fun again I keep making videos 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:31.539
 and everything returns to normal that this 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.729
 it does not happen so it 's very simple I do not go back 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.989
 to play battlefield 4 and there's also no 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.729
 to do a drama for all this either 

00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:38.469
 you have to dramatize I explain when 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.569
 you play a video game that amuses you 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:41.589
 it entertains you that gives you a 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:43.119
 series of things when you leave 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:45.069
 provide not stop playing the 

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:47.439
 has more no there is no mystery in 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.849
 it the small difference is that I 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:51.399
 I have a YouTube channel to which 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.749
 there are subscribed 35 thousand people who are 

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:55.449
 waiting for me to upload battlefield videos 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:57.849
 Well, I'm telling you, it's going to 2004 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.319
 it's not going to be it's not going to be by essence 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:01.070
 reason why the game is so 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:02.630
 right now I do not like it 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.250
 battlefield 4 is a game that I like 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.570
 as it is designed mostly it has 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.730
 things that I do not like like the design of 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.310
 maps of some maps seem to me so many 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.230
 dirty but in general it's a game that 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.820
 I like a game that I like how 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.980
 is designed as it is intended as 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.180
 is now programmed well if I can not 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.680
 enjoy those good things that 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.440
 I consider that he has the game because of 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.820
 of the connection, it's clear that I'm going 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.790
 use my leisure time to play 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.740
 another video game is simple I have 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.830
 3 new battlefield I bought it makes a 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.300
 couple of days for pc I played it on 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.160
 playstation3 maybe it's time to 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.920
 try it on pc and hear if I go back to 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.600
 hook up then maybe upload videos from 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.980
 vitor filtres I started what is clear 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.390
 is that of battlefield 4 as such 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.640
 are the things I will not do anymore 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.710
 videos and in any of the ways I'm going to 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.580
 feel minimally guilty because I do not 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.810
 I'm going to stop making videos of 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.940
 battlefield for doing another kind of 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.290
 most popular content but I'll leave 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.900
 to make battlefield videos because 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.280
 battlefield 4 is broken is not my 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.870
 responsibility of responsibility of
