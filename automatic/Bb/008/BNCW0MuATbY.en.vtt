little bit different so what I like to

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.120 
little bit different so what I like to
do<00:00:16.510> every<00:00:16.930> once<00:00:17.109> in<00:00:17.199> a<00:00:17.289> while<00:00:17.320> is<00:00:17.800> do<00:00:18.100> a

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
do every once in a while is do a

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.690 
do every once in a while is do a
painting<00:00:18.490> based<00:00:19.360> on<00:00:19.630> one<00:00:19.960> color<00:00:20.550> for<00:00:21.550> this

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
painting based on one color for this

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.440 
painting based on one color for this
painting<00:00:22.060> I<00:00:22.210> did<00:00:22.270> a<00:00:23.190> tree<00:00:24.190> a<00:00:24.460> blue<00:00:25.120> tree

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 
painting I did a tree a blue tree

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.000 
painting I did a tree a blue tree
probably<00:00:25.869> you<00:00:25.930> don't<00:00:26.020> see<00:00:26.289> it<00:00:26.380> too<00:00:26.530> often<00:00:26.740> in

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
probably you don't see it too often in

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.130 
probably you don't see it too often in
nature<00:00:27.039> but<00:00:28.000> what<00:00:28.090> I<00:00:28.119> did<00:00:28.360> is<00:00:28.539> I<00:00:28.660> created<00:00:28.720> an

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
nature but what I did is I created an

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.510 
nature but what I did is I created an
entire<00:00:29.530> painting<00:00:29.949> based<00:00:30.760> on<00:00:31.000> blue<00:00:31.690> tones<00:00:32.520> so

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
entire painting based on blue tones so

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.299 
entire painting based on blue tones so
it's<00:00:33.670> kind<00:00:33.820> of<00:00:33.879> a<00:00:33.969> tonal<00:00:34.360> painting<00:00:34.750> in<00:00:34.930> a<00:00:35.020> way

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
it's kind of a tonal painting in a way

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.880 
it's kind of a tonal painting in a way
because<00:00:36.309> it's<00:00:36.429> all<00:00:36.579> based<00:00:36.789> on<00:00:37.030> blue<00:00:37.589> so<00:00:38.589> what

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
because it's all based on blue so what

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.259 
because it's all based on blue so what
you<00:00:38.980> can<00:00:39.129> try<00:00:39.309> to<00:00:39.370> do<00:00:39.670> is<00:00:40.409> create<00:00:41.409> a<00:00:41.620> painting

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
you can try to do is create a painting

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.239 
you can try to do is create a painting
take<00:00:43.269> four<00:00:43.989> or<00:00:44.109> five<00:00:44.289> different<00:00:44.739> tubes<00:00:44.920> of<00:00:45.190> a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:45.249 
take four or five different tubes of a

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:47.700 
take four or five different tubes of a
color<00:00:45.510> try<00:00:46.510> to<00:00:46.569> find<00:00:46.839> some<00:00:47.260> that<00:00:47.440> are<00:00:47.499> a<00:00:47.589> little

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
color try to find some that are a little

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.319 
color try to find some that are a little
warmer<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.429> some<00:00:48.670> that<00:00:48.789> are<00:00:48.909> a<00:00:48.940> little<00:00:49.059> cooler

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
warmer and some that are a little cooler

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.840 
warmer and some that are a little cooler
for<00:00:49.719> example<00:00:50.589> in<00:00:50.769> this<00:00:50.889> painting<00:00:51.219> I<00:00:51.550> used

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
for example in this painting I used

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.509 
for example in this painting I used
brilliant<00:00:52.449> blue<00:00:52.749> which<00:00:53.530> is<00:00:53.679> kind<00:00:53.920> of<00:00:54.010> cool<00:00:54.219> and

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
brilliant blue which is kind of cool and

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.660 
brilliant blue which is kind of cool and
a<00:00:54.929> cobalt<00:00:55.929> teal<00:00:56.260> which<00:00:56.649> is<00:00:56.679> a<00:00:56.799> greenish<00:00:57.219> blue

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
a cobalt teal which is a greenish blue

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.660 
a cobalt teal which is a greenish blue
which<00:00:58.120> is<00:00:58.269> a<00:00:58.299> little<00:00:58.659> bit<00:00:59.039> warmer<00:01:00.039> and<00:01:00.219> I<00:01:00.429> mix

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
which is a little bit warmer and I mix

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.250 
which is a little bit warmer and I mix
those<00:01:00.850> two<00:01:01.120> to<00:01:01.239> create<00:01:01.539> clouds<00:01:01.899> in<00:01:02.170> the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
those two to create clouds in the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.939 
those two to create clouds in the
background

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
background

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.920 
background
and<00:01:03.879> then<00:01:03.999> I<00:01:04.059> kind<00:01:04.390> of<00:01:04.449> based<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.900> entire

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
and then I kind of based the entire

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.950 
and then I kind of based the entire
painting<00:01:05.740> on<00:01:05.950> those<00:01:06.280> two<00:01:06.549> colors<00:01:06.940> and<00:01:07.390> what<00:01:07.930> I

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
painting on those two colors and what I

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.920 
painting on those two colors and what I
did<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.439> I<00:01:08.649> added<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.520> little<00:01:09.700> raw<00:01:09.969> umber<00:01:10.270> which

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
did is I added a little raw umber which

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.100 
did is I added a little raw umber which
is<00:01:11.079> a<00:01:11.110> warm<00:01:11.469> gray<00:01:11.890> to<00:01:12.729> create<00:01:13.360> hills<00:01:13.659> that<00:01:13.869> come

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
is a warm gray to create hills that come

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.260 
is a warm gray to create hills that come
out<00:01:14.289> into<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.710> foreground<00:01:15.159> create<00:01:16.060> a<00:01:16.119> little

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
out into the foreground create a little

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.840 
out into the foreground create a little
bit<00:01:16.360> of<00:01:16.450> distance<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:18.070> then<00:01:18.280> when<00:01:18.430> I<00:01:18.460> created

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
bit of distance and then when I created

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.450 
bit of distance and then when I created
the<00:01:19.030> tree<00:01:19.329> I<00:01:19.509> made<00:01:19.750> sure<00:01:19.930> I<00:01:19.990> used<00:01:20.350> all<00:01:21.219> those

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
the tree I made sure I used all those

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.490 
the tree I made sure I used all those
blue<00:01:21.789> colors<00:01:22.180> a<00:01:22.509> little<00:01:22.780> bit<00:01:22.869> of<00:01:22.960> raw<00:01:23.079> umber<00:01:23.350> a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
blue colors a little bit of raw umber a

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.800 
blue colors a little bit of raw umber a
little<00:01:23.859> bit<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:24.009> black<00:01:24.219> to<00:01:25.149> create<00:01:25.630> some

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
little bit of black to create some

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.300 
little bit of black to create some
contrast<00:01:26.439> and<00:01:27.000> create<00:01:28.000> a<00:01:28.030> neat<00:01:28.450> painting<00:01:28.930> I

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
contrast and create a neat painting I

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.940 
contrast and create a neat painting I
finished<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.460> painting<00:01:30.700> with<00:01:31.030> a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
finished the painting with a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.349 
finished the painting with a
interferance<00:01:32.950> blue<00:01:33.429> color<00:01:33.759> which<00:01:34.179> is

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
interferance blue color which is

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.359 
interferance blue color which is
basically<00:01:34.950> interference<00:01:35.950> paint<00:01:36.189> is

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
basically interference paint is

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.160 
basically interference paint is
basically<00:01:36.759> a<00:01:36.880> color<00:01:37.299> that<00:01:37.630> will<00:01:37.780> reflect

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
basically a color that will reflect

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.899 
basically a color that will reflect
light<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:38.890> kind<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:39.130> change<00:01:39.399> color<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.759> little

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
light and kind of change color a little

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.480 
light and kind of change color a little
bit<00:01:40.060> as<00:01:40.329> you<00:01:40.750> move<00:01:41.079> around<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.380> painting<00:01:41.799> so<00:01:42.460> I

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
bit as you move around the painting so I

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.849 
bit as you move around the painting so I
wanted<00:01:42.759> to<00:01:42.820> give<00:01:42.909> it<00:01:42.939> a<00:01:43.060> unique<00:01:43.420> look<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:44.649> add

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:44.859 
wanted to give it a unique look and add

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:47.370 
wanted to give it a unique look and add
the<00:01:45.429> interference<00:01:46.299> on<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.719> final<00:01:47.170> layer

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
the interference on the final layer

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.830 
the interference on the final layer
which<00:01:47.710> kind<00:01:47.920> of<00:01:48.009> gives<00:01:48.159> it<00:01:48.249> a<00:01:48.369> shimmer<00:01:48.840> and

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
which kind of gives it a shimmer and

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.440 
which kind of gives it a shimmer and
really<00:01:50.170> brings<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.619> tree<00:01:50.890> out<00:01:51.070> I<00:01:51.369> paid<00:01:52.270> the

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
really brings the tree out I paid the

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.840 
really brings the tree out I paid the
foreground<00:01:52.899> the<00:01:53.710> grass<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.460> few<00:01:54.640> little

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
foreground the grass and the few little

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.599 
foreground the grass and the few little
bushes<00:01:55.149> here<00:01:55.420> with<00:01:55.719> blue<00:01:55.990> as<00:01:56.229> well<00:01:56.609> and
