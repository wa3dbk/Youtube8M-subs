00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
of me likes the idea of the are being

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.960 
of me likes the idea of the are being
protruded<00:00:40.560> and<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.430> paint<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.760> black

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
protruded and that I can paint it black

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.300 
protruded and that I can paint it black
in<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.180> background<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.870> then<00:00:43.380> stain<00:00:43.920> over<00:00:44.130> it

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.310 
in the background and then stain over it

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.470 
in the background and then stain over it
like<00:00:44.580> that<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.000> think<00:00:45.150> I'm<00:00:45.210> going<00:00:45.330> to<00:00:45.390> go

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
see it's not perfect the used kind of

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.679 
see it's not perfect the used kind of
oblong<00:01:21.490> here<00:01:21.790> and<00:01:21.880> that<00:01:21.970> kind<00:01:22.149> of<00:01:22.180> thing<00:01:22.420> I

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
oblong here and that kind of thing I

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.950 
oblong here and that kind of thing I
went<00:01:23.320> ahead<00:01:23.409> and<00:01:23.649> had<00:01:24.310> my<00:01:24.670> little<00:01:24.850> point<00:01:25.659> tip

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
went ahead and had my little point tip

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.600 
went ahead and had my little point tip
put<00:01:26.200> in<00:01:26.320> there<00:01:26.470> to<00:01:26.680> give<00:01:26.829> it<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:27.070> sloped<00:01:27.399> edge

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
put in there to give it the sloped edge

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.670 
put in there to give it the sloped edge
and<00:01:27.970> then<00:01:28.600> I<00:01:28.810> went<00:01:28.960> ahead<00:01:29.079> and<00:01:29.229> came<00:01:29.380> back<00:01:29.439> with

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
and then I went ahead and came back with

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.130 
and then I went ahead and came back with
a<00:01:29.710> flat<00:01:29.950> bit<00:01:30.399> and<00:01:30.700> smoothed<00:01:31.570> out<00:01:31.689> the<00:01:31.750> bottom

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
a flat bit and smoothed out the bottom

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.779 
a flat bit and smoothed out the bottom
so<00:01:32.320> it<00:01:32.560> gave<00:01:32.710> a<00:01:32.740> little<00:01:32.860> bit<00:01:32.979> nicer<00:01:33.310> look<00:01:33.549> I

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
so it gave a little bit nicer look I

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.999 
so it gave a little bit nicer look I
also<00:01:34.330> sprayed<00:01:35.080> a<00:01:35.110> lot<00:01:35.259> of<00:01:35.409> black<00:01:35.560> paint<00:01:35.799> down

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
also sprayed a lot of black paint down

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.649 
also sprayed a lot of black paint down
there<00:01:36.220> cover<00:01:36.549> the<00:01:36.670> top<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.060> black<00:01:37.210> paint<00:01:37.479> also

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
there cover the top and black paint also

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.749 
there cover the top and black paint also
then<00:01:38.259> I<00:01:38.320> went<00:01:38.439> back<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:38.770> sanded<00:01:39.130> off<00:01:39.250> most<00:01:39.670> of

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
then I went back and sanded off most of

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.580 
then I went back and sanded off most of
the<00:01:39.880> black<00:01:40.060> paint<00:01:40.360> on<00:01:40.479> top<00:01:40.659> so<00:01:41.289> it<00:01:41.350> kind<00:01:41.530> of

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
the black paint on top so it kind of

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.080 
the black paint on top so it kind of
gives<00:01:41.710> it<00:01:41.829> a<00:01:41.890> little<00:01:41.979> bit<00:01:42.130> older<00:01:42.460> rustic<00:01:42.880> look

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
gives it a little bit older rustic look

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.120 
gives it a little bit older rustic look
I'll<00:01:43.539> probably<00:01:43.780> come<00:01:44.020> in<00:01:44.049> here<00:01:44.530> on<00:01:44.679> like<00:01:45.039> the
