00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.740
 hello everyone in this video I will teach 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.050
 to create a text with an effect of a 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.180
 liquid coverage or a public effect 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.650
 so good we are going to do first 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.230
 place we have to with a text that does not 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.060
 we can do it with the grace that if 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.740
 it will not look bad on us so we're going to 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.350
 doing it puts the text tool and 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.180
 later what as an exclusion that 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.989
 when the text then text for example 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.989
 with a fountain 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.340
 if it is more or less 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.340
 and now he applied the instruction 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.140
 and increased the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.320
 the 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.820
 depth of were social 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.650
 something like that more or less then 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.150
 I'm also going to put a little lid on it 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.480
 with singing to make it better to the 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.480
 view 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.950
 the steps we can create I think it's 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.950
 that 's fine 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.530
 and let's start applying it 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.409
 the effect of this on the coverage 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.409
 liquid then for that let's go to sera 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.120
 I'm going to lower the radio 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.040
 and not things for himself more or less 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.680
 and that is already 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.260
 from the extremes 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.460
 then I will clone this sphere with 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.460
 the move to clone 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.790
 but I'm not going to put you here in mode 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.280
 put object that has as object 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.680
 we drag the expression that is the text 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.530
 what have we done 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.780
 then we would stay this 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.920
 Once we have it, we can 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.229
 go 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.580
 true institution and instead of vertex 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:18.120
 we put volume and then I think that between 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:20.400
 200 and 300 250 more or less what 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.670
 we look then once we have 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.650
 this we are going to make a goal bowl with 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:32.170
 all the balls then we're going to 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:35.980
 here metabol and we add the end 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.440
 then to the goal what we will do 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.080
 will take him down or be 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.740
 raise the value of the cover so that 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.480
 I know we say a species also follows 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.790
 being a taste how they stay if what 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.470
 analyze of flat completion 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.930
 erection then it is changing and it goes 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.100
 changing the shape of the liquid 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.930
 then here in the goal bolt also 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.609
 we are going to do them 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.829
 you can change the subdivisions crime 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.829
 as you want whenever you want better 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.820
 and the thing 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.820
 it's okay 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.239
 Y 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.180
 and 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.019
 the subdivisions of the 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.390
 editor 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.530
 Beware of going through why this will happen 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:32.879
 that if you see we go down a lot disappears in 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.780
 some time so it's coming more or 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.110
 less 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.000
 / even in 2 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.020
 and as you can see we have already created this 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.020
 kind of liquid 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:55.550
 in the rendering you see but of all 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.270
 forms even if it's done that does not 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.630
 you can show some object you can 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.770
 change him 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.770
 the generation 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.240
 but I liked how it looks like once 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.460
 done this because it is only applying the 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.239
 textures that you expect for example 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:20.900
 we could put the red text and leave it 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.230
 white metabolism then you put in the 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.230
 angle 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.840
 the text is liza the rendering 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.139
 and if you will be staying one more thing or 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.870
 less so 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.510
 so 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.820
 I hope that something green has served you 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.910
 tutorial as you see has an effect 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.190
 quite simple and very easy to do 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.560
 so nothing left you in the beginning the 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.750
 video as always the final result and 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.750
 we close and until the next
