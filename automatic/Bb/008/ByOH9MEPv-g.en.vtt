00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello friends this guy everything good that 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.540
 I like today it's about beer 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.220
 really needs advertising with 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.410
 The topic was more or less 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.150
 this week when I was talking to 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.530
 My girlfriend, I do not think it 's 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.360
 It's true that last week I was 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.760
 talking about the fact that we had 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.710
 against a survey where it is 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.960
 she was currently drinking both 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.150
 as the man more than formerly the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.619
 20 years ago, there were about two 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.720
 cans that I did not go out with friends 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.730
 and that the man drank about six 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.430
 and that currently women 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.739
 they can not consume so much or 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.840
 more with how much and she said so 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.730
 I do not like advertising wherever 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.559
 been a hot girl in advertising that 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.239
 thing has what seems to them the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.770
 public building drinks beer to people 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.539
 It has seen that this is not true this 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.879
 research you are talking about is already a 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.610
 neighborhood of a proof that the public 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.129
 still good, too. 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.960
 beer that you do not have is less than 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.760
 18 years and maybe you do not know that I'm 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.250
 Speaking what I mean is more or less. 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.170
 so it is not not a product made 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.820
 only for women understands is not a 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.239
 product made only for the man who 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.220
 Windows 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.010
 I think it's bullshit but the main subject. 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.570
 It's the beer advertisement she has to 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.490
 be made only for man tends 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.220
 always having a tasty advertisement, I 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.780
 I think it's pathetic becc 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.100
 many advertisers should face each other 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.860
 with this kind of positioning that I 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.509
 I'll see what I see now, it's painting. 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.759
 I'm in communication with the whole game. 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.740
 a start carteirada yes I 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.990
 I want to convince you that point is 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.600
 pushed on because why is one is a 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.430
 product consumed by the wobbly sleeps 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.720
 two gêneros console only I speak 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.270
 just an advertisement that she 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.610
 wants to go around where she talks 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.079
 there are several older people and one more young man 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.450
 new drinking beer and everyone talking 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.890
 about the power of this beer issue not 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.990
 I'll say the mark up because in the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.540
 Democracy is not the thing is as follows 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.130
 advertising that 50 years ago 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.990
 the marquise this end to wash my 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.120
 but how good it is that she exists 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.790
 continues to improve the taste is the face 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.920
 newest the pseudo the advertiser 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.140
 I want to play that all and put a 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.370
 of our advertising will reach 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.350
 a younger audience 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.030
 the old man who comes here to dismantle all 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.399
 hour the fear of the guy is who wants to drink 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.430
 beer drinks our beer to see 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.250
 The rain should be hot there. 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.270
 Because something is selling to you. 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.590
 advertising for the young audience because 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.350
 have to be calm is that climate of 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.870
 Quito drinks beer or mount encircling 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.580
 people in stock drinking drinking stands 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.620
 finding the world more beautiful then everything 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.570
 half drunk things multiply then 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.850
 if the person is very pretty logic more 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.440
 still if the guy is very cool he is more 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.720
 cool still quoted a best friend friend 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.730
 who is going to talk a ride today and if 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.350
 baby do not have that annoying face will stay 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.060
 even more annoying than is the case with some 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.060
 people right I will not name names because 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.580
 on point is more but this if you do not 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.500
 Do you understand beer? Do you look for beers? 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.600
 That it was tasty then what he could 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.940
 people tried to want there right? 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.620
 or else totally looking the taste for 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.120
 I like the beer or the use of 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.459
 end product a thing that it is by 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.440
 quality we got behind there was a project 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.880
 I researched and could not find more than 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.010
 I remember when I was in college or 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.799
 a project to stop one day using 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.739
 semi naked women in advertisements for 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.720
 that this reaches an audience x and de facto 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.549
 This has improved because it does not exist anymore. 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.820
 so much publicity there in the 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.230
 communication where sport the female choir 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.580
 sincerely I the best bands to 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.799
 me of beers cases that do not 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.600
 involve this kind of attitude of things 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.489
 are more open to advertising 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.860
 anderson silva from a beer to work 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.690
 on top of a fight mark understood 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.090
 not necessarily involves 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.739
 directly the body as a thing one 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.290
 thing what people want as 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.850
 I desire but not her it promotes the flavor 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.650
 of the thing and even try some long 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.360
 Proof of the advertising is very good. 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.220
 saying good times are coming to 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.630
 understood that it exists in advertisements in 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.430
 a big savings my girlfriend 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.620
 even spoke until an advertisement that 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.909
 She lived in São Paulo from a store. 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.799
 but she was never a baby but the 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:53.230
 propaganda caught the attention played a role 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.849
 as landmark advertising and I think that 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.159
 communication student knows that when 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.730
 you see something elite brand has fulfilled with the 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.200
 paper 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.549
 sometimes it's not that I thing 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.860
 I need this because I saw the advertisement 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.780
 not sometimes I remembered that because I 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.790
 had been working cited he accomplished this 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.260
 Congratulations, you were able to create this piece 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.290
 in my circle of friends 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.250
 Look at the granddaughter sleeping more until they are the 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.440
 boys who are already much more 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.690
 will and in child ended up marking 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.669
 kind back a cell at the end of the day will 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.070
 take to fill it with your friends who 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.229
 effectiveness by avoiding that thing of 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.180
 Sieving on the back knows 'quarry' I 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.220
 I already talked in another video that are the 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.070
 faces that are already known or something that 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.229
 I think with your papinhos of race and 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.240
 that fell from the sky because today this 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.710
 kind of subject understood the face of it 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.080
 I accept but are not there for that 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.600
 typical take a book you see me 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.250
 I think that every commercial that involves 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.350
 hot it already is kinda expected 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.419
 so she needs to grab a 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.039
 public and the public think my god this 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.539
 beer is good because for example the 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.849
 nicole bahls appeared with a glass of 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.310
 beer in hand there stay my god then 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.440

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.910
 because the focus was 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.830
 living from the study a half bizarre bid 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.690
 what happened a woman's time ago 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.849
 who never drank beer turned girl 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.500
 advertisement for a beer is that point 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.050
 that I arrive and tend does not have to 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.450
 involved does not have to involve the 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.430
 a beautiful woman to sell more can 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.160
 just do a simple advertisement 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.930
 She sells beer. I live in the river. 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.940

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.070

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.080
 Thousand Semi-Woman Bodies and Women 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.660
