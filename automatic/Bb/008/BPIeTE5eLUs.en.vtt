00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.380
the ingredients you'll need biscuits are marias

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.640
in this case we will need about two, I have 4

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.420
if I need more

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.740
so it is optional

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.960
we will also need peaches in syrup

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:50.100

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.220
1 can of condensed milk

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.960
we will use lemons, if small, I recommend that are about 4 or 5 lemons,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:16.240
Also, half cream, here I have two but you can use only one

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.000
1 can evaporated milk

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.880
1 loaf, where we will place our carlota

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.780
and finally, it is indispensable blender

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.580
well, already having all this hands wing work

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.760
our blender then we will pour

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
our evaporated milk

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.520

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.720
lemon juice

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.420
lemon helps to give a thick consistency to the mix

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:49.060
well, since we have this, we will liquefy until it begins to thicken

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:57.600
the next step is, soaked in syrup cookies peaches

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:12.260
once the first layer having, let's pour what we have liquefied

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.980
continue with the second layer, as, by the same method

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:52.500
cookies bathe in the juice syrup, make another layer, consecutively what we have liquefied, the thick paste

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.860
see that is easy and simple

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.500
Best of all, is that tastes delicious

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.880
and so we follow up the layers they want to put

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:58.200
after each layer, you can place the diced peaches in syrup.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.760
We place it around

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:29.060
well, we put the last layer, we'll garnish with sliced peaches, this is an option, but you can decorate as they like

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.900
after we put in the refrigerator, if they did at night, let it sit overnight

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:47.640
if they did in the day, let it stand for about two hours, until it is completely cold

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:56.060
