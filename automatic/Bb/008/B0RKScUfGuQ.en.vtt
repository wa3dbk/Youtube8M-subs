and also to talk I do stickers it's not

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.279 
and also to talk I do stickers it's not
just<00:01:39.979> about<00:01:40.159> making<00:01:40.459> cars<00:01:40.970> safer<00:01:41.840> but

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
just about making cars safer but

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.590 
just about making cars safer but
improving<00:01:42.799> driving<00:01:43.369> pleasure<00:01:43.640> -<00:01:44.060> this<00:01:44.299> is<00:01:44.450> the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
improving driving pleasure - this is the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.010 
improving driving pleasure - this is the
Infiniti<00:01:45.670> g37<00:01:46.670> s<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:47.420> it's<00:01:47.539> being<00:01:47.660> used<00:01:47.750> for

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
Infiniti g37 s and it's being used for

00:01:48.020 --> 00:02:00.330 
Infiniti g37 s and it's being used for
test<00:01:48.520> something<00:01:49.520> pretty<00:01:49.729> special<00:01:50.030> too

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.639 

so<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.030> challenge<00:02:01.479> for<00:02:01.750> engineers<00:02:01.840> has<00:02:02.470> long

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
so the challenge for engineers has long

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.039 
so the challenge for engineers has long
been<00:02:02.860> how<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.130> get<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.579> right<00:02:03.790> kind<00:02:04.119> of<00:02:04.360> direct

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
been how to get the right kind of direct

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.530 
been how to get the right kind of direct
feel<00:02:05.530> in<00:02:06.189> the<00:02:06.430> steering<00:02:06.939> so<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:07.240> driver

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
feel in the steering so the driver

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.050 
feel in the steering so the driver
really<00:02:07.840> feels<00:02:08.200> involved<00:02:08.890> with<00:02:09.069> hustling<00:02:09.849> the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
really feels involved with hustling the

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.770 
really feels involved with hustling the
car<00:02:10.300> along<00:02:11.260> now<00:02:11.680> in<00:02:12.069> most<00:02:12.430> cars<00:02:12.760> if<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.660> go

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
car along now in most cars if you go

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.500 
car along now in most cars if you go
over<00:02:13.930> bumps<00:02:14.170> like<00:02:14.410> these<00:02:14.739> manholes<00:02:15.550> here<00:02:15.849> you

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
over bumps like these manholes here you

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.140 
over bumps like these manholes here you
get<00:02:16.599> a<00:02:16.660> lot<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.900> judder<00:02:17.290> in<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.790> steering

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
get a lot of judder in the steering

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.220 
get a lot of judder in the steering
wheel<00:02:20.310> but<00:02:21.310> not<00:02:21.459> this<00:02:21.580> one<00:02:21.849> in<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.150> car<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
wheel but not this one in this car the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.979 
wheel but not this one in this car the
steering<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:24.120> electronic<00:02:25.120> there's<00:02:25.840> no

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
steering is electronic there's no

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.140 
steering is electronic there's no
mechanical<00:02:26.380> link<00:02:27.069> most<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.640> time<00:02:27.880> between

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
mechanical link most of the time between

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.930 
mechanical link most of the time between
the<00:02:28.540> steering<00:02:28.810> wheel<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:30.099> wheel<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:30.610> even

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
the steering wheel and the wheel so even

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.729 
the steering wheel and the wheel so even
if<00:02:31.000> you<00:02:31.150> go<00:02:31.300> over<00:02:31.569> really<00:02:31.750> quite<00:02:32.080> big<00:02:32.350> bumps

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
if you go over really quite big bumps

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:33.479 
if you go over really quite big bumps
like<00:02:32.830> this

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
like this

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.690 
like this
these<00:02:34.269> are<00:02:34.450> ruts<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:34.930> road<00:02:35.580> there's<00:02:36.580> no

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
these are ruts in the road there's no

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.670 
these are ruts in the road there's no
chatter<00:02:36.970> at<00:02:37.120> all<00:02:39.120> it's<00:02:40.120> quite<00:02:40.269> hard<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.510> see

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
chatter at all it's quite hard to see

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
chatter at all it's quite hard to see
but<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:41.739> can<00:02:41.769> tell<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.190> feels<00:02:42.430> pretty

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
but I can tell you it feels pretty

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.949 
but I can tell you it feels pretty
extraordinary<00:02:43.060> driving<00:02:43.690> it

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.559 

it's<00:02:47.799> not<00:02:47.950> like<00:02:48.129> driving<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.849> video<00:02:49.180> game

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
it's not like driving a video game

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.289 
it's not like driving a video game
though<00:02:49.870> I'm<00:02:50.290> changing<00:02:50.739> lanes<00:02:51.299> pretty

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
though I'm changing lanes pretty

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.130 
though I'm changing lanes pretty
aggressively<00:02:52.810> here<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:55.030> can<00:02:55.299> really<00:02:55.569> feel

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
aggressively here you can really feel

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.880 
aggressively here you can really feel
the<00:02:56.530> road<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.980> steering<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:58.750> very<00:02:58.930> direct<00:02:59.590> and

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
the road the steering is very direct and

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.610 
the road the steering is very direct and
this<00:03:00.189> technology<00:03:00.609> this<00:03:01.030> next-generation

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
this technology this next-generation

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.470 
this technology this next-generation
steering<00:03:02.620> could<00:03:03.489> be<00:03:03.579> available<00:03:04.030> as<00:03:04.150> early<00:03:04.269> as

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
steering could be available as early as
