00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.619
 well guys here 75 70 well between that here 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.439
 on my channel 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.430
 in this video we want to show you here 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.460
 the bank's position 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.619
 yes yes guys the bank comes back and is 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.419
 exactly the same as the transit one 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.300
 in practice you have to go to the room 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.640
 where there are all the silhouettes of weapons 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.829
 he had to do a little drawing 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.120
 little bit of underground tunnel and vi 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.720
 you will find in the bank 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.670
 be careful though that the bank is not 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.620
 has output that is only the way 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.780
 where have you arrived so I recommend you 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.610
 if you need to withdraw or deposit the money 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.290
 in the bank to go there eg fine 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.570
 round while someone is a lame one 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.620
 also because if not here in there 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.520
 closes that a beauty 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.010
 then you can almost see guys that 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:05.089
 once at the beginning is what gets you 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.909
 therefore they deposit the money every every 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.150
 others you press icsi I take they settle 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.159
 1000 points but there is on the other side yes 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.740
 can withdraw 1000 points with always 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.079
 the usual cost of 100 points 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.479
 in practice it is the same thing itself 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:23.719
 identical thing of transit the bank ea 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.579
 about transit the money should 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.109
 be connected then and if you have 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.929
 already a nice nest egg on transit 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:31.729
 we say that almost from horse and therefore 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.979
 to already have money even with 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.990
 therefore a thing that really sucks 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.079
 There is very convenient also you have not told me 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.630
 found here you can see the two 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.179
 keys and maybe we'll do another video 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.579
 maybe online because now I'll explain 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.130
 those two that you can practice if yes 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.670
 owns the teaser ie the brass knuckles e 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:56.779
 if you pull a sponge in fact they activate a 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:00.079
 that that we say that button is in 

00:01:56.779 --> 00:02:03.999
 practice you can pass the money on points 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.999
 you can pass points to your companions 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.990
 maybe this afternoon we try to do 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.509
 an online match 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.820
 we report a gameplay on this visa 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.230
 that in single I don't think you can 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.760
 pass the money yourself also because 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.440
 it wouldn't make much sense 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.510
 I said this guy or the bank have told you 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.360
 also the position is explained a bit 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.040
 how much above 300 I like it so much 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.780
 comment on ischia ci from the channel always 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.290
 you didn't look good see you at 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.290
 next video
