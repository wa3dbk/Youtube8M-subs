00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.050 

so<00:00:15.689> we're<00:00:16.689> having<00:00:16.840> a<00:00:17.550> 528<00:00:18.550> megahertz

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
so we're having a 528 megahertz

flexibility when it comes pouring on

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.740 
flexibility when it comes pouring on
there<00:00:35.949> it's<00:00:36.280> maybe<00:00:36.820> the<00:00:36.940> most<00:00:37.239> powerful

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
there it's maybe the most powerful

there it's maybe the most powerful
platform<00:00:38.170> in<00:00:38.589> the<00:00:38.710> industry<00:00:39.160> and<00:00:39.460> let<00:00:39.879> me<00:00:39.970> show

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.880 
surface like this you will see the fish
comes<00:00:47.110> swimming<00:00:47.199> to<00:00:47.680> my<00:00:47.799> finger<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:50.559> is<00:00:50.739> how

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
comes swimming to my finger this is how

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:58.079 
comes swimming to my finger this is how
we<00:00:51.040> chose<00:00:51.309> to<00:00:51.670> take<00:00:51.879> use<00:00:52.119> of<00:00:52.330> the<00:00:52.530> 528<00:00:57.089> it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
we chose to take use of the 528 it

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.399 
we chose to take use of the 528 it
actually<00:00:58.540> makes<00:01:00.869> and<00:01:01.869> just<00:01:02.019> have<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.199> look<00:01:02.290> at

actually makes and just have a look at
it<00:01:02.439> is<00:01:02.680> really<00:01:03.040> powerful<00:01:03.570> when<00:01:04.570> I<00:01:04.600> drag<00:01:05.290> my

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
it is really powerful when I drag my

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.969 
it is really powerful when I drag my
finger<00:01:05.470> like<00:01:05.830> this<00:01:05.950> table<00:01:06.340> phone<00:01:07.920> isn't<00:01:08.920> it

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979

agree this is maybe the most used to use

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.380 
agree this is maybe the most used to use
the<00:01:25.390> screen<00:01:25.689> tang<00:01:26.429> maybe<00:01:27.429> this<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.210> most

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
the screen tang maybe this is the most

you okay I'm powerpoint i can do excel
sheet<00:02:39.560> but<00:02:39.980> just<00:02:40.160> having<00:02:40.490> this<00:02:40.610> here<00:02:40.850> shows

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
sheet but just having this here shows

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.080 
sheet but just having this here shows
you<00:02:41.150> what<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:41.900> can<00:02:42.260> do<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:43.459> technology

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
you what you can do and that technology

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.810 
you what you can do and that technology
is<00:02:44.120> fun<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:45.650> when<00:02:45.770> i<00:02:45.860> say<00:02:46.070> that<00:02:46.100> this<00:02:46.640> is

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
is fun and when i say that this is

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.570 
is fun and when i say that this is
exactly<00:02:47.000> when<00:02:47.930> sony<00:02:48.200> ericsson<00:02:48.590> DNA<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.280> all

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
exactly when sony ericsson DNA is all

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.820 
exactly when sony ericsson DNA is all
about<00:02:49.850> yes<00:02:50.360> so<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:50.840> is<00:02:50.959> what<00:02:51.140> we<00:02:51.350> bring<00:02:51.590> into

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
about yes so this is what we bring into

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.430 
about yes so this is what we bring into
the<00:02:52.070> equation<00:02:52.520> working<00:02:52.880> with<00:02:53.030> little<00:02:53.360> this<00:02:54.260> is

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
the equation working with little this is

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.530 
the equation working with little this is
a<00:02:54.470> first<00:02:55.040> Pollock<00:02:55.700> first<00:02:56.209> fish<00:02:58.120> but<00:02:59.120> there<00:02:59.510> are

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
a first Pollock first fish but there are

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.290 
a first Pollock first fish but there are
lots<00:02:59.810> of<00:03:00.050> seats<00:03:00.440> already<00:03:00.680> here<00:03:01.100> maybe<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:02.060> can

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
lots of seats already here maybe you can

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.960 
lots of seats already here maybe you can
also<00:03:02.510> imagine<00:03:02.990> in<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.410> future<00:03:03.520> to<00:03:04.520> utilize

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
also imagine in the future to utilize

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.540 
also imagine in the future to utilize
this<00:03:05.150> fish<00:03:05.510> but<00:03:06.260> this<00:03:06.500> is<00:03:06.680> also<00:03:06.920> energized

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
this fish but this is also energized

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.300 
this fish but this is also energized
communication<00:03:08.230> maybe<00:03:09.230> somehow<00:03:09.769> connect

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
communication maybe somehow connect

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.370 
communication maybe somehow connect
person-to-person<00:03:10.880> communication<00:03:11.600> through

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
person-to-person communication through

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.420 
person-to-person communication through
this<00:03:12.620> fish<00:03:12.910> maybe<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.930> already<00:03:15.769> is<00:03:15.890> some<00:03:16.160> kind

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
this fish maybe so already is some kind

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.479 
this fish maybe so already is some kind
of<00:03:16.550> you<00:03:16.760> know<00:03:16.790> she's<00:03:17.360> here<00:03:17.720> so<00:03:18.590> please<00:03:18.890> expect

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
of you know she's here so please expect

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.199 
of you know she's here so please expect
we<00:03:20.480> will<00:03:20.630> provide<00:03:21.220> concentrate<00:03:22.220> new<00:03:22.850> fish

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
we will provide concentrate new fish

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.720 
we will provide concentrate new fish
