the latest generation of the fancy foam
Anubis<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.170> an<00:00:22.350> airplane<00:00:22.590> designed

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
Anubis this is an airplane designed

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.910 
Anubis this is an airplane designed
specifically<00:00:23.760> for<00:00:23.880> at<00:00:24.240> 3<00:00:24.539> p<00:00:24.750> which<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.019> indoor

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
specifically for at 3 p which is indoor

specifically for at 3 p which is indoor
precision<00:00:26.550> aerobatics<00:00:27.500> this<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> latest

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
precision aerobatics this is the latest

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.009 
precision aerobatics this is the latest
one<00:00:29.189> couple<00:00:30.000> little<00:00:30.119> design<00:00:30.480> changes<00:00:30.869> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
one couple little design changes the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.229 
one couple little design changes the
most<00:00:31.170> notable<00:00:31.560> thing<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.949> it's<00:00:32.160> almost<00:00:32.759> all

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
most notable thing is it's almost all

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.959 
most notable thing is it's almost all
cutout<00:00:33.750> foam<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.469> covered<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.280> mylar<00:00:35.550> because

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
cutout foam and covered in mylar because

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.410 
cutout foam and covered in mylar because
that<00:00:36.090> makes<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.390> super<00:00:36.630> super<00:00:37.110> lightweight

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
that makes it super super lightweight

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.690 
that makes it super super lightweight
we've<00:00:39.960> got<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.800> know<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.100> all<00:00:41.250> carbon

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
we've got it you know it's all carbon

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.610 
we've got it you know it's all carbon
brace<00:00:41.970> much<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:42.570> most<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.050> regular<00:00:43.380> foam

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
brace much like most of the regular foam

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.560 
brace much like most of the regular foam
right<00:00:43.829> that's<00:00:44.550> that's<00:00:45.000> probably<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.390> little

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
right that's that's probably a little

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.119 
right that's that's probably a little
bit<00:00:45.750> hard<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> see<00:00:46.290> for<00:00:46.530> him<00:00:46.620> by<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:46.950> you

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
bit hard to see for him by but you

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.880 
bit hard to see for him by but you
actually<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.640> carbon<00:00:48.120> fiber<00:00:48.440> all<00:00:49.440> over<00:00:49.800> this

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
actually have carbon fiber all over this

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.420 
actually have carbon fiber all over this
airplane

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
airplane

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.460 
airplane
yeah<00:00:50.699> there's<00:00:51.030> little<00:00:51.390> little<00:00:51.629> rods<00:00:52.020> and

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
yeah there's little little rods and

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.660 
yeah there's little little rods and
tubes<00:00:52.920> all<00:00:53.399> over<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> bottom<00:00:54.180> yeah<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.830> then

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
tubes all over the bottom yeah and then

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.509 
tubes all over the bottom yeah and then
special<00:00:57.330> little<00:00:57.570> laser-cut<00:00:58.140> pieces<00:00:58.650> one<00:00:59.400> of

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
special little laser-cut pieces one of

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:00.799 
special little laser-cut pieces one of
the<00:00:59.610> neat<00:00:59.760> things<00:00:59.790> about<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.300> airplane<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
the neat things about this airplane the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.810 
the neat things about this airplane the
wings<00:01:00.960> are<00:01:01.199> actually<00:01:01.410> removable<00:01:02.220> so<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.519> take

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
wings are actually removable so to take

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.790 
wings are actually removable so to take
those<00:01:03.000> two<00:01:03.269> screws<00:01:03.780> out<00:01:04.050> right<00:01:04.320> there<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.619> one

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
those two screws out right there and one

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.830 
those two screws out right there and one
on<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:04.979> bottom<00:01:05.159> right<00:01:05.460> pop<00:01:06.060> both<00:01:06.300> wings<00:01:06.600> off

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
on the bottom right pop both wings off

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.800 
on the bottom right pop both wings off
and<00:01:07.050> stick<00:01:07.259> it<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.560> small<00:01:07.770> box<00:01:08.210> okay<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.509> this

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
and stick it in a small box okay so this

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.420 
and stick it in a small box okay so this
is<00:01:10.050> looks<00:01:10.680> like<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.860> would<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.250> very

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
is looks like it would be a very

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.310 
is looks like it would be a very
aerobatic<00:01:12.119> airplane

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
aerobatic airplane

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.930 
aerobatic airplane
what's<00:01:13.800> the<00:01:13.979> all<00:01:14.130> up<00:01:14.369> weight<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:14.789> this

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
what's the all up weight on this

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.570 
what's the all up weight on this
airplane<00:01:15.149> airplane<00:01:15.539> is<00:01:15.810> only<00:01:15.930> 52<00:01:16.380> grams<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
airplane airplane is only 52 grams the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.249 
airplane airplane is only 52 grams the
weight<00:01:17.729> battery<00:01:18.180> ready<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.780> throw<00:01:18.990> into<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
weight battery ready to throw into the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.510 
weight battery ready to throw into the
air<00:01:19.380> 50<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.830> 52<00:01:20.369> grams

air 50 to 52 grams

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.639 
air 50 to 52 grams
well<00:01:22.939> I<00:01:22.970> think<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.329> pack<00:01:23.630> of<00:01:23.659> Tic<00:01:24.110> Tacs<00:01:24.380> weighs

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
well I think a pack of Tic Tacs weighs

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.350 
well I think a pack of Tic Tacs weighs
more<00:01:24.860> than<00:01:24.920> this<00:01:25.159> very<00:01:25.310> much<00:01:25.549> yep

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
more than this very much yep

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.020 
more than this very much yep
well<00:01:27.320> tell<00:01:27.680> me<00:01:27.829> a<00:01:27.860> little<00:01:28.009> bit<00:01:28.159> about<00:01:28.610> this

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
well tell me a little bit about this

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.999 
well tell me a little bit about this
this<00:01:29.450> really<00:01:29.780> caught<00:01:29.990> my<00:01:30.170> yeah

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
this really caught my yeah

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.460 
this really caught my yeah
so<00:01:31.399> this<00:01:31.610> is<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:31.909> Alexi<00:01:32.450> Lance<00:01:32.659> off<00:01:32.930> contra

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
so this is the Alexi Lance off contra

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.620 
so this is the Alexi Lance off contra
rotating<00:01:33.649> propeller<00:01:34.369> system<00:01:34.670> do<00:01:35.420> look

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
rotating propeller system do look

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.300 
rotating propeller system do look
there's<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:35.930> single<00:01:36.259> motor<00:01:36.530> here<00:01:36.860> but<00:01:37.039> it<00:01:37.130> uses

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
there's a single motor here but it uses

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.880 
there's a single motor here but it uses
pulleys<00:01:37.939> to<00:01:37.970> drive<00:01:38.450> two<00:01:39.140> propellers<00:01:39.590> in

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
pulleys to drive two propellers in

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.149 
pulleys to drive two propellers in
opposite<00:01:40.369> directions<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.990> that's<00:01:42.560> very<00:01:42.979> very

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
opposite directions and that's very very

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.469 
opposite directions and that's very very
helpful<00:01:43.460> for<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.909> f3p

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
helpful for the f3p

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.440 
helpful for the f3p
aerobatic<00:01:45.490> because<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:46.580> removes<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.119> torque

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
aerobatic because it removes the torque

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.539 
aerobatic because it removes the torque
and<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:48.020> P<00:01:48.229> factor<00:01:48.679> from<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:48.950> airplane<00:01:49.189> so

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
and the P factor from the airplane so

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.550 
and the P factor from the airplane so
with<00:01:50.000> a<00:01:50.060> normal<00:01:50.390> foamy<00:01:50.780> if<00:01:50.990> you<00:01:51.170> go<00:01:51.259> to<00:01:51.320> hover

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
with a normal foamy if you go to hover

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.950 
with a normal foamy if you go to hover
it'll<00:01:51.950> torque<00:01:52.280> roll<00:01:52.520> by<00:01:52.700> itself<00:01:53.000> really<00:01:53.450> this

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
it'll torque roll by itself really this

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.169 
it'll torque roll by itself really this
won't<00:01:54.229> do<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:54.860> this<00:01:55.549> no<00:01:55.850> matter<00:01:56.000> what

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
won't do that and this no matter what

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:57.669 
won't do that and this no matter what
speed<00:01:56.509> you<00:01:56.659> fly<00:01:56.869> it<00:01:56.929> out<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.259> rudder<00:01:57.470> trim

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
speed you fly it out the rudder trim

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.740 
speed you fly it out the rudder trim
never<00:01:57.979> changes<00:01:58.459> so<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.729> makes<00:01:58.880> it<00:01:59.060> much<00:01:59.479> much

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
never changes so it makes it much much

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.930 
never changes so it makes it much much
easier<00:01:59.810> to<00:02:00.259> fly<00:02:00.440> precision<00:02:00.979> aerobatics<00:02:01.159> okay

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
easier to fly precision aerobatics okay

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.760 
easier to fly precision aerobatics okay
okay<00:02:02.390> well<00:02:02.569> that<00:02:02.659> makes<00:02:02.869> perfect<00:02:03.110> sense

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
okay well that makes perfect sense

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.820 
okay well that makes perfect sense
yeah<00:02:03.920> now<00:02:04.780> what's<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:05.899> do<00:02:06.020> with<00:02:06.229> this<00:02:06.380> mylar

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
yeah now what's to do with this mylar

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.550 
yeah now what's to do with this mylar
right<00:02:07.100> here<00:02:07.399> why<00:02:08.060> is<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.420> crinkled<00:02:09.110> up<00:02:09.200> we're

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
right here why is it crinkled up we're

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.729 
right here why is it crinkled up we're
doing<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.920> crinkled<00:02:10.399> mylar<00:02:10.959> is<00:02:11.959> this<00:02:12.230> is<00:02:12.410> the

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
doing the crinkled mylar is this is the

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.530 
doing the crinkled mylar is this is the
first<00:02:13.069> of<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.549> series<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:13.910> claims<00:02:14.239> that<00:02:14.420> we're

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
first of a series of claims that we're

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.080 
first of a series of claims that we're
gonna<00:02:14.630> be<00:02:14.750> taking<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.200> Poland<00:02:15.680> s<00:02:16.190> or<00:02:16.549> can<00:02:16.910> take

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
gonna be taking to Poland s or can take

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.960 
gonna be taking to Poland s or can take
the<00:02:17.209> Mohammed<00:02:17.720> airliner<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.880> through<00:02:19.880> all

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
the Mohammed airliner and through all

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.280 
the Mohammed airliner and through all
the<00:02:20.090> temperature<00:02:20.480> changes<00:02:20.840> we<00:02:20.959> don't<00:02:21.140> want

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
the temperature changes we don't want

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.509 
the temperature changes we don't want
the<00:02:21.349> vial<00:02:21.560> are<00:02:21.709> too<00:02:21.920> tight<00:02:22.160> so<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:22.430> doesn't

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
the vial are too tight so it doesn't

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.280 
the vial are too tight so it doesn't
bring<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.000> airplane<00:02:23.330> up<00:02:23.450> right<00:02:23.930> that's<00:02:24.170> what

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
bring the airplane up right that's what

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.930 
bring the airplane up right that's what
I've<00:02:24.380> done<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.650> this<00:02:24.739> way<00:02:24.799> well<00:02:25.580> that<00:02:25.700> makes

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
I've done it this way well that makes

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.330 
I've done it this way well that makes
perfect<00:02:26.209> sense<00:02:26.480> right<00:02:26.989> there<00:02:27.230> so<00:02:27.769> this<00:02:27.980> this

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
perfect sense right there so this this

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.580 
perfect sense right there so this this
airplane<00:02:28.959> will<00:02:29.959> take<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.290> temperature

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
airplane will take the temperature

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.160 
airplane will take the temperature
changes<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.220> pressure<00:02:31.430> changes<00:02:32.170> while

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
changes and the pressure changes while

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.479 
changes and the pressure changes while
you're<00:02:33.320> actually<00:02:33.380> on<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.829> real<00:02:33.980> air<00:02:34.160> plants

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
you're actually on the real air plants

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.060 
you're actually on the real air plants
the<00:02:34.640> idea<00:02:34.670> exactly<00:02:35.540> okay<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:36.290> Bruce<00:02:36.859> we're

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
the idea exactly okay and Bruce we're

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.520 
the idea exactly okay and Bruce we're
going<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.370> Poland<00:02:37.700> we're<00:02:37.910> very<00:02:38.150> excited
