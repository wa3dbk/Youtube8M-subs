of<00:01:26.900> its<00:01:27.050> kind<00:01:27.290> in<00:01:27.440> the<00:01:27.470> universe<00:01:27.980> so<00:01:28.550> I<00:01:28.580> guess

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
of its kind in the universe so I guess

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.120 
that makes hotshot the most powerful
transformer<00:01:31.190> in<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.280> universe<00:01:31.730> right<00:01:33.130> I

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130
