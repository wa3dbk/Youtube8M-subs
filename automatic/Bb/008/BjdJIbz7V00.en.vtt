computer<00:00:20.880> sitting<00:00:21.060> next<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.420> me<00:00:21.540> is<00:00:21.900> making<00:00:22.080> a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
computer sitting next to me is making a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.910 
computer sitting next to me is making a
lot<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.440> noise

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
lot of noise

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.460 
lot of noise
once<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.760> shuts<00:00:23.939> down<00:00:24.119> I'm<00:00:24.450> going<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.140> unhook

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
once it shuts down I'm going to unhook

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.780 
once it shuts down I'm going to unhook
it<00:00:25.650> I'm<00:00:25.770> going<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:25.980> bring<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.340> back<00:00:26.400> over<00:00:26.610> here

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
it I'm going to bring it back over here

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.690 
it I'm going to bring it back over here
and<00:00:26.910> I'm<00:00:27.000> gonna<00:00:27.119> clean<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.480> out<00:00:27.540> with<00:00:28.700> the

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
and I'm gonna clean it out with the

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.210 
and I'm gonna clean it out with the
compressed<00:00:30.060> air<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.710> then<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.890> are<00:00:31.980> going<00:00:32.099> to

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
compressed air and then we are going to

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.810 
compressed air and then we are going to
replace<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.150> cooling<00:00:33.809> fans<00:00:34.550> with<00:00:35.550> something

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
replace the cooling fans with something

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.610 
replace the cooling fans with something
a<00:00:35.879> bit<00:00:36.030> quieter<00:00:36.420> now<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.260> can<00:00:37.350> see<00:00:37.410> there

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
a bit quieter now as you can see there

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.220 
a bit quieter now as you can see there
we<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.860> two<00:00:38.040> cooling<00:00:38.430> fans<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.230> that's

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
we have two cooling fans and that's

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.530 
we have two cooling fans and that's
because<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.770> machine<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.489> dual<00:00:42.000> processor

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
because this machine is a dual processor

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.560 
because this machine is a dual processor
system<00:00:42.900> you<00:00:43.470> see<00:00:43.620> here<00:00:43.830> are<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.220> two<00:00:44.879> fans

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
system you see here are the two fans

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.189 
system you see here are the two fans
other<00:00:46.559> than<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.949> it's<00:00:47.339> a<00:00:47.550> pretty<00:00:47.580> standard

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
other than that it's a pretty standard

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:55.910 
other than that it's a pretty standard
computer<00:00:52.550> come<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.640> here<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.680> pop<00:00:55.680> these

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
computer come in here and pop these

computer come in here and pop these
spring-loaded<00:00:56.550> screws<00:00:56.940> now<00:00:57.659> a<00:00:57.989> lot<00:00:58.589> of<00:00:58.620> these

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
spring-loaded screws now a lot of these

actually going to be provided with a

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:14.280 
actually going to be provided with a
backplate<00:01:05.549> also

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.450 

and<00:01:15.040> you<00:01:15.100> take<00:01:15.220> some<00:01:15.460> of<00:01:15.490> our<00:01:17.460> isopropyl

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
and you take some of our isopropyl

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:27.260 
and you take some of our isopropyl
alcohol<00:01:19.740> rag<00:01:20.740> here<00:01:23.940> go<00:01:24.940> ahead<00:01:25.000> and<00:01:25.560> clean

alcohol rag here go ahead and clean
these<00:01:28.270> processors<00:01:33.540> could<00:01:34.540> see<00:01:34.690> why<00:01:34.840> we<00:01:34.960> like

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
these processors could see why we like

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.340 
these processors could see why we like
using<00:01:35.320> uh<00:01:35.500> rubbing<00:01:36.070> alcohol<00:01:36.160> for<00:01:37.110> shaking<00:01:38.110> off

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
using uh rubbing alcohol for shaking off

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.650 
using uh rubbing alcohol for shaking off
heat<00:01:39.070> sink<00:01:39.310> compound<00:01:39.370> cuz<00:01:40.120> always<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.450> stuff

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
heat sink compound cuz always the stuff

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.190 
heat sink compound cuz always the stuff
comes<00:01:40.870> off<00:01:41.020> really<00:01:41.440> hard<00:01:41.710> and<00:01:42.690> what<00:01:43.690> this<00:01:43.870> just

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
comes off really hard and what this just

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.110 
comes off really hard and what this just
sort<00:01:44.380> of<00:01:44.820> melts<00:01:45.820> away<00:01:45.940> it's<00:01:46.720> not<00:01:46.900> to<00:01:47.080> us<00:01:47.200> are

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
sort of melts away it's not to us are

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.620 
sort of melts away it's not to us are
pretty<00:01:49.120> nice<00:01:50.250> normally<00:01:51.250> when<00:01:51.490> you<00:01:51.670> spin<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.300> fan

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
pretty nice normally when you spin a fan

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.150 
pretty nice normally when you spin a fan
you<00:01:52.900> can<00:01:52.990> hear<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.320> bearings<00:01:53.680> a<00:01:53.800> little<00:01:54.010> bit

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
you can hear the bearings a little bit

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.090 
you can hear the bearings a little bit
as<00:01:54.340> they<00:01:54.490> go<00:01:55.080> there's<00:01:56.080> almost<00:01:56.229> no<00:01:56.530> noise<00:01:56.650> to<00:01:56.979> it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
as they go there's almost no noise to it

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.100 
as they go there's almost no noise to it
it's<00:01:57.670> got<00:01:57.790> very<00:01:58.090> very<00:01:58.300> good<00:01:58.390> bearing<00:01:58.720> some<00:01:59.080> of

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
it's got very very good bearing some of

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.840 
it's got very very good bearing some of
the<00:01:59.229> cable<00:01:59.680> is<00:01:59.830> nice<00:02:00.190> and<00:02:00.400> braided<00:02:00.670> you<00:02:00.790> know

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
the cable is nice and braided you know

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.280 
the cable is nice and braided you know
they're<00:02:00.970> gonna<00:02:01.090> go<00:02:01.240> in<00:02:01.360> here<00:02:01.479> like<00:02:01.600> this<00:02:01.840> one's

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
they're gonna go in here like this one's

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.620 
they're gonna go in here like this one's
gonna<00:02:02.440> come<00:02:02.680> down<00:02:02.860> here<00:02:03.210> next<00:02:04.210> one's<00:02:04.360> gonna<00:02:04.479> be

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
gonna come down here next one's gonna be

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.290 
gonna come down here next one's gonna be
right<00:02:05.170> next<00:02:05.290> to<00:02:05.470> it

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
right next to it

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.690 
right next to it
and<00:02:07.300> now<00:02:07.679> how<00:02:08.679> this<00:02:08.830> works<00:02:09.600> is<00:02:11.550> you're<00:02:12.550> gonna

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
and now how this works is you're gonna

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.830 
and now how this works is you're gonna
get<00:02:12.820> this<00:02:12.970> over<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.240> top<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.660> processor

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
get this over the top of the processor

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.060 
get this over the top of the processor
and<00:02:14.770> this<00:02:15.370> allen<00:02:15.790> key<00:02:16.709> goes<00:02:17.709> in<00:02:17.830> these<00:02:17.890> little

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
and this allen key goes in these little

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.560 
and this allen key goes in these little
holes<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.970> screws<00:02:21.970> them<00:02:22.120> down<00:02:22.239> this<00:02:22.390> way

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
holes and it screws them down this way

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.080 
holes and it screws them down this way
so<00:02:23.670> pretty<00:02:24.670> well<00:02:24.910> thought<00:02:25.209> out<00:02:25.239> overall<00:02:27.090> you

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
so pretty well thought out overall you

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.199 
so pretty well thought out overall you
can<00:02:28.209> see<00:02:28.360> we<00:02:28.480> have<00:02:28.980> eight<00:02:29.980> heat<00:02:30.280> pipes<00:02:30.519> yeah

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
can see we have eight heat pipes yeah

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.490 
can see we have eight heat pipes yeah
four<00:02:31.480> on<00:02:31.570> each<00:02:31.690> side<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.110> they<00:02:32.200> call<00:02:32.380> it<00:02:32.440> the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
four on each side and they call it the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.910 
four on each side and they call it the
top<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:33.400> there<00:02:34.000> should<00:02:34.180> be<00:02:34.300> good<00:02:34.920> heat

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
top so there should be good heat

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.710 
top so there should be good heat
dissipation<00:02:36.430> there<00:02:36.850> these<00:02:37.330> are<00:02:37.480> little

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
dissipation there these are little

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.360 
dissipation there these are little
connectors<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.200> actually<00:02:38.709> hold<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.950> fan<00:02:39.190> on

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
connectors that actually hold the fan on

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.270 
connectors that actually hold the fan on
and<00:02:39.700> they're<00:02:40.180> pretty<00:02:40.510> crazy<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:41.800> push

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
and they're pretty crazy and you push

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.890 
and they're pretty crazy and you push
these<00:02:42.459> up<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:43.030> over<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:45.570> into<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.690> little

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
these up and over and into the little

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.960 
these up and over and into the little
holes<00:02:47.709> where<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.280> would<00:02:48.400> normally<00:02:48.519> scroll

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
holes where you would normally scroll

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.650 
holes where you would normally scroll
mine<00:02:49.120> if<00:02:49.660> anything<00:02:50.200> we<00:02:50.830> have<00:02:50.950> created<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.700> Tower

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
mine if anything we have created a Tower

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.370 
mine if anything we have created a Tower
of<00:02:52.810> cooling<00:02:53.320> power

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:17.380 

that<00:03:00.380> is<00:03:00.530> some<00:03:00.710> thick<00:03:01.220> through<00:03:01.970> my<00:03:02.120> paste<00:03:16.390> and

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
that is some thick through my paste and

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.600 
that is some thick through my paste and
they<00:03:17.480> get<00:03:17.630> all<00:03:17.810> of<00:03:17.840> our<00:03:18.110> little<00:03:18.950> screws<00:03:19.370> and

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
they get all of our little screws and

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.820 
they get all of our little screws and
line<00:03:19.760> as<00:03:19.970> much<00:03:20.270> as<00:03:20.450> we<00:03:20.570> can<00:03:23.140> able<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:24.260> see<00:03:24.560> to

line as much as we can able to see to

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.780 
line as much as we can able to see to
well<00:03:25.010> here<00:03:25.280> but<00:03:25.600> I'm<00:03:26.600> going<00:03:26.840> down<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:27.700> hang<00:03:28.700> on

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
well here but I'm going down and hang on

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:39.070 
well here but I'm going down and hang on
to<00:03:28.940> this<00:03:30.130> screw<00:03:31.130> here<00:03:36.400> there<00:03:37.400> we've<00:03:37.550> got<00:03:38.080> one

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
to this screw here there we've got one

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.770 
to this screw here there we've got one
screw<00:03:39.410> in<00:03:40.000> let's<00:03:41.000> get<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.300> first<00:03:41.450> one<00:03:41.660> on<00:03:41.720> the

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
screw in let's get the first one on the

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:52.200 
screw in let's get the first one on the
other<00:03:41.870> side

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.590 

I<00:03:52.290> don't<00:03:53.380> almost<00:03:54.100> got<00:03:54.280> it<00:03:54.370> in<00:03:54.490> this<00:03:55.390> be<00:03:55.570> a

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
I don't almost got it in this be a

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.060 
I don't almost got it in this be a
little<00:03:55.810> tricky<00:03:56.140> because<00:03:56.290> we're<00:03:56.620> working<00:03:56.920> with

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
little tricky because we're working with

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.100 
little tricky because we're working with
so<00:03:57.340> many<00:03:58.650> because<00:03:59.650> there's<00:03:59.860> there's<00:04:00.720> sets<00:04:01.720> of

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
so many because there's there's sets of

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.430 
so many because there's there's sets of
screws<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:03.280> we<00:04:03.940> tighten<00:04:04.900> one<00:04:05.020> in<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.350> other

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
screws and we tighten one in the other

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.580 
screws and we tighten one in the other
side<00:04:05.680> jumps<00:04:06.070> out<00:04:06.220> and<00:04:06.460> so<00:04:06.930> can<00:04:07.930> be<00:04:08.050> a<00:04:08.080> little

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
side jumps out and so can be a little

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.430 
side jumps out and so can be a little
bit<00:04:08.770> of<00:04:09.280> a<00:04:09.370> mess<00:04:09.840> trying<00:04:10.840> to<00:04:10.960> get<00:04:11.050> them<00:04:11.170> all<00:04:11.260> in

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
bit of a mess trying to get them all in

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:21.620 
bit of a mess trying to get them all in
this<00:04:19.050> new<00:04:20.050> clothes<00:04:20.320> are<00:04:20.500> running<00:04:20.710> properly

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
this new clothes are running properly

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.760 
this new clothes are running properly
feel<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:22.780> air<00:04:22.900> coming<00:04:22.930> up<00:04:23.290> here<00:04:23.500> what<00:04:23.650> it's

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
feel the air coming up here what it's

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.320 
feel the air coming up here what it's
doing<00:04:24.040> is<00:04:24.130> it's<00:04:24.280> pulling<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:24.610> cold<00:04:24.910> air<00:04:25.150> down

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
doing is it's pulling the cold air down

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.240 
doing is it's pulling the cold air down
here<00:04:25.390> from<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.810> intake<00:04:26.200> and<00:04:26.500> pulling<00:04:27.100> it<00:04:27.160> up

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
here from the intake and pulling it up

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.700 
here from the intake and pulling it up
to<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.430> top<00:04:27.610> if<00:04:28.150> we<00:04:28.210> had<00:04:28.480> a<00:04:28.510> heat<00:04:29.170> sink<00:04:29.470> with<00:04:29.680> a

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
to the top if we had a heat sink with a

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.230 
to the top if we had a heat sink with a
bigger<00:04:30.010> side<00:04:30.340> vent<00:04:30.610> this<00:04:30.760> would<00:04:30.880> actually<00:04:31.000> be

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
bigger side vent this would actually be

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.930 
bigger side vent this would actually be
a<00:04:31.330> pretty<00:04:31.860> good<00:04:32.860> airflow<00:04:33.070> system<00:04:33.700> but<00:04:33.850> this

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
a pretty good airflow system but this

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.220 
a pretty good airflow system but this
one<00:04:34.060> will<00:04:34.150> work<00:04:34.180> fine<00:04:34.540> for<00:04:34.570> now<00:04:34.950> so<00:04:37.080> these<00:04:38.080> are

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
one will work fine for now so these are

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.410 
one will work fine for now so these are
the<00:04:38.320> fans<00:04:38.530> at<00:04:38.740> full<00:04:38.920> speed<00:04:39.360> this<00:04:40.360> is

the fans at full speed this is

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.910 
the fans at full speed this is
technically<00:04:40.900> as<00:04:41.080> loud<00:04:41.320> as<00:04:41.470> this<00:04:41.590> computer

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
technically as loud as this computer

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
technically as loud as this computer
will<00:04:42.040> get<00:04:42.220> under<00:04:42.730> load<00:04:44.100> so<00:04:45.100> now<00:04:45.430> that<00:04:45.490> we<00:04:45.760> have
