hi<00:00:01.339> everyone<00:00:02.050> DAC<00:00:03.070> stands<00:00:04.070> for<00:00:04.520> digital<00:00:05.500> to

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:06.500 
hi everyone DAC stands for digital to

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.250 
hi everyone DAC stands for digital to
analog<00:00:07.129> converter<00:00:07.240> and<00:00:08.240> it's<00:00:09.080> sometimes

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
analog converter and it's sometimes

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.329 
analog converter and it's sometimes
called<00:00:09.679> a<00:00:09.980> DAC<00:00:10.900> now<00:00:11.900> a<00:00:11.929> DAC<00:00:12.380> is<00:00:12.679> a<00:00:12.740> device<00:00:13.309> that

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:13.339 
called a DAC now a DAC is a device that

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.150 
called a DAC now a DAC is a device that
takes<00:00:13.849> digital<00:00:14.480> information<00:00:14.780> and<00:00:15.259> converts

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
takes digital information and converts

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.540 
takes digital information and converts
it<00:00:16.340> into<00:00:16.840> analog<00:00:17.840> information<00:00:18.560> in<00:00:18.770> the<00:00:19.250> audio

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
it into analog information in the audio

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.240 
it into analog information in the audio
world<00:00:19.760> you<00:00:20.000> may<00:00:20.120> have<00:00:20.270> a<00:00:20.300> computer<00:00:20.960> or<00:00:21.160> maybe<00:00:22.160> a

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
world you may have a computer or maybe a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.710 
world you may have a computer or maybe a
digital<00:00:22.730> music<00:00:23.060> player<00:00:23.300> and<00:00:24.220> these<00:00:25.220> have

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
digital music player and these have

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.630 
digital music player and these have
digital<00:00:26.720> audio<00:00:27.200> information<00:00:27.920> stored<00:00:28.280> on<00:00:28.430> them

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
digital audio information stored on them

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.390 
digital audio information stored on them
in<00:00:28.820> zeros<00:00:29.450> and<00:00:29.630> ones<00:00:29.810> but<00:00:30.620> humans<00:00:30.950> don't<00:00:31.100> hear

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
in zeros and ones but humans don't hear

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.070 
in zeros and ones but humans don't hear
in<00:00:31.490> zeros<00:00:31.790> and<00:00:31.940> ones<00:00:33.670> so<00:00:34.670> we<00:00:34.820> need<00:00:35.000> to<00:00:35.870> be<00:00:35.990> able

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
in zeros and ones so we need to be able

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.550 
in zeros and ones so we need to be able
to<00:00:36.260> hear<00:00:36.470> it<00:00:36.560> through<00:00:36.910> speakers<00:00:37.910> or

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.560 
to hear it through speakers or

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.230 
to hear it through speakers or
headphones<00:00:39.560> and<00:00:39.890> that<00:00:40.430> means<00:00:40.700> having<00:00:41.030> an

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.240 
headphones and that means having an

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.900 
headphones and that means having an
electrical<00:00:41.750> signal<00:00:41.990> and<00:00:42.500> sound<00:00:43.160> vibrations

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
electrical signal and sound vibrations

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.840 
electrical signal and sound vibrations
so<00:00:44.540> a<00:00:44.570> DAC<00:00:45.020> takes<00:00:45.500> those<00:00:45.740> zeros<00:00:46.220> and<00:00:46.400> ones<00:00:46.550> and

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
so a DAC takes those zeros and ones and

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.900 
so a DAC takes those zeros and ones and
converts<00:00:47.840> them<00:00:48.079> into<00:00:48.640> analog<00:00:49.640> information

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
converts them into analog information

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.440 
converts them into analog information
that<00:00:50.840> we<00:00:51.140> can<00:00:51.350> understand<00:00:52.900> now<00:00:54.070> Dax<00:00:55.180> that<00:00:56.180> are

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
that we can understand now Dax that are

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.950 
that we can understand now Dax that are
sold<00:00:57.079> in<00:00:57.880> just<00:00:58.880> your<00:00:59.030> average<00:00:59.120> electronics

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
sold in just your average electronics

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.870 
sold in just your average electronics
aren't<00:01:00.170> very<00:01:00.410> good<00:01:00.620> in<00:01:00.770> fact<00:01:00.800> they<00:01:01.610> can

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
aren't very good in fact they can

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.399 
aren't very good in fact they can
distort<00:01:02.450> or<00:01:02.720> change<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.620> dynamic<00:01:04.129> range<00:01:04.370> in

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
distort or change the dynamic range in

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.980 
distort or change the dynamic range in
signal<00:01:06.409> so<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.610> audio<00:01:07.970> isn't<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:08.420> good<00:01:08.600> and

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
signal so the audio isn't so good and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.860 
signal so the audio isn't so good and
that's<00:01:09.380> important<00:01:09.950> if<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.340> are<00:01:10.370> in<00:01:10.729> the<00:01:11.540> pro

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
that's important if you are in the pro

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.570 
that's important if you are in the pro
audio<00:01:12.200> industry<00:01:12.830> you<00:01:12.979> need<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.220> be<00:01:13.340> able<00:01:13.430> to

audio industry you need to be able to
hear<00:01:14.570> properly<00:01:15.350> especially<00:01:15.830> if<00:01:16.280> you're

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
hear properly especially if you're

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.560 
hear properly especially if you're
mixing<00:01:17.000> audio<00:01:17.570> or<00:01:18.260> music<00:01:18.799> and<00:01:19.340> you<00:01:20.180> want<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.479> be

mixing audio or music and you want to be
able<00:01:20.690> to<00:01:20.810> get<00:01:21.020> an<00:01:21.140> accurate<00:01:21.490> representation

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
able to get an accurate representation

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.080 
able to get an accurate representation
of<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.700> mix<00:01:23.049> now<00:01:24.049> on<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:24.799> opposite<00:01:25.430> side<00:01:25.760> of

of the mix now on the opposite side of
digital<00:01:26.750> to<00:01:26.870> analog<00:01:27.320> is<00:01:28.090> analog<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.780> digital

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
digital to analog is analog to digital

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.760 
digital to analog is analog to digital
and<00:01:30.380> that<00:01:30.500> requires<00:01:31.280> conversion<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.710> so<00:01:33.710> you

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
and that requires conversion to so you

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.530 
and that requires conversion to so you
have<00:01:34.150> say<00:01:35.150> a<00:01:35.180> microphone<00:01:35.869> and<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:37.490> computer<00:01:38.180> or

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
have say a microphone and a computer or

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.899 
have say a microphone and a computer or
some<00:01:39.290> kind<00:01:39.500> of<00:01:39.619> digital<00:01:39.830> recording<00:01:40.250> device

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
some kind of digital recording device

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.660 
some kind of digital recording device
and<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.900> microphone<00:01:42.440> picks<00:01:42.740> up<00:01:42.979> sound

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
and the microphone picks up sound

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.940 
and the microphone picks up sound
vibrations<00:01:44.330> from<00:01:44.689> your<00:01:44.900> voice<00:01:45.080> as<00:01:45.409> it's

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
vibrations from your voice as it's

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.429 
vibrations from your voice as it's
happening<00:01:46.369> right<00:01:46.520> now<00:01:46.580> with<00:01:46.970> my<00:01:47.150> voice<00:01:47.330> and<00:01:47.689> in

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
happening right now with my voice and in

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.070 
happening right now with my voice and in
order<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.799> store<00:01:49.610> that<00:01:49.850> information<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.810> edit

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
order to store that information and edit

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.289 
order to store that information and edit
it<00:01:51.380> on<00:01:51.560> a<00:01:51.590> computer<00:01:52.159> it<00:01:52.700> needs<00:01:52.970> to<00:01:53.180> be

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
it on a computer it needs to be

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.530 
it on a computer it needs to be
digitized<00:01:54.049> or<00:01:54.670> converted<00:01:55.670> from<00:01:55.970> analog<00:01:56.509> to

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
digitized or converted from analog to

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.109 
digitized or converted from analog to
digital<00:01:57.100> so<00:01:58.100> that's<00:01:58.880> usually<00:01:59.470> called<00:02:00.470> a<00:02:00.710> 2d<00:02:01.280> so

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
digital so that's usually called a 2d so

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.929 
digital so that's usually called a 2d so
sometimes<00:02:02.509> they'll<00:02:02.689> hear<00:02:02.920> D<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.070> a<00:02:04.100> or<00:02:04.520> A<00:02:04.549> to<00:02:04.790> D

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
sometimes they'll hear D to a or A to D

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.730 
sometimes they'll hear D to a or A to D
and<00:02:05.210> it's<00:02:05.330> basically<00:02:05.990> just<00:02:06.110> talking<00:02:06.470> about

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
and it's basically just talking about

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.589 
and it's basically just talking about
whether<00:02:07.009> it's<00:02:07.250> from<00:02:07.400> digital<00:02:07.790> to<00:02:07.820> analog<00:02:08.359> or

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
whether it's from digital to analog or

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.309 
whether it's from digital to analog or
analog<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.829> digital<00:02:10.450> those<00:02:11.450> converters<00:02:12.079> are

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
analog to digital those converters are

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.980 
analog to digital those converters are
very<00:02:12.919> important

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
very important

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.100 
very important
and<00:02:14.080> having<00:02:15.010> good<00:02:15.160> quality<00:02:15.400> ones<00:02:15.940> can<00:02:16.930> make<00:02:17.080> a

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
and having good quality ones can make a

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.070 
and having good quality ones can make a
real<00:02:17.350> difference<00:02:17.560> in<00:02:18.010> your<00:02:18.610> audio<00:02:19.510> production

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
real difference in your audio production

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.860 
real difference in your audio production
so<00:02:20.550> take<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.580> look<00:02:21.850> at<00:02:22.030> what's<00:02:22.450> available<00:02:22.630> and

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
so take a look at what's available and

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.020 
so take a look at what's available and
you'll<00:02:25.870> notice<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.260> in<00:02:26.740> some<00:02:27.030> applications

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
you'll notice that in some applications

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.080 
you'll notice that in some applications
standalone<00:02:28.900> converters<00:02:29.680> are<00:02:30.010> what<00:02:30.850> many

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
standalone converters are what many

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.290
