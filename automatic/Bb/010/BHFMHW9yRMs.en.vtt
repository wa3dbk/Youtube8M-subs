that<00:00:11.700> -<00:00:11.910> Sheila<00:00:12.150> softly<00:00:12.540> laptop<00:00:13.250> this<00:00:14.250> is

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:14.550 
that - Sheila softly laptop this is

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.960 
that - Sheila softly laptop this is
Suffolk<00:00:14.820> model<00:00:15.179> has<00:00:15.420> RCE<00:00:18.080> 650<00:00:19.279> I<00:00:20.279> believe<00:00:20.880> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
Suffolk model has RCE 650 I believe the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.929 
Suffolk model has RCE 650 I believe the
process<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.690> same<00:00:21.720> for<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.230> c6x<00:00:23.039> bit<00:00:23.310> so

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
process is the same for the c6x bit so

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.689 
process is the same for the c6x bit so
it<00:00:24.000> should<00:00:24.180> be<00:00:24.210> fairly<00:00:24.420> common<00:00:24.930> when<00:00:25.800> closest

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
it should be fairly common when closest

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.550 
it should be fairly common when closest
with<00:00:26.880> these<00:00:27.029> laptops<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.750> mean<00:00:28.410> other

laptops<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:30.109> become<00:00:31.109> less<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.410> recommend

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
laptops to become less I recommend

three first name again
one<00:03:19.069> two<00:03:19.459> three<00:03:20.079> so

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.080 

I<00:03:39.980> don't<00:03:40.980> worry<00:03:41.160> too<00:03:41.220> much<00:03:41.370> about<00:03:41.550> those<00:03:41.940> in

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
I don't worry too much about those in

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.050 
I don't worry too much about those in
the<00:03:42.150> sewers<00:03:42.540> I've<00:03:42.660> got<00:03:42.810> plenty<00:03:43.020> of<00:03:43.140> them

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
the sewers I've got plenty of them

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.210 
the sewers I've got plenty of them
so<00:03:45.060> when<00:03:45.600> you<00:03:45.690> suppose<00:03:45.990> along<00:03:46.320> with<00:03:46.530> this<00:03:46.950> king

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
so when you suppose along with this king

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.830 
so when you suppose along with this king
should<00:03:47.550> never<00:03:47.730> be<00:03:47.820> more<00:03:47.940> flexible<00:03:48.150> she<00:03:48.660> built

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
should never be more flexible she built

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.010 
should never be more flexible she built
another<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:50.000> if<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.120> talked<00:03:51.330> it<00:03:51.450> down<00:03:51.630> under

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
another and if I talked it down under

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.710 
another and if I talked it down under
the<00:03:52.110> keyboard<00:03:52.320> make<00:03:52.980> sure<00:03:53.160> you<00:03:53.250> can<00:03:53.400> see<00:03:53.720> we

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
the keyboard make sure you can see we

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.550 
the keyboard make sure you can see we
have<00:03:54.990> 11<00:03:55.710> kill<00:03:55.920> this<00:03:56.820> is<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.030> second<00:03:57.330> or<00:03:57.390> so<00:03:58.050> this

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
have 11 kill this is a second or so this

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.140 
have 11 kill this is a second or so this
is<00:03:58.740> on<00:03:58.890> an<00:03:59.190> LED<00:03:59.610> panel<00:03:59.690> an<00:04:00.690> LCD<00:04:01.110> panel<00:04:01.680> with

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
is on an LED panel an LCD panel with

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.560 
is on an LED panel an LCD panel with
CCFL<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:04.100> backlight<00:04:05.100> would<00:04:05.370> likely<00:04:05.640> have<00:04:06.030> an

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
CCFL and backlight would likely have an

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.570 
CCFL and backlight would likely have an
additional<00:04:07.080> connection<00:04:07.530> with<00:04:07.680> positive

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
additional connection with positive

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.350 
additional connection with positive
negative<00:04:08.760> gonna<00:04:09.300> turn<00:04:10.260> up<00:04:10.610> so<00:04:11.610> let's<00:04:12.120> make

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
negative gonna turn up so let's make

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.690 
negative gonna turn up so let's make
sure<00:04:12.390> you<00:04:12.540> can<00:04:12.690> equate<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:12.959> to<00:04:13.400> what<00:04:14.400> we<00:04:14.430> can

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
sure you can equate that to what we can

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.400 
sure you can equate that to what we can
do<00:04:15.000> is<00:04:15.150> just<00:04:15.180> have<00:04:15.420> a<00:04:15.480> look<00:04:15.870> at<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.019> tape<00:04:16.230> it

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
do is just have a look at the tape it

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.259 
do is just have a look at the tape it
under<00:04:16.620> very<00:04:16.650> tough<00:04:16.950> start<00:04:17.730> to<00:04:17.850> remove<00:04:18.060> that

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
under very tough start to remove that

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:26.870 
under very tough start to remove that
again<00:04:19.200> being<00:04:19.440> careful<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:26.400> then<00:04:26.550> pull<00:04:26.790> the
