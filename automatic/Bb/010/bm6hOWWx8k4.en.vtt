get<00:04:14.030> it<00:04:14.150> in<00:04:14.269> it's<00:04:15.019> a<00:04:15.109> constant<00:04:15.620> cycle<00:04:16.010> of

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
get it in it's a constant cycle of

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.250

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
spending it to look after people and

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.440 
spending it to look after people and
then<00:04:18.470> people<00:04:19.310> do<00:04:19.489> an<00:04:19.579> event<00:04:19.849> to<00:04:20.209> get<00:04:20.299> that
