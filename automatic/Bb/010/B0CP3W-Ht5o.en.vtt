beforehand and then you're kind of
tanning<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.979> little<00:01:56.250> bit<00:01:56.369> more<00:01:56.520> safely<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
tanning a little bit more safely and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.209

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
one before can be a little bit daunting

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.810 
one before can be a little bit daunting
and<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:15.050> just<00:02:15.230> feel<00:02:15.380> like<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:15.770> look<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.430> little<00:02:16.670> bit

and I just feel like I look a little bit

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.700 
and I just feel like I look a little bit
a<00:02:16.850> little<00:02:17.420> bit<00:02:17.690> better<00:02:17.930> with<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.200> bit<00:02:18.380> of<00:02:18.410> color

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
a little bit better with a bit of color

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.490 
a little bit better with a bit of color
on<00:02:18.800> me<00:02:19.100> if<00:02:19.460> you<00:02:19.520> don't<00:02:20.000> then<00:02:20.510> that's<00:02:20.840> perfectly

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
on me if you don't then that's perfectly

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.870 
on me if you don't then that's perfectly
fine<00:02:21.590> this<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:21.980> by<00:02:22.130> no<00:02:22.280> means<00:02:22.310> kind<00:02:22.700> of<00:02:22.820> a

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
fine this is by no means kind of a

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.670 
fine this is by no means kind of a
necessary<00:02:23.300> step<00:02:23.390> but<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:23.900> one<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.140> I<00:02:24.320> find

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
necessary step but it is one that I find

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.470 
necessary step but it is one that I find
it<00:02:24.830> works<00:02:25.070> really<00:02:25.550> really<00:02:25.700> well<00:02:25.910> at<00:02:26.210> boosting
