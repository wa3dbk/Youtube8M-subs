00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.840
 two tests which means electronic 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.780
 speed control 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.160
 are this motor controllers 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.450
 calibration does you by means of a sensor 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.400
 remote control of a radio remote control 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:34.750
 we will see according to the map 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.949
 kaka 2.0 and is done in two ways 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.040
 calibration of motor controllers 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:42.470
 first method a parent so the 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.699
 advantage is that we can be sure that 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.290
 the controller validated our choice 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.430
 because when they are plugged in every 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.170
 four as we shall see later 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.300
 that they validated really 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.190
 individually 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.899
 so this is the recommended method so 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.559
 the first thing to do is to turn on 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.739
 his breakthrough charge of commands to put 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.820
 the gases at bottom 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:09.970
 I'm in mode 2 guys are at 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.970
 left then to walk the battery 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.789
 so you may have noticed that all 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.350
 controllers are unplugged take the 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:21.289
 first controller including number 1 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:26.690
 who is here to note the polarity 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:29.509
 the brown right side I press on the 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:34.310
 button 1 and 4 and the two buttons 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:36.830
 end of the map and I branch on 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.800
 go as a vip that will tell us 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:44.880
 that is in calibration mode here 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.710
 and which means we are in 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.600
 brake adjustment so the brakes 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.630
 engines the informant it serves mostly 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.060
 for helicopters when they have blades 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.490
 collapsible for the multis rotor 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.479
 leave behind the engines are on 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.700
 medium brake especially for this it 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.630
 automatically braking alone so 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.740
 how could we see in the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.709
 diagram we have the first group 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.110
 which is a group of five clips five 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.370
 visuals that gives us since we were 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:22.470
 no lipo battery including free 2nd 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:25.170
 group so the group of 5.2 times beep 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.069
 we give ourselves the weapons come from 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.190
 batteries is born and give way to it at mach 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:36.480
 fifth of three beep 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:40.290
 which gives us a battery life menu 2 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.390
 4 beep which gives us a menu of timings 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:48.239
 of engine so its sacro engines and 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:52.019
 was waiting for it in the auto timing menu and 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.120
 5 and last group five visuals that is 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.730
 the sync of the engines so the timing hi 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.709
 fi and for multi-role engines 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.700
 finally the engines where there are a lot of 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.300
 members only those who have these words 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.100
 thurman is out 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.800
 so we will take a concrete example 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.440
 able to calibrate these controllers on 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.880
 the radio remote control so I'm going 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.850
 take as an example a lipo battery 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.690
 and that I will put my timing of 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:23.630
 motors in cars so first thing 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:28.400
 I turn on these games but the gas thoroughly I 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.350
 eat the battery power I 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.060
 take the connector of my controller 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.460
 number one I do them one by one 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.690
 beware the polarity marois right 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.230
 I press the two buttons 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:44.270
 end of card 1 and 4 and I 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:50.180
 looks at a series of four goals for 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:52.550
 tell us that we are in calibration mode and 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.670
 I will wait for the series as soon as 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.400
 first series of 5 bis jumps a 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.110
 time to validate how I am in 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.160
 lipo battery so here I validate I 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.160
 drop the gases 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.030
 here we hear the noise so two beeps 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.030
 it means that it is vallier 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.390
 particularity is perhaps 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.160
 disadvantages of these controllers it's 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.610
 that when you want to adjust several modes 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.180
 we have to start from scratch 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:25.530
 so I've already settled but he's trying to 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.970
 tell them that I was in the ipo in 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.430
 lipo battery and now I want them 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.260
 restart the calibration system for 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.900
 tell them I'm in timing back 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.900
 for the synchronization of motors so 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.100
 everything is connected I just remove 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.990
 the controller card my radio control 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.740
 is ready 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.740
 I reconnect the same thing button 1 and 4 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.390
 you i'm in calibration mode and so 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.340
 we can see on the diagram it goes 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.530
 I'll have to wait to be on the 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.720
 group of executives they will be able 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.810
 lower my eating gas is validated 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:37.740
 like what i am in time in auto game 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:39.710
 out of two so here I am alone at the goal 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:44.330
 4 beep 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.330
 I'm going to the throttle 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.780
 the beep that it has validated and I release 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.470
 so then to adjust the engine 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.160
 number 2 3 and 4 it's the same 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:04.040
 handling 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:05.500
 so I am not gas I disconnect the 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.010
 number one controller 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:16.130
 I take the number 2 controller 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:18.500
 I press the button 1 6 4 I branch 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.810
 at the location of controller number 1 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:25.550
 because it is here that the food is 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:28.669
 of the map and we leave for the same 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:31.250
 series we did so 4 bis for us 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:33.110
 to say that we extend the calibration game 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.960
 drop when I'll know the part of a 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.760
 beep 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.770
 I validate I'm in lipo battery and the 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.430
 for each word each mode 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.430
 and each engine 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.580
 so settle them there is 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:54.120
 time of which you could notice gerard 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:58.919
 connected like normal the four 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:00.690
 So how controllers there as I 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:03.240
 I said earlier that we are going to 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.490
 not know if the controllers have 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.180
 all validated our choice because they live 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.790
 all at the same time 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.850
 here but I show you anyway 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:16.470
 So it just the same thing one has to ercÃ© 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:19.560
 you go up the throttles are fully 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.850
 disconnect controller number 1 because 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.040
 it is he who is feeding the 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:25.320
 then we will reconnect it 

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.990
 that we are in calibration mode on the other hand 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.340
 drums 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.200
 I press button 1 and 4 of the 

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.820
 map 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.800
 and here I'm always careful 

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:40.889
 polarity game left on the map 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:42.530
 the controller I power the card the 

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:44.700
 4-bit series 

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.720
 here are the four controllers ringing in 

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.850
 same time we are not on the 

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.050
 synchronization 

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.520
 I want to tell him that I'm still in 

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:54.080
 lipo battery on the four at the same 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:57.720
 time I rock the gas view 

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.820
 I'm waiting mobile validation and that's it 

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.650
 it's done I start the manipulation again 

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:05.240
 in each mode so to say in particular 

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.240
 that I am in auto mode for 4
