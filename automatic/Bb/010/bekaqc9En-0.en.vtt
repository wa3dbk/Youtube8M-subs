you<00:04:21.450> want<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.690> do<00:04:21.840> it

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
you want to do it

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.080 
you want to do it
if<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:22.800> was<00:04:22.919> just<00:04:22.949> you<00:04:23.249> and<00:04:23.430> him<00:04:23.580> this<00:04:23.789> would<00:04:23.909> be

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
if it was just you and him this would be

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.809 
if it was just you and him this would be
simple<00:04:24.479> I<00:04:24.770> tried<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.800> few<00:04:25.919> strategies<00:04:26.219> standing

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 
simple I tried a few strategies standing

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.580 
simple I tried a few strategies standing
on<00:04:26.909> top<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.270> crates<00:04:27.599> and<00:04:27.930> they<00:04:28.169> did<00:04:28.349> work

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
on top of the crates and they did work

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.339 
on top of the crates and they did work
but<00:04:28.979> they<00:04:29.219> took<00:04:29.370> too<00:04:29.639> long<00:04:29.669> and<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:31.020> result

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
but they took too long and the result

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:32.779 
but they took too long and the result
was<00:04:31.469> always<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.889> same<00:04:32.099> I<00:04:32.279> would<00:04:32.340> always<00:04:32.550> get

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
was always the same I would always get

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.540 
was always the same I would always get
hit<00:04:33.289> but<00:04:34.289> i<00:04:34.349> think<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.650> developers<00:04:35.189> realized

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
hit but i think the developers realized

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.830 
hit but i think the developers realized
that<00:04:35.759> this<00:04:35.849> fight<00:04:36.090> was<00:04:36.240> bullshit<00:04:36.719> because

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
that this fight was bullshit because

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.529 
that this fight was bullshit because
it's<00:04:37.020> not<00:04:37.169> ranked<00:04:37.999> so<00:04:38.999> if<00:04:39.090> you're<00:04:39.180> trying<00:04:39.360> to

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
it's not ranked so if you're trying to

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.499 
it's not ranked so if you're trying to
do<00:04:39.629> an<00:04:39.749> s-rank<00:04:40.020> run<00:04:40.289> you<00:04:40.710> don't<00:04:40.919> even<00:04:41.039> have<00:04:41.310> to

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
do an s-rank run you don't even have to

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.730 
do an s-rank run you don't even have to
perform<00:04:42.509> well<00:04:42.779> on<00:04:42.810> this<00:04:43.080> because<00:04:43.259> it's<00:04:43.499> not

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
perform well on this because it's not

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.580 
perform well on this because it's not
mandatory<00:04:43.979> to<00:04:44.400> your<00:04:44.819> results<00:04:45.389> and<00:04:45.509> I<00:04:46.259> think

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
mandatory to your results and I think

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.929 
mandatory to your results and I think
that's<00:04:46.710> very<00:04:46.770> kind<00:04:47.159> of<00:04:47.370> them<00:04:47.430> because<00:04:47.759> that

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:47.939 
that's very kind of them because that

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:50.420 
that's very kind of them because that
would<00:04:48.120> be<00:04:48.330> so<00:04:49.169> difficult<00:04:49.499> for<00:04:49.979> no<00:04:50.159> real<00:04:50.400> reason

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
would be so difficult for no real reason

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.459 
would be so difficult for no real reason
other<00:04:50.969> then<00:04:51.120> it's<00:04:51.360> just<00:04:51.479> a<00:04:51.629> shit<00:04:51.930> placement<00:04:52.409> of

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:52.469 
other then it's just a shit placement of

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:56.959 
other then it's just a shit placement of
enemies<00:04:53.930> but<00:04:54.930> up<00:04:55.650> here<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:56.009> use<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.490> rocket<00:04:56.819> guy
