00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
the camera power and while we're at it

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.010 
the camera power and while we're at it
we<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.140> connect<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.829> cameras<00:00:56.640> Wi-Fi<00:00:57.020> antenna

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
we can connect the cameras Wi-Fi antenna

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.830 
we can connect the cameras Wi-Fi antenna
that<00:00:58.350> came<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> package<00:00:59.539> just<00:01:00.539> screw<00:01:00.809> that

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
that came in the package just screw that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.860 
that came in the package just screw that
in<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> back<00:01:01.859> here<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:03.660> set<00:01:03.690> this

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870

in to the back here so to set this
camera<00:01:04.229> up<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.729> through<00:01:06.000> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
camera up we have to do it through a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.780 
camera up we have to do it through a
wired<00:01:06.330> connection<00:01:06.689> first<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.280> go<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> your

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
wired connection first so go to your

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.840 
wired connection first so go to your
router<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.540> off<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.200> back<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.979> can

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
router and off the back of it you can

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.539 
router and off the back of it you can

this

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.059 
this
so<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.790> interface<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.390> simple<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:13.740> gives<00:02:13.950> you

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
so the interface is simple it gives you

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.589 
so the interface is simple it gives you
a<00:02:14.130> space<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.700> see<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.090> cameras<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.480> are

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
a space to see the cameras you are

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.500 
a space to see the cameras you are
connected<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.349> it<00:02:17.340> also<00:02:17.550> allows<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.390> add
