00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.400
 Modest Tastes cuisine from armful loves 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.640
 this section is beyond bread ... 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.400
 we will share a very delicious bread recipe 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.800
 French "Brioche" 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.360
 but if you want to learn the materials first 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.360
 1 pack of quick yeast 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.680
 1 tablespoon powder sugar 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.480
 1 tea cup of warm water 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.280
 1 tea cup warm milk 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.760
 1 egg and 1 egg white 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.760
 half pack of butter 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.560
 1 teaspoon salt 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.640
 and enough flour 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.880
 For the above; 1 egg yolk 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.600
 After the materials, 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.480
 right now for the curd ... 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.400
 we drained the warm water 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.400
 sweaty 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.400
 and adding powdered sugar 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.440
 we're mixing it with a fingertip 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.240
 Now we're breaking 1 egg 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.520
 one egg white 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.560
 we will use the yellow 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.520
 and adding milk 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.920
 and short-time mixing 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.120
 in the butter we melt and burn 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.400
 add salt after butter 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.960
 After a little more mixing 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.160
 we will start to knead by adding flour 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.200
 Our dough is so thick, neither too hard nor too soft 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.600
 little flour 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.280
 now we're closing 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.680
 and warm for 45 minutes - 1 hour 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.240
 roasted 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.640
 Let's start to shape now 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.480
 Let's take a few rounds 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.840
 let's just say that ... 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.520
 A little more than usual because it is an oily dough. 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.760
 ferment 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.120
 Now we're gonna tear it apart, first our dough ... 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.320
 a quarter of us 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.320
 then we will divide the remaining dough into 9 equal parts. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.600
 not in our traditional recipe but if we want it to be shaped ... 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.560
 in this way we can also place our doughs in tartar molds 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.040
 We are showing in the simplest form while preserving the traditional shape 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.840
 we place our rounds into trays 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.160
 now light in the middle with any kitchen appliance 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.160
 and the other piece of dough we take ... 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.880
 again divided into 9 equal parts 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.720
 we put the tiny balls we have prepared on our cavities 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.000
 we prepare the bruises 20-30 minutes ... 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.680
 wait for a little more fermentation in the tray 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.160
 yes now finally; We had 1 egg yolk 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.160
 1 tablespoon mixed with water 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.120
 and bourbon breads on the edges and edges 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.280
 after the egg yolk ... 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.960
 Our preheated 190-degree bake brunches ... 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.320
 we cook until golden 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.360
 our brothers are cooked 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.600
 after waiting for half an hour as we can take to the table 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.560
 Modest Flavors in our kitchen in this section ... 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.880
