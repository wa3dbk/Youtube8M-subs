bevel it will either make it a much

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.399 
bevel it will either make it a much
rounded<00:01:03.589> edge<00:01:05.060> or<00:01:06.060> if<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.390> shrink<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.840> down<00:01:07.049> it

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
rounded edge or if we shrink it down it

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.550 
rounded edge or if we shrink it down it
will<00:01:07.619> create<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.340> sharper<00:01:08.909> edge<00:01:09.439> for<00:01:10.439> our

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
the next option you'll want to work with

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.130 
the next option you'll want to work with
is<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:15.979> segments<00:01:16.640> option<00:01:17.150> this<00:01:17.689> is<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:17.990> one

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
is the segments option this is the one

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.780 
is the segments option this is the one
that<00:01:18.229> will<00:01:18.380> add<00:01:18.619> more<00:01:18.950> edge<00:01:19.189> loops<00:01:19.520> and

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
that will add more edge loops and

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.260 
that will add more edge loops and
definition<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:21.110> that<00:01:21.140> bevel

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
definition to that bevel

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.109 
definition to that bevel
as<00:01:23.380> we<00:01:24.380> change<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.920> segment<00:01:25.429> number<00:01:25.759> it<00:01:25.880> adds

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
as we change the segment number it adds

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.499 
as we change the segment number it adds
more<00:01:26.600> detail<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.439> this<00:01:27.590> bevel<00:01:28.420> creating<00:01:29.420> a

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
more detail to this bevel creating a

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:37.719 
more detail to this bevel creating a
smoother<00:01:30.670> transition<00:01:35.799> I'm<00:01:36.799> going<00:01:37.159> to<00:01:37.280> create

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
smoother transition I'm going to create

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.760 
smoother transition I'm going to create
another<00:01:38.500> cube<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:39.799> move<00:01:40.369> this<00:01:40.549> over<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:41.060> show

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
another cube and move this over to show

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.440 
another cube and move this over to show
you<00:01:42.770> what<00:01:42.979> happens<00:01:43.429> if<00:01:43.579> you<00:01:43.610> have<00:01:43.880> multiple

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
you what happens if you have multiple

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.740 
you what happens if you have multiple
faces<00:01:44.990> selected<00:01:45.939> when<00:01:46.939> we<00:01:47.119> worked<00:01:47.329> with<00:01:47.450> this

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
faces selected when we worked with this

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.870 
faces selected when we worked with this
bevel<00:01:48.110> we<00:01:48.409> only<00:01:48.560> worked<00:01:48.860> with<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:49.159> top<00:01:49.369> face<00:01:49.670> a

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
bevel we only worked with the top face a

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.160 
bevel we only worked with the top face a
single<00:01:50.420> polygon<00:01:51.399> I'm<00:01:52.399> going<00:01:52.789> to<00:01:52.880> change<00:01:53.270> the

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
single polygon I'm going to change the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.639 
single polygon I'm going to change the
subdivisions<00:01:54.979> on<00:01:55.189> this<00:01:55.700> object<00:01:55.909> so<00:01:56.500> we<00:01:57.500> have

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
subdivisions on this object so we have

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.279 
subdivisions on this object so we have
more<00:01:57.890> polygons<00:01:58.399> to<00:01:58.549> work<00:01:58.700> with<00:01:58.909> on<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.179> top<00:01:59.390> so

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
more polygons to work with on the top so

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:06.059 
more polygons to work with on the top so
I'll<00:02:00.349> go<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.590> face<00:02:01.009> and<00:02:02.349> select<00:02:03.349> just<00:02:03.649> my<00:02:03.950> top

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
I'll go to face and select just my top

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.370 
I'll go to face and select just my top
surface<00:02:07.479> so<00:02:08.479> right<00:02:08.630> here<00:02:08.869> instead<00:02:09.079> of<00:02:09.170> having

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
surface so right here instead of having

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.000 
surface so right here instead of having
just<00:02:09.560> one<00:02:09.769> polygon<00:02:10.429> we<00:02:10.880> have<00:02:11.060> nine<00:02:11.269> and<00:02:12.010> let's

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
just one polygon we have nine and let's

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.229 
just one polygon we have nine and let's
go<00:02:13.280> up<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.940> perform<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:14.989> bevel<00:02:15.290> on<00:02:15.440> this

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
go up and perform a bevel on this

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.050 
go up and perform a bevel on this
everything<00:02:17.239> looks<00:02:17.599> good<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.579> if<00:02:19.579> we<00:02:19.760> do<00:02:20.030> our

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
everything looks good and if we do our

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.610 
everything looks good and if we do our
offset<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:21.019> can<00:02:21.200> see<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:24.110> bevel<00:02:24.500> is

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
offset you can see that the bevel is

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.059 
offset you can see that the bevel is
applied<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.250> every<00:02:25.790> edge<00:02:26.030> on<00:02:26.709> each<00:02:27.709> of<00:02:27.950> those

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
applied to every edge on each of those

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.990 
applied to every edge on each of those
polygons<00:02:29.859> so<00:02:30.859> that<00:02:31.040> may<00:02:31.370> be<00:02:31.430> what<00:02:31.850> you're

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
polygons so that may be what you're

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.300 
polygons so that may be what you're
looking<00:02:32.269> for<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:32.810> may<00:02:32.930> not<00:02:33.139> be<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.590> wanted

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
looking for and it may not be I wanted

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.539 
looking for and it may not be I wanted
to<00:02:34.400> make<00:02:34.519> everyone<00:02:34.880> aware<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:36.500> if<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:37.400> have

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
to make everyone aware that if you have

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.030 
to make everyone aware that if you have
multiple<00:02:38.000> faces<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.870> will<00:02:39.079> perform<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.680> bevel

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
multiple faces it will perform a bevel

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
multiple faces it will perform a bevel
on<00:02:40.130> each<00:02:40.579> face

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.900 

let's<00:02:46.180> go<00:02:46.330> around<00:02:46.750> this

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
let's go around this

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.740 
let's go around this
and<00:02:48.890> we<00:02:49.890> will<00:02:50.010> perform<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.760> bevel<00:02:51.090> on<00:02:51.120> some

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
and we will perform a bevel on some

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.430 
and we will perform a bevel on some
edges<00:02:52.550> so<00:02:53.550> let's<00:02:53.730> right-click<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.450> select

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
edges so let's right-click and select

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.440 
edges so let's right-click and select
edge<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:57.290> double<00:02:58.290> click<00:02:58.530> on<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:59.310> edges<00:02:59.850> that

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
edge and double click on the edges that

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.540 
edge and double click on the edges that
we<00:03:00.690> would<00:03:00.840> like<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.080> apply<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.560> bevel<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.190> and

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
we would like to apply a bevel to and

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.940 
we would like to apply a bevel to and
when<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.450> double<00:03:03.810> click<00:03:04.020> on<00:03:04.050> your<00:03:04.200> edges<00:03:04.710> it

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
when you double click on your edges it

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.060 
when you double click on your edges it
will<00:03:05.010> select<00:03:05.490> an<00:03:05.730> entire<00:03:06.180> edge<00:03:06.600> loop<00:03:06.900> or<00:03:07.080> all

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
will select an entire edge loop or all

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.800 
will select an entire edge loop or all
of<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.580> edges<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:08.970> are<00:03:09.210> connected<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.750> each

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
of the edges that are connected to each

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.770 
of the edges that are connected to each
other<00:03:10.280> so<00:03:11.280> now<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.460> our<00:03:11.610> edges<00:03:12.090> are<00:03:12.240> selected

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
other so now that our edges are selected

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.570 
other so now that our edges are selected
let's<00:03:13.290> go<00:03:13.500> up<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.740> edit<00:03:14.040> mesh<00:03:14.220> &amp;<00:03:14.520> bevel<00:03:15.510> and

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
let's go up to edit mesh &amp; bevel and

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.940 
let's go up to edit mesh &amp; bevel and
again<00:03:17.580> let's<00:03:17.790> go<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.240> offset<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.950> adjust

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
again let's go to the offset and adjust

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.540 
again let's go to the offset and adjust
the<00:03:20.490> size<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.940> our<00:03:21.090> bevel<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:25.190> we<00:03:26.190> can<00:03:26.310> change

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
the size of our bevel and we can change

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:34.580 
the size of our bevel and we can change
our<00:03:26.790> segments<00:03:31.940> let<00:03:32.940> me<00:03:33.030> delete<00:03:33.390> this<00:03:33.630> cube<00:03:34.320> and

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
our segments let me delete this cube and

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.130 
our segments let me delete this cube and
come<00:03:35.340> back<00:03:35.550> and<00:03:36.680> let's<00:03:37.680> apply<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:38.370> bevel<00:03:39.020> to<00:03:40.020> the

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
come back and let's apply a bevel to the

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.520 
come back and let's apply a bevel to the
vertex<00:03:40.590> on<00:03:40.800> the<00:03:40.890> bottom<00:03:41.700> of<00:03:41.820> this<00:03:41.970> object<00:03:42.530> we

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
vertex on the bottom of this object we

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.610 
vertex on the bottom of this object we
will<00:03:43.650> right<00:03:44.130> click<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.580> select<00:03:44.640> vertex<00:03:45.620> let's

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
will right click and select vertex let's

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.180 
will right click and select vertex let's
grab<00:03:46.890> these<00:03:47.100> two<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:50.000> go<00:03:51.000> up<00:03:51.830> to<00:03:52.830> apply<00:03:53.160> a

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
grab these two and go up to apply a

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.880 
grab these two and go up to apply a
bevel<00:03:53.820> on<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.030> vertices<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:55.260> we've

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
bevel on the vertices that we've

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.990 
bevel on the vertices that we've
selected<00:03:57.140> if<00:03:58.140> we<00:03:58.410> zoom<00:03:58.680> in<00:03:58.860> here<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.340> can<00:03:59.700> see

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
selected if we zoom in here you can see

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.449 
selected if we zoom in here you can see
the<00:04:00.150> effect<00:04:00.450> that<00:04:00.630> we<00:04:00.750> get<00:04:01.130> again<00:04:02.130> we<00:04:02.340> can

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
the effect that we get again we can

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.949 
the effect that we get again we can
adjust<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.480> offset<00:04:04.880> to<00:04:05.880> change<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.390> size<00:04:06.660> of

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
adjust the offset to change the size of

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.830 
adjust the offset to change the size of
our<00:04:07.110> bevel<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.670> we<00:04:08.670> can<00:04:08.850> come<00:04:09.060> in<00:04:09.209> and<00:04:09.360> adjust

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
our bevel and we can come in and adjust

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.170 
our bevel and we can come in and adjust
the<00:04:10.020> number<00:04:10.530> of<00:04:10.620> segments<00:04:11.130> that<00:04:11.310> will<00:04:12.000> add

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
the number of segments that will add

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:23.800 
the number of segments that will add
detail<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:13.100> round<00:04:14.100> this<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:15.840> our<00:04:16.020> bevel
