00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.850 

so<00:00:08.140> talking<00:00:08.470> about<00:00:09.220> draw<00:00:09.639> strokes<00:00:10.150> and<00:00:10.860> draw

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
so talking about draw strokes and draw

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.620 
so talking about draw strokes and draw
strokes<00:00:12.280> are<00:00:12.549> used<00:00:12.910> to<00:00:13.240> move<00:00:13.389> your<00:00:13.510> boat

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:13.630 
strokes are used to move your boat

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.509 
strokes are used to move your boat
laterally<00:00:14.260> moving<00:00:14.590> the<00:00:14.650> boat<00:00:14.800> forwards<00:00:15.340> and

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 
laterally moving the boat forwards and

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.429 
laterally moving the boat forwards and
backwards<00:00:15.700> so<00:00:16.059> it's<00:00:16.299> pretty<00:00:16.480> intuitive<00:00:16.869> but

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
backwards so it's pretty intuitive but

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.170 
backwards so it's pretty intuitive but
moving<00:00:17.800> the<00:00:17.890> boat<00:00:18.040> laterally<00:00:18.700> such<00:00:18.970> when

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
moving the boat laterally such when

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.600 
moving the boat laterally such when
you're<00:00:19.300> pulling<00:00:19.630> yourself<00:00:19.689> up<00:00:20.020> to<00:00:20.230> a<00:00:20.259> buddy<00:00:21.070> or

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
you're pulling yourself up to a buddy or

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.550 
you're pulling yourself up to a buddy or
pulling<00:00:22.060> yourself<00:00:22.180> up<00:00:22.480> to<00:00:22.630> a<00:00:22.660> dock<00:00:22.989> or<00:00:23.290> away

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
pulling yourself up to a dock or away

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.409 
pulling yourself up to a dock or away
from<00:00:23.829> a<00:00:23.890> dock<00:00:24.099> anything<00:00:24.910> like<00:00:25.000> that

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
from a dock anything like that

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.260 
from a dock anything like that
draw<00:00:25.779> strokes<00:00:26.020> are<00:00:26.169> really<00:00:26.320> helpful<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.880> the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
draw strokes are really helpful the the

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.330 
draw strokes are really helpful the the
idea<00:00:28.509> behind<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:28.810> draw<00:00:28.989> stroke<00:00:29.349> is<00:00:29.500> you're

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
idea behind the draw stroke is you're

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.490 
idea behind the draw stroke is you're
gonna<00:00:30.460> reach<00:00:30.700> out<00:00:30.939> pretty<00:00:31.419> much<00:00:31.509> straight<00:00:32.349> out

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
gonna reach out pretty much straight out

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.250 
gonna reach out pretty much straight out
from<00:00:32.529> the<00:00:32.770> hip<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.670> more<00:00:33.880> vertical<00:00:34.300> the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
from the hip the more vertical the

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.240 
from the hip the more vertical the
paddle<00:00:35.739> shaft<00:00:36.190> is<00:00:36.579> the<00:00:37.120> more<00:00:37.329> actual<00:00:38.250> lateral

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
paddle shaft is the more actual lateral

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.000 
paddle shaft is the more actual lateral
pull<00:00:39.550> you're<00:00:40.210> gonna<00:00:40.329> be<00:00:40.510> able<00:00:40.809> to<00:00:40.960> to<00:00:41.530> exert<00:00:41.859> on

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
pull you're gonna be able to to exert on

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.400 
pull you're gonna be able to to exert on
the<00:00:42.100> paddle<00:00:42.429> so<00:00:42.550> at<00:00:43.359> first<00:00:43.750> it<00:00:43.989> may<00:00:44.079> be<00:00:44.109> a<00:00:44.230> bit

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
the paddle so at first it may be a bit

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.259 
the paddle so at first it may be a bit
unbalanced<00:00:44.890> to<00:00:45.190> reach<00:00:45.399> that<00:00:45.609> top<00:00:45.879> hand<00:00:46.179> right

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
unbalanced to reach that top hand right

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:48.360 
unbalanced to reach that top hand right
over<00:00:46.420> you<00:00:47.320> can<00:00:47.469> start<00:00:47.739> with<00:00:47.859> it<00:00:47.949> a<00:00:48.010> bit<00:00:48.129> lower

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
over you can start with it a bit lower

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.160 
over you can start with it a bit lower
but<00:00:48.910> ultimately<00:00:49.329> you<00:00:49.510> want<00:00:49.570> to<00:00:49.690> get<00:00:49.809> that<00:00:49.960> top

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
but ultimately you want to get that top

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.110 
but ultimately you want to get that top
hand<00:00:50.379> right<00:00:50.739> across<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.370> paddle<00:00:51.760> shaft<00:00:51.879> as

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
hand right across the paddle shaft as

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.630 
hand right across the paddle shaft as
vertical<00:00:52.570> as<00:00:52.629> possible<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:53.499> then<00:00:53.890> pull<00:00:54.429> water

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
vertical as possible and then pull water

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.090 
vertical as possible and then pull water
to<00:00:54.879> the<00:00:54.999> hip<00:00:55.179> now<00:00:55.839> before<00:00:56.440> your<00:00:56.649> paddle

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
to the hip now before your paddle

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.919 
to the hip now before your paddle
reaches<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.850> side<00:00:58.030> of<00:00:58.179> your<00:00:58.239> boat<00:00:58.449> where<00:00:58.809> it

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
reaches the side of your boat where it

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:00.389 
reaches the side of your boat where it
can<00:00:59.050> get<00:00:59.170> pinned<00:00:59.559> and<00:00:59.800> actually<00:01:00.070> clip<00:01:00.280> you

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
can get pinned and actually clip you

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.459 
can get pinned and actually clip you
very<00:01:00.609> easily<00:01:00.789> you<00:01:01.629> have<00:01:01.839> to<00:01:01.989> release<00:01:02.260> the

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
very easily you have to release the

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:03.989 
very easily you have to release the
pressure<00:01:02.710> off<00:01:02.980> your<00:01:03.159> blade<00:01:03.429> and<00:01:03.789> there's<00:01:03.969> a

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:03.999 
pressure off your blade and there's a

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:06.180 
pressure off your blade and there's a
couple<00:01:04.180> of<00:01:04.330> ways<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.659> do<00:01:04.809> that<00:01:04.960> you<00:01:05.500> can<00:01:06.040> either

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
couple of ways to do that you can either

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.550 
couple of ways to do that you can either
just<00:01:06.460> slice<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.030> blade<00:01:07.210> out<00:01:07.240> behind<00:01:07.900> you<00:01:08.170> or

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
just slice the blade out behind you or

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.290 
just slice the blade out behind you or
you<00:01:09.130> can<00:01:09.280> do<00:01:09.340> what's<00:01:09.490> called<00:01:09.580> a<00:01:09.760> tea<00:01:09.970> stroke

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
you can do what's called a tea stroke

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.840 
you can do what's called a tea stroke
which<00:01:10.840> involves<00:01:11.229> curling<00:01:11.619> your<00:01:11.710> wrists<00:01:12.130> 90

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
which involves curling your wrists 90

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.940 
which involves curling your wrists 90
degrees<00:01:13.149> so<00:01:13.479> that<00:01:13.960> you<00:01:14.200> can<00:01:14.320> slice<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:14.770> blade

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
degrees so that you can slice the blade

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.219 
degrees so that you can slice the blade
back<00:01:15.220> to<00:01:15.700> where<00:01:15.820> it<00:01:15.880> started<00:01:15.909> and<00:01:16.659> take

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
back to where it started and take

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.980 
back to where it started and take
another<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.829> couple<00:01:18.790> things<00:01:19.000> in<00:01:19.180> a<00:01:19.420> common

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
another a couple things in a common

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.749 
another a couple things in a common
problems<00:01:20.380> that<00:01:20.470> happen<00:01:20.920> for<00:01:21.070> people<00:01:21.100> they'll

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
problems that happen for people they'll

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.380 
problems that happen for people they'll
pull<00:01:22.119> in<00:01:22.540> and<00:01:23.430> rather<00:01:24.430> than<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:25.000> boat<00:01:25.149> moving

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
pull in and rather than the boat moving

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.990 
pull in and rather than the boat moving
laterally<00:01:25.840> its<00:01:26.290> boat<00:01:26.770> turns<00:01:27.159> and<00:01:27.820> if<00:01:27.909> the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
laterally its boat turns and if the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.249 
laterally its boat turns and if the
boats<00:01:28.210> turning<00:01:28.750> it<00:01:28.840> means<00:01:29.049> you're<00:01:29.229> not

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
boats turning it means you're not

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.410 
boats turning it means you're not
pulling<00:01:29.649> directly<00:01:30.310> into<00:01:30.549> your<00:01:30.670> hip<00:01:30.909> you're

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
pulling directly into your hip you're

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.330 
pulling directly into your hip you're
pulling<00:01:31.750> either<00:01:31.899> too<00:01:32.140> far<00:01:32.409> forward<00:01:32.799> towards

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
pulling either too far forward towards

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.399 
pulling either too far forward towards
your<00:01:33.490> knee<00:01:33.640> or<00:01:33.909> your<00:01:33.939> foot<00:01:34.329> or<00:01:34.780> else<00:01:34.930> too<00:01:35.170> far

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
your knee or your foot or else too far

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.450 
your knee or your foot or else too far
back<00:01:35.850> what's<00:01:36.850> called<00:01:37.060> a<00:01:37.119> stern<00:01:37.420> draw<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:38.460> it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
back what's called a stern draw and it

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.889 
back what's called a stern draw and it
pulls<00:01:39.700> your<00:01:39.880> Stern<00:01:40.149> around<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:40.600> spins<00:01:40.810> you

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
pulls your Stern around and spins you

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.330 
pulls your Stern around and spins you
the<00:01:40.990> other<00:01:41.140> way<00:01:41.259> so<00:01:41.799> make<00:01:42.039> sure<00:01:42.070> you're

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
the other way so make sure you're

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.709 
the other way so make sure you're
pulling<00:01:42.520> ready<00:01:42.820> to<00:01:42.909> your<00:01:43.000> hip<00:01:43.180> different

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
pulling ready to your hip different

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.420 
pulling ready to your hip different
boats<00:01:44.020> will<00:01:44.289> act<00:01:44.500> differently<00:01:44.979> if<00:01:45.219> you<00:01:45.280> have<00:01:45.399> a

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
boats will act differently if you have a

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.670 
boats will act differently if you have a
rudder<00:01:45.729> in<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:46.509> may<00:01:46.659> have<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:47.079> actually<00:01:47.530> have

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
rudder in you may have to actually have

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.450 
rudder in you may have to actually have
to<00:01:47.920> pull<00:01:48.399> slightly<00:01:48.759> behind<00:01:49.329> the<00:01:49.570> hip<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:51.310> just

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
to pull slightly behind the hip you just

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.279 
to pull slightly behind the hip you just
have<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.729> figure<00:01:51.850> out<00:01:51.969> the<00:01:52.240> type<00:01:52.390> of<00:01:52.420> boat<00:01:52.659> that

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
have to figure out the type of boat that

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.080 
have to figure out the type of boat that
you<00:01:53.439> have<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.310> type<00:01:54.460> of<00:01:54.490> draw<00:01:54.820> stroke

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
you have and the type of draw stroke

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.090 
you have and the type of draw stroke
where<00:01:55.390> exactly<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:56.170> pull<00:01:56.380> your<00:01:56.590> draw<00:01:56.829> stroke

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
where exactly to pull your draw stroke

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.370 
where exactly to pull your draw stroke
to<00:01:57.579> -<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.479> deal<00:01:58.630> with<00:01:58.750> that<00:01:58.899> boat

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
to - to deal with that boat

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.319 
to - to deal with that boat
another<00:01:59.950> type<00:02:00.219> of<00:02:00.250> draw<00:02:00.520> stroke<00:02:00.820> which<00:02:01.299> is

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
another type of draw stroke which is

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.630 
another type of draw stroke which is
even<00:02:01.719> more<00:02:02.320> effective<00:02:02.920> than<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.189> tee<00:02:03.369> stroke

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
even more effective than the tee stroke

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.090 
even more effective than the tee stroke
is<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:04.149> sculling<00:02:04.869> draw<00:02:04.899> and<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.740> sculling

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
is the sculling draw and the sculling

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.730 
is the sculling draw and the sculling
draw<00:02:06.130> lets<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:07.149> pull<00:02:07.719> yourself<00:02:08.080> laterally

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
draw lets you pull yourself laterally

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.400 
draw lets you pull yourself laterally
constantly<00:02:09.520> you<00:02:09.640> get<00:02:09.820> steady<00:02:10.179> pressure<00:02:10.600> from

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
constantly you get steady pressure from

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.589 
constantly you get steady pressure from
your<00:02:11.500> Blake

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
your Blake

the<00:02:12.930> key<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.230> scaling<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:13.799> that<00:02:14.189> your<00:02:14.280> paddle

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
the key to scaling is that your paddle

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.720 
the key to scaling is that your paddle
will<00:02:15.269> travel<00:02:15.689> on<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.959> path<00:02:16.290> about<00:02:16.709> two<00:02:17.310> feet<00:02:17.549> out

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
to the side of your kayak again you want

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.170 
to the side of your kayak again you want
to<00:02:19.620> get<00:02:19.769> your<00:02:19.920> top<00:02:20.159> hand<00:02:20.430> across<00:02:20.609> the<00:02:20.879> boat<00:02:21.060> and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
to get your top hand across the boat and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.449 
to get your top hand across the boat and
your<00:02:21.420> paddles<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.840> vertical<00:02:22.170> as<00:02:22.260> possible<00:02:22.459> now

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
your paddles of vertical as possible now

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.140 
your paddles of vertical as possible now
when<00:02:24.450> your<00:02:24.629> paddle<00:02:25.019> is<00:02:25.109> pushing<00:02:25.560> forward<00:02:26.150> you

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
when your paddle is pushing forward you

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.330 
when your paddle is pushing forward you
want<00:02:27.299> to<00:02:27.420> open<00:02:27.599> up<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.290> edge<00:02:28.439> the<00:02:28.829> leading

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
want to open up the edge the leading

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.640 
want to open up the edge the leading
edge<00:02:29.489> so<00:02:30.299> that<00:02:30.329> the<00:02:30.569> power<00:02:30.959> face<00:02:31.319> of<00:02:31.530> your

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
edge so that the power face of your

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.429 
edge so that the power face of your
paddle<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.370> catching<00:02:32.970> water<00:02:33.180> once<00:02:34.019> you<00:02:34.140> get<00:02:34.319> to

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
paddle is catching water once you get to

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:35.990 
paddle is catching water once you get to
around<00:02:34.500> your<00:02:34.650> toes<00:02:34.950> you'll<00:02:35.400> rotate<00:02:35.879> your

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
around your toes you'll rotate your

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.110 
around your toes you'll rotate your
wrists<00:02:36.329> and<00:02:36.500> then<00:02:37.500> pull<00:02:37.950> back<00:02:38.220> again<00:02:38.970> the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
wrists and then pull back again the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.849 
wrists and then pull back again the
leading<00:02:39.389> edge<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.720> away<00:02:39.989> from<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.379> so<00:02:40.739> that

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
leading edge is away from you so that

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.879 
leading edge is away from you so that
your<00:02:40.950> power<00:02:41.159> face<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.579> catching<00:02:41.939> water<00:02:42.889> and

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
your power face is catching water and

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.089 
your power face is catching water and
that<00:02:44.159> sculling<00:02:44.819> motion<00:02:45.239> there<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.870> gonna<00:02:46.109> draw

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
that sculling motion there is gonna draw

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.750 
that sculling motion there is gonna draw
me<00:02:47.340> sideways<00:02:48.859> way<00:02:49.859> to<00:02:49.920> think<00:02:50.159> about<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.609> is

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
me sideways way to think about it is

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.839 
me sideways way to think about it is
it's<00:02:51.299> just<00:02:51.389> like<00:02:52.069> buttering<00:02:53.069> toast<00:02:53.340> or<00:02:53.700> you

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
it's just like buttering toast or you

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.670 
it's just like buttering toast or you
know<00:02:53.970> spreading<00:02:54.299> peanut<00:02:54.569> butter<00:02:54.720> on<00:02:54.870> on<00:02:55.109> bread

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
know spreading peanut butter on on bread

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.250 
know spreading peanut butter on on bread
your<00:02:56.310> leading<00:02:56.790> edge<00:02:56.909> has<00:02:56.939> to<00:02:57.510> stay<00:02:57.720> higher<00:02:57.959> if

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
your leading edge has to stay higher if

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.319 
your leading edge has to stay higher if
it<00:02:58.409> doesn't<00:02:58.889> then<00:02:59.549> it's<00:02:59.730> just<00:02:59.790> gonna<00:02:59.970> dive

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
it doesn't then it's just gonna dive

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:01.909 
it doesn't then it's just gonna dive
it's<00:03:00.569> gonna<00:03:00.689> cut<00:03:00.989> into<00:03:01.169> the<00:03:01.349> bread<00:03:01.530> your

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
it's gonna cut into the bread your

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.229 
it's gonna cut into the bread your
paddle<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.310> gonna<00:03:02.459> slice<00:03:02.700> into<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.060> water

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
paddle is gonna slice into the water

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.550 
paddle is gonna slice into the water
it's<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.750> same<00:03:04.049> idea

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
it's the same idea

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.580 
it's the same idea
keep<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.669> leading<00:03:06.000> edge<00:03:06.150> higher<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:07.379> just

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
keep the leading edge higher and I just

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.890 
keep the leading edge higher and I just
do<00:03:07.739> that<00:03:07.889> on<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.159> vertical<00:03:08.459> plane<00:03:08.669> and<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.870> can

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
do that on a vertical plane and I can

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.289 
do that on a vertical plane and I can
apply<00:03:10.290> steady<00:03:10.829> pressure<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.819> really<00:03:12.120> move

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
apply steady pressure and really move

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:21.840 
apply steady pressure and really move
myself<00:03:12.450> sideways<00:03:12.989> quickly

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.910
