00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.219
 first impression was very nice it has 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.290
 did not think that the terrain like that 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.600
 spacious and so big is 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:24.630
 in the meantime one finds oneself also very much 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.630
 Good and good here and everything was great 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.500
 The bus ride here was very long one 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.750
 hour we had to drive here but 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.520
 We came for breakfast and there was 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.420
 what to eat and what to eat 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.420
 We relax immediately 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.670
 The breakfast is very rich 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.130
 a lot of different things go on 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.320
 Selection There are different yogurts 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.470
 there are muesli there are 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.060
 different types of bread and rolls 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.950
 cold cuts there are even many 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.650
 various Greek cheeses what 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.700
 I think something nice is typical of the country 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.270
 So it really is for every taste 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.270
 something here 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:17.740
 to 23 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.159
 The room has a beautiful 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.320
 outlook we can go straight to the sea 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:31.290
 Views also have good possibilities 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:35.030
 into the interior of the country to look and 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.030
 The cleanliness of the room was great too 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.310
 mainz always very nice it is very big 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.670
 it's all there you need 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.770
 a small fridge is it clean yes 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.770
 just as I expected 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.550
 Of course, that's not beautiful 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.410
 sandy beach as you are used to it 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.420
 but it's about two to three 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.030
 three hundred meters so 1 23 minutes times 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.210
 easy because the beaches are a bit smaller 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.740
 But that makes everything very nice 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.000
 winding bays very romantic 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.000
 Maybe you could call it that 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.360
 the thing off
