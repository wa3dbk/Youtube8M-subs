00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.590
 according to her it is necessary no but for a long time I had to work in the 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.479
 southern australia musical helene crucible amsterdam 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:19.009
 to study the impact of climate change on the biodiversity of these 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.009
 regions 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.519
 collecting all the species from the team book the andante artists mac 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.300
 answer is naturally in the name it is far from it since we know 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.050
 relatively well the large animals of the birds d 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.950
 mammal marine mammals 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.220
 for sean connery is relatively well the plant species the plants to 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.980
 flowers 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.800
 on the other hand accounts going down the nonsense organizes small 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.130
 for that of mosses lichens 9 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.690
 the microflora the microfauna and well there we fall into a field of the unknown place 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.789
 full 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.900
 and there are spenders of this biodiversity 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.900
 that we know and not at the very very bad 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.020
 also in areas that are hard to reach 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.540
 one in particular I think 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.430
 seabed there are certainly very many species of fish 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.610
 seaweed 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.940
 for which we have never changed but that I have never studied 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.180
 in this respect during the International Polar Year 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.640
 there is a big program that aims to send ships 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.719
 oceanographic 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.169
 all around the Antarctic continent and then% spread out exploring its funds 

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:33.960
 sailors who are for the totally unknown 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960
 to go up species to determine them 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.400
 short of trying to increase our knowledge about the biodiversity of 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.770
 these marine areas 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.720
 nor should we believe that only small species or species is 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.120
 inaccessible they are poorly known% and we have an example here again very very 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.940
 recent species of birds including large sizes of penguins go by 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.200
 example of albatross 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.049
 in your revealed just a few years ago their status of 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.310
 new species for science 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.420
 so far they are confused with common species 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.679
 we can mention the case of the fight at the all star game which is very very close 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:15.519
 looks like 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.500
 like two drops of profitable water atrocious but genetically that is totally 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:20.560
 isolated 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.880
 and we do not know and this albatross endemic to the road to villac cerda 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.640
 than fifty individuals so it's something very very little 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.110
 which places this species in a status of endangered species created in 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.479
 rwanda also always pretty example the star of arms including hot 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:39.140
 an agreement was its author 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.410
 who has been identifying it as an endemic species of island business 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.900
 soul only last year
