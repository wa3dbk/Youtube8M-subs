today I want to talk to you guys for

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.749 
today I want to talk to you guys for
just<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.110> minute<00:00:10.320> about<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.650> push<00:00:10.860> press<00:00:11.160> I've

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
just a minute about the push press I've

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.370 
just a minute about the push press I've
had<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.940> lot<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.179> people<00:00:12.450> ask<00:00:12.690> me<00:00:12.840> about<00:00:12.929> why

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
had a lot of people ask me about why

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.320 
had a lot of people ask me about why
they<00:00:13.799> see<00:00:13.860> me<00:00:14.160> doing<00:00:14.340> push<00:00:14.639> presses<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.179> some

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
they see me doing push presses in some

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.120 
they see me doing push presses in some
of<00:00:15.420> my<00:00:15.509> videos<00:00:15.870> mostly<00:00:16.260> behind<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.740> neck<00:00:16.920> but

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
of my videos mostly behind the neck but

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.650 
of my videos mostly behind the neck but
right<00:00:17.460> now<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.730> my<00:00:17.850> meat<00:00:18.029> prep<00:00:18.270> have<00:00:18.420> switched

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
right now in my meat prep have switched

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.310 
right now in my meat prep have switched
over<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.900> front<00:00:19.230> push<00:00:19.470> presses<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:21.289> why<00:00:22.289> I

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
over to front push presses and why I

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.250 
over to front push presses and why I
have<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.890> my<00:00:23.010> novice<00:00:23.400> program<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.300> strict<00:00:25.019> press

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
have in my novice program a strict press

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.779 
have in my novice program a strict press
and<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.500> reason<00:00:25.800> for<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.699> my

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
and the reason for that is that in my

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.150 
and the reason for that is that in my
novice<00:00:27.150> program<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.779> think<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.680> novice

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
novice program I think that the novice

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.120 
novice program I think that the novice
lifter<00:00:29.609> doesn't<00:00:30.510> always<00:00:30.660> have<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.560> skill<00:00:32.099> and

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
lifter doesn't always have the skill and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.600 
lifter doesn't always have the skill and
proficiency<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.500> body<00:00:34.500> awareness<00:00:34.710> to

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
proficiency and body awareness to

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.970 
proficiency and body awareness to
properly<00:00:36.000> perform<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.450> push<00:00:36.660> press<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.290> they

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
properly perform a push press and they

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.950 
properly perform a push press and they
already<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.090> much<00:00:39.239> work<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.780> just

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
already have so much work that just

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.010 
already have so much work that just
hammers<00:00:40.379> their<00:00:40.620> core<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.070> their<00:00:41.219> lower<00:00:41.399> body

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
hammers their core in their lower body

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.720 
hammers their core in their lower body
that<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.290> don't<00:00:43.860> think<00:00:44.100> they're<00:00:44.280> really<00:00:44.579> gonna

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that I don't think they're really gonna

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.729 
that I don't think they're really gonna
benefit<00:00:45.300> from<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.780> whereas<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.530> more

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
benefit from it whereas in for a more

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.369 
benefit from it whereas in for a more
intermediate<00:00:47.100> lifter<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.300> think<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> push

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
intermediate lifter I think the push

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.590 
intermediate lifter I think the push
press<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:50.010> an<00:00:50.190> amazing<00:00:50.879> movement<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.420> almost

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
press is an amazing movement I almost

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.479 
press is an amazing movement I almost
like<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.079> call<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.410> squads<00:00:53.039> for<00:00:53.219> upper<00:00:53.460> body

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
like to call it squads for upper body

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.810 
like to call it squads for upper body
and<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.539> reason<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:54.989> because<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.770> puts<00:00:56.399> so

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
and the reason is because it puts so

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.580 
and the reason is because it puts so
much<00:00:56.850> overload<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.870> body<00:00:58.050> now<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> lot<00:00:58.500> of

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
much overload on the body now a lot of

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.200 
much overload on the body now a lot of
people<00:00:58.829> will<00:00:58.949> argue<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.879> yeah<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
people will argue with you that yeah the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.639 
people will argue with you that yeah the
primary<00:01:00.690> movers<00:01:01.020> involved<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.469> something

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
primary movers involved in something

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.990 
primary movers involved in something
like<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> push<00:01:02.160> press<00:01:02.430> or<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.699> anterior

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
like a push press or the anterior

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.260 
like a push press or the anterior
deltoids<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:05.129> lateral<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.700> medial<00:01:05.729> head

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
deltoids and the lateral and medial head

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.350 
deltoids and the lateral and medial head
of<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> triceps<00:01:07.729> but<00:01:08.729> they<00:01:08.909> forget<00:01:09.270> that

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
of the triceps but they forget that

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.300 
of the triceps but they forget that
that's<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.780> concentric<00:01:10.409> portion<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
that's on the concentric portion of the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.289 
that's on the concentric portion of the
rep<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.570> also<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:13.020> leg<00:01:13.260> drive<00:01:13.500> involved

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
rep and you also have leg drive involved

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.120 
rep and you also have leg drive involved
so<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.630> working<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.140> lower<00:01:16.259> body<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
so it is working the lower body to a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.660 
so it is working the lower body to a
certain<00:01:17.610> extent<00:01:18.710> but<00:01:19.710> that's<00:01:19.920> really<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:20.340> to

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
certain extent but that's really just to

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.550 
certain extent but that's really just to
get<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> weight<00:01:21.210> up<00:01:21.420> what<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.049> really<00:01:22.229> find

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
get the weight up what you really find

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.109 
get the weight up what you really find
on<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> push<00:01:22.979> press<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.700> when<00:01:24.000> you

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
on the push press is that when you

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.789 
on the push press is that when you
particularly<00:01:24.900> if<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.229> right<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
particularly if you do it right with the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.460 
particularly if you do it right with the
false<00:01:26.189> grip<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> very<00:01:26.970> narrow<00:01:27.240> grip<00:01:27.750> what

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
false grip and the very narrow grip what

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.319 
false grip and the very narrow grip what
you<00:01:28.590> find<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.340> really<00:01:29.759> really

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
you find is that it really really

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.510 
you find is that it really really
hammers<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> triceps<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.650> top<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.430> I've

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
hammers the triceps to the top and I've

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.890 
hammers the triceps to the top and I've
known<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> lot<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.030> guys<00:01:33.150> over<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> years<00:01:33.780> who

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
known a lot of guys over the years who

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.560 
known a lot of guys over the years who
do<00:01:34.200> feel<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.009> push<00:01:35.640> press<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.060> probably

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
do feel that the push press is probably

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.260 
do feel that the push press is probably
a<00:01:36.689> superior<00:01:37.229> tricep<00:01:37.680> builder<00:01:38.040> but<00:01:38.939> where<00:01:39.119> it

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
a superior tricep builder but where it

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.899 
a superior tricep builder but where it
shines<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:40.040> hypertrophy<00:01:41.040> purposes<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.759> guys

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
shines for hypertrophy purposes for guys

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.700 
shines for hypertrophy purposes for guys
trying<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.360> bigger<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.110> eccentric

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
trying to get bigger is the eccentric

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.200 
trying to get bigger is the eccentric
portion<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> rep<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.610> what<00:01:44.790> you'll<00:01:44.939> note

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
portion of the rep and what you'll note

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.149 
portion of the rep and what you'll note
is<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.450> when<00:01:46.110> you're<00:01:46.290> doing<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.590> eccentric

the weight on the eccentric grab and

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.380 
the weight on the eccentric grab and
you'll<00:02:07.920> probably<00:02:08.129> get<00:02:08.520> Dom's<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.119> lot<00:02:09.270> of

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
those places that when you first start

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.320 
those places that when you first start
doing<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.400> lift

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
doing the lift

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.270 
doing the lift
and<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:13.080> have<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.380> remember<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.830> when<00:02:14.160> it

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
and you have to remember that when it

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.370 
and you have to remember that when it
comes<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.790> eccentric<00:02:15.180> reps<00:02:15.660> we<00:02:15.990> do<00:02:16.200> know<00:02:16.350> that

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
comes to eccentric reps we do know that

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.540 
comes to eccentric reps we do know that
eccentric<00:02:17.070> loading<00:02:17.310> plays<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.730> huge<00:02:18.440> role<00:02:19.440> in

hypertrophy and muscle growth from all
the<00:02:21.750> research<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.320> we<00:02:22.500> also<00:02:22.650> know<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:22.920> it

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
the research and we also know that it

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.860 
the research and we also know that it
doesn't<00:02:23.460> even<00:02:23.520> have<00:02:23.820> to<00:02:23.970> be<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.120> slow<00:02:24.420> negative

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
doesn't even have to be a slow negative

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.660 
doesn't even have to be a slow negative
as<00:02:24.990> long<00:02:25.140> as<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.410> have<00:02:25.620> some<00:02:25.980> control<00:02:26.370> over<00:02:26.400> a

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
negative you gain all the benefits in

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.940

terms of hypertrophy from a negative

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.500 
terms of hypertrophy from a negative
that<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.370> would<00:02:32.550> from<00:02:32.760> even<00:02:33.000> doing<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.240> really

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
that you would from even doing a really

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.910 
that you would from even doing a really
slow<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.900> there's<00:02:34.050> no<00:02:34.200> benefit<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.620> going

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
slow and there's no benefit to going

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.590 
slow and there's no benefit to going
slower<00:02:35.220> as<00:02:35.400> long<00:02:35.550> as<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.730> have<00:02:35.910> some<00:02:36.210> control

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
slower as long as you have some control

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.050 
slower as long as you have some control
on<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:38.040> way<00:02:38.190> down<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.670> it's<00:02:38.760> not<00:02:38.910> just

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
on the way down and it's not just

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.840 
on the way down and it's not just
dropping<00:02:39.690> at<00:02:39.810> freefall<00:02:40.230> speed<00:02:40.670> so<00:02:41.670> it's

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
dropping at freefall speed so it's

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.730 
dropping at freefall speed so it's
really<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.300> eccentric<00:02:42.900> loading<00:02:43.320> of<00:02:43.590> this

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
really the eccentric loading of this

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.870 
really the eccentric loading of this
movement<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.190> really<00:02:44.520> helps<00:02:44.730> with<00:02:44.790> a

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
movement that really helps with a

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.390 
movement that really helps with a
hypertrophy<00:02:45.540> but<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:46.020> also<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.470> fantastic

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
hypertrophy but it's also a fantastic

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.700 
hypertrophy but it's also a fantastic
power<00:02:48.150> builder<00:02:48.600> on<00:02:48.720> top<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.140> because<00:02:49.470> you

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
power builder on top of it because you

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.820 
power builder on top of it because you
are<00:02:49.740> learning<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.250> use<00:02:50.520> your<00:02:50.580> upper<00:02:50.940> body

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
are learning to use your upper body

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.770 
are learning to use your upper body
while<00:02:52.830> strongly<00:02:53.520> engaging<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.120> core<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.390> the

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
while strongly engaging the core and the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.570 
while strongly engaging the core and the
lower<00:02:54.810> body<00:02:55.230> using<00:02:55.710> those<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.980> help<00:02:56.160> drive<00:02:56.400> the

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
lower body using those to help drive the

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.070 
lower body using those to help drive the
weight<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.210> full<00:02:57.480> body<00:02:57.720> power

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
weight so it is a full body power

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.050 
weight so it is a full body power
movement<00:02:58.710> with<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.920> bigger<00:02:59.250> focus<00:02:59.640> on<00:02:59.970> the

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
movement with a bigger focus on the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.300 
movement with a bigger focus on the
upper<00:03:00.270> body<00:03:00.440> which<00:03:01.440> really<00:03:01.710> makes<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.160> an

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
upper body which really makes it an

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.480 
upper body which really makes it an
all-around<00:03:02.880> fantastic<00:03:04.010> movement<00:03:05.010> because<00:03:05.460> it

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
all-around fantastic movement because it

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.990 
all-around fantastic movement because it
combines<00:03:06.240> explosive<00:03:07.020> power<00:03:07.430> full<00:03:08.430> body<00:03:08.670> work

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
combines explosive power full body work

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.580 
combines explosive power full body work
with<00:03:09.570> a<00:03:09.600> very<00:03:10.200> strong<00:03:11.150> hypertrophy<00:03:12.590> element

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
with a very strong hypertrophy element

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.130 
with a very strong hypertrophy element
to<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:14.070> lot<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.700> important<00:03:15.690> muscles<00:03:16.050> and

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
to a lot of the important muscles and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.690 
to a lot of the important muscles and
particularly<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.620> lot<00:03:16.770> of<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.950> important<00:03:17.400> show

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
particularly a lot of the important show

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.520 
particularly a lot of the important show
muscles<00:03:18.209> for<00:03:18.420> guys<00:03:18.600> who<00:03:18.900> are<00:03:19.020> really<00:03:19.350> looking

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
muscles for guys who are really looking

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.340 
muscles for guys who are really looking
to<00:03:20.010> look<00:03:20.580> better<00:03:20.850> without<00:03:21.150> strength<00:03:21.750> sports

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
to look better without strength sports

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.350 
to look better without strength sports
being<00:03:22.680> their<00:03:22.950> primary<00:03:23.520> focus<00:03:23.730> or<00:03:24.030> their<00:03:24.180> only

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
being their primary focus or their only

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.380 
being their primary focus or their only
focus<00:03:25.190> so<00:03:26.190> it's<00:03:26.340> really<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.640> very<00:03:26.730> versatile

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
focus so it's really a very versatile

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.449 
focus so it's really a very versatile
lift<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.870> like<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.350> I<00:03:28.470> recommend<00:03:28.950> anyone<00:03:29.070> who's

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
lift I like it I recommend anyone who's
