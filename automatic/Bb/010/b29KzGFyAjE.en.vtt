00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
including the iphone 5s so that's where

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.370 
including the iphone 5s so that's where
the<00:00:20.279> magnetized<00:00:20.820> case<00:00:21.180> comes<00:00:21.539> into<00:00:21.869> mind<00:00:22.109> as

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
the magnetized case comes into mind as

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.279 
the magnetized case comes into mind as
it<00:00:22.500> kind<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.800> mimics<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.550> functionality

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
it kind of mimics that functionality

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.080 
it kind of mimics that functionality
unlike<00:00:25.289> some<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.680> cheery<00:00:26.369> standard

same time it's held together in place
with<00:00:48.059> some<00:00:48.300> magnets<00:00:49.039> this<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.219> real

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
with some magnets this is the real

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.459 
with some magnets this is the real
extraordinary<00:00:51.120> about<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.510> design<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.170> case

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
extraordinary about the design the case

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.260 
extraordinary about the design the case
it's<00:00:52.890> pretty<00:00:53.160> much<00:00:53.280> straight<00:00:53.760> forward<00:00:54.120> a

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
it's pretty much straight forward a

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.240 
it's pretty much straight forward a
little<00:00:54.480> bit<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.780> conventional<00:00:55.440> side<00:00:55.710> it's

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
little bit the conventional side it's

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.520 
little bit the conventional side it's
made<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.670> plastic<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:57.600> not<00:00:57.719> too<00:00:57.989> heavy<00:00:58.170> at

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
made of plastic so it's not too heavy at

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.680 
made of plastic so it's not too heavy at
the<00:00:58.680> same<00:00:58.859> time<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.609> pretty<00:00:59.910> form-fitting

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
the same time it's pretty form-fitting

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.420 
the same time it's pretty form-fitting
so<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.020> doesn't<00:01:01.289> add<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> whole<00:01:01.680> lot<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.920> bulk<00:01:02.190> to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
so it doesn't add a whole lot of bulk to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.299 
so it doesn't add a whole lot of bulk to
the<00:01:02.460> iphone<00:01:03.059> size<00:01:03.589> it<00:01:04.589> attempts<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.010> emulate

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the iphone size it attempts to emulate

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.670 
the iphone size it attempts to emulate
the<00:01:05.729> look<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.240> metallic<00:01:06.600> finish<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:07.470> its

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the look of a metallic finish with its

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.399 
the look of a metallic finish with its
design<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.880> indeed<00:01:09.180> plastic<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> little

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
design but it is indeed plastic a little

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.770 
design but it is indeed plastic a little
bit<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.619> slippery<00:01:10.950> side<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.150> same<00:01:12.270> time<00:01:12.510> it

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
bit of slippery side at the same time it

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.679 
bit of slippery side at the same time it
does<00:01:13.020> make<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.409> case<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> little<00:01:14.130> bit<00:01:14.280> Hollow

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
does make the case a little bit Hollow

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.690 
does make the case a little bit Hollow
there<00:01:15.689> really<00:01:15.930> isn't<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> problem<00:01:16.700> inserting

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
there really isn't a problem inserting

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.550 
there really isn't a problem inserting
and<00:01:17.790> removing<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.450> handset<00:01:18.900> from<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.320> case

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and removing the handset from the case

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.289 
and removing the handset from the case
it's<00:01:19.830> basically<00:01:20.130> two<00:01:20.340> components<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.119> have

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
it's basically two components you have

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.749 
it's basically two components you have
this<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.960> top<00:01:22.500> portion<00:01:22.830> here<00:01:23.250> which

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
this this top portion here which

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.399 
this this top portion here which
basically<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.330> case<00:01:24.570> anything<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.290> have

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
basically in case anything and you have

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.530 
basically in case anything and you have
the<00:01:25.590> main<00:01:25.830> component<00:01:26.189> here<00:01:26.520> which<00:01:27.000> easily

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
the main component here which easily

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.359 
the main component here which easily
allows<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.170> handset<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.590> slide<00:01:28.920> into<00:01:29.130> place

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
allows the handset to slide into place

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.370 
allows the handset to slide into place
like<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:30.630> said<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:30.900> like<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.259> it's

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
like we said we like that it's

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.289 
like we said we like that it's
form-fitting<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.159> very<00:01:32.460> lightweight<00:01:32.790> but

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
form-fitting and very lightweight but

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.270 
form-fitting and very lightweight but
the<00:01:33.420> edges<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> case<00:01:34.259> are<00:01:34.500> pretty<00:01:34.890> sharp

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the edges of the case are pretty sharp

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.679 
the edges of the case are pretty sharp
especially<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> bottom<00:01:36.299> edge<00:01:36.479> where<00:01:36.630> you

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
especially the bottom edge where you

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.240 
especially the bottom edge where you
have<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.869> cutouts<00:01:37.170> for<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.439> microUSB<00:01:38.220> port

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
have the cutouts for the microUSB port

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.670 
have the cutouts for the microUSB port
and<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.729> three<00:01:39.570> nav<00:01:39.780> millimeter<00:01:40.229> headset

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
and the three nav millimeter headset

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.410 
and the three nav millimeter headset
jack<00:01:40.950> may<00:01:41.310> prove<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.939> little<00:01:42.150> bit<00:01:42.299> and

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
jack may prove to be a little bit and

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.569 
jack may prove to be a little bit and
comfortable<00:01:42.960> over<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> period<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.979> time<00:01:44.220> just

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
comfortable over a period of time just

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.249 
comfortable over a period of time just
because<00:01:44.880> they're<00:01:45.060> extremely<00:01:45.509> sharp<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
because they're extremely sharp to the

becomes even more recess than before so

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.559 
becomes even more recess than before so
that<00:02:11.400> means<00:02:11.610> you're<00:02:11.730> going<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.910> use<00:02:12.270> the

so<00:02:34.319> on<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.530> other<00:02:34.650> end<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.160> course<00:02:35.190> you

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
so on the other end of it of course you

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.059 
so on the other end of it of course you
have<00:02:35.640> your<00:02:35.670> usual<00:02:35.940> USB<00:02:36.720> connection<00:02:37.290> now<00:02:37.799> they

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
have your usual USB connection now they

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.130 
have your usual USB connection now they
have<00:02:38.340> magnets<00:02:38.879> inside<00:02:39.299> of<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.629> on<00:02:39.780> both<00:02:40.110> of

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
have magnets inside of you on both of

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.869 
have magnets inside of you on both of
them<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:40.829> that<00:02:40.980> as<00:02:41.129> soon<00:02:41.310> as<00:02:41.430> they're<00:02:41.579> close<00:02:41.760> to

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
them so that as soon as they're close to

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.610 
them so that as soon as they're close to
one<00:02:42.030> another<00:02:42.060> they're<00:02:42.750> going<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:42.959> snap<00:02:43.260> shut

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
one another they're going to snap shut

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.640 
one another they're going to snap shut
and<00:02:43.829> have<00:02:44.159> a<00:02:44.190> very<00:02:44.640> firm<00:02:44.909> connection<00:02:45.500> as<00:02:46.500> soon

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
and have a very firm connection as soon

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.319 
and have a very firm connection as soon
as<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:46.950> connected<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.730> handset<00:02:48.150> will

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
as it's connected the handset will

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.930 
as it's connected the handset will
automatically<00:02:49.319> start<00:02:49.590> charging<00:02:50.310> like<00:02:50.549> that

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
automatically start charging like that

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.240 
automatically start charging like that
now<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.390> cool<00:02:51.750> thing<00:02:51.959> about<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.500> connection

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
now the cool thing about the connection

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.039 
now the cool thing about the connection
here<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.670> there's<00:02:54.150> no<00:02:54.269> compromise<00:02:54.629> to

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
here is that there's no compromise to

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.960 
here is that there's no compromise to
the<00:02:55.079> charging<00:02:55.709> time<00:02:55.739> it's<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.459> same<00:02:56.760> thing

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
the charging time it's the same thing

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.699 
the charging time it's the same thing
you<00:02:57.060> would<00:02:57.120> get<00:02:57.329> if<00:02:57.629> you're<00:02:57.810> using<00:02:58.109> the<00:02:58.379> usual

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
you would get if you're using the usual

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.460 
you would get if you're using the usual
lightning<00:02:59.190> cable<00:02:59.700> so<00:02:59.970> it's<00:03:00.299> not<00:03:00.660> slower<00:03:01.109> or

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
lightning cable so it's not slower or

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.229 
lightning cable so it's not slower or
any<00:03:01.680> faster<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:02.549> you<00:03:02.609> can<00:03:02.790> get<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.030> same

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
any faster so you can get the same

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.900 
any faster so you can get the same
performance<00:03:03.660> with<00:03:04.349> the<00:03:04.379> connection<00:03:05.099> here<00:03:05.310> so

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
performance with the connection here so

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.580 
performance with the connection here so
no<00:03:06.090> time<00:03:06.269> at<00:03:06.450> all<00:03:06.569> we're<00:03:06.870> able<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.230> get<00:03:07.379> the

no time at all we're able to get the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.800 
no time at all we're able to get the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
handset fully charged in the same time

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.900 
handset fully charged in the same time
you<00:03:09.959> would<00:03:10.200> get<00:03:10.379> if<00:03:10.620> we<00:03:10.680> were<00:03:10.950> using<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.370> usual

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
you would get if we were using the usual
