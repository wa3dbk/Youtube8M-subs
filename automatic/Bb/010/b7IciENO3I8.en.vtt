00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:06.920
 especially because all your purchases 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.989
 It is from them that the debt is born after I 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.260
 I make the purchase on time 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.359
 of course I should take out debt and then 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.200
 I will have to honor that commitment 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.209
 Is not it 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.209

 these means of purchasing make 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.640
 Do you have future commitments? 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.860
 and therein lies the great secret in this 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.700
 diagnosis that we speak in the block 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.120
 previous 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.980
 it is necessary that you seek the cause of 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.370
 problem of indebtedness that is 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.700
 really upsetting and with that you 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.980

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.340

 But how do we go and get the cause? 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.579
 of this problem and there enters the education 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.880
 financial and this is the point more 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.310
 important you need to resume the 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.220
 control of incoming money and 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.150
 money that comes to this the diagnosis 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.810
 will give me the ability to interpret 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.739
 each expense and know how much of excess 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.620
 you have at this expense and also know if 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.690
 its financial budget entails 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.510
 all benefits 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.819
 many people are spending a lot more 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.910
 what they are really getting 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.840
 honor the benefits he assumed then 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.670
 we really need to be aware 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.549
 financially well 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.549
 reinaldo sunday I'm already in debt 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:51.450
 I can not pay the credit card anymore. 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.639
 the total monthly installment I already am 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.459
 the overdraft totally taken his 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:59.489
 limit is already bursting I no longer 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.549
 I can pay the installment of the 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.910
 Finally, I'm in a situation 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:08.220
 It is very delicate at this moment that the 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.400
 Financial education can do 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.250
 great value of the great solution for 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.000
 your life and in this sense it's time to have 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.889
 calm down even you 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.680
 seek the creditor to try to reach agreement 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.169
 I do not advise that you need 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.070
 first take over your control 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.800
 financially the money that in 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.170
 the money that comes out then it 's necessary 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.240
 that you do so the diagnosis of 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.690
 all you should have a check 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.610
 especially when the rate I 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.040
 I must pay when I go to 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.140
 I am still missing the full amount of my 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.410
 debt is a diagnosis specifically 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:50.200
 in the activity at that moment you will be 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.240
 really taking conscience into account 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.150
 control of all your debts and there 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.760
 those that are no longer being conditions 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.950
 to pay for those that are already already 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.430
 have expired and you are already really 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.900
 defaulting reinaldo has already been denied 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.260
 no spc and no serasa 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.480
 My name is dirty it is logical that the 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.850
 moment you actually start a 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.660
 new story and for this you need 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.940
 be calm tranquility we will talk to 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.670
 our creditor at the first moment owe 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:25.300
 I do not deny paid when and how I can 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:27.880
 that's right I should not deny paid as e 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.550
 when you can you need to resume 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.010
 control of your financial life does not 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.400
 to make agreement that you really do not 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:39.940
 will honor it and there comes the side really 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.370
 his absolute control the reins of his 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.670
 financial life before seeking a 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.400
 According to lenders how now you already 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.860
 know to whom you owe how it is that you 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.480
 is in your financial life the 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.850
 indebtedness becomes something 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:59.110
 controlled then how do we go? 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:01.150
 pay each installment that is already past due 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.170
 so nothing to make payments 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.060
 anticipated 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.510
 I need my budget first 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.190
 financially understand that I can not 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.010
 spend more than I'm getting 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.440
 This means that I need to balance 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.960
 and more than that I need to have a 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.230
 left over from my budget so 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.660
 know how much you spend and spend less 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.300
 What you get is the big secret. 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:28.600
 so you can create the 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:31.750
 strategy so you can make a 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:35.860
 according to a proposal or even 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:39.010
 save money for the lender a 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.880
 day be the subject of negotiations but 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.520
 I believe 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.840
 if you do not have your budget 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:48.460
 earning more than you spend 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.380
 you will hardly be able to honor your 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.750
 commitments even by making an agreement 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:56.560
 elongated with very low interest rate 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:07:00.010
 so more than ever you need to have 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:03.370
 absolute self- control and the next 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:07.330
 program we will do just that as 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:10.720
