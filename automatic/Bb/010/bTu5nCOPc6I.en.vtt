00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
pots or recall afterwards instead of

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.459 
pots or recall afterwards instead of
having<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.910> lose<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.270> much<00:00:36.420> HP<00:00:36.630> there's<00:00:37.410> a

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
having to lose so much HP there's a

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.900 
having to lose so much HP there's a
really<00:00:37.739> interesting<00:00:37.770> technique<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.730> can<00:00:38.790> use

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
really interesting technique you can use

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.970 
really interesting technique you can use
to<00:00:39.300> minimize<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.989> amount<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.559> damage<00:00:40.950> that

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
to minimize the amount of damage that

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.950 
to minimize the amount of damage that
dragon<00:00:41.489> deals<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.600> when<00:00:42.780> used

dragon deals to you and when used

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.779 
dragon deals to you and when used
perfectly<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.739> cause<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.219> take<00:00:44.399> zero

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
perfectly it can cause you to take zero

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.240 
perfectly it can cause you to take zero
damage<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.930> basic<00:00:46.260> idea<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.039> technique

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
damage the basic idea of the technique

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.119 
damage the basic idea of the technique
is<00:00:47.640> abusing<00:00:48.000> two<00:00:48.329> main<00:00:48.629> facts<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.739> dragon

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
is abusing two main facts that dragon

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.040 
is abusing two main facts that dragon
will<00:00:50.280> always<00:00:50.640> attack<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.120> target<00:00:51.300> closest<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
will always attack the target closest to

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.869 
will always attack the target closest to
it<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.980> fact<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.250> your<00:00:53.460> eigen<00:00:53.579> can

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
it and the fact that your eigen can

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.639 
it and the fact that your eigen can
change<00:00:54.149> its<00:00:54.360> target<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.809> focus<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.410> the
