probably one of the biggest changes that
that<00:01:24.580> we<00:01:24.670> go<00:01:24.820> through<00:01:25.030> is<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.740> amount<00:01:26.860> of

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
that we go through is the amount of

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.030 
that we go through is the amount of
racing<00:01:27.340> it's<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.760> lot<00:01:27.910> more<00:01:27.940> and<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:29.040> the

racing it's a lot more and and the

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
muscle on yeah you definitely have to

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.540 
muscle on yeah you definitely have to
you<00:01:52.360> know<00:01:52.510> try<00:01:53.440> to<00:01:53.530> get<00:01:53.740> bigger<00:01:53.950> or<00:01:54.160> get<00:01:54.370> better

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
you know try to get bigger or get better

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.070 
you know try to get bigger or get better
for<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:54.850> 450<00:01:55.390> it's<00:01:55.570> a<00:01:55.810> lot<00:01:56.260> faster<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:56.980> a

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
for the 450 it's a lot faster and a

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.750 
for the 450 it's a lot faster and a
little<00:01:59.080> more<00:01:59.290> weight<00:01:59.470> to<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.860> so<00:02:00.040> I<00:02:00.070> mean<00:02:00.490> I

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
little more weight to it so I mean I

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.500 
little more weight to it so I mean I
tried<00:02:01.360> to<00:02:01.450> do<00:02:01.540> what<00:02:01.660> I<00:02:01.720> could<00:02:01.780> do<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:04.210> just

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
tried to do what I could do and and just

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.970 
tried to do what I could do and and just
in<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.990> back<00:02:05.140> of<00:02:05.290> your<00:02:05.380> mind<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:05.650> got<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:05.860> know

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
in the back of your mind you got to know

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.590 
in the back of your mind you got to know
that<00:02:06.010> it's<00:02:06.280> a<00:02:06.340> lot<00:02:06.490> faster<00:02:06.670> and<00:02:06.940> then<00:02:07.330> when<00:02:07.510> it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
that it's a lot faster and then when it

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.330 
that it's a lot faster and then when it
by<00:02:07.720> two<00:02:07.780> it<00:02:08.050> bites<00:02:08.229> you<00:02:08.349> you<00:02:08.770> know<00:02:08.890> twice<00:02:09.160> as

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
by two it bites you you know twice as

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.830 
by two it bites you you know twice as
hard<00:02:09.519> so<00:02:09.670> it's<00:02:09.969> because<00:02:10.329> it's<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.539> little<00:02:10.750> bit

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
hard so it's because it's a little bit

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.490 
hard so it's because it's a little bit
heavier<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.349> in<00:02:11.439> a<00:02:11.530> lot<00:02:11.650> faster<00:02:11.859> so

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
heavier and in a lot faster so

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.080 
heavier and in a lot faster so
it<00:02:13.160> uh<00:02:13.270> you<00:02:14.270> just<00:02:14.390> gotta<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:14.960> know<00:02:15.580> watch<00:02:16.580> pick

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
it uh you just gotta you know watch pick

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.370 
it uh you just gotta you know watch pick
and<00:02:17.240> choose<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.750> know<00:02:17.870> why<00:02:18.080> are<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.200> pushing

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
and choose you know why are you pushing

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.110 
and choose you know why are you pushing
where<00:02:18.680> you<00:02:18.740> don't<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:19.190> little<00:02:19.640> bit<00:02:19.760> easier<00:02:19.880> to

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
where you don't a little bit easier to

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.510 
where you don't a little bit easier to
do<00:02:20.330> some<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.810> step<00:02:21.290> on<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.740> step-offs<00:02:22.130> in

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
do some of the step on and step-offs in

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.130 
do some of the step on and step-offs in
the<00:02:22.640> triple<00:02:23.030> with<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.300> extra<00:02:23.540> power<00:02:23.810> mean

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
the triple with that extra power mean

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.810 
the triple with that extra power mean
did<00:02:24.320> you<00:02:24.500> can<00:02:24.800> find<00:02:24.980> yourself<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.340> first<00:02:25.610> time

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
did you can find yourself the first time

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.670 
did you can find yourself the first time
on<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:26.000> supercross<00:02:26.570> track<00:02:26.780> on<00:02:27.020> a<00:02:27.050> 40-goal<00:02:27.440> wow

man<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.250> over-jumped<00:02:28.970> that<00:02:29.209> triple<00:02:29.630> yeah<00:02:29.900> it's

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
man I over-jumped that triple yeah it's

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.630 
man I over-jumped that triple yeah it's
definitely<00:02:30.320> nice<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.650> have<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.010> power<00:02:31.160> but

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
definitely nice to have the power but

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.090 
definitely nice to have the power but
obviously<00:02:31.820> like<00:02:32.300> I<00:02:32.420> said<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:33.410> power<00:02:33.590> can<00:02:33.980> also

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
obviously like I said the power can also

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.920 
obviously like I said the power can also
get<00:02:34.370> you<00:02:34.459> in<00:02:34.550> trouble<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.090> yeah<00:02:35.690> there's

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
get you in trouble so yeah there's

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.540 
get you in trouble so yeah there's
obviously<00:02:36.290> gives<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.680> takes<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:37.010> 450<00:02:37.400> does

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
obviously gives and takes the 450 does

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.760 
obviously gives and takes the 450 does
stuff<00:02:37.760> good<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.120> 250f<00:02:38.570> just<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.170> stuff<00:02:39.530> good

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
stuff good the 250f just the stuff good

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.120 
stuff good the 250f just the stuff good
and<00:02:39.890> they<00:02:39.950> both<00:02:40.100> do<00:02:40.250> stuff<00:02:40.459> bad<00:02:40.670> so<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:42.920> nuts

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
and they both do stuff bad so you nuts

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.470 
and they both do stuff bad so you nuts
that's<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.490> real<00:02:43.640> that's<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.030> real<00:02:44.180> thing<00:02:44.390> is

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
that's the real that's the real thing is

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.180 
that's the real that's the real thing is
you<00:02:44.600> have<00:02:44.630> a<00:02:44.750> lot<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:44.930> power<00:02:45.170> in<00:02:45.290> but<00:02:45.709> then<00:02:46.010> you

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
you have a lot of power in but then you

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.130 
you have a lot of power in but then you
you<00:02:46.220> know<00:02:46.489> you<00:02:46.520> sacrifice<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.120> little<00:02:47.780> bit<00:02:48.020> of

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
you know you sacrifice a little bit of

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.050 
you know you sacrifice a little bit of
the<00:02:48.290> you<00:02:48.680> know<00:02:48.800> you<00:02:49.280> have<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.550> weight<00:02:49.730> and

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
the you know you have the weight and

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.820 
the you know you have the weight and
obviously<00:02:50.989> it<00:02:51.080> might<00:02:51.170> be<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.320> little<00:02:51.410> harder<00:02:51.800> to

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
obviously it might be a little harder to

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.770 
obviously it might be a little harder to
turn<00:02:52.070> because<00:02:52.310> you're<00:02:52.550> trying<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.790> turn<00:02:52.970> you

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
turn because you're trying to turn you

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.720 
turn because you're trying to turn you
know<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.080> bike<00:02:54.260> that's<00:02:54.500> way<00:02:54.650> faster<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:55.489> i

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
know the bike that's way faster so i
