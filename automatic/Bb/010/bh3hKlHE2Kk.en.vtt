pronounce it fail and I just want to

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.930 
pronounce it fail and I just want to
point<00:00:13.710> out<00:00:13.830> right<00:00:14.099> here<00:00:14.340> i<00:00:14.400> knifed<00:00:14.730> this

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
point out right here i knifed this

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.880 
point out right here i knifed this
SATCOM<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.870> counts<00:00:16.080> as<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.289> point<00:00:16.619> toward

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
SATCOM and that counts as a point toward

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.890 
SATCOM and that counts as a point toward
my<00:00:17.070> point<00:00:17.340> streak<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.760> when<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.240> get<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> kem

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
my point streak and when you get a kem

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.109 
my point streak and when you get a kem
strike<00:00:19.199> it's<00:00:19.439> actually<00:00:20.279> called<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.789> point

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
strike it's actually called a point

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.689 
strike it's actually called a point
streak<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.750> for<00:00:22.050> example<00:00:22.160> when<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.310> knife<00:00:23.519> a

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
streak so for example when you knife a

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.029 
streak so for example when you knife a
sad<00:00:23.910> calm<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.779> get<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> point<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.920> would

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
sad calm and you get a point you would

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.529 
sad calm and you get a point you would
think<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.760> would<00:00:26.910> count<00:00:27.119> toward<00:00:27.480> your

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
think that that would count toward your

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.660 
think that that would count toward your
point<00:00:27.900> streak<00:00:28.260> but<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.769> actually<00:00:29.220> isn't<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
point streak but that actually isn't the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.160 
point streak but that actually isn't the
case<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.240> guys<00:00:30.390> are<00:00:30.570> gonna<00:00:30.630> see<00:00:30.960> why<00:00:31.140> that

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
case and you guys are gonna see why that

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.590 
case and you guys are gonna see why that
was<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.769> crucial<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.880> game<00:00:33.120> play<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
was so crucial in this game play and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.170 
was so crucial in this game play and
that<00:00:34.290> was<00:00:34.530> kind<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.920> mistake<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.399> ended<00:00:36.000> up

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that was kind of a mistake that ended up

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.569 
that was kind of a mistake that ended up
I<00:00:36.450> guess<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.320> wasn't<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.649> mistake<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.489> was

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
I guess it wasn't a mistake but it was

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.160 
I guess it wasn't a mistake but it was
just<00:00:38.610> something<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.300> would<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.780> gotten<00:00:39.989> me

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
just something that would have gotten me

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.990 
just something that would have gotten me
the<00:00:40.320> kem<00:00:40.530> strike<00:00:40.920> if<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.460> hadn't<00:00:41.790> been<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the kem strike if that hadn't been the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.420 
the kem strike if that hadn't been the
case<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.420> anyways<00:00:43.170> let's<00:00:43.680> get<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> actual

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
case but anyways let's get to the actual

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.819 
case but anyways let's get to the actual
gameplay<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.960> match<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.320> guys<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.710> in

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
gameplay so the match you guys have in

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.310 
gameplay so the match you guys have in
front<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> game<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.170> domination<00:00:49.170> on

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
front of you is a game of domination on

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.770 
front of you is a game of domination on
the<00:00:49.530> map<00:00:49.710> Warhawk<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.969> definitely<00:00:51.210> one

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
the map Warhawk this is definitely one

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.260 
the map Warhawk this is definitely one
of<00:00:51.809> my<00:00:51.960> favorite<00:00:52.620> maps<00:00:52.829> for<00:00:53.340> at<00:00:54.149> least

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
of my favorite maps for at least

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.090 
of my favorite maps for at least
attempting<00:00:54.809> kem<00:00:54.989> strikes<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
attempting kem strikes I just like the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.920 
attempting kem strikes I just like the
way<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.340> spawns<00:00:56.640> work<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.750> it's

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
way the spawns work and I like that it's

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.750 
way the spawns work and I like that it's
not<00:00:58.050> too<00:00:58.350> big<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.250> there<00:00:59.430> aren't<00:00:59.550> too

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
not too big and that there aren't too

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.279 
not too big and that there aren't too
many<00:00:59.789> lines<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.359> get<00:01:00.480> sniped<00:01:00.840> if<00:01:01.140> you're

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
many lines to get sniped if you're

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.410 
many lines to get sniped if you're
careful<00:01:01.530> enough<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.730> gun<00:01:02.910> i'm<00:01:03.000> using<00:01:03.329> in

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
careful enough and the gun i'm using in

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.960 
careful enough and the gun i'm using in
the<00:01:03.480> game<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.409> assault<00:01:04.860> rifle<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.430> ak-12

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the game is the assault rifle the ak-12

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.020 
the game is the assault rifle the ak-12
i<00:01:06.860> definitely<00:01:07.860> recommend<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.340> gun<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.880> a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
i definitely recommend this gun it's a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.240 
i definitely recommend this gun it's a
three<00:01:09.270> shot<00:01:09.510> kill<00:01:09.810> from<00:01:10.530> from<00:01:11.040> close<00:01:11.220> distance

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
three shot kill from from close distance

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.850 
three shot kill from from close distance
and<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.390> foreshock<00:01:12.780> hill<00:01:12.990> from<00:01:13.260> range<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and and a foreshock hill from range and

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.219 
and and a foreshock hill from range and
the<00:01:14.130> attachments<00:01:14.729> i'm<00:01:14.850> using<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.600> grip<00:01:15.930> so

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the attachments i'm using is the grip so

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.380 
the attachments i'm using is the grip so
that<00:01:16.409> my<00:01:16.530> recoil<00:01:17.100> doesn't<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:17.970> too<00:01:18.210> out<00:01:18.360> of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
that my recoil doesn't get too out of

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.060 
that my recoil doesn't get too out of
hand<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.930> then<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.470> muzzle<00:01:19.920> brake

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
hand and then the muzzle brake

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.160 
hand and then the muzzle brake
attachment<00:01:20.700> which<00:01:21.119> also<00:01:21.390> increases<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
attachment which also increases the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.960 
attachment which also increases the
range<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.920> assault<00:01:23.189> rifle<00:01:23.520> by<00:01:23.640> twenty

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
range of the assault rifle by twenty

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.700 
range of the assault rifle by twenty
percent<00:01:24.299> which<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.020> really<00:01:25.259> helpful<00:01:25.560> for

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
percent which is really helpful for

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.590 
percent which is really helpful for
getting<00:01:26.100> through<00:01:26.250> shot<00:01:26.520> kills<00:01:26.790> at<00:01:27.150> longer

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
getting through shot kills at longer

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.999 
getting through shot kills at longer
ranges<00:01:27.960> which<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.650> be<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> difference

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
ranges which can be the difference

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.940 
ranges which can be the difference
between<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.579> kill<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.299> death<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.930> I'm<00:01:31.710> using

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
between a kill and a death so I'm using

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.590 
between a kill and a death so I'm using
the<00:01:32.189> specialist<00:01:32.790> setup<00:01:33.060> which<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.360> pretty

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the specialist setup which is pretty

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.569 
the specialist setup which is pretty
common<00:01:33.990> when<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.560> comes<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.950> attempting<00:01:35.430> kem

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
common when it comes to attempting kem

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.770

anything else you could use like a

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.850 
anything else you could use like a
support<00:01:48.420> set<00:01:48.600> up<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.899> then<00:01:49.020> you'd<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.170> UAVs

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860
