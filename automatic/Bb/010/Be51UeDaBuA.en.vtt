00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
I'm just going to quickly explain a

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.379 
I'm just going to quickly explain a
little<00:00:02.220> bit<00:00:02.399> about<00:00:02.460> maintenance<00:00:03.240> of<00:00:03.360> your

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
little bit about maintenance of your

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.910 
little bit about maintenance of your
products<00:00:03.870> and<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.200> make<00:00:04.319> sure<00:00:04.500> you<00:00:04.650> get<00:00:04.799> the

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
products and to make sure you get the

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.860 
products and to make sure you get the
most<00:00:05.100> out<00:00:05.339> of<00:00:05.370> it<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:05.910> assure<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.330> efficiency

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
most out of it and assure the efficiency

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.990 
most out of it and assure the efficiency
as<00:00:06.990> as<00:00:07.109> far<00:00:07.259> as<00:00:07.410> possible<00:00:07.620> now<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.550> noticed<00:00:08.940> on

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
as as far as possible now I noticed on

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000 
as as far as possible now I noticed on
the<00:00:09.120> product<00:00:09.420> there's<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.599> max<00:00:09.809> fill<00:00:10.019> line<00:00:10.080> what

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
the product there's a max fill line what

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.919 
the product there's a max fill line what
we<00:00:11.099> recommend<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:11.849> when<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.330> see<00:00:12.540> dirt

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
we recommend is that when you see dirt

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.259 
we recommend is that when you see dirt
and<00:00:13.230> dust<00:00:13.559> get<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.309> towards<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.820> max<00:00:15.089> fill

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
and dust get in towards the max fill

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.760 
and dust get in towards the max fill
line<00:00:15.299> it's<00:00:15.660> there<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.320> right<00:00:16.500> time<00:00:16.740> to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
line it's there is the right time to

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.710 
line it's there is the right time to
empty<00:00:17.100> even<00:00:17.789> though<00:00:17.940> there's<00:00:18.180> more<00:00:18.420> capacity

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
empty even though there's more capacity

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.140 
empty even though there's more capacity
in<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.140> product<00:00:19.500> basically<00:00:20.460> if<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.640> overfill

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
in the product basically if you overfill

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.330 
in the product basically if you overfill
your<00:00:21.300> product<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:22.470> airflow<00:00:22.800> can't<00:00:23.070> get

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
your product the airflow can't get

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.000 
your product the airflow can't get
through<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.570> floor<00:00:24.779> head<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.410> your<00:00:25.710> actual

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
through to the floor head so your actual

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.759 
through to the floor head so your actual
cleaning<00:00:26.160> performance<00:00:26.460> will<00:00:27.449> be<00:00:27.689> reduced<00:00:28.140> if

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
cleaning performance will be reduced if

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.679 
cleaning performance will be reduced if
you<00:00:29.010> regularly<00:00:29.670> maintain<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.330> enter<00:00:30.570> your

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
you regularly maintain and enter your

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.970 
you regularly maintain and enter your
product<00:00:31.019> then<00:00:31.199> you'll<00:00:31.380> always<00:00:31.529> ensure

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
product then you'll always ensure

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.990 
product then you'll always ensure
maximum<00:00:32.250> efficiency<00:00:33.120> impact<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.660> performance

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
maximum efficiency impact of performance

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
maximum efficiency impact of performance
you'll<00:00:36.000> notice<00:00:36.390> if<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.690> take<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.960> canister

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
you'll notice if we take that canister

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.190 
you'll notice if we take that canister
off<00:00:37.850> that<00:00:38.850> we've<00:00:38.969> got<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> an<00:00:39.809> orange

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
off that we've got a an orange

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.260 
off that we've got a an orange
color-coded<00:00:41.070> area<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.820> actually<00:00:42.120> where

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
color-coded area this is actually where

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.709 
color-coded area this is actually where
the<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:43.140> pre-filter<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:45.210> recommend

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the the pre-filter is so we recommend

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.029 
the the pre-filter is so we recommend
that<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.530> should<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.739> checked

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
that this this should be checked

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.540 
that this this should be checked
regularly<00:00:47.129> but<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.300> average<00:00:49.309> you<00:00:50.309> should

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
regularly but on average you should

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.340 
regularly but on average you should
really<00:00:50.850> clean<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.360> products<00:00:51.840> or<00:00:52.170> this

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
really clean this products or this

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.889 
really clean this products or this
filter<00:00:52.770> once<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.219> month<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:54.210> access<00:00:54.600> it's

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
filter once a month so access it's

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.810 
filter once a month so access it's
really<00:00:55.170> simple<00:00:56.120> like<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.559> take<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.800> out<00:00:58.890> what

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
really simple like this take it out what

really simple like this take it out what
you'll<00:00:59.969> see<00:01:00.180> now<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.260> filter<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.730> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
you'll see now is the filter this is a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.039 
you'll see now is the filter this is a
foam<00:01:03.359> filter<00:01:04.159> so<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.280> very<00:01:05.489> easy<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:06.240> clean

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
foam filter so it's very easy to clean

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.929 
foam filter so it's very easy to clean
you<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:07.470> put<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.130> onto<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.430> tap<00:01:08.670> with

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
you just put it onto the tap with

you just put it onto the tap with
lukewarm<00:01:09.360> water<00:01:09.500> give<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.680> good<00:01:10.860> squish<00:01:11.310> and

lukewarm water give it a good squish and

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.789 
lukewarm water give it a good squish and
a<00:01:11.580> squeeze<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.689> rinse<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.020> off<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.500> let<00:01:13.650> that

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
a squeeze to rinse it off and let that

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.660 
a squeeze to rinse it off and let that
dry<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.100> 24<00:01:14.670> hours<00:01:15.030> once<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.140> dry<00:01:16.640> you<00:01:17.640> can

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
dry for 24 hours once it's dry you can

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.630 
dry for 24 hours once it's dry you can
put<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.090> straight<00:01:18.720> back<00:01:18.900> in

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.789 

put<00:01:24.640> that<00:01:24.759> on<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:27.369> way<00:01:27.520> you<00:01:27.580> go<00:01:27.820> again<00:01:28.799> and

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
put that on the way you go again and

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.399 
put that on the way you go again and
then<00:01:29.890> finally<00:01:30.340> there's<00:01:30.580> an<00:01:30.700> exhaust<00:01:31.000> filter

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
then finally there's an exhaust filter

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.170 
then finally there's an exhaust filter
underneath<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.680> product<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.940> exhaust

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.749 
good idea just to check the maintenance
of<00:01:58.240> this<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:58.720> we<00:01:58.810> just<00:01:58.960> got<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.140> coin<00:01:59.490> very<00:02:00.490> easy

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
of this so we just got a coin very easy

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.490 
of this so we just got a coin very easy
everyone's<00:02:01.569> got<00:02:01.750> one<00:02:01.800> and<00:02:02.800> do<00:02:03.039> the<00:02:04.229> part<00:02:05.229> and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
everyone's got one and do the part and

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.460 
everyone's got one and do the part and
then<00:02:05.950> this<00:02:06.130> access<00:02:06.580> is<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:08.200> exhaust

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
then this access is the the exhaust

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.650 
then this access is the the exhaust
filter<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.970> on<00:02:10.090> here<00:02:10.239> you've<00:02:10.360> got<00:02:10.539> an

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
filter so on here you've got an

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.770 
filter so on here you've got an
antibacterial<00:02:10.929> layer<00:02:11.709> so<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.549> keeps<00:02:13.390> odors

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
antibacterial layer so that keeps odors

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.440 
antibacterial layer so that keeps odors
and<00:02:14.110> bacteria<00:02:14.680> at<00:02:15.100> bay<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.640> reduces<00:02:16.180> smells

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
and bacteria at bay and reduces smells

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.440 
and bacteria at bay and reduces smells
and<00:02:16.930> here<00:02:17.470> you've<00:02:17.560> got<00:02:17.769> a<00:02:17.799> HEPA<00:02:18.160> 13<00:02:18.610> filter<00:02:19.150> so

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
and here you've got a HEPA 13 filter so

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.830 
and here you've got a HEPA 13 filter so
that's<00:02:19.630> real<00:02:20.170> high<00:02:20.410> efficiency<00:02:20.980> filter<00:02:21.840> ideal

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
that's real high efficiency filter ideal

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.270 
that's real high efficiency filter ideal
for<00:02:23.049> allergy<00:02:23.380> sufferers<00:02:23.410> people<00:02:24.190> who've

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
for allergy sufferers people who've

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.180 
for allergy sufferers people who've
asked<00:02:24.549> more<00:02:24.670> things<00:02:25.060> like<00:02:25.239> that<00:02:25.680> we<00:02:26.680> recommend

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
asked more things like that we recommend

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.940 
asked more things like that we recommend
you<00:02:27.280> keep<00:02:27.489> an<00:02:27.640> eye<00:02:27.760> on<00:02:27.790> these<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.680> with<00:02:29.680> again

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
you keep an eye on these and with again

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.340 
you keep an eye on these and with again
with<00:02:30.130> average<00:02:30.610> use<00:02:30.820> it's<00:02:31.090> best<00:02:31.329> to<00:02:31.450> change

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
with average use it's best to change

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.970 
with average use it's best to change
these<00:02:32.739> probably<00:02:33.430> every<00:02:33.700> six<00:02:33.970> months<00:02:34.470> but<00:02:35.470> if

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
these probably every six months but if

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.560 
these probably every six months but if
you<00:02:36.130> just<00:02:36.280> keep<00:02:36.489> an<00:02:36.670> eye<00:02:36.790> on<00:02:36.850> them<00:02:37.060> you'll<00:02:37.450> be

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
you just keep an eye on them you'll be

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.229 
you just keep an eye on them you'll be
able<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.840> see<00:02:38.799> how<00:02:39.010> dirty<00:02:39.250> they<00:02:39.579> are<00:02:42.239> so

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
able to see how dirty they are so

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.750 
able to see how dirty they are so
there's<00:02:44.049> very<00:02:44.350> little<00:02:44.560> maintenance<00:02:44.859> required

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
there's very little maintenance required

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.050 
there's very little maintenance required
but<00:02:46.180> we've<00:02:46.660> tried<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.049> more<00:02:47.200> itches<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:48.060> make

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
but we've tried it more itches to make

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.390 
but we've tried it more itches to make
it<00:02:49.209> as<00:02:49.329> easy<00:02:49.540> as<00:02:49.900> possible<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.799> maintain<00:02:51.010> your

it as easy as possible to maintain your

it as easy as possible to maintain your
products<00:02:52.350> everyone<00:02:53.350> hates<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.829> but<00:02:54.130> it<00:02:54.220> looks

easy

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
easy

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.109 
easy
it's<00:02:56.739> obviously<00:02:57.100> not<00:02:57.690> such<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.720> child
