00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
think about what would happen if you

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.080 
think about what would happen if you

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
for example the Hindenburg was a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.759 
for example the Hindenburg was a
balloon-like<00:01:02.940> airship<00:01:03.750> which<00:01:03.930> used<00:01:04.170> hydrogen

balloon-like airship which used hydrogen

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.590 
balloon-like airship which used hydrogen
gas<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.369> float<00:01:05.640> because<00:01:05.880> hydrogen<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.570> lighter

than<00:01:07.110> air<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.740> lightest<00:01:08.280> element<00:01:08.430> there

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
than air it's the lightest element there
