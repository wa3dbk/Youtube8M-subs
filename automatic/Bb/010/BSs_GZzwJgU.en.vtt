00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
save cucumber seeds and now this might

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.410 
save cucumber seeds and now this might
strike<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.420> as<00:00:18.720> crazy<00:00:18.980> but<00:00:19.980> it's<00:00:20.970> not<00:00:21.210> hard

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
strike you as crazy but it's not hard

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.980 
strike you as crazy but it's not hard
and<00:00:22.130> everything<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.279> do<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.699> very<00:00:24.390> simple

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
and everything that I do is very simple

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.070 
and everything that I do is very simple
so<00:00:25.460> just<00:00:26.460> know<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.180> not<00:00:27.390> rocket

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
so just know that this is not rocket

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.200 
so just know that this is not rocket
science<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.680> when<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.519> see<00:00:29.670> how<00:00:29.789> easy<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.090> is

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
science and when you see how easy it is

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.999 
science and when you see how easy it is
you<00:00:30.810> might<00:00:30.960> slap<00:00:31.170> yourself<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.590> couple<00:00:31.830> times

and<00:01:42.710> really<00:01:43.710> any<00:01:43.950> way<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.250> want<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.549> do<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.850> I

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
and really any way you want to do it I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.910 
and really any way you want to do it I
can<00:01:45.869> slice<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.320> half<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.710> show<00:01:46.829> you

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
can slice it in half just to show you

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.530 
can slice it in half just to show you
count<00:01:47.100> what's<00:01:47.220> going<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:48.390> it's

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
count what's going on here but it's

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.960 
count what's going on here but it's
pretty<00:01:48.720> hollow<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.380> inside<00:01:49.530> as<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.850> guys

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
pretty hollow on the inside as you guys

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.990 
pretty hollow on the inside as you guys
can<00:01:51.149> see<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.780> definitely<00:01:51.990> hollow<00:01:52.820> it's<00:01:53.820> I

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
can see it's definitely hollow it's I

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.810 
can see it's definitely hollow it's I
mean<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:55.140> very<00:01:55.350> spongy<00:01:55.770> but<00:01:56.670> you

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
mean it's like it's very spongy but you

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.679 
mean it's like it's very spongy but you
just<00:01:57.000> see<00:01:57.180> these<00:01:57.360> beautiful<00:01:58.040> seeds<00:01:59.040> here<00:01:59.280> and

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
just see these beautiful seeds here and

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.789 
just see these beautiful seeds here and
they<00:02:00.689> kind<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.990> got<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.320> little<00:02:01.590> seed

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
they kind of got like a little seed

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.709 
they kind of got like a little seed
coating<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.969> outside<00:02:03.360> they're<00:02:03.570> kind

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
coating on on the outside they're kind

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.950 
coating on on the outside they're kind
of<00:02:03.780> slimy<00:02:04.340> but<00:02:05.340> they<00:02:05.460> got<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.729> kind<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.360> jelly

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
of slimy but they got this kind of jelly

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.669 
of slimy but they got this kind of jelly
like<00:02:07.229> seed<00:02:07.649> coating<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:10.050> seed<00:02:10.289> coating

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
like seed coating and the seed coating

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.400 
like seed coating and the seed coating
is

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
is

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.710 
is
is<00:02:11.470> right<00:02:12.100> there<00:02:12.130> it's<00:02:12.850> kind<00:02:13.060> of<00:02:13.150> gooey<00:02:13.360> kind

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
is right there it's kind of gooey kind

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.270 
is right there it's kind of gooey kind
of<00:02:13.810> slimy<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.320> got<00:02:14.470> dudes<00:02:14.710> I<00:02:14.980> gonna<00:02:15.100> ask

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
of slimy so I got dudes I gonna ask

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.760 
of slimy so I got dudes I gonna ask
these<00:02:15.430> little<00:02:15.610> booger<00:02:15.790> actually<00:02:16.600> but<00:02:17.530> then

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
these little booger actually but then

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.520 
these little booger actually but then
the<00:02:18.280> seed<00:02:18.580> comes<00:02:19.210> out<00:02:19.390> perfect<00:02:19.780> we're<00:02:20.410> not

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
the seed comes out perfect we're not

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.690 
the seed comes out perfect we're not
gonna<00:02:20.680> worry<00:02:20.860> about<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.040> seed<00:02:21.340> coating

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
gonna worry about that seed coating

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.880 
gonna worry about that seed coating
because<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.450> seed<00:02:22.690> coating<00:02:23.050> is<00:02:23.230> totally

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
because that seed coating is totally

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.800 
because that seed coating is totally
harmless<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.120> what<00:02:25.210> we're<00:02:25.300> gonna<00:02:25.360> do<00:02:25.570> is<00:02:25.660> we're

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
harmless so what we're gonna do is we're

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.430 
harmless so what we're gonna do is we're
just<00:02:25.840> gonna<00:02:26.050> take<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:27.180> cucumber<00:02:28.230> Eric<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.350> just

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
just gonna take the cucumber Eric I just

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.190 
just gonna take the cucumber Eric I just
got<00:02:29.740> kind<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.430> rolling<00:02:30.730> around<00:02:30.880> work<00:02:31.870> out<00:02:32.050> the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
got kind of rolling around work out the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.670 
got kind of rolling around work out the
seeds<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:33.730> ones<00:02:33.910> that<00:02:34.120> come<00:02:34.330> out<00:02:34.480> are<00:02:34.840> are

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
seeds and the ones that come out are are

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.580 
seeds and the ones that come out are are
good<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.480> can<00:02:37.630> just<00:02:37.780> kind<00:02:37.960> of<00:02:38.020> give<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.530> a

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
good and you can just kind of give it a

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.820 
good and you can just kind of give it a
nice<00:02:38.650> smack<00:02:39.190> sometimes<00:02:39.550> they<00:02:39.640> come<00:02:39.820> out<00:02:39.910> but

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
nice smack sometimes they come out but

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.220 
nice smack sometimes they come out but
just<00:02:41.830> kind<00:02:41.980> of<00:02:42.010> squeeze<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.460> and<00:02:42.990> these<00:02:43.990> seeds

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
just kind of squeeze it and these seeds

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.140 
just kind of squeeze it and these seeds
should<00:02:44.380> just<00:02:44.590> kind<00:02:44.770> of<00:02:44.800> come<00:02:45.340> out<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:46.030> can

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
should just kind of come out and you can

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.790 
should just kind of come out and you can
also<00:02:46.270> use<00:02:46.630> your<00:02:46.750> finger<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.230> help<00:02:47.560> them<00:02:47.710> out

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
also use your finger and help them out

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.830 
also use your finger and help them out
but<00:02:48.340> there's<00:02:48.490> not<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:48.790> many<00:02:48.910> seeds<00:02:49.420> in<00:02:49.660> these

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
but there's not that many seeds in these

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.690 
but there's not that many seeds in these
cucumbers<00:02:50.230> for<00:02:50.770> some<00:02:50.950> reason<00:02:51.250> I've<00:02:51.340> noticed

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
cucumbers for some reason I've noticed

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.700 
cucumbers for some reason I've noticed
the<00:02:52.450> market<00:02:52.840> Mars<00:02:52.990> don't<00:02:53.230> have<00:02:53.410> all<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.530> many

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
the market Mars don't have all that many

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.430 
the market Mars don't have all that many
seeds<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.220> as<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.490> can<00:02:54.700> see<00:02:54.970> it's<00:02:55.140> hollow<00:02:56.140> on

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
seeds and as you can see it's hollow on

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.980 
seeds and as you can see it's hollow on
the<00:02:56.470> inside<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.880> that's<00:02:58.090> what<00:02:58.810> you're

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
the inside and that's what you're

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
the inside and that's what you're
looking<00:02:59.230> for<00:02:59.380> that's<00:02:59.500> what<00:02:59.710> gives<00:02:59.860> it<00:02:59.980> that

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
looking for that's what gives it that

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.550 
looking for that's what gives it that
that<00:03:00.430> fun<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:00.940> like<00:03:01.360> hollow<00:03:01.630> kind<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:02.350> thud

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
that fun that like hollow kind of thud

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.460 
that fun that like hollow kind of thud
thud<00:03:03.520> to<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.820> um<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:04.900> kind<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.320> just

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
thud to it um and so you kind of just

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.460 
thud to it um and so you kind of just
work<00:03:05.800> it<00:03:05.980> twist<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.150> work<00:03:07.360> it<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:07.630> these

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
work it twist it and work it and these

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.350 
work it twist it and work it and these
cedar<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:08.950> kind<00:03:09.160> of<00:03:09.190> just<00:03:09.370> fall<00:03:09.580> out<00:03:09.790> there

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
cedar and I kind of just fall out there

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.640 
cedar and I kind of just fall out there
we<00:03:10.570> go<00:03:10.630> see<00:03:10.750> that's<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:10.990> good<00:03:11.080> example<00:03:11.200> right

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
we go see that's a good example right

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.170 
we go see that's a good example right
there<00:03:11.680> just<00:03:12.250> kind<00:03:12.490> of<00:03:12.520> twist<00:03:12.670> it<00:03:12.850> and<00:03:13.030> these

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
there just kind of twist it and these

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.330 
there just kind of twist it and these
seeds<00:03:13.570> just<00:03:13.660> kind<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:13.930> plop<00:03:14.740> right<00:03:15.010> out

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
seeds just kind of plop right out

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.610 
seeds just kind of plop right out
because<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.360> is<00:03:16.390> hollow<00:03:16.720> so<00:03:16.900> once<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.320> break

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
because it is hollow so once you break

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.740 
because it is hollow so once you break
once<00:03:18.550> you<00:03:18.640> break<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:18.940> membrane<00:03:19.300> that's

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
once you break the membrane that's

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.750 
once you break the membrane that's
holding<00:03:20.020> them<00:03:20.110> in<00:03:20.260> there<00:03:20.470> they<00:03:21.310> kind<00:03:21.520> of<00:03:21.550> just

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
holding them in there they kind of just

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.720 
holding them in there they kind of just
drop<00:03:22.000> right<00:03:22.030> out<00:03:22.240> so<00:03:22.570> now<00:03:22.690> you<00:03:22.750> got<00:03:22.959> two<00:03:23.730> hallow

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.540 
they've been sitting out for a good week
or<00:05:46.840> so<00:05:46.990> even<00:05:47.260> tomato<00:05:47.680> seeds<00:05:48.040> and<00:05:48.250> those<00:05:48.310> dry

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
out pretty quickly so that's just a

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.540 
out pretty quickly so that's just a
standard<00:05:50.230> rule<00:05:50.620> let<00:05:51.010> them<00:05:51.100> set<00:05:51.250> out<00:05:51.280> for<00:05:51.460> about

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
a week and that way you won't have a

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.360 
a week and that way you won't have a
problem<00:05:52.990> make<00:05:53.770> sure<00:05:53.800> they're<00:05:54.070> in<00:05:54.100> a<00:05:54.220> well

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
ventilated area keep might have some I

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.340 
ventilated area keep might have some I
keep<00:05:57.040> them<00:05:57.130> out<00:05:57.190> of<00:05:57.540> really<00:05:58.540> hot<00:05:58.720> areas<00:05:59.080> and

keep them out of really hot areas and

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.860 
keep them out of really hot areas and
just<00:06:00.160> kind<00:06:00.280> of<00:06:00.310> make<00:06:00.430> sure<00:06:00.460> they're<00:06:00.870> room

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
just kind of make sure they're room

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.750 
just kind of make sure they're room
temperature<00:06:01.950> cold<00:06:02.950> you<00:06:03.130> don't<00:06:03.280> want<00:06:03.490> them<00:06:03.580> to

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
temperature cold you don't want them to

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.020 
temperature cold you don't want them to
be<00:06:03.850> too<00:06:04.090> hot<00:06:04.830> because<00:06:05.830> that<00:06:06.070> also<00:06:06.220> in<00:06:06.610> that

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
be too hot because that also in that

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.450 
be too hot because that also in that
also<00:06:07.360> allows<00:06:07.780> mold<00:06:08.110> to<00:06:08.260> grow<00:06:08.470> if<00:06:08.740> there's<00:06:09.250> any

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
also allows mold to grow if there's any

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.670 
also allows mold to grow if there's any
moisture<00:06:10.420> left<00:06:10.450> if<00:06:10.960> it's<00:06:11.140> really<00:06:11.470> warm

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
moisture left if it's really warm

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.340 
moisture left if it's really warm
they're<00:06:12.460> gonna<00:06:12.580> mold<00:06:13.420> very<00:06:13.720> easily<00:06:13.960> so<00:06:14.290> you

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.350 
they're gonna mold very easily so you

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.270 
they're gonna mold very easily so you
want<00:06:14.530> to<00:06:14.590> make<00:06:14.680> sure<00:06:14.710> it's<00:06:14.950> kind<00:06:15.100> of<00:06:15.130> room
