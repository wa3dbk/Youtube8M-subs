 novelties of a manufacturer who is 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.770
 both French and Chinese it is about 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.210
 alcatel to calton one touch so that did not 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.560
 nothing to do with alcatel lucent since 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.270
 this entity the mobile phone 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.100
 Alcatel was bought back a few 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.529
 years by the Chinese tcl but despite 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.090
 40% of engineers and 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.310
 executives of this French sound box 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.929
 is what makes you still have a 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.790
 presence in France important enough that he 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.040
 must know that alcatel is the fifth 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.149
 mobile builder in France on 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.149
 discover their novelties right away 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.539
 and so it's on the occasion of a lunch 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.219
 rather greedy looked it was not bad 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.600
 that alcatel showed us his 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.510
 novelties so we make you discover 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.309
 Preview on 01net tv with 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.480
 three ranges three distinct ranges the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.879
 first is the pop range 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.500
 so this is a range that does not want to 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.420
 very expensive we will find smartphones 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.120
 from 79 euros is enough 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.650
 impressive at the fare level we have to 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.760
 just about every range of screens 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.180
 up to 1 6 inches 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.680
 look at it with specificities that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.189
 do not have to blush with respect to the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.110
 competition 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.240
 the particularity of this phone is 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.310
 its price so you can find this 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.470
 phone if they grow to 189 euros this 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.820
 who is still a sacred a sacred 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.560
 good news if you want to have a 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.640
 phone with a big screen so from 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.420
 the other side of the range still in 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.640
 this pop range 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.080
 this tiny smartphone look at it 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.540
 is funny enough he has a apps screen is 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.860
 barely 2.8 inches so what's that 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.939
 serves are you going to tell me because that's 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.990
 true only to write an email on this 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.500
 kind of smartphones it's not going to be 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.020
 easy 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.850
 well it's primarily a music player that 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.229
 will be able to broadcast the whole 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.180
 music you want but he has some 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.649
 smartphone features since it has 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.770
 a real chip 3g that you will be able 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.030
 put inside then alcatel us 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.290
 says they have healed the sound part 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.930
 from this 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.790
 smartphone since actually the headphones 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.160
 which are delivered are with his da mark 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.960
 jbl and you have 32 gigabytes of memory 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.760
 so you can still store not 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.740
 bad of music and then this post fit 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.230
 because that's his name at the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.180
 particularity of having roosters that are 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.100
 removed at bhl which you can 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.880
 customize this with people made 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.649
 different colors 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.030
 and then he has a little flip this little son 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.580
 will be able to protect him and of course but 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.560
 also thanks to buttons in front of you 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:22.350
 allow to mount the sound to lower it 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.340
 then also to change tracks then in 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.950
 amount in range now with the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.730
 idol range these are phones that 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.730
 are pretty pretty with a finish 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.489
 golden for this one is the good alpha 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.659
 he is 3g he is also 4g he exists in 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.930
 made in both versions 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.610
 and again alcatel tells us 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.500
 that they paid close attention to the 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.840
 making this phone is his 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.340
 design we will not show you all the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.599
 alcatel one touch novelties because 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.970
 that he had a lot there 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.500
 really focuses on products 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.569
 which in our opinion are worth the detour 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.730
 and then after we attack the range heroes 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.370
 so here we go back to a phone from 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.720
 big size since this phone makes 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.860
 6 inches is not really a 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.450
 novelty since it had been announced 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.819
 by alcatel one touch 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.079
 on the occasion of the cs but it is 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.019
 interesting because beyond the fact 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.970
 that he has a full hd screen and that he is 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.609
 rather fine it comes with a whole 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.650
 battery of accessories like for example 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.910
 a bracelet but also a mini phone 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.930
 because it's true that like this 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.590
 phone is rather big with his 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.510
 6 inch screen 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.700
 this mini phone will allow you to 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.680
 make phone calls and get by 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.989
 take out the flagship 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.970
 we will say and then the booklets too 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.739
 with a small electronic light that 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.660
 will be connected to this phone and who will 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.370
 so you can view 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.859
 information without having to go out 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.470
 from your pocket or bag 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.340
 this big phone and then again like 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.130
 for the pop range 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.139
 this smartphone can have a flip so 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.239
 this kind of little cock that can get 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.709
 add that is rather ingenious and 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.940
 which will allow you to display 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.290
 additional information even 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.000
 when the phone is protected in 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.310
 done since we see there are small 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.040
 connectors that will fuel actually 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.540
 this flip and posters and so of 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.680
 information then it can be by 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.500
 example because you have received an email 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.359
 an SMS or just theirs then the 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.430
 also characteristic of alcatel one touch 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.620
 it is to want to put forward the side 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.609
 top but from their phone it's not 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.889
 because it's a Chinese builder 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.609
 now that actually these phones 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.739
 do not have soul 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.380
 they are genuinely built from a to 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.609
 z by alcatel our quality is always 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.190
 French 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.289
 we have regional teams for example 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.210
 the europe team which is based in the region 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.039
 Parisian who is very important who 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.479
 is not just about selling and 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.920
 marketing but who also makes the 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.630
 r &amp; d the validation of the work of 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.130
 all the technical work of 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.860
 technical marketing with operators 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.510
 all this is french we have teams 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.310
 dedicated internally absolutely for all 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.240
 so we usually start with really 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.770
 a concept 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.750
 what we would like to bring inside 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.250
 of a precise range on a new 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.290
 product but the design teams 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.610
 industrialist who work at what's going 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.590
 look like the product what are the 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.570
 trends we draw the product really 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.580
 we work with our R &amp; D teams 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.600
 to choose the components the 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.040
 best components in terms of 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.950
 quality what will work best in 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.830
 this value proposition we develop 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.720
 the product we test the factory we 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.730
 same was the one our own factory 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.080
 valid it is tested in different 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.140
 regions ourselves with our own 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.610
 so design team up to the 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.080
 marketing everything is done by us 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.090
 yes, this is what's new 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.710
 so alcatel one touch we make you 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.720
 discover in preview on 0 net tv 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.400
 which will be presented 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.340
 so at the mobile world congress then 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.010
 Is it going to be enough to Alcatel 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.180
 win against the Chinese giant who will 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.690
 happen that they will announce their 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.660
 novelties such as the aid 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.400
 but also the geese or the week at the milk 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.530
 casam also that they go themselves 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.060
 offer pretty pretty phones to 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.070
 unbeatable prices with 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.380
 the big challenge of alcatel one touch so 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.120
 with all this novelty the mobile 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.060
