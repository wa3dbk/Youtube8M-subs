00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.440 
class gold and basically I wanted to get
my<00:01:16.170> assault<00:01:16.890> rifles<00:01:17.250> go<00:01:17.430> because<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.210> just

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
my assault rifles go because I just

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.910 
my assault rifles go because I just
needed<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.080> challenge<00:01:19.530> where<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.740> do

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
needed to do that challenge where you do

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.940 
needed to do that challenge where you do
like<00:01:20.689> 150<00:01:21.689> kills<00:01:21.900> or<00:01:22.049> something<00:01:22.380> no<00:01:22.500> personal

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
like 150 kills or something no personal

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.179

swamp<00:01:23.310> pike<00:01:23.909> no<00:01:24.390> perks<00:01:24.600> no<00:01:24.810> attachments<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.830> I

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
swamp pike no perks no attachments so I

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.670 
swamp pike no perks no attachments so I
went<00:01:27.119> ahead<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.450> put<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.110> class<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.530> on

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
went ahead and put this class it up on

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.730 
went ahead and put this class it up on
so<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.700> know<00:01:30.479> Kyle<00:01:30.900> ghost<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.229> coming<00:01:31.470> out<00:01:31.560> soon

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
so I know Kyle ghost is coming out soon

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.580 
so I know Kyle ghost is coming out soon
I<00:01:31.890> really<00:01:32.159> know<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.909> still<00:01:33.590> hopefully

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
I really know that but I still hopefully

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.770 
I really know that but I still hopefully
can<00:01:34.799> get<00:01:34.950> all<00:01:35.220> my<00:01:35.520> assault<00:01:35.790> rifles<00:01:36.180> diamond<00:01:36.600> or

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
can get all my assault rifles diamond or

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.319 
can get all my assault rifles diamond or
stuff<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.259> before<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.400> comes<00:01:38.700> out<00:01:38.909> and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
stuff like that before it comes out and

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.450 
stuff like that before it comes out and
that<00:01:40.259> most<00:01:40.500> likely<00:01:40.920> isn't<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.369> happen

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
that most likely isn't going to happen

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.280 
that most likely isn't going to happen
but<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.090> hope<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.689> still<00:01:42.869> want<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.110> get<00:01:43.170> it

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
but I hope like I still want to get it

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.780 
but I hope like I still want to get it
just<00:01:43.439> because<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:43.890> golden<00:01:44.340> everything

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
just because it's like golden everything

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.850 
just because it's like golden everything
but<00:01:45.479> um<00:01:46.100> yes<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.700> actually<00:01:48.479> did<00:01:48.960> similar

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
but um yes so I actually did similar

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.920 
but um yes so I actually did similar
challenges<00:01:50.369> like<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.970> almost<00:01:51.630> actually

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
challenges like this I almost actually

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.840 
challenges like this I almost actually
rage<00:01:52.470> quit<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:52.979> game<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.189> almost<00:01:53.460> quit<00:01:53.640> this

rage quit this game I almost quit this
game<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:55.259> would<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.590> gotten<00:01:55.770> this

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
game and I would have gotten this

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.889 
game and I would have gotten this
gameplay<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.340> luckily<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.729> stayed<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.659> ended

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
gameplay but luckily I stayed and ended

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.209 
gameplay but luckily I stayed and ended
up<00:01:57.930> getting<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.890> was<00:01:58.979> actually

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
up getting this and it was actually

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.760 
up getting this and it was actually
really<00:01:59.369> unexpected<00:01:59.939> um<00:02:00.390> students<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.530> bad<00:02:01.740> i

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
really unexpected um students so bad i

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.899

think<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> second<00:02:02.670> rule<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.880> i

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
think it's like the second rule that i

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.880 
think it's like the second rule that i
started<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.899> i<00:02:03.930> was<00:02:04.229> really<00:02:04.320> lucky<00:02:04.560> there
