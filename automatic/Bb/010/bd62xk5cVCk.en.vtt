00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
it's supposed to be is not really

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.850 
it's supposed to be is not really
nothing<00:00:50.399> at<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.610> moment<00:00:51.289> but<00:00:52.289> then<00:00:52.530> they

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
nothing at the moment but then they

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.830 
nothing at the moment but then they
can't<00:00:53.129> sail<00:00:53.430> off<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:53.850> guy<00:00:54.149> sensei<00:00:54.629> keeps

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840

on a mission together I thought that was
pretty<00:01:17.880> fun<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.570> basically<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.049> mission<00:01:19.200> is

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
pretty fun and basically the mission is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.450 
that they're trying to collect them a
bunch<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.509> herbal<00:01:22.320> plants<00:01:22.680> because<00:01:23.009> they

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
bunch of herbal plants because they

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.219
