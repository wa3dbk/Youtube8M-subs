00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.750 

so<00:00:01.079> there's<00:00:01.260> the<00:00:01.500> back<00:00:01.829> of<00:00:02.040> the<00:00:02.129> differential

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
so there's the back of the differential

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.120 
so there's the back of the differential
where<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.060> drive<00:00:03.270> shaft<00:00:03.570> comes<00:00:03.840> in<00:00:04.080> I've<00:00:04.890> got

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
where the drive shaft comes in I've got

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.570 
where the drive shaft comes in I've got
the<00:00:05.370> shift<00:00:05.819> actuator<00:00:06.629> out<00:00:07.200> it's<00:00:08.099> just<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.370> set

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
the shift actuator out it's just a set

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.940 
the shift actuator out it's just a set
of<00:00:08.610> Forks<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.269> it<00:00:09.389> corresponds<00:00:09.960> with<00:00:10.769> this

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
of Forks and it corresponds with this

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.190 
of Forks and it corresponds with this
ring<00:00:11.219> right<00:00:11.460> here<00:00:11.759> now<00:00:12.630> when<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.900> look<00:00:13.049> at

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
ring right here now when you look at

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.930 
ring right here now when you look at
this<00:00:13.410> I've<00:00:13.620> got<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.920> disconnected<00:00:14.549> right<00:00:14.610> now

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
this I've got it disconnected right now

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.750 
this I've got it disconnected right now
and<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.660> can<00:00:15.809> see<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.710> one<00:00:16.890> side<00:00:17.190> turns<00:00:17.520> but

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
and you can see the one side turns but

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.760 
and you can see the one side turns but
the<00:00:17.910> other<00:00:18.060> doesn't<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.750> all<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:19.439> does<00:00:19.740> is

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
the other doesn't and all this does is

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.450 
the other doesn't and all this does is
it<00:00:20.070> just<00:00:20.279> grabs<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.789> ring<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:22.070> I'm<00:00:23.070> turning

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
it just grabs that ring and I'm turning

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.029 
it just grabs that ring and I'm turning
this<00:00:23.550> with<00:00:23.730> my<00:00:23.910> toe<00:00:23.970> by<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.359> way<00:00:24.570> as<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:25.769> turns

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
this with my toe by the way as it turns

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.939 
this with my toe by the way as it turns
it<00:00:26.369> locks<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.880> up<00:00:26.970> together<00:00:27.500> so<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.680> they<00:00:28.830> all

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
it locks it up together so that they all

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.540 
it locks it up together so that they all
move<00:00:29.160> together

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.180 

love<00:00:32.150> that<00:00:32.360> sound<00:00:33.040> what<00:00:34.040> the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
love that sound what the

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.570 
love that sound what the
that's<00:00:37.190> way<00:00:37.490> low<00:00:37.790> I<00:00:38.830> never<00:00:39.830> fly<00:00:40.160> that<00:00:40.370> low

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
that's way low I never fly that low

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.770 
that's way low I never fly that low
that's<00:00:40.790> not<00:00:41.060> an<00:00:41.680> let's<00:00:42.680> have<00:00:42.860> a<00:00:42.920> new<00:00:43.100> guy<00:00:43.780> he's

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
that's not an let's have a new guy he's

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.340 
that's not an let's have a new guy he's
booking<00:00:45.260> -<00:00:45.470> he's<00:00:45.770> trying<00:00:46.070> to<00:00:46.220> get<00:00:46.520> in<00:00:46.700> fast

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
booking - he's trying to get in fast

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.760 
booking - he's trying to get in fast
anyway<00:00:49.059> so<00:00:50.059> yeah<00:00:50.360> and<00:00:50.989> then<00:00:51.200> I<00:00:51.230> just<00:00:51.470> shove<00:00:51.739> it

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
anyway so yeah and then I just shove it

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.530 
anyway so yeah and then I just shove it
back<00:00:52.010> over<00:00:52.280> and<00:00:52.430> you're<00:00:52.760> in<00:00:52.910> two-wheel<00:00:53.239> drive

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
back over and you're in two-wheel drive

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.240 
back over and you're in two-wheel drive
the<00:00:54.110> reason<00:00:54.440> why<00:00:54.530> they<00:00:54.739> go<00:00:54.950> through<00:00:55.160> the

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
the reason why they go through the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.130 
the reason why they go through the
trouble<00:00:55.430> to<00:00:55.640> make<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.910> axle<00:00:56.360> come<00:00:56.540> out<00:00:56.780> of

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
trouble to make the axle come out of

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.260 
trouble to make the axle come out of
four-wheel<00:00:58.070> drive<00:00:58.309> or<00:00:58.489> not<00:00:58.610> is<00:00:58.850> there's<00:00:59.059> less

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
four-wheel drive or not is there's less

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.650 
four-wheel drive or not is there's less
inertia<00:00:59.629> and<00:01:00.020> metal<00:01:00.290> moving<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:02.120> transfer

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
inertia and metal moving the transfer

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.460 
inertia and metal moving the transfer
case<00:01:02.950> causes<00:01:03.950> for<00:01:04.160> this<00:01:04.400> to<00:01:05.030> disengage<00:01:05.750> but

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
case causes for this to disengage but

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.590 
case causes for this to disengage but
even<00:01:06.800> when<00:01:06.950> it<00:01:07.130> disengages<00:01:07.940> if<00:01:08.119> you<00:01:08.240> have<00:01:08.420> all

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
even when it disengages if you have all

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.940 
even when it disengages if you have all
of<00:01:08.750> that<00:01:08.780> metal<00:01:09.320> being<00:01:10.450> moved<00:01:11.450> it<00:01:12.320> creates<00:01:12.740> a

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
of that metal being moved it creates a

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.800 
of that metal being moved it creates a
lack<00:01:13.250> of<00:01:13.280> efficiency<00:01:14.090> because<00:01:14.240> everything<00:01:14.690> on

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
lack of efficiency because everything on

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.270 
lack of efficiency because everything on
the<00:01:14.990> three-quarter-ton<00:01:15.500> one<00:01:15.860> ton

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
the three-quarter-ton one ton

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.830 
the three-quarter-ton one ton
it's<00:01:16.670> heavy<00:01:17.000> it<00:01:17.420> weighs<00:01:17.540> a<00:01:17.720> lot<00:01:18.850> so<00:01:19.850> anyway

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
it's heavy it weighs a lot so anyway

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.109 
it's heavy it weighs a lot so anyway
that's<00:01:21.110> how<00:01:21.170> that<00:01:21.259> works<00:01:21.590> now<00:01:21.860> I<00:01:22.580> will<00:01:22.910> say

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
that's how that works now I will say

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.670 
that's how that works now I will say
this<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:23.660> got<00:01:23.810> two<00:01:24.050> lines<00:01:24.410> that<00:01:24.560> are

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
this so you got two lines that are

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.980 
this so you got two lines that are
vacuum<00:01:25.100> lines<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:25.640> on<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.180> Dodge<00:01:26.390> if<00:01:26.810> your

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
vacuum lines and on the Dodge if your

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.499 
vacuum lines and on the Dodge if your
axle<00:01:27.440> isn't<00:01:27.710> walking<00:01:27.890> up<00:01:28.220> but<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.550> transfer

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
axle isn't walking up but the transfer

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.320 
axle isn't walking up but the transfer
case<00:01:29.690> is<00:01:29.770> check<00:01:30.770> these<00:01:31.040> these<00:01:31.850> are<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.149> same

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
case is check these these are the same

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.960 
case is check these these are the same
two<00:01:32.570> vacuum<00:01:32.990> lines<00:01:33.340> there's<00:01:34.340> a<00:01:34.399> vacuum<00:01:34.610> lines

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
two vacuum lines there's a vacuum lines

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.020 
two vacuum lines there's a vacuum lines
that<00:01:35.149> go<00:01:35.300> to<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.660> top<00:01:35.869> of<00:01:36.050> your<00:01:36.170> transfer<00:01:36.709> case

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
that go to the top of your transfer case

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.529 
that go to the top of your transfer case
you<00:01:38.030> see<00:01:38.240> them<00:01:38.360> right<00:01:38.539> there<00:01:38.619> stick<00:01:39.619> it<00:01:39.770> up

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
you see them right there stick it up

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.010 
you see them right there stick it up
right<00:01:41.539> there

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
right there

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.419 
right there
so<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:43.280> vacuum<00:01:43.670> actuate<00:01:44.060> those<00:01:44.270> into<00:01:44.630> place

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
so you vacuum actuate those into place

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.249 
so you vacuum actuate those into place
inside<00:01:46.429> of<00:01:46.490> there<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.090> then<00:01:47.600> it<00:01:47.750> brings<00:01:48.110> them

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
inside of there and then it brings them

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.749 
inside of there and then it brings them
out<00:01:48.380> over<00:01:48.649> here<00:01:48.830> while<00:01:48.979> this<00:01:49.130> red<00:01:49.520> one

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
out over here while this red one

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.150 
out over here while this red one
especially<00:01:50.179> gets<00:01:51.170> diesel<00:01:51.590> fuel<00:01:51.860> and

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
especially gets diesel fuel and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.440 
especially gets diesel fuel and
transmission<00:01:52.759> fluid<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:53.179> everything

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
transmission fluid and everything

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.330 
transmission fluid and everything
dripped<00:01:53.660> on<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:54.020> it's<00:01:54.530> all<00:01:54.709> soft<00:01:54.979> and<00:01:55.130> mushy

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
dripped on it it's all soft and mushy

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.699 
dripped on it it's all soft and mushy
and<00:01:55.819> then<00:01:56.479> once<00:01:56.660> it's<00:01:56.840> soft<00:01:57.080> and<00:01:57.229> mushy

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709 
and then once it's soft and mushy

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.150 
and then once it's soft and mushy
it<00:01:58.130> just<00:01:58.429> gets<00:01:58.670> pulled<00:01:59.060> off<00:01:59.240> so<00:02:00.229> you<00:02:01.039> know

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
it just gets pulled off so you know

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.249
