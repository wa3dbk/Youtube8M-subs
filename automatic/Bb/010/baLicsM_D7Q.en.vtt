00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.420 
next in the bag there are some there's
this<00:02:25.250> mobile<00:02:26.250> app<00:02:26.640> playbook<00:02:27.269> I<00:02:28.220> think<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.280> have

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
this mobile app playbook I think I have

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.650 
this mobile app playbook I think I have
an<00:02:29.549> idea<00:02:29.819> what<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.209> is<00:02:30.450> I'm<00:02:30.750> not<00:02:30.930> too<00:02:31.110> sure<00:02:33.349> oh

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
an idea what this is I'm not too sure oh

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.250 
an idea what this is I'm not too sure oh
yeah<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:38.250> can<00:02:38.370> basically<00:02:38.519> look<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:40.049> like

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
yeah so you can basically look and like

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.890 
yeah so you can basically look and like
I<00:02:40.440> guess<00:02:40.590> order<00:02:41.099> things<00:02:41.660> like<00:02:42.660> food<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.470> stuff

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.690 
I guess order things like food and stuff
and<00:02:45.900> all<00:02:46.019> that<00:02:46.049> kind<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.530> stuff<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:49.700> that's

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
and all that kind of stuff so that's

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.640 
and all that kind of stuff so that's
that<00:02:51.360> there's<00:02:52.819> yeah<00:02:53.819> and<00:02:54.090> then<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:55.079> is<00:02:55.380> the
