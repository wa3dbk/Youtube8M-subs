00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
to have it out of the you know that did

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.220 
to have it out of the you know that did
Paul<00:02:51.580> Heyman<00:02:52.030> team<00:02:52.270> and<00:02:52.510> even<00:02:52.750> he<00:02:52.870> wasn't<00:02:53.170> able

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
Paul Heyman team and even he wasn't able

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.440 
Paul Heyman team and even he wasn't able
to<00:02:53.410> do<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.680> so<00:02:53.830> maybe<00:02:53.950> Cena<00:02:54.310> is<00:02:54.580> thinking<00:02:55.360> that

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
to do it so maybe Cena is thinking that

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.090 
to do it so maybe Cena is thinking that
maybe<00:02:55.510> he<00:02:55.810> can't<00:02:56.080> get<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.320> done<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:56.770> I<00:02:56.800> think

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
maybe he can't get it done that I think

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.070 
maybe he can't get it done that I think
scene<00:02:57.280> is<00:02:57.370> gonna<00:02:57.550> be<00:02:57.610> able<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.820> do<00:02:57.910> it<00:02:57.940> I'm<00:02:58.900> not

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
scene is gonna be able to do it I'm not

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.440 
scene is gonna be able to do it I'm not
that<00:02:59.260> big<00:02:59.470> big<00:02:59.890> anon<00:03:00.580> you<00:03:00.910> know<00:03:01.000> John<00:03:01.270> seemed

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
that big big anon you know John seemed

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.470 
that big big anon you know John seemed
to<00:03:01.540> become<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.870> United<00:03:02.380> States<00:03:02.910> Champion<00:03:03.910> but

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
to become the United States Champion but

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.600 
to become the United States Champion but
I<00:03:04.510> do<00:03:04.660> think<00:03:05.050> this<00:03:05.380> is<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.740> John<00:03:05.950> Cena<00:03:06.190> victory

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
I do think this is the John Cena victory

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.699 
I do think this is the John Cena victory
party<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.090> after<00:03:07.450> fast<00:03:07.720> lane<00:03:07.990> we<00:03:08.590> will

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
party and after fast lane we will

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.030 
party and after fast lane we will
finally<00:03:09.070> be<00:03:09.220> able<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.459> say<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.180> the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
finally be able to say that the the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.040 
finally be able to say that the the
victory<00:03:12.040> streak<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:13.269> know<00:03:13.300> has<00:03:13.570> been<00:03:13.810> broken

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
victory streak you know has been broken
