00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.520
 game is not loading at this moment 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:34.130
 because I just turned the power on 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.320
 I was in stand by 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.189

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.640
 power cut 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:48.350
 there will need to be a 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.210

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.780
 settings 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.340
 here is just how the deputy had this 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.220

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:33.190
 let's not go here or other 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:36.700
 nintendo ds profile profile settings 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:43.720
 it will restart loading the files 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:45.700
 required to run the game back up and 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:51.330
 if what you carry is on the SD card 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:54.690
 but not in the ghetto and ethanol itself 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:59.970
 of s 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:04.840
 there is not only one on the small screen of the game 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:09.459
 will be here in the case is the mario kart I 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:12.010
 can run the game using in 3d that 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:16.269
 are already 13 of a new camera to 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.510
 realize the effect but is not remembering 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.510
 on here 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.230
 also want to change the match in 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.189
 present date 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:34.250
 You can only use one game per SD card. 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:37.219
 so you have to call the computer and 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.629
 do the procedure to pass a new 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.629
 game in the fourth time 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.739
 So here's game running and it's 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.739
