Sosa<00:03:36.180> masks<00:03:36.900> are<00:03:37.560> we<00:03:38.130> going<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.340> be<00:03:38.400> able<00:03:38.430> to

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
Sosa masks are we going to be able to

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.790 
Sosa masks are we going to be able to
customize<00:03:39.120> our<00:03:39.270> armor<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:39.990> armor<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.680> our

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
companions more than an Emmy too so we

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.900 
companions more than an Emmy too so we
really<00:03:44.220> wanted<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.490> broaden<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
really wanted to broaden the

really wanted to broaden the
customization<00:03:45.510> experience<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.050> we

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
customization experience so we

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.560 
customization experience so we
definitely<00:03:46.440> will<00:03:46.890> have<00:03:47.250> more<00:03:47.790> customization

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570
