tell<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> little<00:01:13.409> bit<00:01:13.560> about<00:01:13.920> history<00:01:14.250> of

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
tell you a little bit about history of

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.390 
tell you a little bit about history of
this<00:01:14.760> method<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.780> gets<00:01:16.080> its<00:01:16.290> name<00:01:16.650> from<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
this method it gets its name from the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.990 
this method it gets its name from the
fact<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.259> like<00:01:19.259> Phoenix<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.159> destroys

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
fact that like Phoenix it destroys

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.950 
fact that like Phoenix it destroys
itself<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.930> then<00:01:22.619> comes<00:01:23.009> back<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.640> life<00:01:23.960> it

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
itself and then comes back to life it

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.620 
itself and then comes back to life it
gets<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.439> term<00:01:25.650> layer<00:01:25.950> because<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:27.060> work<00:01:27.360> in

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
gets the term layer because you work in

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.929 
gets the term layer because you work in
layers<00:01:29.210> ok<00:01:30.210> now<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:31.409> begin<00:01:31.610> placing<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
layers ok now to begin placing the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.760 
layers ok now to begin placing the
pieces<00:01:33.420> start<00:01:34.380> off<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.979> edge<00:01:35.520> pieces<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.770> then

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
pieces start off in edge pieces and then

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.960 
pieces start off in edge pieces and then
move<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.490> corners<00:01:38.970> on<00:01:39.689> edge<00:01:39.960> piece<00:01:40.970> and

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
move on to the corners on edge piece and

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.700 
move on to the corners on edge piece and
edge<00:01:42.240> piece<00:01:42.600> will<00:01:42.899> go<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.590> so
