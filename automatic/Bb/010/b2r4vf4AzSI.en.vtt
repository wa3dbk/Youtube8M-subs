so<00:01:39.149> we<00:01:39.360> add<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.930> think<00:01:39.960> about<00:01:40.340> $500<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:42.149> this

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
so we add I think about $500 to this

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.410 
so we add I think about $500 to this
but<00:01:43.750> now<00:01:43.990> we're<00:01:44.770> able<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:45.220> put<00:01:45.460> these

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
but now we're able to put these

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.700 
but now we're able to put these

mentioned to me even more than the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.520 
mentioned to me even more than the
weight<00:02:01.160> issue<00:02:01.430> is<00:02:02.060> how<00:02:02.960> am<00:02:03.050> I<00:02:03.140> supposed<00:02:03.470> to

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
weight issue is how am I supposed to

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.980 
weight issue is how am I supposed to
mount<00:02:03.800> something<00:02:04.340> on<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:04.610> tent<00:02:04.970> how<00:02:05.570> I<00:02:05.600> hang

a<00:02:06.170> wall<00:02:06.350> mount<00:02:06.620> fan<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.610> we<00:02:07.730> came<00:02:07.910> up<00:02:07.970> with<00:02:08.240> this

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
a wall mount fan so we came up with this

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.170 
a wall mount fan so we came up with this
solution<00:02:08.570> here<00:02:09.280> it's<00:02:10.280> strong<00:02:10.610> enough<00:02:10.910> that

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
solution here it's strong enough that

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.240 
solution here it's strong enough that
you<00:02:11.510> can<00:02:11.660> hang<00:02:11.780> your<00:02:11.810> ballast<00:02:12.350> from<00:02:12.770> it<00:02:12.890> if<00:02:13.130> you

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.449 
you can hang your ballast from it if you
want<00:02:13.460> to<00:02:13.550> do<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.930> super<00:02:14.930> easy<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.590> install

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.789 

we<00:02:18.549> just<00:02:18.760> flipped<00:02:19.030> on<00:02:19.239> over<00:02:19.510> here<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:23.650> yet

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
we just flipped on over here but yet

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.410 
we just flipped on over here but yet
it's<00:02:23.980> really<00:02:24.159> strong<00:02:24.640> because<00:02:24.939> it<00:02:25.209> goes<00:02:25.390> from

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
it's really strong because it goes from

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.229 
it's really strong because it goes from
top<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.840> bottom

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239
