00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.049
 destroying nature means self-destruction 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.400
 the earth's ecosystem is intrinsically perfect based on a 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.280
 fundamental concept that is created in that of nothing but destroyed 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:20.340
 it transforms 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.210
 that is, a circular system that allows it to be eternal in balance 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.759
 the man on the contrary has passed his economy on the linear system that starts 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.739
 from the production of goods and ends to the landfill incinerator a system 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.770
 bankruptcy in the beginning that led us to consume xd in just 30 years 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.310
 reversibly one third of the planet's resources 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.720
 but one thing still pleases chante and that the life of 99% of the things produced ends 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.780
 in the trash after just 6 months their sale we exploit resources we consume e 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.050
 we produce waste at an unsustainable Berber rate than often 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.350
 we don't even need them 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.710
 the wicked exploitation of resources has caused a massive deforestation e 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.619
 desertification of the earth by bringing the extension of an impressive number of 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:12.780
 animal species 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.190
 in addition to air and water pollution, impoverishment 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.049
 genetic product of extinction is one of the most tragic aspects in the 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.150
 dangerous life itself the diversity this essence the planet is destined for 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.680
 to a slow agony 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.829
 the reckless way in which waste is treated 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.500
 for example through the incineration a little the discharge of water 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.280
 brought among other things 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.920
 adua heap of pollutants in the food chain 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.700
 and therefore in our organisms to such a level also the maternal milk is 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.390
 become a food with the highest concentration of polluting things there 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.640
 this makes us understand that everything we are shamelessly inflicting on the 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.229
 land 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.890
 we are inflicting it in an equally direct but more bald way to us 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.320
 themselves 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.320
 yes first 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:16.209
 we must realize that the availability of energy is anything but 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.119
 that shatters on this planet 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:22.199
 the only reason that leads us to think the opposite is that monetary system 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:26.260
 capitalist and its strategies creates scarcity names 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.860
 as the last thing that the energy industry wants abundance because 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.510
 in the monetary system this translates into a loss of profits 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:39.289
 still one of the most important sources of energy to recognize energy 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:40.439
 geothermal 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.810
 a report from the massachusetts institute of technology 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.930
 in 2006 under geothermal energy he discovered that in the earth they are 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.390
 currently available 13,000 z of energy with the possibility of 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.450
 make it easily available 2000 called jaw using technologies 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.779
 gets better 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:02.799
 the total energy consumption of all the nations on the planet is about half z 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.069
 hello alarm 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.519
 which means that only from this source 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.999
 it could have been about 4,000 years of energy 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:10.939
 for the planet 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:14.349
 and if we think that the earth constantly renews its heat this energy 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.329
 it is really inviting it could be used forever this empty 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.650
 extraordinary inexhaustible source of renewable energy 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.959
 there are many others that are undervalued I have completely ignored 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.989
 due to insufficient information such as wind energy and solar energy 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.269
 the energy obtained from the sea and waves 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.689
 think for example of the internal combustion engine used on all our cars 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.930
 despite the small improvements made over the years remains 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.419
 however an invention of more than 100 years ago 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:49.259
 which wastes more than 70 80 percent of its potential in heat instead of in 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:54.039
 movement at the end of the day we are driving stoves that waste big 

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:55.969
 part of the fuel needed 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:59.119
 pollution produce greenhouse gases diseases 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:00.439
 for what 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.409
 in reality there would be no more reason to burn fuels 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:08.259
 fossils if not that of personal interests linked to the profit of roofs e 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.259
 in the prospects of new energies in the drawer 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.800
 the freedom of plurality of information and not just one of the 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.819
 cornerstones of a healthy society 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:31.149
 properly informed people have the opportunity to produce a thought 

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:35.500
 just bieber of mind nowadays you have the feeling that the trend is 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:39.719
 exactly the opposite information held in the hands of a few grownups 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:43.369
 groups that simply don't want bon can guarantee information 

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:44.659
 free 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:49.360
 an example for all of television whose schedule clearly shows that 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.589
 the useful informative didactic tool is more bad because it was one 

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:54.360
 time 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.279
 today we watch television programs 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:01.809
 many to divert people's attention from the really important things to 

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:05.370
 to stimulate the division the quarrel the gossip 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.550
 channel dialogue and opinions predetermined assumptions made 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.930
 of little relevance 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.210
 all this to obtain a strong homologation of thought in order to 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.490
 foster a particular person an idea a political project 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.719
 the information is given by the newspapers is not so different but the power of the 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:30.520
 television tool and such that the feathers are the mirror of reality but it is the 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.009
 reality itself but being built in its image and likeness 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:38.809
 since the people who do not follow it hang cut off 

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:42.819
 conversations sometimes even de vise while all others that 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:47.349
 follow are unconsciously induced to imitation to the point that they speak like 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:47.969
 TV 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:53.789
 they invest like TV their children grow up like the TV says they think like TV 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:08.320
 in nature there is nothing static 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.870
 its strength also lies in the continuous self-improvement achieved by many 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.570
 small changes over time man and society are not exempt from 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.890
 this concept therefore the change should never be opposed rather 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.850
 a company should design its own path towards a better future 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.120
 following the lines of dialogue in comparison and change based on 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.490
 needs and resources of the same priority that are obviously in continuous 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.369
 evolution 

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:39.380
 each institution at the time of its creation 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.210
 assumes its own identity 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.360
 a life of its own 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.099
 it will extend high to preserve itself and remain constant 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:50.630
 so it seems clear that any attempt to institutionalize aspects of the 

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:51.560
 our living 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.180
 it is a big brake on our improvement 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.939
 freedom of expression especially when it becomes critical 

00:06:57.939 --> 00:06:59.260
 to an institution 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.670
 is strongly hindered by cement molds art. to be compared to 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.710
 blasphemy or nail terrorism even refuses to be confronted 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.840
 and thanks to the internet there can be a dialogue of more free information 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.789
 precisely because this pro loco virtual and therefore - controllable freedom that 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:18.200
 we acquire you will come 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.440
 there are institutional constraints, even psychological ones, and allows us to 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.540
 deal 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.930
 more openly echoes - france 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.470
 but it is absurd and trieste 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.290
 that this is not possible everywhere 

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:33.910
 and unfortunately in everyday life this is exactly what happens when not 

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.920
 more people are directly confronted but they are institutions and 

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.550
 talk to each other for us by cutting out every criticism then itself
