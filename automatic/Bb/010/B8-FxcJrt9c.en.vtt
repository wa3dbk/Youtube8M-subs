are ready to go additionally with the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.870 
are ready to go additionally with the
faucet<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> new<00:01:19.020> docking<00:01:19.650> system<00:01:20.070> for

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
faucet we have a new docking system for

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.850 
faucet we have a new docking system for
the<00:01:21.000> spray<00:01:21.270> head<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.259> spray<00:01:22.470> head<00:01:22.619> does

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the spray head so the spray head does

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.679 
the spray head so the spray head does
pull<00:01:23.070> out<00:01:23.220> nicely<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:24.200> you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.409> see<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:26.689> it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
pull out nicely and you can see that it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.990 
pull out nicely and you can see that it
does<00:01:27.960> actuate<00:01:28.680> between<00:01:29.520> two<00:01:29.700> different

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
does actuate between two different

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.990 
does actuate between two different
sprays<00:01:30.500> but<00:01:31.500> additionally

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
sprays but additionally

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.500 
sprays but additionally
there<00:01:33.660> is<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:34.260> docking<00:01:34.860> system<00:01:35.360> that<00:01:36.360> will

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
there is a docking system that will

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.230 
there is a docking system that will
magnetically<00:01:36.810> dock<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.920> faucet<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:39.060> that

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
magnetically dock the faucet so that

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.970 
magnetically dock the faucet so that
head<00:01:39.390> snaps<00:01:39.690> right<00:01:39.870> into<00:01:40.050> place<00:01:40.110> okay<00:01:40.830> so<00:01:40.890> I

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
head snaps right into place okay so I

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.310 
head snaps right into place okay so I
guess<00:01:41.190> the<00:01:41.310> idea<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.570> most<00:01:43.050> pull

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
guess the idea here is that in most pull

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.520 
guess the idea here is that in most pull
downs<00:01:43.560> over<00:01:44.340> time<00:01:44.610> from<00:01:44.940> repeated<00:01:45.450> use<00:01:45.720> this

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
downs over time from repeated use this

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.170 
downs over time from repeated use this
gets<00:01:46.800> a<00:01:46.920> little<00:01:47.070> loose<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.550> it<00:01:47.700> kind<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.940> hangs

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
gets a little loose and it kind of hangs

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.109 
gets a little loose and it kind of hangs
down<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> little<00:01:48.750> bit<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:49.950> magnet<00:01:50.460> keeps

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
down a little bit but the magnet keeps

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.270 
down a little bit but the magnet keeps
it<00:01:51.240> nice<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.450> tight<00:01:51.840> for<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.260> long<00:01:52.440> haul<00:01:52.650> yeah

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280
