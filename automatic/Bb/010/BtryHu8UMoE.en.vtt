00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
always get a hound spawning for us and I

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.909 
always get a hound spawning for us and I
think<00:03:07.629> if<00:03:07.870> we<00:03:07.959> drop<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:08.319> on<00:03:08.469> the<00:03:08.560> ground<00:03:08.799> that

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:08.919 
think if we drop that on the ground that

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.039 
think if we drop that on the ground that
will<00:03:09.040> spawn<00:03:09.370> near<00:03:09.609> the<00:03:09.760> ground<00:03:09.939> so<00:03:10.569> let's<00:03:10.750> just

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
will spawn near the ground so let's just

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.809 
will spawn near the ground so let's just
get<00:03:11.230> over<00:03:11.530> tonight<00:03:11.799> time<00:03:12.069> and<00:03:12.310> let's<00:03:12.430> see<00:03:12.669> her
