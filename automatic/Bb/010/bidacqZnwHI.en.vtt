00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
 we continue the theme of the launch 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.410
 engine in cold conditions means 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:14.299
 the engine of our car is already 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.970
 warmed up a manual transmission 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.010
 here is not so dangerous already starting 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.279
 motion 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.769
 somewhere around 50 degrees means 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.560
 our task 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:31.380
 prepare for reversing we 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:37.940
 we are elegant parking for this 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.940
 we need to squeeze the grip to the floor 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.860
 shift the lever into reverse gear and 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:49.180
 note we are not the handbrake yet 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:53.220
 take off until the moment we start 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:56.890
 movement because if we are with them 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:00.100
 handbrake means we can run over the fence 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.739
 who is ahead and wants 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.400
 tell all novice drivers about 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.790
 tom that 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:12.220
 handbrake shoot before driving 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.610
 car is very important and so 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.460
 We are preparing for reversing and 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.890
 I want to say more about what you remove 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.640
 please lever to neutral 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:28.540
 release the clutch and try to survive 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.340
 and back on in this version 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.940
 from pay attention now not 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:39.039
 turned on means reverse gear 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:42.310
 this is very often the case for cars 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:45.100
 it is necessary and put the lever in 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.819
 neutral position to neutral 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.410
 position 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:52.900
 and then release the clutch pedal and another 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.700
 just click on it 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.080
 you can swing a few times and then 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.780
 translate the lever into reverse gear 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.330
 now it will turn on easily without any 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.290
 problems it very often happens with all 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.490
 by cars 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.600
 it means our task is slowly starting 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.380
 movement adding a certain fuel 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.390
 portion of the fuel as soon as possible 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.460
 clutch and let go a little to 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.370
 there was a car vibration 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.360
 let's release the clutch 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:32.530
 here we are removing the student and now 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.960
 car back more accurately forward to the fence 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.420
 will not refuse 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.990
 all give a little gas not in a hurry squeeze 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.460
 clutch means stopped looked 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.700
 carefully because we are with you 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:51.370
 moving to the courtyard area here go 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.870
 pedestrians and so again we start 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:59.890
 movement all cars produce 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.260
 movement is slow on the grip and therefore 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.380
 the driver must be able to work with the pedals 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.380
 clutch 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.060
 miss 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.840
 convinced of the absence of pedestrians we 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.840
 we start the movement 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.550
 we get 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.150
 we start reversing 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.100
 mean here is very important on small 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.460
 speeds repeat produce movement 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:08.080
 not letting go grip everyone and impatient 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:14.350
 and throw the pedal so always when 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.350
 there is a car training 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:24.270
 and rushes forward but with insufficient 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.440
 depress the gas pedal the engine stalls 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.419
 therefore it is imperative 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.810
 hold the clutch pedal at least 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.810
 several meters at the beginning of the movement 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.810
 the car 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.920
 specifically for auto reel. ru 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:55.460
 it means very often ask what 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:56.690
 The approximate distance should be to 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.680
 cars 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.680
 means 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:09.610
 if we sit behind the wheel and look ahead 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:13.950
 then we must pay attention 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:17.650
 see the gap between the cars 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.780
 ahead also ours between 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.260
 the hood 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:25.180
 about 30 centimeters is enough so 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:30.150
 we start moving turn on right 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.150
 turn signal will turn right 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:38.030
 mean if you noticed 2 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.150
 roadways they are divided 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.650
 an island of safety as soon as 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:47.570
 pedestrians will appear on our driveways 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.440
 it means our task is to stop and 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.440
 skip 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:01.020
 Now we are moving to the site 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:06.679
 and and consider 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:06.679
 some actions 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:11.470
 with a driver who has a certain 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:14.620
 region 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:17.860
 we look at the actions of the elements 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:21.000
 extreme driving mean 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.000
 novice driver 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.159
 clever is experience 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.159
 very fast 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.760
 so you have completed the steps 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:41.090
 wrong 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.090
 we crossed two lanes in a row 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.490
 through the roadway 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.380
 I taught you how 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:54.389
 humble rebuild maneuvers first 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.110
 push attack and why are you breaking 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:57.110
 rules are more expensive 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.450
 specifically for autocad .
