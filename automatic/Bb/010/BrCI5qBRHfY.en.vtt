00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
a real sense of the evidence that's

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.219 
a real sense of the evidence that's

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
people and that would be a statistic

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.039 
people and that would be a statistic
that<00:01:43.680> people<00:01:43.920> could<00:01:44.040> use<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.460> understand<00:01:45.060> what

other people and generally think and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
reduce blood pressure that is one reason

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.160 
reduce blood pressure that is one reason
and<00:02:17.939> that<00:02:18.359> is<00:02:18.420> something<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:18.989> going<00:02:19.079> to

give prove scientific to explain blood
pressure<00:02:28.469> and<00:02:28.769> how<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.010> color<00:02:29.340> blue<00:02:29.639> helps<00:02:30.030> to

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
pressure and how the color blue helps to

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.470 
pressure and how the color blue helps to
reduce<00:02:30.299> blood<00:02:30.629> pressure<00:02:30.750> by<00:02:31.469> being<00:02:31.709> calming

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
reduce blood pressure by being calming

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.660 
reduce blood pressure by being calming
the<00:02:33.480> second<00:02:33.870> argument<00:02:34.799> that<00:02:34.859> I'm<00:02:35.010> making<00:02:35.370> that

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
the second argument that I'm making that

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.490 
the second argument that I'm making that
blue<00:02:35.909> is<00:02:36.060> associated<00:02:36.359> with<00:02:36.659> nature<00:02:37.290> which<00:02:37.469> is

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
blue is associated with nature which is

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.740 
blue is associated with nature which is
helpful<00:02:37.889> in<00:02:38.159> yoga<00:02:38.519> so<00:02:38.670> again<00:02:38.849> a<00:02:38.879> second<00:02:39.480> reason

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
helpful in yoga so again a second reason

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.809 
helpful in yoga so again a second reason
why<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.319> think<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:41.069> blue<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.430> good<00:02:41.639> color

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
why I think that blue is a good color

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.509 
why I think that blue is a good color
for<00:02:41.939> yoga<00:02:42.419> studios<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.019> then<00:02:43.560> three<00:02:43.889> it<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.370> a

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
for yoga studios and then three it is a

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.159 
for yoga studios and then three it is a
light<00:02:44.819> color<00:02:44.849> which<00:02:45.269> helps<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.599> keep<00:02:45.659> a<00:02:45.840> studio

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:46.169 
light color which helps to keep a studio

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:48.409 
light color which helps to keep a studio
cool<00:02:46.560> in<00:02:46.829> warm<00:02:47.129> weather<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:48.000> can<00:02:48.150> see<00:02:48.269> here

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:48.419 
cool in warm weather so you can see here

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.659 
cool in warm weather so you can see here
I<00:02:48.450> have<00:02:48.659> three<00:02:49.019> different<00:02:49.290> arguments<00:02:50.069> each<00:02:50.430> of

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:50.669 
I have three different arguments each of

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.159 
I have three different arguments each of
which<00:02:50.790> are<00:02:50.909> going<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.090> become<00:02:51.359> a<00:02:51.389> paragraph<00:02:51.959> in

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:52.169 
which are going to become a paragraph in

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.800 
which are going to become a paragraph in
my<00:02:52.469> larger<00:02:52.919> paper<00:02:53.129> and<00:02:53.459> so<00:02:53.849> my<00:02:53.969> whole<00:02:54.269> paper<00:02:54.540> is

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
my larger paper and so my whole paper is

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.780 
my larger paper and so my whole paper is
proving<00:02:55.319> that<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.530> color<00:02:55.739> blue<00:02:56.069> is<00:02:56.310> good<00:02:56.549> for

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
proving that the color blue is good for

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.939 
proving that the color blue is good for
yoga<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.209> it's<00:02:57.599> good<00:02:57.840> for<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.169> walls<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.620> yoga

studio because of these particular
reasons<00:03:01.349> and<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:02.159> it's<00:03:02.489> easy<00:03:02.819> for<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.329> to<00:03:03.449> see

colors<00:03:23.790> tend<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.329> be<00:03:24.509> cooler<00:03:25.259> and<00:03:25.379> don't

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
colors tend to be cooler and don't

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.170 
colors tend to be cooler and don't
attract<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.189> heat<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.519> much<00:03:26.669> you<00:03:26.849> can<00:03:27.000> see

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
attract the heat so much you can see

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.509

here<00:03:27.419> I<00:03:27.569> have<00:03:27.900> three<00:03:28.229> very<00:03:28.530> different<00:03:28.889> reasons

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519

for<00:03:43.199> things<00:03:43.500> about<00:03:43.620> blood<00:03:43.829> pressure<00:03:44.099> things

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
for things about blood pressure things

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.610 
for things about blood pressure things
about<00:03:44.879> nature<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.359> things<00:03:45.840> about<00:03:46.079> kind<00:03:46.590> of

weather<00:03:47.310> temperatures<00:03:47.819> I<00:03:47.939> guess<00:03:48.150> so<00:03:48.930> again

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
weather temperatures I guess so again
