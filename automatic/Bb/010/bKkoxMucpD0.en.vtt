going on in the silver market just like
the<00:01:13.440> gold<00:01:13.650> market<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:15.050> he<00:01:16.050> addresses<00:01:16.590> some<00:01:16.800> of

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the gold market so he addresses some of

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.390 
the gold market so he addresses some of
those<00:01:17.010> in<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.340> very<00:01:17.550> objective<00:01:18.210> way<00:01:19.100> it's<00:01:20.100> kind
