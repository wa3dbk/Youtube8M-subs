00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
surprisingly enough most of the roles

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.270 
surprisingly enough most of the roles
that<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.379> Daytona<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.949> stuff<00:00:59.160> like

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
that we do like Daytona and stuff like

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.160 
that we do like Daytona and stuff like
that<00:00:59.340> our<00:00:59.730> car<00:01:00.030> isn't<00:01:00.449> necessarily<00:01:00.930> that

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
that our car isn't necessarily that

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.720 
that our car isn't necessarily that
competitive<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.070> very<00:01:02.280> good<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
competitive but it's very good and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.289 
competitive but it's very good and
strong<00:01:03.000> through<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.949> banking<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
strong through the the banking and the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.120 
strong through the the banking and the
infield<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:06.960> always<00:01:07.560> end<00:01:07.799> up<00:01:07.890> with<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
infield and we always end up with a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.950 
infield and we always end up with a
pretty<00:01:08.340> good<00:01:08.549> car<00:01:08.790> there<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.210> we're<00:01:09.750> quite

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
pretty good car there so we're quite

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.240 
pretty good car there so we're quite
hopeful<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.470> we're<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.159> a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
hopeful that we're going to be a

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.420 
hopeful that we're going to be a
frontrunner<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.810> race<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.369> don't<00:01:14.369> know

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
frontrunner for that race and don't know

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.609 
frontrunner for that race and don't know
if<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.640> quite<00:01:14.970> defend<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.570> win<00:01:16.290> but

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
if we can quite defend that win but

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.039 
if we can quite defend that win but
we're<00:01:16.770> going<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.920> give<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.280> as<00:01:17.430> much<00:01:17.970> effort<00:01:18.780> as

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
we're going to give it as much effort as

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.050 
we're going to give it as much effort as
we<00:01:19.200> possibly<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.799> moving<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.610> race<00:01:20.820> from

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
we possibly can moving the race from

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.240 
we possibly can moving the race from
March<00:01:21.299> through<00:01:21.360> October<00:01:21.740> maybe<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.890> little<00:01:22.979> bit

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
March through October maybe a little bit

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.330 
March through October maybe a little bit
of<00:01:23.340> issue<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:23.880> with<00:01:24.450> weather<00:01:24.920> I<00:01:25.920> think

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
of issue with with weather I think

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.310 
of issue with with weather I think
you've<00:01:26.490> got<00:01:26.670> later<00:01:26.970> storms<00:01:27.509> coming<00:01:27.990> up<00:01:28.110> I

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
you've got later storms coming up I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.950 
you've got later storms coming up I
think<00:01:28.770> go<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.040> know<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.520> could<00:01:29.670> have

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
think go you know we could have

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.030
