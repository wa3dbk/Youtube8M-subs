for a long time I think they're

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.359

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
because the umpires I think a little bit

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.639

confused<00:01:40.300> like<00:01:40.479> we<00:01:40.690> are<00:01:40.869> so<00:01:41.170> it<00:01:41.319> will<00:01:41.470> be<00:01:41.619> a

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
confused like we are so it will be a

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.109
