 we find feed this video so annoying 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.690
 and the reason for that is that video

 just so terrible really wrong ok 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.830

 which is also completely filled with 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.130
 balloons 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.350

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.560
 get a present and there it is 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.030
 here a hair extension but I have too 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.330
 have seen enough advertisements 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.550
 with my club boxes and lip gloss and all 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.530
 the other shit was nowhere at all 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.369
 will be around every old can lie about ten 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.080
 cent with the action and those shoes 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.479
 that site should illuminate with magic 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.660
 wished to see that 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.520

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.530
 what are no laces needed for 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.230
 because there is another fact that is 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.630
 just makes no sense okay we have 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.160
 two other ladies for you 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.950
 the next advertisement that we go to you 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.190
 show is dark that is really such 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.810
 awful irritating advertising 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.860
 okay so we will leave it to you now 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.050

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.510
 and therein you shall again 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.510

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.920
 do you think this asterisk is none 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.890
 evil can now just look what 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.959
 happens when the heating turns on it 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.349
 asterisk may be due to the sudden 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.330
 sand through temperature changes 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.739
 if this happens now we will replace you 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.690
 for her immediately but at Carglass 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.340

 we can fix the previous one without it 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.520
 to replace it 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.140
 we inject our hpx in a hurry and 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.850
 the result is almost within 30 minutes 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.830
 invisible and the weather is up again 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.480

 home yarn then you pay insurance 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.750

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.740

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.920
 card la depends okay this was the advertisement 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.350
 for carglass 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.470
 why he is so annoying is found 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.210
 just the entire advertisement 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.490
 First , it fully integrates us 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.480
 not that that man's name 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.480
 you don't start advertising like that 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.150
 yes if you know that you still pass 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.260
 cell why is that cupboard the one 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.330
 sofa that really doesn't make sense now 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.880
 this really does not interest us at all 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:55.530
 which fixes that window when you get there 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:58.320
 but we know what repairs I must personally 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.200
 assured he always ate everything 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.630
 as a toddler with wanting child 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.010
 indeed ok well now we have our third 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.320

 box is one of those many plus cyclamen 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.900
 that really very annoying is okay that 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.970
 so you're not going to show you anymore 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.040
 this is the last four this is the last 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.209
 advertising that we include in this video 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:24.290
 walk and yes here we go again 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.290

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.050
 if possible it is fresh from the neighborhood 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.650
 plus we always have a lot of benefits 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.139

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.970

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.139

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.340
 plus if you want to bring that 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.380

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.360

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.500
 gesture why did it take 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.660
 all customers get with plus we 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:55.180
 we give that attention 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:56.979

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.110

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.260
 everyone understands this because 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.000
 the beginning of this video is already 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.750
 terribly bad 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.340
 just how that woman was running 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.750
 don't understand why it would run anyway 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.960
 used to be 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:31.260
 but well yes that is not a good start 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:31.260
 for the lady that she met 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.020
 and that plus sign is just terrible 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.390
 irritating 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.100
 yes plus come on then you just do it 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.710

 we just continue with videos 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.780
 It won't always make big claws 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.480
