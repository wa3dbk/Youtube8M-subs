00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
intensity so everything looks pretty

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.070

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
much intensity issues so let's go ahead

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.520 
much intensity issues so let's go ahead
and<00:01:17.009> go<00:01:17.070> back<00:01:17.420> and<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.630> course<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.290> some

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
now this isn't like too much of a part

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.110 
now this isn't like too much of a part
of<00:01:40.540> the<00:01:40.720> original<00:01:41.140> NES<00:01:41.560> version<00:01:42.040> it's<00:01:42.850> more

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
of the original NES version it's more

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.230 
of the original NES version it's more
like<00:01:43.270> a<00:01:43.420> port<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:44.230> some<00:01:44.500> added<00:01:44.860> features<00:01:45.240> it's

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
like a port and some added features it's

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.660 
like a port and some added features it's
I<00:01:46.690> don't<00:01:47.140> know<00:01:47.200> how<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.410> explain<00:01:47.650> it<00:01:47.890> but

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
I don't know how to explain it but

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.960 
I don't know how to explain it but
because<00:01:49.150> of<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:49.540> 3d<00:01:49.990> slider<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:51.460> got<00:01:51.820> the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
because of that 3d slider you got the

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.040 
because of that 3d slider you got the
choice<00:01:52.270> to<00:01:52.630> have<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:54.220> depth<00:01:54.490> or<00:01:54.760> not<00:01:55.150> so<00:01:55.930> let's

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
choice to have the depth or not so let's

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:03.120 
choice to have the depth or not so let's
go<00:01:56.170> ahead<00:01:56.290> and<00:01:56.440> show<00:01:56.860> you<00:01:56.950> guys<00:01:57.010> track<00:01:57.430> 1<00:02:02.130> now

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
go ahead and show you guys track 1 now

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.800 
go ahead and show you guys track 1 now
this<00:02:03.310> game<00:02:03.460> flows<00:02:03.850> pretty<00:02:04.150> nicely<00:02:04.450> the

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
this game flows pretty nicely the

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.660 
this game flows pretty nicely the
framerate<00:02:05.050> is<00:02:05.380> amazing<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:06.070> gotta<00:02:06.310> give<00:02:06.580> them

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
framerate is amazing I gotta give them

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.030 
framerate is amazing I gotta give them
that<00:02:06.940> and<00:02:07.240> I'm<00:02:07.900> actually<00:02:08.140> not<00:02:08.380> looking<00:02:08.920> at

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
that and I'm actually not looking at

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.710 
that and I'm actually not looking at
what<00:02:09.220> I'm<00:02:09.340> playing<00:02:09.580> so<00:02:09.880> I'm<00:02:10.209> probably<00:02:10.390> not

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
what I'm playing so I'm probably not

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.420 
what I'm playing so I'm probably not
doing<00:02:10.899> too<00:02:11.140> good<00:02:11.290> I'm<00:02:11.440> actually<00:02:11.560> staring<00:02:12.070> into

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
doing too good I'm actually staring into
