we're<00:01:08.570> usually<00:01:08.720> up<00:01:08.960> in<00:01:09.110> Colorado<00:01:09.500> all<00:01:10.070> right

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
we're usually up in Colorado all right

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.670 
we're usually up in Colorado all right
now<00:01:10.640> it<00:01:10.970> does<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:11.360> snow<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:12.110> quality<00:01:12.470> of<00:01:12.560> the

vary<00:01:15.140> dramatically<00:01:16.009> from<00:01:16.220> place<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:16.549> place

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
vary dramatically from place to place

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.310 
vary dramatically from place to place
um<00:01:17.390> not<00:01:18.049> here<00:01:18.320> but<00:01:18.860> sometimes<00:01:19.340> it<00:01:19.490> does<00:01:20.320> it

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
um not here but sometimes it does it

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.440 
um not here but sometimes it does it
gets<00:01:21.530> quite<00:01:21.799> soft<00:01:22.100> I<00:01:22.250> guess<00:01:22.430> sometimes<00:01:23.240> over

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
gets quite soft I guess sometimes over

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
gets quite soft I guess sometimes over
in<00:01:23.509> Europe<00:01:23.720> when<00:01:23.840> it's<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:23.990> bit<00:01:24.110> warm<00:01:24.350> because

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
in Europe when it's a bit warm because

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.899 
in Europe when it's a bit warm because
it<00:01:24.649> does<00:01:24.860> get<00:01:24.979> quite<00:01:25.220> warm<00:01:25.340> over<00:01:25.610> there<00:01:25.700> but

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
it does get quite warm over there but

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.790 
it does get quite warm over there but
usually<00:01:26.539> it's<00:01:26.659> pretty<00:01:26.720> good<00:01:26.960> now<00:01:27.470> we<00:01:27.530> think

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
usually it's pretty good now we think

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.380 
usually it's pretty good now we think
we've<00:01:27.890> spotted<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.640> bit<00:01:28.729> of<00:01:28.819> a<00:01:28.909> flaw<00:01:29.119> in<00:01:29.149> your

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
we've spotted a bit of a flaw in your

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.190 
we've spotted a bit of a flaw in your
technique<00:01:31.000> we<00:01:32.000> noticed<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.569> when<00:01:32.780> you<00:01:32.840> come

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
technique we noticed that when you come

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.630 
technique we noticed that when you come
down<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.679> mountain<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:34.100> don't<00:01:34.310> use<00:01:34.490> the

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
down the mountain you don't use the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.580 
down the mountain you don't use the
poles<00:01:34.880> at<00:01:35.179> all<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.720> we<00:01:35.840> think<00:01:36.080> we<00:01:36.200> could<00:01:36.350> take

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
poles at all and we think we could take

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.669 
poles at all and we think we could take
1.5<00:01:37.340> seconds<00:01:37.789> off<00:01:37.940> your<00:01:38.170> times<00:01:39.170> if<00:01:39.409> you<00:01:39.500> just

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
1.5 seconds off your times if you just

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.160 
1.5 seconds off your times if you just
use<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.069> poles<00:01:40.390> well<00:01:41.390> I<00:01:41.659> don't<00:01:41.929> know<00:01:41.990> whether

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
use the poles well I don't know whether

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.719 
use the poles well I don't know whether
we<00:01:42.259> can<00:01:42.289> show<00:01:42.590> it<00:01:42.830> get<00:01:42.950> some<00:01:43.069> footage<00:01:43.369> up<00:01:43.549> of

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
we can show it get some footage up of

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:44.980 
we can show it get some footage up of
you<00:01:43.909> coming<00:01:44.270> down<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.450> mountain<00:01:44.569> we<00:01:44.780> probably

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
you coming down the mountain we probably

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.480 
you coming down the mountain we probably
can<00:01:45.319> but<00:01:45.799> if<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.009> ever<00:01:46.100> thought<00:01:46.310> of<00:01:46.460> doing

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
can but if you ever thought of doing

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.950 
can but if you ever thought of doing
that<00:01:46.819> or<00:01:47.000> is<00:01:47.090> there<00:01:47.240> any<00:01:47.360> opportunity<00:01:47.569> to

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
that or is there any opportunity to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.600 
that or is there any opportunity to
include<00:01:48.229> that<00:01:48.560> well<00:01:49.159> is<00:01:49.280> this<00:01:49.429> in<00:01:49.520> the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
include that well is this in the

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.449 
include that well is this in the
downhill<00:01:50.090> downhill<00:01:51.020> well<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:52.069> don't<00:01:52.250> really

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:52.459 
downhill downhill well you don't really

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:58.590 
downhill downhill well you don't really
know<00:01:52.700> that<00:01:52.729> makes<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:53.149> proud<00:01:53.390> of<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.600> start

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.459 

kilometres<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.719> don't<00:01:59.869> try<00:02:00.049> adding<00:02:00.380> that

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
kilometres you don't try adding that

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:01.779 
kilometres you don't try adding that
extra<00:02:00.619> push<00:02:00.979> because<00:02:01.130> it's<00:02:01.369> not<00:02:01.460> gonna<00:02:01.579> get

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
extra push because it's not gonna get

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:08.800 
extra push because it's not gonna get
you<00:02:01.850> anyway<00:02:06.460> you<00:02:07.460> know<00:02:07.579> you've<00:02:08.390> got<00:02:08.570> a<00:02:08.600> lot<00:02:08.780> of

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
you anyway you know you've got a lot of

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.999 
you anyway you know you've got a lot of
speed<00:02:09.019> going<00:02:09.049> because<00:02:09.410> you<00:02:09.530> coming<00:02:09.799> down<00:02:09.920> the

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
speed going because you coming down the

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.229 
speed going because you coming down the
mountain<00:02:10.130> just<00:02:10.369> imagine<00:02:10.729> how<00:02:10.820> much<00:02:10.940> more<00:02:11.180> if

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
mountain just imagine how much more if

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.970 
mountain just imagine how much more if
you<00:02:11.299> can<00:02:11.420> just<00:02:11.600> get<00:02:11.750> safe<00:02:12.019> one<00:02:12.500> or<00:02:12.650> two<00:02:12.829> in

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
you can just get safe one or two in

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.920 
you can just get safe one or two in
every<00:02:13.130> meter<00:02:13.549> I<00:02:13.970> reckon<00:02:14.510> it'd<00:02:14.660> be<00:02:14.750> terrific

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
every meter I reckon it'd be terrific

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.150 
every meter I reckon it'd be terrific
and<00:02:16.120> look<00:02:17.120> it's<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.930> terrific<00:02:18.230> run<00:02:18.590> yesterday

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
and look it's a terrific run yesterday

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.410 
and look it's a terrific run yesterday
now<00:02:19.370> you've<00:02:19.489> got<00:02:19.609> two<00:02:19.760> other<00:02:19.910> events<00:02:20.030> coming

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
now you've got two other events coming

and anything good I think that's right
Roy<00:02:45.140> yes<00:02:45.590> Jenny<00:02:46.310> can<00:02:46.519> we<00:02:46.609> talk<00:02:46.760> about<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.239> just

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
Roy yes Jenny can we talk about the just

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.670 
Roy yes Jenny can we talk about the just
does<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.170> quality<00:02:48.380> of<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.859> snow<00:02:49.900> vary<00:02:50.900> within

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
does the quality of the snow vary within

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.039 
does the quality of the snow vary within
an<00:02:51.950> event<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:52.850> if<00:02:53.120> you're<00:02:53.239> going<00:02:53.540> early<00:02:53.750> it's

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
an event so if you're going early it's

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.420 
an event so if you're going early it's
an<00:02:54.109> advantage<00:02:54.590> or<00:02:54.709> if<00:02:54.829> you're<00:02:54.950> going<00:02:55.100> late

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
an advantage or if you're going late

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.930 
an advantage or if you're going late
it's<00:02:55.790> an<00:02:55.910> admission

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
it's an admission

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.460 
it's an admission
so<00:02:57.940> which<00:02:58.330> is<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.510> advantage<00:02:59.050> which<00:02:59.230> way<00:02:59.410> does

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
so which is the advantage which way does

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.750 
so which is the advantage which way does
it<00:02:59.590> go<00:03:02.130> usually<00:03:03.130> if<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.250> have<00:03:03.400> an<00:03:03.490> earliest

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
it go usually if you have an earliest

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.220 
it go usually if you have an earliest
start<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.210> works<00:03:04.390> quite<00:03:04.540> well<00:03:04.630> but<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:05.020> also

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
start it works quite well but it also

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.900 
start it works quite well but it also
depends<00:03:05.770> on<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:05.920> weather<00:03:06.100> like<00:03:06.400> here<00:03:06.580> is<00:03:06.700> such

actually the fastest on the top in the
downhill<00:03:37.840> yeah<00:03:38.410> in<00:03:38.710> the<00:03:38.800> actual<00:03:39.100> race<00:03:39.280> itself

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
downhill yeah in the actual race itself

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.250 
downhill yeah in the actual race itself
I<00:03:39.880> was<00:03:40.060> twenty<00:03:40.330> night<00:03:40.480> than<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.810> top<00:03:41.020> just

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
I was twenty night than the top just

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.020 
I was twenty night than the top just
because<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:41.650> got<00:03:41.770> hot<00:03:42.340> just<00:03:42.610> because<00:03:42.880> of<00:03:42.970> the

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
because it got hot just because of the

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.840 
because it got hot just because of the
transload<00:03:43.570> down<00:03:43.870> so<00:03:44.230> it<00:03:44.530> that's<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.370> huge<00:03:45.550> dip

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
transload down so it that's a huge dip

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.400 
transload down so it that's a huge dip
it<00:03:46.030> is<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.150> huge<00:03:46.450> difference<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:46.810> when<00:03:47.110> we<00:03:47.230> saw

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
it is a huge difference so when we saw

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.410 
it is a huge difference so when we saw
or<00:03:47.620> with<00:03:47.830> another<00:03:48.670> event<00:03:48.820> where<00:03:49.150> we<00:03:49.240> saw

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
or with another event where we saw

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.440 
or with another event where we saw
Picabo<00:03:50.410> Street<00:03:50.470> coming<00:03:50.980> at<00:03:51.190> 16<00:03:51.970> or<00:03:52.180> something

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
Picabo Street coming at 16 or something

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.290 
Picabo Street coming at 16 or something
she<00:03:52.870> was<00:03:53.020> going<00:03:53.260> quite<00:03:53.410> late<00:03:53.830> and<00:03:54.490> the<00:03:55.000> person

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300

who<00:03:55.420> went<00:03:55.930> very<00:03:56.110> early<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:57.520> that<00:03:57.550> would<00:03:58.000> have

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
see them cuz we've basically got the

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.600
