00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.880 
and it also says p or not xbox 720 it
kind<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.540> makes<00:01:57.869> me<00:01:58.079> think<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.590> those<00:01:58.860> are

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
kind of makes me think that those are

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.679 
kind of makes me think that those are
going<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.250> be<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.490> actual<00:01:59.700> names<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
going to be the actual names and the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.929 
going to be the actual names and the
game<00:02:00.930> developers<00:02:01.590> know<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.460> reason<00:02:02.820> why<00:02:02.909> i

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
game developers know it the reason why i

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.030 
game developers know it the reason why i
think<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:03.630> because<00:02:03.990> they<00:02:04.439> would<00:02:04.619> for

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
think that it's because they would for

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.819 
think that it's because they would for
xbox<00:02:05.369> 720<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.090> code<00:02:06.299> name<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.659> Durango<00:02:07.229> pretty
