00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
gone past you may have actually seen it

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.289 
gone past you may have actually seen it
I<00:03:42.260> wasn't<00:03:42.680> talking<00:03:42.860> over<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.250> clip<00:03:43.430> but<00:03:43.670> it

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
I wasn't talking over the clip but it

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.090 
I wasn't talking over the clip but it
was<00:03:44.510> crazy<00:03:44.780> he<00:03:45.049> actually<00:03:45.290> out<00:03:45.769> strength

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
was crazy he actually out strength

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.400 
was crazy he actually out strength
felipe<00:03:46.549> santana<00:03:46.910> so<00:03:47.209> his<00:03:47.600> strengths<00:03:48.019> that<00:03:48.080> it

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
felipe santana so his strengths that it

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.020 
felipe santana so his strengths that it
kind<00:03:48.769> of<00:03:48.860> lies<00:03:49.070> but<00:03:49.280> then<00:03:49.400> sometimes<00:03:49.670> is

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
kind of lies but then sometimes is

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.759 
kind of lies but then sometimes is
completely<00:03:50.630> true<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:50.930> it<00:03:51.200> does<00:03:51.350> make<00:03:51.530> sense

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
completely true and it does make sense

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.759 
completely true and it does make sense
so<00:03:52.130> it's<00:03:52.940> very<00:03:53.269> inconsistent<00:03:54.080> and<00:03:54.440> his<00:03:54.560> winged

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
so it's very inconsistent and his winged

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.550 
so it's very inconsistent and his winged
foot<00:03:55.010> is<00:03:55.780> incredibly<00:03:56.780> average<00:03:57.260> it's<00:03:57.470> a

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
foot is incredibly average it's a

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.810 
foot is incredibly average it's a
three-star<00:03:58.040> week<00:03:58.190> for<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:58.459> I<00:03:58.519> can't<00:03:58.730> really

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
three-star week for so I can't really

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.330 
three-star week for so I can't really
expect<00:03:59.090> any<00:03:59.299> more<00:03:59.480> it<00:03:59.690> is<00:04:00.110> very<00:04:00.500> very<00:04:00.650> average

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
expect any more it is very very average

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.970 
expect any more it is very very average
but<00:04:01.549> it<00:04:02.120> is<00:04:02.299> sometimes<00:04:02.870> misses<00:04:03.350> the<00:04:03.500> ball<00:04:03.680> and

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
but it is sometimes misses the ball and

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.620 
but it is sometimes misses the ball and
it's<00:04:04.070> a<00:04:04.160> big<00:04:04.370> shame<00:04:04.610> but<00:04:04.880> leads<00:04:05.090> on<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.420> pros

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
it's a big shame but leads on the pros

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.660 
it's a big shame but leads on the pros
and<00:04:05.660> cons<00:04:05.870> now<00:04:06.170> I'm<00:04:06.350> gonna<00:04:06.530> give<00:04:06.739> him<00:04:06.769> an<00:04:06.950> 8.5<00:04:07.430> I

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
and cons now I'm gonna give him an 8.5 I

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.520 
and cons now I'm gonna give him an 8.5 I
think<00:04:07.790> that's<00:04:07.940> fair<00:04:08.180> very<00:04:08.780> solid<00:04:09.140> player<00:04:09.320> but

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
think that's fair very solid player but

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.100 
think that's fair very solid player but
well<00:04:10.459> it<00:04:10.640> kind<00:04:11.030> of<00:04:11.150> ruined<00:04:11.480> Allah<00:04:11.600> mela<00:04:11.840> and

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
I'm very very gutter that because I was

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.440 
I'm very very gutter that because I was
looking<00:04:14.810> forward<00:04:15.049> to<00:04:15.140> so<00:04:15.680> so<00:04:16.190> much<00:04:16.519> but<00:04:17.390> he

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
looking forward to so so much but he

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.360 
looking forward to so so much but he
just<00:04:17.630> wasn't<00:04:17.900> what<00:04:18.140> I<00:04:18.200> thought<00:04:18.320> he'd<00:04:18.769> be<00:04:18.979> maybe

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
just wasn't what I thought he'd be maybe

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.029 
just wasn't what I thought he'd be maybe
maybe<00:04:20.330> I<00:04:20.510> hyped<00:04:21.019> him<00:04:21.080> up<00:04:21.229> a<00:04:21.410> little<00:04:21.440> bit<00:04:21.890> too

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
maybe I hyped him up a little bit too

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.440 
maybe I hyped him up a little bit too
much<00:04:22.190> but<00:04:22.250> you<00:04:22.550> can<00:04:22.729> see<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.030> pros<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:23.300> the

cons
I<00:04:24.260> just<00:04:24.650> find<00:04:24.890> he<00:04:25.040> isn't<00:04:25.250> as<00:04:25.400> strong<00:04:25.730> as<00:04:25.910> I'd

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
I just find he isn't as strong as I'd

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.520 
I just find he isn't as strong as I'd
like<00:04:26.180> him<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.390> be<00:04:26.510> the<00:04:26.660> normal<00:04:26.900> kind<00:04:27.080> I<00:04:27.260> never
