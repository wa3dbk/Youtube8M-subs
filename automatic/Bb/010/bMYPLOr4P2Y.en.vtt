mine down in Sydney by the name of Adam
he<00:00:16.440> wanted<00:00:17.310> something<00:00:17.460> modern<00:00:17.760> but<00:00:17.850> he<00:00:17.910> still

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
he wanted something modern but he still

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.029 
he wanted something modern but he still
wanted<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.359> bit<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.600> cafe<00:00:18.960> feel<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.590> so

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
wanted a bit of a cafe feel to it so

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.070 
wanted a bit of a cafe feel to it so
this<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.609> what<00:00:20.730> we<00:00:20.820> came<00:00:20.970> up<00:00:21.090> with<00:00:21.240> some<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
this is what we came up with some of the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.700 
this is what we came up with some of the
things<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.850> differentiate<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:24.210> from<00:00:24.710> well

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
things that differentiate this from well

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.009 
things that differentiate this from well
certainly<00:00:25.980> from<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.250> standard<00:00:26.609> cb250<00:00:27.240> probably

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
certainly from a standard cb250 probably

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.779 
certainly from a standard cb250 probably
the<00:00:28.080> most<00:00:28.230> glaringly<00:00:29.010> obvious<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> seat

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the most glaringly obvious is the seat

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.479 
the most glaringly obvious is the seat
that's<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:31.610> that's<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.910> seat<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.809> get<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.489> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
that's a that's a seat that I get in the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.190 
that's a that's a seat that I get in the
front<00:00:35.760> guard<00:00:36.059> there<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.719> see<00:00:36.870> I've<00:00:36.960> cut

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
front guard there you can see I've cut

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.470 
front guard there you can see I've cut
that<00:00:37.320> down<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:38.610> first<00:00:38.940> things<00:00:39.120> we<00:00:39.270> did<00:00:39.360> of

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
that down the first things we did of

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.869

but you can see we've mounted the
battery<00:01:20.220> up<00:01:20.340> there<00:01:20.549> we've<00:01:20.820> got<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:22.640> air

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640

non-standard<00:01:28.590> exhaust<00:01:29.130> these<00:01:29.610> are<00:01:29.820> probably

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
non-standard exhaust these are probably

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.569 
non-standard exhaust these are probably
one<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.600> my<00:01:30.720> favorite<00:01:31.140> cafe<00:01:31.470> racer<00:01:31.680> exhausts<00:01:32.280> I

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
one of my favorite cafe racer exhausts I

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.530 
one of my favorite cafe racer exhausts I
just<00:01:33.390> think<00:01:33.540> they<00:01:33.630> look<00:01:33.810> great<00:01:33.900> we've<00:01:34.680> got<00:01:34.920> a

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
just think they look great we've got a

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.270 
just think they look great we've got a
it's<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.630> 2<00:01:36.780> into<00:01:36.960> 1<00:01:37.110> into<00:01:37.259> 2<00:01:37.470> basically<00:01:37.950> it's

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
it's a 2 into 1 into 2 basically it's

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.120 
it's a 2 into 1 into 2 basically it's
got<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> little<00:01:38.579> balancer<00:01:39.680> across<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.860> bottom

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
got a little balancer across the bottom

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.730 
got a little balancer across the bottom
which<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:41.939> can<00:01:42.150> probably<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.750> see<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.350> there

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
which you can probably just see in there

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.300 
which you can probably just see in there
so<00:01:44.280> should<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.090> nice<00:01:45.299> note<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.070> see

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
so should have a nice note you can see

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.090 
so should have a nice note you can see
we've<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:48.450> haven't<00:01:48.720> mounted<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.170> rear<00:01:49.829> light

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100

we've we haven't mounted the rear light
there<00:01:50.340> yet<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:51.180> that's<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.509> last<00:01:51.659> thing<00:01:51.960> as

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
there yet but that's the last thing as

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.319 
there yet but that's the last thing as
far<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> real<00:01:53.070> light<00:01:53.280> goes<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:54.270> just

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
far as the real light goes it's just

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.990 
far as the real light goes it's just
gonna<00:01:54.540> be<00:01:54.659> one<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.840> those<00:01:54.960> small<00:01:55.200> shotgun<00:01:55.680> type
