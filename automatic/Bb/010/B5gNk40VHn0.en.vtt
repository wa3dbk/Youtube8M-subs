00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.750
 I'm here to tell you today at the time. 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.029
 from college 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.790
 My nickname that you are fatter on is 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.250
 well maybe my grandmother had reason 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.680
 deep down this wound hid something 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.980
 very sad years at this time of 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.290
 college I tried to kill myself twice 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.780
 I use lloyd's, I think whoever tries to 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.020
 kill because it 's cowardly and allegories are 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.320
 brave and has nothing to do with it 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.449
 a function of 90% of people trying to 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.610
 if you kill what you kill they have some 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.800
 really disturb the brain like 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.570
 popularity of pressure and life 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:11.970
 according to the world organization of 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:13.740
 social health binge eating 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.799
 I even broke with the reality some 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.710
 resisted outbreaks chile panic 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:25.640
 I even heard voices and even with all 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.640
 this disease that I had years ago looks 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.710
 if you talk five years ago 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.500
 one day you will not need 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.310
 no treatment I was going to find it all 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.070
 bullshit because because at the time I was 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.939
 misdiagnosed with depression 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.220
 bipolar 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.869
 I was 18 at the time of 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.900
 What did the doctors do to me? 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.030
 said that these diseases 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.400
 only the rest of your life will you 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.170
 have the most effective remedy or treatment 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.990
 important you have to do psychotherapy 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.360
 bla bla bla and you will stay the rest of the 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.190
 life having to pay attention that these 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.509
 diseases are recurrent, ie the 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.790
 turns 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.450
 summarizing condemn me to live in america 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:18.850
 So I decided that I really 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.850
 Nothing has a cure. I'll have to stay in my purse. 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.840
 only that these psychologists and psychologists 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.090
 psychiatrists that I had gone to and they 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.970
 were still stuck there is an old model 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.160
 the agency where you focus on the disease 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.390
 when you focus on the disease you really do not 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.480
 there will only be other specialists 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.160
 that it is still a good thing that the 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.040
 focus on health 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.610
 and when you focus on health healing is 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.260
 possible as it was in my case I'm 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.230
 cured three years ago 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.030
 cured disease is not with controlled 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.730
 I want to show you 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.560
 in this series of thoughts filmed 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.050

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.450

 Modern 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.450
 where focus on health and then you can 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.610
 get rid of this disorder you 're not 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.209
 condemned at the end and does not 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.709

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.540
 comments 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.269

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.310
 support for passing knowledge to 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.590
 forward to that no one else has to 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.440
 condemned to live on the goal is not 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.060
 People have how to get out of this.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:59.050
 pass will get a way in day has 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.780
