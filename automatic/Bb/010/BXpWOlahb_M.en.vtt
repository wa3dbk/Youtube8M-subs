that<00:04:41.220> but<00:04:41.430> what<00:04:41.580> we're<00:04:41.730> doing<00:04:42.000> is<00:04:42.150> kind<00:04:42.390> of<00:04:42.510> a

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
that but what we're doing is kind of a

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.360 
that but what we're doing is kind of a
different<00:04:42.840> are<00:04:43.470> different<00:04:43.530> things<00:04:44.010> so<00:04:44.250> we're

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
different are different things so we're

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.800 
different are different things so we're
trying<00:04:44.520> to<00:04:44.640> get<00:04:44.790> take<00:04:45.390> it<00:04:45.510> to<00:04:45.600> a<00:04:45.630> different

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
trying to get take it to a different

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:59.910 
trying to get take it to a different
area<00:04:46.200> in<00:04:46.770> in<00:04:47.010> a<00:04:47.100> way

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.580 

it's<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:01.300> technique<00:05:01.630> probably<00:05:02.290> because

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
it's the technique probably because

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.050 
it's the technique probably because
that's<00:05:02.710> what's<00:05:02.980> got<00:05:03.160> to<00:05:03.280> hold<00:05:03.640> everything

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
that's what's got to hold everything

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.790 
that's what's got to hold everything
together<00:05:04.360> but<00:05:04.810> there<00:05:05.080> has<00:05:05.230> to<00:05:05.380> be<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:05.680> next

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
together but there has to be the next

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.310 
together but there has to be the next
level<00:05:06.250> of<00:05:07.290> interaction<00:05:08.290> between<00:05:08.590> each<00:05:09.010> other

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
level of interaction between each other

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.570 
level of interaction between each other
you<00:05:11.320> got<00:05:11.440> to<00:05:11.590> get<00:05:11.710> good<00:05:12.130> enough<00:05:12.220> with<00:05:12.490> the

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
you got to get good enough with the

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.700 
you got to get good enough with the
technique<00:05:12.970> where<00:05:13.150> you<00:05:13.270> can<00:05:13.300> actually

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
technique where you can actually

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.350 
technique where you can actually
communicate<00:05:14.710> with<00:05:14.740> each<00:05:15.190> other<00:05:15.400> so<00:05:16.060> you<00:05:16.090> don't

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
communicate with each other so you don't

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.030 
communicate with each other so you don't
really<00:05:16.780> have<00:05:16.900> to<00:05:17.140> think<00:05:17.350> about<00:05:17.440> that<00:05:17.740> too<00:05:17.890> much

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
really have to think about that too much

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.980 
really have to think about that too much
to<00:05:18.190> put<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:18.400> next<00:05:18.640> level<00:05:18.940> on<00:05:19.090> to<00:05:19.330> it<00:05:19.510> so<00:05:19.810> well

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
to put the next level on to it so well

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.350 
to put the next level on to it so well
we're<00:05:20.740> a<00:05:20.770> bunch<00:05:20.980> of<00:05:21.130> mates<00:05:21.280> so<00:05:21.790> it<00:05:22.060> has<00:05:22.210> to<00:05:22.330> come

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
we're a bunch of mates so it has to come

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.750 
we're a bunch of mates so it has to come
across<00:05:22.690> light<00:05:23.020> that<00:05:23.590> we<00:05:24.160> are<00:05:24.310> actually<00:05:24.490> really

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
across light that we are actually really

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.400 
across light that we are actually really
good<00:05:24.970> mates<00:05:25.180> that<00:05:25.300> we<00:05:25.360> hang<00:05:25.480> out<00:05:25.660> together<00:05:25.840> as

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
good mates that we hang out together as

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:57.540 
good mates that we hang out together as
well<00:05:26.650> so<00:05:27.210> hopefully<00:05:28.210> that

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.770
