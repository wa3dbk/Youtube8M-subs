00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.649
 good kids you spend huizar that 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.889
 I'm here in what you once commit 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:10.460
 a gameplay of this one is good these of 

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:17.370
 edvard works 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:19.260
 the writer is late the game I do not have 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.180
 for several months since it came out 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.070
 practically the same 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.670
 this has played enough matches and such 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:31.640
 and it's because I wanted to play but in 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.430
 it's a good game 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.899
 many people think that I started 3 goes wrong and 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.280
 we go the first days then already 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.710
 they put in a patch and they fixed it like that 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.260
 that if you want to buy it you will not have 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.489
 problems to play at least is what 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.690
 who thinks long ago that the games 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.329
 I say that experience that I have 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.370
 since I believe complete and good the truth 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.579
 can play weapon and it 's pretty 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:57.550
 well fucked competitively and such 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.550
 some videos and this game the truth 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.300
 it's pretty good 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:14.180
 I think we are the best because the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.439
 rest are a fucking shit this is 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.689
 pretty good the truth to me to me what 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:26.049
 that I liked the most I had 225 2 thousand 500 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:28.460
 low with the 300 has the head 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.500
 always with him he used to consist shit in 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.780
 villa I do not know why I agreed not to like it 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.759
 I find it very comfortable because both 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.600
 medium as a long distance quite 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.440
 well and such and already short is because it is very 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.560
 Quick 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.209
 It's not hard to kill you the truth 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.799
 paddlers I do not know how it will be the same now 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:49.220
 do not unbalance or something in the cear or 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.509
 anything like this is used when 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.850
 a third play so it's not 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.150
 franco is to act under everyone 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.940
 the atlas was good but this frank 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.710
 it's a chant of locks and any 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.990
 cross and such is it 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.100
 and sorry if I swallow with things I never 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.250
 recommended universe 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.660
 I would like to leave a comment I think 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.590
 are more videos from here to not be 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.750
 a lot of time on Sunday has 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.100
 uploaded the channel by the way really I 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.959
 no matter what the channel helps me and if you see the 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.840
 video helps me and if not also so 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.540
 do what comes out of the balls and 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.850
 well that the only thing he wanted to say 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.319
 is that if someone likes it or if 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.140
 someone has doubts if you buy this 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.569
 latest 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.620
 if you have friends to play that you know 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.620
 buy because you are going to have a good time 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.550
 before all my friends now they are no longer 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.080
 no longer 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.350
 They were touching the balls but good 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.090
 in short if you like the product the 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.430
 essence the last color that spiritual 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.390
 they kill me pretty out there with a fucking 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.620
 with a crazy monkey fucking that goes with his fucking 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.430
 sniper killing pelÃ© thus 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.290
 as he says as if he does not 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.530
 this game is the host and if you like the 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.599
 weapon and you do not have fucking hands because you do not 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.269
 you eat it because more or less 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:23.780
 reward would have men rampant and neither 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.609
 it can change but it really makes up for it 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.290
 change this game of so that this one 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.939
 already put it on purpose I think for 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.349
 Log in so that not because you are 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.930
 exist some that already has giving 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.389
 jumps like a delayed whore and then 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.500
 can you say basically what 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.500
 they want with this game is 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:47.489
 and encourage that I do not know why 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.700
 I have a couple of clips talking about that 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.680
 that game I do not get anything is a good 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.459
 split a 28 42 and I think it's 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.459
 pretty cool 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.570
 he plays also an 80 27 but that I'm not going to 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.740
 upload because it's a text that died on 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.350
 rap and good 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.570
 so do not do that 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.329
 what is a good game, what do you have 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.930
 doubts of 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:27.900
 at a Christmas time and such if I tell you 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.280
 you want to buy 13 when I played I was going 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.530
 fucking mother and that were the first 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.400
 weeks or feel if you had to go to 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.330
 better guess 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.830
 today that the team had screwed if there 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.570
 three or something like that 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.230
 now it is already restored it would be a 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:47.670
 failure there are two days or whatever 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.520
 and as you see well enough 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.830
 in fact going to serve seems damn 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.570
 be with this measure of fucking mother and with 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.440
 the others that I'm also a lot 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.810
 the ability 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.880
 the iron pretty but I did not get to 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.560
 convince what is good is also a 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.190
 time in quite good variables of the 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.190
 rule 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:12.010
 and I like it because it goes well for all 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.440
 the distances because by far three 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.880
 brands and I have a problem that 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.340
 a few fucking games this if they are far 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.840
 the shots I do not see a shit and I never 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.000
 I saw them at least as it is less 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.200
 mark and even if normal points are made 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.980
 that we seem to have thrown into the air 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.800
 warfare 3 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.780
 I know that I like to be me 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.820
 I use and it gives me fucking mother 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.440
 and well we have it very comment 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.129
 this way the musician father something that good 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.649
 because already 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:38.790
 to do this I never work much and 

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:40.560
 we talked about what he wanted 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.570
 what I wanted to tell you about the 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.840
 low streak that led to equal as 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.840
 you see 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.280
 nothing the rats in this game is 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.190
 quite well they are very balanced not 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.320
 there is no that is why I want 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.080
 take advantage since I'm just going to see this 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.090
 nest started I mean the boats 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.460
 of casualties from modern warfare 2 to 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.410
 This game is a fucking shit all or 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.200
 be each and every one of them in all 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.080
 the games are crap because because 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.940
 they do not really let you play games 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.990
 gusts because 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:24.160
 it respects a little listening 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:26.800
 They do not leave you for example in this complex 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.680
 do not follow them like we were 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.810
 blocked the boss the bones 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.810
 for example that was the previous 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.229
 that is, it was impossible to play in that game 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.600
 the nights of casualties were not removed 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:45.330
 avioncitos this if the dogs had 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.970
 the game already is that is really 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:51.930
 I do not know about those nights, it took away from you 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:54.150
 play good and finish the game in my 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.530
 fucking life I commented and my fucking life I'm going to 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.430
 comment again if not also the 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:01.080
 conace this because I know that the test 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.699
 made the sister equal I wanted to do 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.500
 this because I'm totally stripe that we are 

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:06.689
 what to do and jehovah I'll comment 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:10.020
 a couple of nonsense here we go three that 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:11.909
 I have the same to thank you in the end 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.620
 as a whole seven minutes good I think 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:14.680
 that this is already merit for me that never 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.530
 it has done 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:20.759
 and good kids to see if I upload something more 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.759
 but it is young for all
