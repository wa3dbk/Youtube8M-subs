00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.420 

so<00:00:10.900> there's<00:00:11.080> gonna<00:00:11.230> be<00:00:11.320> a<00:00:11.410> second<00:00:11.920> part<00:00:11.950> to<00:00:12.219> the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430 
so there's gonna be a second part to the

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.670 
so there's gonna be a second part to the
level<00:00:12.760> seven<00:00:12.969> upgrade<00:00:13.600> mainly<00:00:14.110> due<00:00:14.260> the<00:00:14.440> fact

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
level seven upgrade mainly due the fact

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.170 
level seven upgrade mainly due the fact
that<00:00:14.799> after<00:00:15.280> I<00:00:15.309> installed<00:00:15.820> the<00:00:15.969> ground

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
that after I installed the ground

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.830 
that after I installed the ground
effects

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
effects

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.429 
effects
well<00:00:17.500> the<00:00:17.710> LEDs<00:00:18.130> start<00:00:18.520> burning<00:00:18.759> out<00:00:19.060> and<00:00:19.439> be

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
well the LEDs start burning out and be

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.290 
well the LEDs start burning out and be
honest<00:00:20.860> they're<00:00:21.160> not<00:00:21.340> that<00:00:21.550> bright<00:00:21.730> as<00:00:22.090> well

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
honest they're not that bright as well

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.659 
honest they're not that bright as well
so<00:00:23.230> I<00:00:23.259> went<00:00:23.680> out<00:00:23.830> and<00:00:23.860> bought<00:00:24.070> some<00:00:24.400> high

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669 
so I went out and bought some high

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.519 
so I went out and bought some high
quality<00:00:24.730> LEDs<00:00:25.720> that<00:00:25.990> should<00:00:26.170> be<00:00:26.260> much

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
quality LEDs that should be much

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.609 
quality LEDs that should be much
brighter<00:00:26.859> and<00:00:27.100> they<00:00:27.910> won't<00:00:28.119> burn<00:00:28.480> out<00:00:28.720> also

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
brighter and they won't burn out also

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.740 
brighter and they won't burn out also
I'm<00:00:30.250> gonna<00:00:30.340> be<00:00:30.550> installing<00:00:30.910> some<00:00:31.060> more<00:00:31.510> LEDs

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
I'm gonna be installing some more LEDs

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.189 
I'm gonna be installing some more LEDs
into<00:00:32.559> the<00:00:33.010> Stampede<00:00:33.580> body<00:00:33.930> including<00:00:34.930> brake

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
into the Stampede body including brake

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.189 
into the Stampede body including brake
lights<00:00:35.530> and<00:00:35.860> on<00:00:36.790> top<00:00:37.059> of<00:00:37.090> that<00:00:37.390> I'm<00:00:37.780> gonna<00:00:38.050> be

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
lights and on top of that I'm gonna be

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.220 
lights and on top of that I'm gonna be
trying<00:00:38.470> to<00:00:38.589> get<00:00:38.769> rid<00:00:39.040> of<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.610> blue<00:00:39.960> ESC<00:00:40.960> and

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
trying to get rid of the blue ESC and

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.380 
trying to get rid of the blue ESC and
blue<00:00:41.680> millennium<00:00:42.280> motor<00:00:42.489> and<00:00:43.059> I'll<00:00:43.180> show<00:00:43.360> you

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
blue millennium motor and I'll show you

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.240 
blue millennium motor and I'll show you
what<00:00:43.600> I<00:00:43.629> mean<00:00:43.870> about<00:00:44.050> that<00:00:44.200> in<00:00:44.649> a<00:00:44.800> little<00:00:45.070> bit

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
what I mean about that in a little bit

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.549 
what I mean about that in a little bit
first<00:00:45.760> let's<00:00:46.180> get<00:00:46.329> all<00:00:46.480> the<00:00:46.600> LEDs<00:00:46.960> taken<00:00:47.350> care

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
first let's get all the LEDs taken care

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.680 
first let's get all the LEDs taken care
of<00:00:47.590> so<00:00:48.460> this<00:00:48.579> is<00:00:48.760> what<00:00:48.910> it<00:00:49.000> looks<00:00:49.180> like<00:00:49.270> with

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
of so this is what it looks like with

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.270 
of so this is what it looks like with
the<00:00:49.719> LEDs<00:00:50.170> that<00:00:50.200> I<00:00:50.469> have<00:00:50.710> in<00:00:50.860> there<00:00:51.039> right<00:00:51.219> now

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
the LEDs that I have in there right now

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.020 
the LEDs that I have in there right now
not<00:00:52.270> too<00:00:52.480> bright<00:00:52.890> with<00:00:53.890> what<00:00:54.399> three<00:00:54.820> of<00:00:54.940> them

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
not too bright with what three of them

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.090 
not too bright with what three of them
burned<00:00:55.329> out<00:00:55.570> it<00:00:56.140> doesn't<00:00:56.379> look<00:00:56.590> very<00:00:56.800> good<00:00:56.980> at

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
burned out it doesn't look very good at

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.420 
burned out it doesn't look very good at
all<00:00:57.219> and<00:00:57.699> then<00:00:57.940> when<00:00:58.059> I<00:00:58.090> turn<00:00:58.329> off<00:00:58.449> the<00:00:58.600> light

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
all and then when I turn off the light

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.650 
all and then when I turn off the light
it<00:01:00.430> just<00:01:00.489> isn't<00:01:01.030> that<00:01:01.359> bright

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
it just isn't that bright

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.800 
it just isn't that bright
and<00:01:03.870> here<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.559> with<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.430> new<00:01:05.460> LEDs<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
and here it is with the new LEDs as you

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.980 
and here it is with the new LEDs as you
can<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.200> there<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:08.479> very<00:01:09.479> dramatic

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
can see there is a very dramatic

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.340 
can see there is a very dramatic
difference<00:01:11.180> that's<00:01:12.180> really<00:01:12.570> good<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.049> of

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
difference that's really good and of

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.180 
difference that's really good and of
course<00:01:13.619> when<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.920> turn<00:01:14.159> off<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> light<00:01:16.009> yeah<00:01:17.009> it

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
course when I turn off the light yeah it

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.440 
course when I turn off the light yeah it
lights<00:01:17.399> up<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.610> whole<00:01:17.729> room

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
lights up the whole room

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.450 
lights up the whole room
ooh<00:01:19.909> that<00:01:20.909> looks<00:01:20.940> much<00:01:21.720> better<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:25.619> then<00:01:26.430> you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
ooh that looks much better and then you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.779 
ooh that looks much better and then you
can<00:01:26.700> see<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:28.259> headlights<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:29.130> ended<00:01:29.399> up<00:01:29.520> adding

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
can see the headlights I ended up adding

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.080 
can see the headlights I ended up adding
two<00:01:30.420> more<00:01:30.750> at<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> bottom<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.820> course

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
two more at the bottom and of course

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.649 
two more at the bottom and of course
added<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.690> brake<00:01:33.869> lights<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.759> as<00:01:35.759> with<00:01:36.090> other

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
added the brake lights and as with other

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.540 
added the brake lights and as with other
C's<00:01:37.050> that<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.319> have<00:01:37.530> each<00:01:37.920> one<00:01:38.130> has<00:01:38.310> their<00:01:38.520> own

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
C's that I have each one has their own

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.080 
C's that I have each one has their own
individual<00:01:39.179> switch<00:01:42.770> there<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:43.860> go<00:01:44.039> Wow<00:01:44.729> looks

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
individual switch there we go Wow looks

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.639 
individual switch there we go Wow looks
poof<00:01:47.330> and<00:01:48.330> then<00:01:48.810> when<00:01:48.929> I<00:01:48.960> turn<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.409> light<00:01:49.619> off

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
poof and then when I turn the light off

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.770 
poof and then when I turn the light off
completely<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.909> pretty<00:01:51.210> much<00:01:51.360> lights<00:01:51.630> up

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
completely just pretty much lights up

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.359 
completely just pretty much lights up
the<00:01:51.899> whole<00:01:52.020> room<00:01:54.799> they<00:01:55.799> know<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.159> brake

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the whole room they know the brake

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.539 
the whole room they know the brake
lights<00:01:56.640> aren't<00:01:57.920> out<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:58.979> sync<00:01:59.369> they're

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
lights aren't out of sync they're

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.609 
lights aren't out of sync they're
actually<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.970> same<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.690> just<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.170> angle<00:02:01.319> of

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
actually the same it's just the angle of

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.640 
actually the same it's just the angle of
the<00:02:01.679> wall<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:01.890> makes<00:02:02.220> them<00:02:02.340> look<00:02:02.490> all<00:02:02.640> warped

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:14.810 

ting<00:02:07.650> so<00:02:08.280> freakin<00:02:08.850> braid<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:14.280> now<00:02:14.490> for<00:02:14.760> the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
ting so freakin braid and now for the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.050 
ting so freakin braid and now for the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
ESC as you can tell it is blue and I

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.360 
ESC as you can tell it is blue and I

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
so now it's on to the balunia motor now

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.699 
so now it's on to the balunia motor now
