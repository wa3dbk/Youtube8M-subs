00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
a huge state we're writing so much about

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.749 
a huge state we're writing so much about
the<00:01:31.140> world<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.680> didn't<00:01:31.890> know<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.220> massive

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
the world we didn't know this massive

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.310 
the world we didn't know this massive
but<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.060> had<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.299> choose<00:01:33.509> between<00:01:33.689> two<00:01:34.049> major

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
but we had to choose between two major

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.960 
but we had to choose between two major
cities<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:35.009> Houston<00:01:35.340> seemed<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
cities but Houston seemed to have the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.399 
cities but Houston seemed to have the
most<00:01:36.060> pictures<00:01:36.450> popping<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:36.840> guys<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.170> thought

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
most pictures popping up guys I thought

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.830 
most pictures popping up guys I thought
that<00:01:37.619> we<00:01:37.740> could<00:01:37.950> drive<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.729> Houston<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:39.750> it

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
that we could drive to Houston but it

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.289 
that we could drive to Houston but it
turns<00:01:40.049> out<00:01:40.140> take<00:01:40.320> something<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.650> four<00:01:41.299> from

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299
