to<00:01:57.840> do<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.079> because<00:01:58.289> it<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.619> like<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.799> said<00:01:58.920> it

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
to do it because it is like I said it

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.690 
to do it because it is like I said it
may<00:01:59.280> blow<00:01:59.490> apart<00:01:59.819> and<00:02:00.090> destroy<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> $10,000

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
may blow apart and destroy a $10,000

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.440 
may blow apart and destroy a $10,000
engine<00:02:04.670> so<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:05.850> we've<00:02:05.969> got<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.210> couple

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
engine so here we've got a couple

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.419 
engine so here we've got a couple
examples<00:02:06.749> of<00:02:07.319> superchargers<00:02:08.100> that<00:02:08.280> have

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
examples of superchargers that have

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.430 
examples of superchargers that have
blown<00:02:08.670> up<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.240> caused<00:02:09.690> some<00:02:09.899> issues<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
blown up and caused some issues the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.949 
blown up and caused some issues the
components<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.190> basically<00:02:12.150> disintegrated

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
components have basically disintegrated

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.390 
components have basically disintegrated
and<00:02:13.200> gone<00:02:13.799> through<00:02:14.040> the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
and gone through the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.569 
and gone through the
taking<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.299> taking<00:02:15.840> out<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:15.989> engines<00:02:16.579> the

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
taking it and taking out the engines the

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.910 
taking it and taking out the engines the
oil<00:02:17.849> pumps<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.390> stuff<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:19.019> but<00:02:19.829> the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
oil pumps and stuff like that but the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.069 
oil pumps and stuff like that but the
first<00:02:20.129> one<00:02:20.340> we've<00:02:20.489> got<00:02:20.519> here<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.209> one<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.019> the

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
first one we've got here and one of the

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.449 
first one we've got here and one of the
big<00:02:22.230> issues<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.590> we<00:02:22.860> see<00:02:23.040> with<00:02:23.189> them<00:02:23.340> if

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
big issues that we see with them if

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.949 
big issues that we see with them if
they're<00:02:23.610> not<00:02:23.760> maintained<00:02:24.269> is<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.569> friction

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
they're not maintained is the friction

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.500 
they're not maintained is the friction
washers<00:02:25.409> themselves<00:02:26.069> go<00:02:26.939> missing<00:02:27.329> basically

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
washers themselves go missing basically

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.869 
washers themselves go missing basically
too<00:02:27.959> little<00:02:28.290> washers<00:02:28.799> that<00:02:29.400> go<00:02:29.549> on<00:02:29.700> either

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
too little washers that go on either

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.390 
too little washers that go on either
side<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.209> this<00:02:30.450> little<00:02:30.629> gear<00:02:30.930> here<00:02:31.319> and<00:02:31.500> after

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
side of this little gear here and after

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.970 
side of this little gear here and after
while<00:02:32.579> they<00:02:32.819> can<00:02:33.060> wear<00:02:33.540> out<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.049> break<00:02:34.769> apart

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
while they can wear out and break apart

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.539 
while they can wear out and break apart
and<00:02:35.459> go<00:02:36.000> through<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.390> engine<00:02:36.780> now<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:38.340> one

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
and go through the engine now the one

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.240 
and go through the engine now the one
thing<00:02:38.760> here<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.329> that<00:02:39.900> BRP<00:02:40.650> has<00:02:40.769> actually

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
thing here that that BRP has actually

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.530 
thing here that that BRP has actually
done<00:02:41.400> some<00:02:41.579> improvements<00:02:42.239> with<00:02:42.359> these

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
done some improvements with these

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.110 
done some improvements with these
washers<00:02:43.019> over<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.439> years<00:02:43.709> if<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:44.609> got<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> gold

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
washers over the years if you got a gold

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.149 
washers over the years if you got a gold
set<00:02:45.510> kind<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.440> like<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.680> ones<00:02:46.889> I'm<00:02:47.129> showing

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
set kind of like the ones I'm showing

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.330 
set kind of like the ones I'm showing
here<00:02:48.170> they're<00:02:49.170> basically<00:02:49.709> they're<00:02:49.950> good<00:02:50.129> for

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
here they're basically they're good for

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.640 
here they're basically they're good for
a<00:02:50.400> hundred<00:02:50.790> hours<00:02:50.909> and<00:02:51.389> that<00:02:52.139> once<00:02:52.379> they<00:02:52.530> get

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
a hundred hours and that once they get

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.379 
a hundred hours and that once they get
replaced<00:02:53.129> with<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.609> the<00:02:53.819> new<00:02:53.940> ones<00:02:54.150> in<00:02:54.299> the

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
replaced with the the new ones in the

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.050 
replaced with the the new ones in the
kit<00:02:54.629> via<00:02:54.930> titanium<00:02:55.530> coated<00:02:55.889> ones<00:02:56.129> they're

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
kit via titanium coated ones they're

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.020 
kit via titanium coated ones they're
good<00:02:57.239> up<00:02:57.389> to<00:02:57.540> 200<00:02:58.079> hours<00:02:58.200> so<00:02:58.980> they<00:02:59.489> are<00:02:59.700> making

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
good up to 200 hours so they are making

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.089 
good up to 200 hours so they are making
great<00:03:00.510> improvements<00:03:00.720> with<00:03:01.260> these<00:03:01.439> washers<00:03:01.920> to

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
great improvements with these washers to

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.580 
great improvements with these washers to
kind<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.400> lengthen<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.389> interval<00:03:04.019> of<00:03:04.049> how

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
kind of lengthen the interval of how

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.490 
kind of lengthen the interval of how
long<00:03:04.799> they<00:03:05.040> uh<00:03:05.069> how<00:03:05.879> long<00:03:06.060> they<00:03:06.239> go<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:07.319> can

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
long they uh how long they go you can

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.710 
long they uh how long they go you can
see<00:03:07.680> here<00:03:07.980> on<00:03:08.159> this<00:03:08.579> supercharge<00:03:09.480> where

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
see here on this supercharge where

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.119 
see here on this supercharge where
they've<00:03:09.840> actually<00:03:09.870> blown<00:03:10.470> apart<00:03:10.829> and<00:03:11.040> they're

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
they've actually blown apart and they're

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.910 
they've actually blown apart and they're
missing<00:03:11.340> on<00:03:11.609> both<00:03:11.819> sides<00:03:12.120> here<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:13.260> if<00:03:13.709> this

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
missing on both sides here and if this

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.220 
missing on both sides here and if this
is<00:03:14.129> one<00:03:14.400> kind<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.269> be<00:03:15.389> aware<00:03:15.599> of<00:03:15.659> if<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.959> got<00:03:16.109> an

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
is one kind to be aware of if you got an

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.610 
is one kind to be aware of if you got an
older<00:03:16.620> C<00:03:16.889> do<00:03:17.090> an<00:03:18.090> O<00:03:18.510> seven<00:03:18.989> or<00:03:19.109> older<00:03:19.470> they

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
older C do an O seven or older they

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.289 
older C do an O seven or older they
might<00:03:19.769> have<00:03:19.889> had<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.069> white<00:03:20.400> washer<00:03:20.940> into<00:03:21.060> them

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
might have had a white washer into them

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:21.949 
might have had a white washer into them
the<00:03:21.389> white<00:03:21.569> ones

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
the white ones

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.680 
the white ones
they're<00:03:22.709> definitely<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.370> had<00:03:24.120> issues<00:03:24.510> with

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
they're definitely and had issues with

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.409 
they're definitely and had issues with
them<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.340> they<00:03:26.340> could<00:03:26.400> basically<00:03:26.699> blow<00:03:27.120> up<00:03:27.269> at

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
them and they could basically blow up at

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.720 
them and they could basically blow up at
any<00:03:27.480> time<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.109> basically<00:03:28.859> what<00:03:29.310> I'm<00:03:29.400> trying<00:03:29.669> to

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
any time so basically what I'm trying to

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.520 
any time so basically what I'm trying to
say<00:03:29.909> here<00:03:29.940> is<00:03:30.209> if<00:03:30.510> you've<00:03:30.720> just<00:03:30.989> purchased<00:03:31.169> a

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
say here is if you've just purchased a

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.500 
say here is if you've just purchased a
seadoo<00:03:31.859> or<00:03:32.099> with<00:03:32.549> a<00:03:32.579> supercharger<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.329> you're

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
seadoo or with a supercharger and you're

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.710 
seadoo or with a supercharger and you're
not<00:03:33.659> too<00:03:33.870> sure<00:03:34.109> if<00:03:34.379> it's<00:03:34.980> been<00:03:35.190> rebuilt<00:03:35.669> or<00:03:36.239> you

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
not too sure if it's been rebuilt or you

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.119 
not too sure if it's been rebuilt or you
can't<00:03:36.959> remember<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.349> last<00:03:37.500> time<00:03:37.680> it's<00:03:37.949> been

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
can't remember the last time it's been

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.030 
can't remember the last time it's been
done<00:03:38.159> or<00:03:38.519> its<00:03:38.639> o7<00:03:39.180> or<00:03:39.299> older<00:03:39.629> it's<00:03:40.049> probably<00:03:41.010> a

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
done or its o7 or older it's probably a

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.219 
done or its o7 or older it's probably a
very<00:03:41.129> good<00:03:41.489> idea<00:03:41.909> to<00:03:42.180> get<00:03:42.359> that<00:03:42.569> supercharger

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:43.229 
very good idea to get that supercharger

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.379 
very good idea to get that supercharger
removed<00:03:43.620> get<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.340> inspected<00:03:44.609> get<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.239> rebuilt

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
removed get it inspected get it rebuilt

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.770 
removed get it inspected get it rebuilt
that<00:03:45.690> so<00:03:46.109> you<00:03:46.229> know<00:03:46.349> what's<00:03:46.560> going<00:03:46.829> on<00:03:47.690> now<00:03:48.690> the

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
that so you know what's going on now the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.240 
that so you know what's going on now the
other<00:03:49.019> issue<00:03:49.290> I've<00:03:49.560> seen<00:03:49.799> with<00:03:50.069> the

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
other issue I've seen with the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.309 
other issue I've seen with the
superchargers<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.239> not<00:03:51.449> very<00:03:51.690> often<00:03:52.109> this<00:03:52.169> is

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
superchargers and not very often this is

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.710 
superchargers and not very often this is
just<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.620> select<00:03:52.949> few<00:03:53.069> but<00:03:53.489> once<00:03:54.329> in<00:03:54.479> a<00:03:54.540> while

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
just a select few but once in a while

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.689 
just a select few but once in a while
you'll<00:03:54.870> see<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:55.139> bearing<00:03:55.680> blow<00:03:55.949> up<00:03:56.129> on<00:03:56.370> them<00:03:56.549> and

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:56.699 
you'll see a bearing blow up on them and

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.180 
you'll see a bearing blow up on them and
then<00:03:57.209> same<00:03:57.479> thing<00:03:57.750> again<00:03:57.989> here<00:03:58.319> you<00:03:58.440> see<00:03:58.680> where

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
then same thing again here you see where

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.309 
then same thing again here you see where
the<00:03:59.340> bearing<00:03:59.669> where<00:03:59.819> the<00:03:59.940> cage<00:04:00.239> basically<00:04:01.169> the

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
the bearing where the cage basically the

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.289 
the bearing where the cage basically the
cage<00:04:01.590> is<00:04:01.799> disintegrated<00:04:02.579> on<00:04:02.699> this<00:04:02.879> bearing

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
cage is disintegrated on this bearing

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.719 
cage is disintegrated on this bearing
the<00:04:04.199> bearing<00:04:04.500> has<00:04:04.590> fallen<00:04:04.889> apart<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.519> again

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
the bearing has fallen apart and again

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:08.030 
the bearing has fallen apart and again
it's<00:04:05.909> got<00:04:06.120> sucked<00:04:06.449> into<00:04:06.659> the<00:04:06.930> intake<00:04:07.379> and<00:04:07.409> made

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
it's got sucked into the intake and made

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.430 
it's got sucked into the intake and made
its<00:04:08.220> way<00:04:08.280> through<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.819> engine<00:04:09.209> so<00:04:10.169> I<00:04:10.199> just

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
its way through the engine so I just

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.140 
its way through the engine so I just
want<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.739> show<00:04:10.859> this<00:04:11.069> one<00:04:11.129> just<00:04:11.459> an<00:04:11.579> example<00:04:11.879> we

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
want to show this one just an example we

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.149 
want to show this one just an example we
had<00:04:12.329> on<00:04:12.479> the<00:04:12.599> bench<00:04:12.810> here<00:04:13.109> and<00:04:13.290> again<00:04:13.889> once

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
had on the bench here and again once

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.279 
had on the bench here and again once
this<00:04:14.340> happened<00:04:14.849> you<00:04:14.909> can<00:04:15.060> see<00:04:15.269> here<00:04:15.690> in<00:04:15.810> the

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
this happened you can see here in the

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.860 
this happened you can see here in the
oil<00:04:16.500> pump<00:04:16.859> words<00:04:17.250> that<00:04:17.609> scored<00:04:18.180> up<00:04:18.329> both<00:04:18.539> oil

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
oil pump words that scored up both oil

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.990 
oil pump words that scored up both oil
pump<00:04:19.169> some<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:20.159> the<00:04:20.250> point<00:04:20.489> that<00:04:20.609> they<00:04:20.729> need<00:04:20.909> to

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
pump some to the point that they need to

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.750 
pump some to the point that they need to
be<00:04:21.120> replaced<00:04:21.449> you<00:04:22.409> can<00:04:22.620> actually<00:04:22.950> see<00:04:23.370> some<00:04:23.400> of

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
be replaced you can actually see some of

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.060 
be replaced you can actually see some of
the<00:04:23.820> filings<00:04:24.419> from<00:04:24.599> the<00:04:24.779> bearing<00:04:25.169> in<00:04:25.860> this

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
the filings from the bearing in this

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.920 
the filings from the bearing in this
little<00:04:26.340> cavity<00:04:26.849> here<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.300> then<00:04:27.750> it

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
little cavity here and then it

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.870 
little cavity here and then it
it's<00:04:28.259> made<00:04:28.470> its<00:04:28.650> way<00:04:28.800> through<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:29.250> engine<00:04:29.699> and

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
it's made its way through the engine and

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.029 
it's made its way through the engine and
through<00:04:30.449> all<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.690> crankshaft<00:04:31.050> bearings<00:04:31.770> the

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
through all the crankshaft bearings the

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.580 
through all the crankshaft bearings the
connecting<00:04:33.030> rod<00:04:33.240> bearings<00:04:33.660> top<00:04:33.930> end<00:04:34.199> bearings

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
connecting rod bearings top end bearings

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.310

all<00:04:34.740> that<00:04:34.919> type<00:04:35.130> of<00:04:35.160> stuff<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.840> so<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.990> doesn't

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
all that type of stuff and so it doesn't

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.230 
all that type of stuff and so it doesn't
take<00:04:37.440> long<00:04:37.470> to<00:04:37.710> destroy<00:04:38.039> an<00:04:38.370> engine<00:04:38.669> really

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
take long to destroy an engine really

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.629 
take long to destroy an engine really
quickly<00:04:39.630> when<00:04:39.810> this<00:04:39.990> happens<00:04:40.500> I'm<00:04:41.039> not<00:04:41.310> trying
