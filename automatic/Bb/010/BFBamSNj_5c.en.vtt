cement<00:01:50.780> neither<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:52.020> i<00:01:52.939> there<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
cement neither can i there is a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.789 
cement neither can i there is a
difference<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> stronger<00:01:55.229> product

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799
