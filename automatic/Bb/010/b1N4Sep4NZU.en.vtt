00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
it shows that Samsung is innovating and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.840 
it shows that Samsung is innovating and
that<00:01:31.710> they're<00:01:31.860> not<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.040> resting<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.759> their

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
that they're not just resting on their

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.310 
that they're not just resting on their
laurels<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.360> working<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:33.960> existing

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
laurels and working on existing

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.249 
laurels and working on existing
categories<00:01:35.159> now<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.299> think<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.750> Galaxy<00:01:37.140> Note

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
categories now I think the Galaxy Note

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.289 
categories now I think the Galaxy Note
