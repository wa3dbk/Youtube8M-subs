you're<00:03:17.800> just<00:03:18.010> trying<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.310> find<00:03:18.490> a<00:03:18.640> match<00:03:18.850> now

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
you're just trying to find a match now

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.120 
you're just trying to find a match now
the<00:03:19.780> reason<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.170> might<00:03:20.320> need<00:03:20.500> up<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.800> seven

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
the reason you might need up to seven

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.770 
the reason you might need up to seven
pieces<00:03:21.340> of<00:03:21.550> five<00:03:21.760> paper<00:03:22.090> is<00:03:22.300> it<00:03:22.420> could<00:03:22.570> be<00:03:22.660> the

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
pieces of five paper is it could be the

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.390 
pieces of five paper is it could be the
very<00:03:22.810> last<00:03:23.020> item<00:03:23.650> that<00:03:23.800> turns<00:03:24.070> out<00:03:24.250> to<00:03:24.310> have

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
very last item that turns out to have

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.610 
very last item that turns out to have
the<00:03:24.580> match<00:03:24.820> but<00:03:25.210> however<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.900> think<00:03:26.320> for<00:03:26.500> myself

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
the match but however I think for myself

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.710 
the match but however I think for myself
I<00:03:27.040> had<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.730> match<00:03:28.000> on<00:03:28.210> the<00:03:28.300> second<00:03:28.600> or<00:03:28.660> third

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
I had a match on the second or third

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.270 
I had a match on the second or third
item<00:03:29.020> so<00:03:29.320> once<00:03:29.500> you've<00:03:29.620> got<00:03:29.770> a<00:03:29.800> match<00:03:30.010> you<00:03:30.160> can

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
item so once you've got a match you can

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.530 
item so once you've got a match you can
drop<00:03:30.430> all<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.700> other<00:03:30.820> items<00:03:31.180> you're<00:03:31.360> only

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
drop all the other items you're only

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.730 
drop all the other items you're only
going<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:31.840> need<00:03:31.900> like<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.380> matching

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
going to need like the matching

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.820 
going to need like the matching
fingerprints<00:03:34.080> so<00:03:35.080> once<00:03:35.410> you<00:03:35.560> have<00:03:35.710> your

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
fingerprints so once you have your

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.590 
fingerprints so once you have your
matching<00:03:36.250> fingerprints<00:03:36.880> you<00:03:37.000> now<00:03:37.180> want<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.510> go

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
matching fingerprints you now want to go

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.270 
matching fingerprints you now want to go
to<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.870> mention<00:03:38.290> gate<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:38.800> speak<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.160> the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
dimension bought some and so basically

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.080 
dimension bought some and so basically
now<00:04:08.500> what<00:04:08.710> we<00:04:08.800> need<00:04:08.830> to<00:04:08.980> do<00:04:09.250> is<00:04:09.400> go<00:04:09.640> speak<00:04:10.060> to

now what we need to do is go speak to
the<00:04:10.630> relevant<00:04:10.960> person<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:11.620> found<00:04:11.860> matching

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
the relevant person you found matching

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.190 
the relevant person you found matching
the<00:04:12.400> finger<00:04:12.640> principle<00:04:13.090> but<00:04:13.540> first<00:04:13.840> off<00:04:14.020> head

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
the finger principle but first off head

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.050 
the finger principle but first off head
back<00:04:14.380> to<00:04:14.500> Sinclair<00:04:14.950> mention<00:04:15.400> or<00:04:15.580> explain<00:04:15.880> how

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
back to Sinclair mention or explain how

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.170 
back to Sinclair mention or explain how
to<00:04:16.120> do<00:04:16.330> that<00:04:17.190> ok<00:04:18.190> once<00:04:18.400> you<00:04:18.520> arrive<00:04:18.790> back<00:04:19.030> and

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
to do that ok once you arrive back and

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.610 
to do that ok once you arrive back and
imagine<00:04:19.540> this<00:04:19.630> is<00:04:19.780> what<00:04:19.900> you<00:04:19.989> need<00:04:20.140> to<00:04:20.260> do<00:04:20.380> now

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
imagine this is what you need to do now

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.830 
imagine this is what you need to do now
obviously<00:04:20.920> this<00:04:21.070> part<00:04:21.430> will<00:04:21.640> vary<00:04:21.940> to

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
obviously this part will vary to

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.900 
obviously this part will vary to
different<00:04:23.170> people<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.740> depend<00:04:24.220> on<00:04:24.610> who<00:04:24.790> you

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
different people and depend on who you

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.580 
different people and depend on who you
got<00:04:25.090> matching<00:04:25.510> fingerprints<00:04:26.140> for<00:04:26.320> however

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
got matching fingerprints for however

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.040 
got matching fingerprints for however
the<00:04:27.220> whole<00:04:27.400> concept<00:04:27.940> is<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.210> same<00:04:28.240> thing<00:04:28.480> and

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
the whole concept is the same thing and

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.230 
the whole concept is the same thing and
so<00:04:30.040> so<00:04:30.250> you<00:04:30.340> remember<00:04:30.730> there<00:04:30.880> were<00:04:30.970> six

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
so so you remember there were six

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.240 
so so you remember there were six
different<00:04:31.690> items<00:04:32.110> that<00:04:32.320> you<00:04:32.410> found<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:33.100> it

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
different items that you found and it

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.820 
different items that you found and it
could<00:04:33.370> either<00:04:33.490> banana<00:04:34.120> Bob<00:04:34.660> Carol<00:04:35.350> David

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
could either banana Bob Carol David

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.320 
could either banana Bob Carol David
Elizabeth<00:04:36.280> or<00:04:36.400> Frank<00:04:36.790> that<00:04:37.000> you<00:04:37.060> found

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
Elizabeth or Frank that you found

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.480 
Elizabeth or Frank that you found
matching<00:04:37.750> fingerprints<00:04:38.290> for<00:04:38.470> now<00:04:38.890> whoever

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
matching fingerprints for now whoever

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.890 
matching fingerprints for now whoever
that<00:04:39.580> is<00:04:39.640> you<00:04:40.030> need<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:40.240> do<00:04:40.420> the<00:04:40.510> relevant

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
that is you need to do the relevant

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
starting with my own and so if you found

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.470 
starting with my own and so if you found
matching<00:04:50.860> fingerprints<00:04:51.430> for<00:04:51.550> Bob<00:04:51.760> like<00:04:52.030> I<00:04:52.210> did

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
matching fingerprints for Bob like I did

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.450 
matching fingerprints for Bob like I did
and<00:04:52.630> when<00:04:53.260> you<00:04:53.350> speak<00:04:53.590> to<00:04:53.620> him<00:04:53.740> he'll<00:04:54.100> say<00:04:54.130> they

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
had a problem with the beehive in the

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.240 
had a problem with the beehive in the
garden<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:57.430> had<00:04:57.670> used<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.180> poison<00:04:58.690> on<00:04:58.990> it<00:04:59.250> but

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
garden and had used a poison on it but

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.680 
garden and had used a poison on it but
when<00:05:00.430> you<00:05:00.550> actually<00:05:00.700> go<00:05:01.000> and<00:05:01.120> check<00:05:01.330> out<00:05:01.540> the

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
when you actually go and check out the

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.330 
when you actually go and check out the
beehive<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.200> investigate<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:02.890> beehives

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
beehive and investigate the beehives

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.980 
beehive and investigate the beehives
still<00:05:03.700> puzzled<00:05:04.090> activities<00:05:04.660> and<00:05:04.870> there's

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
still puzzled activities and there's

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.690 
still puzzled activities and there's
definitely<00:05:05.320> not<00:05:05.530> being<00:05:05.740> poisoned<00:05:05.980> at<00:05:06.250> all<00:05:06.490> so

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
definitely not being poisoned at all so

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.580 
definitely not being poisoned at all so
there<00:05:06.850> you<00:05:06.940> go<00:05:07.000> that's<00:05:07.300> you're<00:05:07.540> a<00:05:07.570> catch<00:05:08.050> for

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
there you go that's you're a catch for

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.140 
there you go that's you're a catch for
knowing<00:05:08.800> that<00:05:08.890> Bob<00:05:09.190> done<00:05:09.430> it<00:05:09.580> however

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
knowing that Bob done it however

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.850 
knowing that Bob done it however
obviously<00:05:10.870> if<00:05:10.930> you've<00:05:11.050> got<00:05:11.169> different<00:05:11.290> people

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
obviously if you've got different people

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.620 
obviously if you've got different people
and<00:05:12.220> this<00:05:12.400> is<00:05:12.490> what<00:05:12.610> you<00:05:12.700> need<00:05:12.820> to<00:05:12.970> do<00:05:13.120> so<00:05:13.419> if

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
and this is what you need to do so if

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.150 
and this is what you need to do so if
you<00:05:13.720> found<00:05:13.930> matching<00:05:14.380> fingerprints<00:05:14.890> for<00:05:14.979> Anna

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
you found matching fingerprints for Anna

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.420 
you found matching fingerprints for Anna
she<00:05:15.580> will<00:05:15.700> say<00:05:15.940> that<00:05:16.180> she

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
she will say that she

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.610 
she will say that she
used<00:05:16.550> to<00:05:16.640> poison<00:05:16.820> on<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.270> compost<00:05:17.720> heap<00:05:17.960> so

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
used to poison on the compost heap so

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.780 
used to poison on the compost heap so
obviously<00:05:18.860> if<00:05:18.950> you<00:05:19.010> go<00:05:19.160> and<00:05:19.310> investigate<00:05:19.580> the

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
obviously if you go and investigate the

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.310 
obviously if you go and investigate the
compost<00:05:20.150> heap<00:05:20.360> you'll<00:05:20.540> find<00:05:20.810> out<00:05:20.990> that's<00:05:21.230> not

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
compost heap you'll find out that's not

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.440 
compost heap you'll find out that's not
true<00:05:21.680> and<00:05:21.950> if<00:05:22.640> you<00:05:22.880> found<00:05:23.060> matching

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
true and if you found matching

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.030 
true and if you found matching
fingerprints<00:05:23.990> for<00:05:24.110> Carol<00:05:24.500> she<00:05:24.740> would<00:05:24.890> say

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
fingerprints for Carol she would say

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.680 
fingerprints for Carol she would say
that<00:05:25.220> she<00:05:25.370> used<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.730> poison<00:05:25.910> on<00:05:26.210> the<00:05:26.330> drained

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
that she used to poison on the drained

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.690 
that she used to poison on the drained

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
unclog it and again obviously if you

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.250 
unclog it and again obviously if you
investigate<00:05:29.240> the<00:05:29.330> drain<00:05:29.600> it<00:05:29.930> will<00:05:30.020> tell<00:05:30.170> you

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
investigate the drain it will tell you

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:02.420 
used to poison for finite it's not true

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.260 
used to poison for finite it's not true
so<00:06:02.660> you<00:06:02.750> basically<00:06:02.930> caught<00:06:03.350> them<00:06:03.530> out<00:06:03.680> and<00:06:04.270> now

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270
