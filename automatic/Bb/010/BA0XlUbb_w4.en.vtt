00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
a closer inspection shows that the image

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.760 
a closer inspection shows that the image
lacks<00:01:17.610> detail<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.330> has<00:01:18.510> a<00:01:18.540> lot<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.810> noise<00:01:19.080> and

problems on the droid were fixed by a
software<00:02:15.239> update<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.319> is<00:02:16.470> possible<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:16.980> a

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
software update so it is possible that a

software update so it is possible that a

future update on the milestone may

future update on the milestone may
improve<00:02:19.170> matters<00:02:19.790> however<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.000> actual

too<00:02:23.250> much<00:02:23.280> which<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.760> little<00:02:24.300> bit<00:02:24.600> surprising

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
too much which is little bit surprising

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.050 
too much which is little bit surprising

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
considering that one of motorola's few

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.210 
considering that one of motorola's few
recent<00:02:27.300> successes<00:02:27.870> was<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.650> camera<00:02:28.890> on<00:02:29.040> the
