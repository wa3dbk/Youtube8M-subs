00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.910
 Hello everyone 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.799
 today we will achieve a 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.850
 delicious barbecue sauce 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.279
 for that we need 70 g of ketchup 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.740
 30 g of good wine vinegar 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.410
 tablespoon mustard 2 shallots 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.779
 minced a tablespoon of sauce 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.119
 worcestershire a tablespoon of 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.960
 honey and a teaspoon of 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.239
 smoked paprika 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.430
 to finish we will also need to 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.040
 about 80 grams of olive oil 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.770
 to start we will bring back our 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.370
 chopped shallot in a little bit then 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.890
 olive lé 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.809
 we will try not to do them too much 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.090
 golden in any case not grilled but we will 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.610
 to melt them and a little bit very 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.320
 slightly caramelize during this time 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.510
 there we will mix all the rest of our 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.860
 ingredients in our blender we can 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.860
 also do it by hand if you want 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.700
 we will keep the honey aside because we 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.700
 will add it to the end in our shallots 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.800
 and a little smoked paprika to you 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.960
 two and take sweet paprika instead if 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.880
 you want a barbecue sauce not too 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.010
 spicy but suddenly this is what will 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.520
 give the smoked flavor of the sauce 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.040
 barbecue 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.530
 we will add a little pepper and 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.150
 a pinch of salt then readjust 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.300
 when the assault is ready 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.650
 we are not bad we will add our little 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.240
 honey to coat our shallots so years 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.340
 we want we can also replace 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.540
 shallots part of the onion this is a 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.920
 question taste me I find that 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.070
 the shallot is a little sweeter 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.930
 and sweeter but he put an onion 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.790
 instead so our failures without 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.070
 caramelized now towards is added 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.479
 in nine länder hop we will add a 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.580
 little bit of olive oil we 're not going 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:59.970
 necessarily added everything we will adjust a 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:02.310
 and we mix we will now pour up 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.520
 our sauce in a little pot for the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.090
 keep you add a little bit of 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.869
 ketchup 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.030
 but no I have a little bit after we 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.190
 season we just put salt pepper 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.650
 according to his tastes a little sweeter 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.860
 if we prefer a top it's like 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.050
