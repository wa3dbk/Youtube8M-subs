00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
one at a time soak them all the way

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.850 
one at a time soak them all the way
through<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.180> put<00:01:15.390> them<00:01:15.509> in

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.080 

this<00:01:20.580> machine<00:01:21.300> definitely<00:01:22.580> can<00:01:23.580> hold<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.940> lot

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
this machine definitely can hold a lot

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.040 
this machine definitely can hold a lot
more<00:01:24.150> clothes<00:01:24.780> than<00:01:25.200> my<00:01:26.100> old<00:01:26.310> one<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:27.480> see<00:01:27.840> is

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
more clothes than my old one you see is

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.080 
more clothes than my old one you see is
the<00:01:28.320> Wonder<00:01:28.650> washer<00:01:29.220> which<00:01:29.400> was<00:01:29.430> electric

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the Wonder washer which was electric

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.280 
the Wonder washer which was electric
power<00:01:30.920> this<00:01:31.920> uses<00:01:32.760> a<00:01:32.850> hand<00:01:33.090> crank<00:01:33.480> instead<00:01:33.900> so

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
power this uses a hand crank instead so

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.570 
power this uses a hand crank instead so
I<00:01:34.320> guess<00:01:34.620> I'm<00:01:35.460> also<00:01:35.790> saving<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.300> electricity

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
I guess I'm also saving on electricity

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.340 
I guess I'm also saving on electricity
you<00:01:38.580> know<00:01:38.760> I<00:01:38.790> don't<00:01:39.060> pay<00:01:39.510> electricity<00:01:40.229> that's

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350

neat device the warm or hot water heats

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.890 
neat device the warm or hot water heats
the<00:02:00.570> air<00:02:00.830> inside<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:01.890> vessel<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.820> creates<00:02:03.780> a

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
the air inside the vessel and creates a

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.280 
the air inside the vessel and creates a
pressure<00:02:04.220> and<00:02:05.220> forces<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.149> water<00:02:06.330> in<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
pressure and forces the water in the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.460 
pressure and forces the water in the
detergent<00:02:08.239> into<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.570> clothes<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.140> clean<00:02:10.350> it

detergent into the clothes to clean it

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.460 
detergent into the clothes to clean it
now<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.610> that's<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.360> tight<00:02:12.660> I'm<00:02:13.200> going<00:02:13.410> to

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
now that that's on tight I'm going to

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.520 
now that that's on tight I'm going to
spin<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.770> for<00:02:14.010> about<00:02:14.070> two<00:02:14.430> minutes<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:16.500> only

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
spin it for about two minutes the only

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.850 
spin it for about two minutes the only
downside<00:02:17.750> but<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:18.930> only<00:02:19.080> two<00:02:19.320> minutes<00:02:19.500> so

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
downside but it's only two minutes so

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.130 
downside but it's only two minutes so
it's<00:02:19.980> not<00:02:20.100> too<00:02:20.310> bad<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.850> like<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.600> stop<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.080> go

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
it's not too bad I like to stop and go

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.740 
it's not too bad I like to stop and go
the<00:02:22.290> other<00:02:22.410> way<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:24.920> give<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.040> clues<00:02:26.750> going

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
the other way and give the clues going

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.140 
the other way and give the clues going
back<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.140> forth<00:02:28.410> there<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:29.760> way<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:29.940> know<00:02:30.120> to

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
back and forth there the way I know to

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.840 
back and forth there the way I know to
get<00:02:30.450> nice<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.780> clean<00:02:34.400> now<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.549> would<00:02:35.730> be<00:02:35.820> a

great time if you had beer plus one or

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.110 
great time if you had beer plus one or
something<00:02:40.380> like<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:42.440> it's<00:02:43.440> not<00:02:43.620> required<00:02:44.120> if

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
something like that it's not required if

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.479 
something like that it's not required if
I<00:02:45.269> got<00:02:45.450> spin<00:02:45.720> this<00:02:45.870> for<00:02:46.049> two<00:02:46.200> minutes<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.860> need

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
I got spin this for two minutes I need

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.840 
I got spin this for two minutes I need
something<00:02:48.950> now<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.010> legs<00:02:50.310> are<00:02:50.519> a<00:02:50.549> little

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
something now the legs are a little

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.930 
something now the legs are a little
flimsy<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.420> made<00:02:51.570> of<00:02:51.660> plastic<00:02:52.820> haven't<00:02:53.820> had

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
flimsy the made of plastic haven't had

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.580 
flimsy the made of plastic haven't had
any<00:02:54.030> problems<00:02:54.420> yet<00:02:54.630> but<00:02:55.110> it's<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.380> pretty

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
any problems yet but it's a pretty

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.949 
any problems yet but it's a pretty
simple<00:02:55.830> design<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:57.000> if<00:02:57.090> they<00:02:57.209> did<00:02:57.390> break<00:02:57.630> I<00:02:57.930> can

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
simple design so if they did break I can

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.530 
simple design so if they did break I can
see<00:02:58.320> easily<00:02:58.950> going<00:02:59.370> down<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.880> depot<00:03:00.239> and

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
see easily going down to the depot and

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.190 
see easily going down to the depot and
pick<00:03:01.470> up<00:03:01.650> something<00:03:02.150> but<00:03:03.150> so<00:03:03.720> far<00:03:03.989> it's<00:03:04.170> been

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
pick up something but so far it's been

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.100 
pick up something but so far it's been
great<00:03:04.350> I<00:03:05.360> don't<00:03:06.360> think<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.540> how<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.750> spin<00:03:06.989> this

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
great I don't think I how to spin this

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.720 
great I don't think I how to spin this
for<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.380> full<00:03:07.560> two<00:03:07.830> minutes<00:03:08.040> because<00:03:08.370> I

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
for the full two minutes because I

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.390 
for the full two minutes because I
really<00:03:09.209> think<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.480> get<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.720> point

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
I've been doing this on the ground just

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.750 
I've been doing this on the ground just
so<00:03:18.239> that<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.450> can<00:03:18.599> see<00:03:18.840> how<00:03:19.050> it<00:03:19.110> works<00:03:19.550> so<00:03:20.550> now

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
so that you can see how it works so now

I'm going to move over to the sink which

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:34.580 
I'm going to move over to the sink which
is<00:03:22.800> area<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.489> recommend<00:03:24.000> doing<00:03:24.720> this

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.640 

is<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.190> not<00:03:35.340> got<00:03:35.550> by<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.819> sink<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:37.200> comes<00:03:37.500> with

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
I've been doing is just adding some cold

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.509 
I've been doing is just adding some cold
water<00:04:03.569> and<00:04:03.810> spinning<00:04:04.200> it<00:04:04.349> for<00:04:04.620> about<00:04:04.709> 30

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
water and spinning it for about 30

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.240 
water and spinning it for about 30
seconds<00:04:05.970> or<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:06.360> it<00:04:07.170> seems<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.530> be<00:04:07.650> removing

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
seconds or so it seems to be removing

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.390 
seconds or so it seems to be removing
all<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.670> detergent<00:04:09.269> from<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.540> clothing<00:04:10.400> if

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
all the detergent from the clothing if

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.820 
all the detergent from the clothing if

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
you had a heat dryer you might want to

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.360 
you had a heat dryer you might want to
consider<00:04:14.190> washing<00:04:14.549> my<00:04:14.880> hand<00:04:15.330> to<00:04:15.750> remove<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.370> so

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
consider washing my hand to remove it so

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.250 
consider washing my hand to remove it so
it<00:04:17.459> doesn't<00:04:17.729> get<00:04:17.850> cooked<00:04:18.060> into<00:04:18.329> the<00:04:18.630> clothes<00:04:18.900> I

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.310 
it doesn't get cooked into the clothes I
use<00:04:19.829> a<00:04:19.859> spin<00:04:20.220> dryer<00:04:20.519> so<00:04:21.150> any<00:04:21.540> water<00:04:21.840> remaining
