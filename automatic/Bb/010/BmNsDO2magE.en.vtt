00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
about recording drums and how you can do

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.439 
about recording drums and how you can do
that<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.230> budget<00:00:20.000> one<00:00:21.000> thing<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.300> really

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
that on a budget one thing you really

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.210 
that on a budget one thing you really
need<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.779> consider<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.800> sound<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
need to consider is the sound of the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.920 
need to consider is the sound of the
room<00:00:23.369> you're<00:00:23.550> recording<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.630> spend

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
room you're recording in you can spend

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.359 
room you're recording in you can spend
all<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.289> money<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.619> world<00:00:25.650> on<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.189> best

all the money in the world on the best
drums<00:00:26.699> heads<00:00:27.390> microphones<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:29.220> name<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.580> you

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
drums heads microphones you name it you

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.999 
drums heads microphones you name it you
can<00:00:29.910> buy<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.210> but<00:00:30.840> if<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.109> room<00:00:31.320> sounds<00:00:31.740> bad

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
can buy it but if the room sounds bad

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.709 
can buy it but if the room sounds bad
your<00:00:32.430> recording<00:00:32.880> will<00:00:32.910> sound<00:00:33.270> bad

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
your recording will sound bad

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.350 
your recording will sound bad
so<00:00:34.110> sometimes<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:34.860> worth<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.360> rooting

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
so sometimes it's worth just rooting

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.549 
so sometimes it's worth just rooting
around<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.750> seeing<00:00:36.870> if<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.079> can<00:00:37.230> find<00:00:37.380> some

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
around and seeing if you can find some

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.950 
around and seeing if you can find some
old<00:00:37.710> duvets<00:00:38.190> mattresses<00:00:38.820> whatever<00:00:39.149> else<00:00:39.420> to

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
old duvets mattresses whatever else to

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.930 
old duvets mattresses whatever else to
put<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.320> room<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.710> try<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.070> break<00:00:41.550> up<00:00:41.730> some

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
put in the room to try and break up some

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.880 
put in the room to try and break up some
of<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> sound<00:00:42.360> put<00:00:43.140> some<00:00:43.320> stuff<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.649> there<00:00:43.739> to

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
of the sound put some stuff in there to

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.770 
of the sound put some stuff in there to
absorb<00:00:44.160> some<00:00:44.399> frequencies<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.480> will<00:00:45.690> do

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
absorb some frequencies and that will do

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.270 
absorb some frequencies and that will do
wonders<00:00:46.020> for<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> sound<00:00:46.680> quality<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.100> your

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
wonders for the sound quality of your

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.389 
wonders for the sound quality of your
recording<00:00:47.960> okay<00:00:48.960> now<00:00:49.170> for<00:00:49.530> my<00:00:49.710> own<00:00:49.860> methods

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
recording okay now for my own methods

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.700 
recording okay now for my own methods
they<00:00:50.820> I've<00:00:51.149> really<00:00:51.629> got<00:00:51.750> two<00:00:51.960> main<00:00:52.289> ways<00:00:52.500> of

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
they I've really got two main ways of

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.950 
they I've really got two main ways of
recording<00:00:52.860> drums<00:00:53.309> there's<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.180> closed<00:00:54.449> miking

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
recording drums there's a closed miking

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.290 
recording drums there's a closed miking
technique<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.100> distance<00:00:56.550> miking

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
technique and the distance miking

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.720 
technique and the distance miking
technique<00:00:57.809> now<00:00:58.590> close<00:00:58.829> miking<00:00:59.340> means<00:00:59.550> that

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
technique now close miking means that

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.240 
technique now close miking means that
each<00:00:59.850> drum<00:01:00.180> will<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> mic<00:01:00.719> close<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.649> so

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
each drum will have a mic close to it so

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.799 
each drum will have a mic close to it so
that<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.609> one<00:01:02.850> microphone<00:01:03.359> will<00:01:03.539> pick<00:01:03.570> up

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
that that one microphone will pick up

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.289 
that that one microphone will pick up
the<00:01:03.930> one<00:01:04.140> drum<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.650> pointed<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.339> now<00:01:05.820> usually

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
the one drum is pointed to now usually

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.660 
the one drum is pointed to now usually
on<00:01:06.420> drums<00:01:06.689> we'd<00:01:07.110> use<00:01:07.380> dynamic<00:01:08.130> microphones

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
on drums we'd use dynamic microphones

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.700 
on drums we'd use dynamic microphones
although<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.330> use<00:01:09.360> condensers<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.470> for

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
although you can use condensers and for

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.289 
although you can use condensers and for
some<00:01:10.920> cases<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.760> might<00:01:11.939> be<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.150> sound

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
some cases that might be the sound

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.230 
some cases that might be the sound
you're<00:01:12.479> looking<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.890> as<00:01:13.890> well<00:01:14.280> as<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.640> you

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
you're looking for as well as that you

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.390 
you're looking for as well as that you
would<00:01:15.420> then<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.799> overhead<00:01:16.799> condenser

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
would then have overhead condenser

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.010 
would then have overhead condenser
microphones<00:01:17.909> now<00:01:18.150> these<00:01:18.270> are<00:01:18.479> pickup<00:01:18.780> all<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
microphones now these are pickup all the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.749 
microphones now these are pickup all the
cymbals<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.710> general<00:01:20.070> sound<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> kit

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
cymbals and a general sound of the kit

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.710 
cymbals and a general sound of the kit
and<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.030> gives<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.420> bit<00:01:21.600> more<00:01:21.810> life<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:23.720> kind

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
and it gives it a bit more life and kind

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.840 
and it gives it a bit more life and kind
of<00:01:24.810> character<00:01:25.350> than<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.159> have<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
of character than if you just have the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.749 
of character than if you just have the
drum<00:01:27.119> microphones<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.869> run<00:01:28.759> distance

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
drum microphones on the run distance

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.600 
drum microphones on the run distance
miking<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:31.200> would<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.860> overhead

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
miking you would have the overhead

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.490 
miking you would have the overhead
condenser<00:01:33.119> microphones<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.900> same<00:01:34.140> way<00:01:34.320> as

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
condenser microphones in the same way as

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.660 
condenser microphones in the same way as
close<00:01:34.979> miking<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:37.170> would<00:01:37.320> have

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
close miking but then you would have

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.300 
close miking but then you would have
maybe<00:01:38.670> one<00:01:38.939> more<00:01:39.150> large<00:01:39.509> diaphragm<00:01:39.960> condenser

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
maybe one more large diaphragm condenser

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.580 
maybe one more large diaphragm condenser
microphone<00:01:41.310> low<00:01:42.150> down<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.659> maybe<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.140> meter<00:01:43.380> or

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
microphone low down and maybe a meter or

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.590 
microphone low down and maybe a meter or
two<00:01:43.619> away<00:01:43.860> from<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.340> drum<00:01:44.520> kit<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.850> front<00:01:45.119> to

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
two away from the drum kit in front to

on<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.890> budget<00:01:56.270> what<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.299> would<00:01:57.570> say<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.840> rather

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
on a budget what I would say is rather

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.109

than<00:01:58.259> go<00:01:58.409> out<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.710> buy<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.369> cheapest<00:01:59.880> set<00:02:00.000> of

I only have a couple of mics there are a

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.760 
I only have a couple of mics there are a
rubella<00:02:12.190> with<00:02:12.370> better<00:02:12.580> quality<00:02:13.110> than<00:02:14.110> the

mics when you buy a set of seven why I

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.770 
mics when you buy a set of seven why I
would<00:02:17.140> recommend<00:02:17.310> would<00:02:18.310> be<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:18.700> use<00:02:18.940> two

would recommend would be to use two

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
but you know if maybe your budgets

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.120 
but you know if maybe your budgets
limited<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.320> can't<00:02:44.560> afford<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.890> lot<00:02:45.040> of

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
limited and you can't afford a lot of

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.670 
limited and you can't afford a lot of
mics<00:02:45.340> or<00:02:45.670> if<00:02:46.600> you've<00:02:46.870> only<00:02:46.959> got<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.230> little<00:02:47.560> bit

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
mics or if you've only got a little bit

technique<00:02:53.410> works<00:02:53.739> really<00:02:54.070> nicely<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.550> get

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
technique works really nicely and get

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.060 
technique works really nicely and get
some<00:02:54.820> great<00:02:55.000> results<00:02:55.380> one<00:02:56.380> microphone<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:57.040> I

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
some great results one microphone that I

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.280 
some great results one microphone that I
think<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.430> fantastic<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:59.489> the<00:03:00.489> CM<00:03:00.970> 70<00:03:01.600> fifty<00:03:01.989> be

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
think is fantastic is the CM 70 fifty be

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.530 
think is fantastic is the CM 70 fifty be

this<00:03:25.989> case<00:03:26.610> we<00:03:27.610> take<00:03:27.820> off<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.150> sleeve<00:03:28.360> you<00:03:28.600> can

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
this case we take off the sleeve you can

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.390 
this case we take off the sleeve you can
see<00:03:28.930> that<00:03:29.110> it's<00:03:29.260> well<00:03:29.410> protected<00:03:29.769> in<00:03:30.070> a<00:03:30.220> hard

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
see that it's well protected in a hard

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.940 
see that it's well protected in a hard
case<00:03:33.930> opening<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.019> case<00:03:35.200> up<00:03:35.470> you<00:03:35.680> can<00:03:35.830> see

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
case opening the case up you can see

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.590 
case opening the case up you can see
that<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.160> microphones<00:03:36.670> kept<00:03:37.000> really<00:03:37.330> nicely

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
that the microphones kept really nicely

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.080 
that the microphones kept really nicely
in<00:03:38.080> load<00:03:38.890> of<00:03:39.010> foam<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.519> stop<00:03:39.730> it<00:03:39.880> from<00:03:40.030> moving

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
in load of foam to stop it from moving

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.810 
in load of foam to stop it from moving
around<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:41.170> absorb<00:03:41.470> shock<00:03:41.739> that's<00:03:42.459> really

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
around and to absorb shock that's really

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.100 
around and to absorb shock that's really
important<00:03:43.209> because<00:03:43.299> it's<00:03:43.600> very<00:03:43.660> very

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
important because it's very very

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.870 
important because it's very very
important<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.680> look<00:03:44.799> after<00:03:44.980> microphones<00:03:45.670> but

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
important to look after microphones but

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.699 
important to look after microphones but
especially<00:03:46.200> condenser<00:03:47.200> microphones<00:03:49.560> this<00:03:50.560> is

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
especially condenser microphones this is

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.680 
especially condenser microphones this is
a<00:03:50.739> mic<00:03:50.980> itself<00:03:51.400> it's<00:03:52.150> got<00:03:52.299> an<00:03:52.420> on/off<00:03:52.660> switch

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
a mic itself it's got an on/off switch

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.289 
a mic itself it's got an on/off switch
which<00:03:53.320> some<00:03:54.040> people<00:03:54.340> might<00:03:54.489> think<00:03:54.519> why

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
which some people might think why

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.940 
which some people might think why
because<00:03:55.810> a<00:03:55.840> lot<00:03:56.019> of<00:03:56.049> microphones<00:03:56.560> don't<00:03:56.769> have

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
because a lot of microphones don't have

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.130 
because a lot of microphones don't have
that<00:03:57.160> but<00:03:58.120> this<00:03:58.269> is<00:03:58.480> really<00:03:58.690> really<00:03:58.810> good

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
that but this is really really good

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.140 
that but this is really really good
because<00:03:59.380> this<00:03:59.650> particular<00:04:00.010> microphone<00:04:03.150> we

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
because this particular microphone we

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
because this particular microphone we
unscrew<00:04:04.480> it<00:04:04.799> can<00:04:05.799> take<00:04:05.980> a<00:04:06.010> battery<00:04:07.170> condenser

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
unscrew it can take a battery condenser

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.550 
unscrew it can take a battery condenser
microphones<00:04:08.680> need<00:04:08.980> power<00:04:09.489> now<00:04:10.360> usually<00:04:11.290> you

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
microphones need power now usually you

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.110 
microphones need power now usually you
will<00:04:11.860> have<00:04:12.010> a<00:04:12.040> mixer<00:04:12.430> or<00:04:12.549> something<00:04:12.579> like<00:04:12.910> that

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
will have a mixer or something like that

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.509 
will have a mixer or something like that
where<00:04:13.299> you<00:04:13.420> can<00:04:13.570> supply<00:04:14.010> phantom<00:04:15.010> power<00:04:15.250> which

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
where you can supply phantom power which

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.659 
where you can supply phantom power which
is<00:04:15.730> plus<00:04:16.120> 48<00:04:16.540> volts<00:04:17.079> but<00:04:17.680> if<00:04:17.950> you<00:04:18.130> don't<00:04:18.400> have

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
is plus 48 volts but if you don't have

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.360 
is plus 48 volts but if you don't have
something<00:04:19.090> with<00:04:19.239> phantom<00:04:19.599> power<00:04:20.280> then<00:04:21.280> you

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
something with phantom power then you

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.230 
something with phantom power then you
can<00:04:21.549> pop<00:04:21.760> a<00:04:21.789> battery<00:04:22.240> in<00:04:22.740> screw<00:04:23.740> it<00:04:23.830> up<00:04:23.950> and

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
can pop a battery in screw it up and

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.060 
can pop a battery in screw it up and
you're<00:04:25.240> good<00:04:25.360> to<00:04:25.390> go<00:04:25.510> and<00:04:26.470> that's<00:04:26.710> why<00:04:27.010> the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
you're good to go and that's why the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.350 
you're good to go and that's why the
on/off<00:04:27.550> switch<00:04:27.760> is<00:04:27.789> really<00:04:28.120> important

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
on/off switch is really important

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.520 
on/off switch is really important
because<00:04:28.450> it<00:04:28.599> can<00:04:28.660> stop<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:28.930> battery<00:04:29.320> running

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
because it can stop the battery running

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.490 
because it can stop the battery running
down<00:04:29.830> if<00:04:30.070> you're<00:04:30.340> using<00:04:30.610> in<00:04:31.060> that<00:04:31.090> way<00:04:31.630> the

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
down if you're using in that way the

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.630 
down if you're using in that way the
other<00:04:32.650> thing<00:04:32.860> that's<00:04:32.979> quite<00:04:33.250> good<00:04:33.280> about

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
other thing that's quite good about

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.790 
other thing that's quite good about
having<00:04:33.849> a<00:04:34.030> battery<00:04:34.270> is<00:04:34.690> that<00:04:35.380> generally

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
having a battery is that generally

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.460 
having a battery is that generally
speaking<00:04:35.830> when<00:04:36.669> you<00:04:36.760> mic<00:04:36.940> up<00:04:37.210> anything<00:04:38.050> the

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
speaking when you mic up anything the

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.350 
speaking when you mic up anything the
microphones<00:04:39.070> will<00:04:39.430> be<00:04:39.520> on<00:04:39.640> those<00:04:39.760> three<00:04:40.120> pins

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
microphones will be on those three pins

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.040 
microphones will be on those three pins
there<00:04:40.660> which<00:04:41.260> is<00:04:41.380> an<00:04:41.500> XLR<00:04:42.099> lead<00:04:42.520> now<00:04:43.300> phantom

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
there which is an XLR lead now phantom

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.080

an<00:04:51.010> XLR<00:04:51.460> lead<00:04:52.169> now<00:04:53.169> if<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:53.979> don't<00:04:54.220> have<00:04:54.430> any

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
an XLR lead now if you don't have any

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.580 
an XLR lead now if you don't have any
Excel<00:04:55.090> ours<00:04:55.240> but<00:04:55.419> maybe<00:04:55.570> you've<00:04:55.720> got<00:04:55.870> XLR<00:04:56.349> to

Excel ours but maybe you've got XLR to
Jack<00:04:56.890> so<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.729> other<00:04:57.880> end<00:04:58.120> of<00:04:58.210> its<00:04:58.390> like<00:04:58.870> what

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
Jack so the other end of its like what

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.570 
Jack so the other end of its like what
you<00:04:59.229> put<00:04:59.410> into<00:04:59.530> a<00:04:59.620> guitar<00:04:59.979> or<00:05:00.010> something<00:05:00.490> like

that

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.450 
that
then<00:05:01.810> you<00:05:02.140> can<00:05:02.289> use<00:05:02.410> the<00:05:02.560> battery<00:05:03.010> for<00:05:03.370> the

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
then you can use the battery for the

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.940 
then you can use the battery for the
power<00:05:03.669> and<00:05:03.940> still<00:05:04.660> get<00:05:04.900> a<00:05:04.930> good<00:05:05.200> clear<00:05:05.560> sound

can put on your cymbal stand so your

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.440 
can put on your cymbal stand so your

great<00:05:39.010> microphone<00:05:39.580> from<00:05:39.760> Stagg<00:05:40.120> is<00:05:40.330> the<00:05:40.539> diem

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
great microphone from Stagg is the diem

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.029 
great microphone from Stagg is the diem
50:10<00:05:41.650> this<00:05:42.490> is<00:05:42.669> based<00:05:43.000> on<00:05:43.210> microphone<00:05:44.039> and

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
50:10 this is based on microphone and

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:46.680 
50:10 this is based on microphone and
the<00:05:45.370> reason<00:05:45.610> it<00:05:45.700> works<00:05:45.820> best<00:05:46.090> for<00:05:46.180> bass<00:05:46.450> is

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
the reason it works best for bass is

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.110 
the reason it works best for bass is
because<00:05:47.140> it's<00:05:47.289> frequency<00:05:47.680> range<00:05:48.130> can<00:05:48.729> go<00:05:48.880> very

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
because it's frequency range can go very

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.730 
because it's frequency range can go very
very<00:05:49.180> low<00:05:49.510> it<00:05:49.659> can<00:05:49.720> go<00:05:49.870> all<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.050> way<00:05:50.229> down<00:05:50.440> to

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
very low it can go all the way down to

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.580 
very low it can go all the way down to
20<00:05:51.280> Hertz<00:05:51.460> and<00:05:51.849> all<00:05:52.479> the<00:05:52.570> way<00:05:52.659> up<00:05:52.840> to<00:05:53.349> 10

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
20 Hertz and all the way up to 10

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.430 
20 Hertz and all the way up to 10
kilohertz<00:05:53.979> to<00:05:54.190> 10,000<00:05:54.760> minutes<00:05:55.380> this<00:05:56.380> is

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
kilohertz to 10,000 minutes this is

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.080 
kilohertz to 10,000 minutes this is
especially<00:05:56.860> important<00:05:57.340> for<00:05:57.370> a<00:05:57.460> bass<00:05:57.580> drum<00:05:57.880> or

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
especially important for a bass drum or

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.880 
especially important for a bass drum or
other<00:05:58.390> bass<00:05:58.599> instruments<00:05:59.200> you<00:05:59.349> can<00:05:59.380> use<00:05:59.680> this

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
other bass instruments you can use this

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.490 
other bass instruments you can use this
to<00:06:00.310> mic<00:06:00.490> up<00:06:00.700> bass<00:06:01.000> amps<00:06:01.690> as<00:06:01.870> well<00:06:02.110> if<00:06:02.320> you're

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
to mic up bass amps as well if you're

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.110 
to mic up bass amps as well if you're
recording

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
recording

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
like that it's the same idea as the

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.620 
like that it's the same idea as the
condensers<00:06:08.700> in<00:06:08.850> the<00:06:08.910> way<00:06:09.030> it's<00:06:09.180> packaged

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.600 
condensers in the way it's packaged
you've<00:06:09.930> got<00:06:10.200> the<00:06:10.320> hardshell<00:06:10.800> case<00:06:11.100> with<00:06:11.490> the

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
you've got the hardshell case with the

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.280 
you've got the hardshell case with the
foam<00:06:11.820> inner<00:06:12.180> so<00:06:12.660> it's<00:06:12.780> very<00:06:12.900> well<00:06:13.110> protected

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290
