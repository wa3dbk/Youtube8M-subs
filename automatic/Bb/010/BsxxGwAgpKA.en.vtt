 Today we are already making Christmas decorations 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:10.800
 for the christmas tree 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:14.929
 This looks like cardboard was made of paper 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:20.369
 Thick paper is paper for example 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:22.850

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.850
 Christmas tree 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.289
 you need for it 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.750
 Here I pressed that is almost 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:38.059

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:42.690
 then have a gyro then you need 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:48.950
 Father in different colors never drive 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:52.469
 and a needle nÃ¤hnadel a strengths 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:57.750
 I want to be able to do anything you like 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:06.049
 Let's go here now 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.049

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:56.810

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:59.610
 Actually you can take little erasing 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:07.020

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:11.190
 take it easy and well as the paper 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:19.310
 lets them longer a piece stops the 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.310
 thread and start to wake up 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:48.880

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:52.360

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.360

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:10.060

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.710

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.659

00:03:45.659 --> 00:04:02.459
 middle hangs but if we once them 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:04:05.609

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:10.980
