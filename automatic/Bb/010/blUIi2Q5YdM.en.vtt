and<00:03:01.900> built<00:03:02.410> this<00:03:02.709> platform<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.750> know

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
and built this platform that you know

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.860 
and built this platform that you know
they<00:03:05.020> hope<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.290> make<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:06.030> design<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.390> and

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
they hope to make the design and and

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.800 
they hope to make the design and and
development<00:03:08.560> of<00:03:08.650> apps<00:03:08.890> much<00:03:09.310> easier<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.090> you

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
development of apps much easier and you

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.650 
development of apps much easier and you
could<00:03:11.140> definitely<00:03:11.319> see<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:13.150> benefits

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
could definitely see the benefits

could definitely see the benefits
through<00:03:13.930> our<00:03:14.080> development<00:03:14.709> process<00:03:15.090> because

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
through our development process because

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.930 
through our development process because
it<00:03:17.319> was<00:03:17.590> nice<00:03:17.800> to<00:03:17.980> know<00:03:18.160> we<00:03:18.340> were<00:03:18.459> sitting<00:03:18.640> on<00:03:18.910> a

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
it was nice to know we were sitting on a

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.729 
it was nice to know we were sitting on a
very<00:03:19.030> solid<00:03:19.390> platform<00:03:20.050> that<00:03:20.200> they<00:03:20.350> had<00:03:20.530> built

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
very solid platform that they had built

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.300 
very solid platform that they had built
you<00:03:21.310> know<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.519> app<00:03:21.670> is<00:03:21.970> very<00:03:22.830> capable<00:03:23.830> at

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
you know the app is very capable at

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.250 
you know the app is very capable at
handling<00:03:24.790> a<00:03:24.880> ton<00:03:25.150> of<00:03:25.180> data<00:03:25.540> coming<00:03:25.870> in<00:03:26.080> for

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
handling a ton of data coming in for

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.990 
handling a ton of data coming in for
these<00:03:26.350> four<00:03:26.560> hundred<00:03:26.860> operas<00:03:27.250> all<00:03:27.459> of<00:03:27.880> the

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
these four hundred operas all of the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.360 
these four hundred operas all of the
metadata<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.780> they<00:03:29.380> built<00:03:29.620> on<00:03:29.769> top<00:03:30.010> of<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.310> a

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
metadata and they built on top of it a

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.100 
metadata and they built on top of it a
number<00:03:30.670> of<00:03:30.730> customizations<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.840> player

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
number of customizations to the player

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.470 
number of customizations to the player
so<00:03:32.709> that<00:03:32.860> we<00:03:32.950> can<00:03:33.130> offer<00:03:33.250> sort<00:03:34.000> of<00:03:34.060> add-on

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
so that we can offer sort of add-on

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.240 
so that we can offer sort of add-on
features<00:03:34.959> that<00:03:35.260> are<00:03:35.470> very<00:03:35.500> important<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.100> us

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
features that are very important to us

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.690 
features that are very important to us

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
like subtitles on all the videos and for

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.699 
like subtitles on all the videos and for
a<00:03:39.760> lot<00:03:39.880> of<00:03:39.970> our<00:03:40.060> recent<00:03:40.390> videos<00:03:40.690> subtitles<00:03:41.560> in

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
subscription service so the way the app

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.580 
subscription service so the way the app
works<00:03:46.269> is<00:03:46.569> that<00:03:46.780> it<00:03:46.959> is<00:03:47.110> free<00:03:47.319> to<00:03:47.440> download

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
works is that it is free to download

works is that it is free to download
from<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.340> App<00:03:48.610> Store<00:03:49.239> but<00:03:49.600> you<00:03:49.720> will<00:03:49.900> need<00:03:50.110> a

is probably how at least 50 60 % of our

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.660 
is probably how at least 50 60 % of our
audience<00:04:01.870> comes<00:04:02.110> in<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.350> door<00:04:02.530> we<00:04:03.130> through<00:04:03.610> a

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
audience comes in the door we through a

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.330 
audience comes in the door we through a
third-party<00:04:04.060> vendor<00:04:04.360> have<00:04:05.049> a<00:04:05.380> smaller<00:04:06.100> number

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
third-party vendor have a smaller number

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.220 
third-party vendor have a smaller number
of<00:04:06.519> titles<00:04:06.880> available<00:04:07.570> for<00:04:07.750> download<00:04:08.200> through

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
of titles available for download through

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.390 
of titles available for download through
iTunes<00:04:08.610> so<00:04:09.610> I<00:04:09.640> think<00:04:09.850> right<00:04:10.180> now<00:04:10.420> it<00:04:10.810> is<00:04:11.130> 10<00:04:12.130> of

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
iTunes so I think right now it is 10 of

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.509 
iTunes so I think right now it is 10 of
our<00:04:12.610> live<00:04:12.820> in<00:04:12.970> HD<00:04:13.090> performances<00:04:14.019> and

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
our live in HD performances and

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.449 
our live in HD performances and
somewhere<00:04:15.519> between<00:04:15.930> 15<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:16.959> 20<00:04:17.530> of<00:04:17.739> our<00:04:18.070> radio

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
somewhere between 15 and 20 of our radio

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.270 
somewhere between 15 and 20 of our radio
broadcast<00:04:18.780> performances<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:20.049> that<00:04:20.650> again<00:04:21.220> is
