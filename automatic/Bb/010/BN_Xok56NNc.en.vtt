matte lipsticks I find them easier to

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.130 
matte lipsticks I find them easier to
apply<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.799> they<00:01:23.460> stay<00:01:23.729> put<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:25.020> is

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
apply and just they stay put so this is
