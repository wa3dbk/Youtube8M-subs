 giving a little bit lost 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.039

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.450
 but good in the end this greeting them 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.210
 very single each list 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.509
 to your hand that pretty 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.869
 but good this 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.530
 what I wanted to comment and say everything 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.390
 that kind of thing good in itself 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.040
 As I had already told you my plan was 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.140
 keep raising the strikes and all that 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.070
 that they like so much has always 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.080
 liked 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.720
 and I 've also started thinking a little 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.670
 about what I think I feel that I already 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.979
 I fulfilled my mission on youtube that were 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.610
 be cover everything you could from gta 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.680
 5 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.600
 that before I already uploaded videos and everything 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.570
 that and good 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.840
 that's another story and well you know no 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.009
 there will always be those ipads people and 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:17.240
 the fucking mother 'fucking so much the 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:20.450
 kill fucking there is true 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.060
 the joke or what I'm telling you is that 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.640
 There are many people who say that my channel 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.700
 has a lot of inactive people and if true 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.650
 many of the times like this happens does not see you 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.350
 almost 10 20 percent of your 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.780
 subscribers on youtube and does not have 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.600
 absolutely nothing weird or is it like 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.190
 that a person signs up and you 're 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.790
 She forgot your password and never again 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.800
 put this in again a lot of 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.590
 things because then for the people who 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:54.400
 so much question of that then I teach them 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.400
 I was now you get text worth 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.060
 and it's not ending by that part 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.720
 but 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.970
 and now yes 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.520
 now we are going to focus on those that 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.880
 What I wanted to tell you is that it's what 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.260
 I will do after I return in 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.660
 youtube I think this is going to be the 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.990
 last video that I will upload up 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.920
 within 2 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:23.140
 at the most 23 weeks and then coming back 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.870
 maybe it took me about 34 more days 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.480
 leaving videos ready or doing 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.310
 videos 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.269
 and I think it would start to give rhythms with 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.340
 the channel again and again 1 2 3 in what 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.469
 that install me on the internet in what 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.049
 prepares the being and then after that 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:43.329
 prepare the zero I'm going to move again 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.540
 but it will be there in the same city or 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:49.469
 is going to be something x not the same day at 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.469
 next day I'm already 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.590
 Look, look, he's already throwing a lawsuit 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.110
 pass both 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.260
 then if it's going to be an inactive time 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.290
 that's not why I ask for your support and 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:08.890
 all that does not look look there is casting 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.890
 Click lawsuit is very small 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.090
 that I though 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.859
 pretty from wikileaks 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.669
 all right 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.669
 let's see 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:29.009
 and today my boy my little girl then this 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.550
 good 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:34.309
 because this in itself nothing else is that to tell you 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.430
 that I'm going to be inactive for a while 

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:41.039
 but I'm going to upload many things that I know 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.279
 you will like them all, you know misterix 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:46.409
 gameplays and those series with query that 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:48.310
 I want to do in follows the channel is going to 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:51.930
 to be 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.700
 quite active and then something else too 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.770
 I do not know why I have not done and I 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.980
 to follow the example of several others 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.440
 youtubers that is doing things sometimes 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.720
 without planning them as not thinking so much 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.310
 things and how is it that if I go up this 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.860
 video to the best and do not see it so much either 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.350
 about just doing it and if what 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:15.420
 you want to do and if you do it and upload it 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.420
 well and if not then also it is not 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.520
 it's fine and by the way I have a video 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.550
 out there consult that I have not published and 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.440
 I can post it so they can see that 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.130
 league of legends but then there is the serious 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:33.780

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.780
