we're going to put a half hitch as a

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.750 
we're going to put a half hitch as a
stop<00:00:36.450> knot<00:00:36.720> that<00:00:37.560> won't<00:00:37.800> go<00:00:38.400> through<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
stop knot that won't go through the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:51.700 
stop knot that won't go through the
Slipknot<00:00:39.060> as<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> good<00:00:39.810> starting<00:00:40.260> point

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.710 

and<00:00:51.800> we'll<00:00:52.430> cinch<00:00:52.730> it<00:00:52.880> down<00:00:52.910> nice<00:00:53.450> and<00:00:53.480> tight

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
and we'll cinch it down nice and tight

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.340 
and we'll cinch it down nice and tight
now<00:00:54.490> here<00:00:55.490> you<00:00:55.850> can<00:00:56.030> either<00:00:56.270> burn<00:00:56.660> this<00:00:56.990> tail

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
now here you can either burn this tail

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.910 
now here you can either burn this tail
off<00:00:57.760> or<00:00:58.760> as<00:00:59.270> you<00:00:59.989> can<00:01:00.140> see<00:01:00.350> in<00:01:00.470> this<00:01:00.560> video

we're<00:01:01.430> going<00:01:01.550> to<00:01:01.670> incorporate<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.810> tail

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
we're going to incorporate the tail

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.219 
we're going to incorporate the tail
along<00:01:03.980> our<00:01:04.220> work

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.910 

in<00:01:09.649> the<00:01:09.920> field<00:01:10.210> we<00:01:11.210> use<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:11.810> tool<00:01:12.560> called<00:01:12.590> the

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
in the field we use a tool called the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.950 
in the field we use a tool called the
needle<00:01:13.250> as<00:01:13.369> you<00:01:13.549> can<00:01:13.729> see<00:01:13.909> you<00:01:14.060> can<00:01:14.329> fill<00:01:14.689> it<00:01:14.869> up

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
needle as you can see you can fill it up

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.319 
needle as you can see you can fill it up
with<00:01:15.590> a<00:01:15.619> bunch<00:01:15.920> of<00:01:16.009> our<00:01:16.189> thread<00:01:16.640> around<00:01:17.180> or

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:17.329 
with a bunch of our thread around or

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.630 

and<00:01:23.120> then<00:01:23.240> we<00:01:23.360> come<00:01:23.570> over<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.960> top<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.640> we

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
and then we come over the top and we

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.730 
and then we come over the top and we
come<00:01:25.850> over<00:01:26.090> again<00:01:26.210> holding<00:01:26.870> on<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.260> second

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
come over again holding on to the second

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.430 
come over again holding on to the second
loop<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.160> we'll<00:01:28.910> do<00:01:29.480> the<00:01:29.630> same<00:01:29.660> thing<00:01:29.900> we'll

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
loop and we'll do the same thing we'll

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.100 
loop and we'll do the same thing we'll
twist<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.150> whatever<00:01:32.150> direction<00:01:32.690> you

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
twist it and whatever direction you

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.100 
twist it and whatever direction you
decide<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.740> twist<00:01:34.070> this<00:01:34.550> rope<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:35.600> needs<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.930> be

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
decide to twist this rope it needs to be

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.640 
decide to twist this rope it needs to be
kept<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:37.190> same<00:01:37.670> throughout<00:01:38.390> because<00:01:39.230> if<00:01:39.500> you

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
kept the same throughout because if you

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.680 
kept the same throughout because if you
twist<00:01:40.280> it<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.610> other<00:01:40.640> way<00:01:40.970> your<00:01:41.240> work<00:01:41.510> will

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
twist it the other way your work will

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.240 
twist it the other way your work will
actually<00:01:42.020> loosen<00:01:42.470> when<00:01:42.620> you<00:01:42.710> go<00:01:42.830> to<00:01:42.890> tighten

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
actually loosen when you go to tighten

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.700 
actually loosen when you go to tighten
it<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:43.610> you<00:01:43.670> got<00:01:43.910> to<00:01:44.030> keep<00:01:44.360> that<00:01:44.540> in<00:01:44.600> mind

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.600 

we<00:01:49.710> come<00:01:49.920> over<00:01:50.160> and<00:01:51.320> we<00:01:52.320> wrap<00:01:52.650> around<00:01:52.680> once<00:01:53.160> and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
we come over and we wrap around once and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.170 
we come over and we wrap around once and
pull<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> section<00:01:54.480> out<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.840> make<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> loop<00:01:55.800> and

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
pull a section out and make a loop and

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.440 
pull a section out and make a loop and
twist<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:58.580> we<00:01:59.580> bring<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.940> needle<00:02:00.090> back

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
twist it and we bring the needle back

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:17.940 
twist it and we bring the needle back
through<00:02:00.480> the<00:02:00.840> loop<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:02.660> cinch<00:02:03.660> it<00:02:03.840> tight

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.620

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.790 
your same slip knot and half hitch as a
stop<00:02:58.550> knot<00:02:58.810> so<00:02:59.810> you<00:02:59.900> can<00:03:00.050> cinch<00:03:00.320> your<00:03:00.560> first

knot nice and tight now you continue

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.520 
knot nice and tight now you continue
with<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.700> same<00:03:07.910> method<00:03:08.360> as<00:03:08.720> we<00:03:08.990> did<00:03:09.020> earlier

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
with the same method as we did earlier

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.360 
with the same method as we did earlier
wrapping<00:03:10.520> around<00:03:11.800> holding<00:03:12.800> onto<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.160> loop

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
wrapping around holding onto the loop

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.000 
wrapping around holding onto the loop
twisting<00:03:14.000> it<00:03:14.150> one<00:03:14.390> direction<00:03:14.860> putting<00:03:15.860> the

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
needle through cinching it up nice and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:31.380 
needle through cinching it up nice and
tight

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.450 

and<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:32.050> keep<00:03:32.230> this<00:03:32.410> method<00:03:32.830> up<00:03:32.950> until<00:03:33.370> you

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
and you keep this method up until you

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.920 
and you keep this method up until you
get<00:03:33.610> to<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.910> point<00:03:34.120> where<00:03:34.330> you<00:03:34.390> want<00:03:34.570> to<00:03:34.660> stop

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
and you will terminate it the same way

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.020 
and you will terminate it the same way
