00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.529
 but my ago acer also has one 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.530
 another between announced licking jake 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.110
 and that you both get the more premium appearance 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.060
 must have for is a device with 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.410
 pretty good specifications but it 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.140
 is clearly not yet a competitor for the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.460
 be really top devices are one 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.429
 go the extra mile on appearance 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.050
 but that is also personal again 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:28.470
 but my question is pretty strong 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.550
 9 in shape to the galaxy s3 or something of van 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.040
 samsung 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.760
 but there are also some differences 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.840
 off device 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.270
 I said it looks a bit like that 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.460
 samsung so much plastic but it looks 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.080
 very nicely finished from very smooth 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.790
 especially and what is nice about the 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.080
 edges of the screen it also runs one 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.020
 little had to come down a bit 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.550
 that feels best when she can 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.020
 roundness too 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.930
 a camera that is a tiny bit 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.870
 protruding but all in all it looks 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.250
 okay if you like plastic wood 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.010
 the screen looks pretty good again 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.900
 but it is not a top resolution 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.520
 as you really come very close then you will 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.990
 You do see that that is also clearly better 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.100
 sharp him as look at small 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.960
 print 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.340
 the colors are beautiful it looks 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.170
 pretty clear 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.630
 and see how it works pretty well so 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.609
 in short, screen is good 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.159
 The front camera has a 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:20.020
 2 megapixel camera for the selfies 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.969
 look pretty okay those from those squares 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.880
 and you can have a 13 megapixel 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:26.140
 camera with auto focus and LED flash 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.850
 what at home is still lacking in the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.939
 back because we we the cheaper 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.740
 model to see the z500 is the clock 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.240
 to make those prints if you have a cell 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.530
 make video that is 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.740
 this is not a pity 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.740
 actually 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.560
 how much about inside has a canal 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.670
 becomes a processor that works at 1.3 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.799
 gert 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.289
 we go once dedicated and working memory 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.539
 and 8 gigabytes for storing files yourself 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.829
 stand or fall and there equal 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.369
 And in addition you can add some memory 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.200
 expand with a micro sd cards at 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.909
 the smartphones from acer will be there anyway 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.439
 delivered something nice and very hot and 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.840
 equally xtend 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.759
 what does that mean remember it 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.679
 device that shows a normal screen 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.259
 but the screen on so suppose you can 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:11.769
 also on your desktop or on your laptop PC 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.299
 can show and that can be up to 100 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.069
 are like your device lying naked but 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.630
 where someone concentrated on the village 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.739
 look at the screen and you want anyway 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.799
 somewhere in a corner 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.750
 see what happens on your phone a 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.609
 another scenario is now some people 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.069
 nice to use whatsapp but that 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.810
 only works on phones but now you would 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.000
 so that whatsapp message can be there 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.730
 make and 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.870
 one laser on your laptop screen other 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.270
 Nice thing is if you have one 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.890
 file on your computer then you can 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.770
 just in the window 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.590
 drag from your smartphone and then your 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.550
 put the file on your smartphone 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.590
 the way the connection is established 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.410
 came is still very special 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.060
 do not use bluetooth or nfc where the 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.400
 about four years I now sound whole 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.390
 high sound that gives in these patents 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.040
 to be 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.520
 once the connection is made then it goes 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.470
 the rest continue with wifi connection 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.410
 this acer extend function that works with 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.440
 every acer smartphone and that makes it further 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.750
 no matter what brand of laptop you use 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.120
 conclusion it is pretty pretty and 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.540
 sleek-looking device nice and light and beautiful 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.610
 thin and i think for price point he 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.540
 nice plan compete with others 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.590
 devices 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.930
 we have to wait for her how 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.760
 that really comes from the test especially the 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.250
 Battery life think we are concerned about the 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.200
 battery inside is not that big 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.180
 every budget is available from 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.320
 this month of September for a price of 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.320
 around 280 euros
