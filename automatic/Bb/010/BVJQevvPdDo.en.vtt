00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hi everyone knows beat morning 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.029
 so as you could see in the 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.220
 title today we find ourselves for 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.940
 a video recruitment of the team n 21 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:17.180
 so I'm going for this recruitment because we 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:20.189
 is more likely to be active so 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.779
 so that's why I'm doing 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.609
 this little recruitment video I hope 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.670
 that some find are going to be 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.730
 interested and so as you can the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.420
 see 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.030
 as visual support I put a species 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.970
 from list so in this list and 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.590
 learn a skype gamertag call them 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.230
 you own youtube channel one 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.520
 finally I made a list is actually 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.510
 for people who wish 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.540
 recruit the N21 is simple 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.059
 you have to send a private message with 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.120
 precisely this list and the answers 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.769
 some of these questions will say even if 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.460
 it's not really good questions 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:03.449
 formulated finally respond to these species of 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.399
 two questions in private message 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.530
 so to send a private message and 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.440
 it's very simple you can go on 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.570
 my chain is normally on the side 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.900
 right of the channel wanted to make a 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.909
 finally send a private message to the 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.540
 person from the chain or just 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.960
 marked the name made send back message is 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.220
 the name of the string so my string is 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.860
 below the video 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.570
 So here you send me for 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.050
 people who want to participate in this 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.320
 recruitment 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.000
 you see me the answers so I 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.740
 will give an example for example 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.940
 first name you call xavier gamertag I 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:53.420
 do not know we're going to tell her she and m 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:57.170
 gilles matter what age or age I regret 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.479
 for example 15 years skype the skate you 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.479
 have the call of that you have so 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.149
 that's why we can say that 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.539
 can play even if we are still 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:11.570
 more about black ops 2 and that's good 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.730
 also to have other call of duty the 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.010
 youtube channel where he or she does it by 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.750
 against it does not matter if you 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.750
 have a youtube channel specified the if 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.670
 you do not have these parks savard 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.580
 unchanged but these are the stories of 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.599
 that I can pass on the channel if 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.890
 you have one to see your work 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.840
 your finally here is what 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.420
 to see the person you are all 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.730
 just the time of play not in 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.580
 week 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.540
 so that's to say on weekdays it's at 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.030
 say on monday 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.690
 how many hours of play you can 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.060
 finally do it's a little bit 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.920
 must tell me globally end that 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.160
 week how long do you play and 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.090
 the weekend when I say type of player 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.090
 so types of players it's very simple 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.830
 basically tell me if you like me 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.230
 played there that he made lucky the goal 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.590
 that's what you're basically 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.160
 their assault then the ratio I prefer 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.980
 to prevent it is not important 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:25.750
 when I ask the ratio is when 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.150
 even here to be based 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.570
 if anyone wants to be recruited and he 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.240
 at 0.10 ratio it's going to be complicated 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.910
 understands but it's not because 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.430
 someone will have 52 ratio that he will have more 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:44.170
 chances to be recruited that a guy who 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.970
 at 1.60 that the ratio I assure you we are 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.450
 a tim lane retains it's more of a team 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.610
 fun 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.260
 there are some people who want 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.520
 to do which fidh if they want 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.430
 to make the little eva girl who 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.540
 take the snipe is who who who do 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.250
 from there that he did while the others 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.310
 are there but treats but there is no 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.360
 worry with at this level there is if you 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.650
 want to do that he did you 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.600
 do the right thing if you want 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.100
 to play with machine guns and play 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.430
 the goal or make sentences ya not 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.940
 of problem so the ratio is not 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.240
 really important and then good 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.880
 if anyone has a ratio wine is that 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.530
 just after he answers me in the arms 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.080
 most used in black ops the and 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.000
 which puts that snipers a wine the ratio 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.320
 it's still okay if we play 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.470
 scared cosnac that's for sure so you 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.260
 do not worry about the ratio 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.720
 that's really to be sure 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.230
 not recruit a person who at 0.10 of 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.760
 breed pipes that do not understand too much this 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.640
 happening in white on black ops by 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.140
 example or call of simply 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.350
 so here are the weapons that most 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.670
 used in black ops 2 so you 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.490
 can go watch your stats 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.010
 black of the and me marc went five 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.110
 six most used weapons good if you 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.390
 can I put 10 a good this 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.510
 depends the ranking of the angles with 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:06.980
 which ones you have more fragment what and 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:11.940
 then I put more so the more that 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:14.430
 you to mark something that 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.530
 that you think that interested me or 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.150
 because in fact I explained to you I 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.980
 am not the only one to read I will not be 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.410
 the only one to read all your applications 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.670
 tell all the people who are 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.760
 quite active in the team 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.750
 so I think of wallace n 21 I think that 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.800
 frieze xn 21 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:34.500
 I think of rip n 21 good after that's for sure 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.840
 that there are many others who are 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.000
 connected right now that's why 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:46.170
 I recruit it seems to me that in the team 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:49.290
 we are new and invasion is only 4 4,5 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.910
 to be quite often connected but good 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.480
 we are not often the four at the same time 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.100
 time so it's a bit complicated to 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.200
 this is a little complicated in 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.940
 week we often find ourselves alone or at 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.440
 two so that's why I want 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.910
 recruit we will say five people but 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.639
 it can be more like that can be 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.990
 less it depends 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.939
 I think it does five 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.620
 people around so that's it if you 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:15.320
 are interested 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.780
 you can still apply 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.520
 private message and gace and it will be more 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.080
 simple because of reading in the 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.570
 comments a whole list of answers 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.830
 it remains to be quite complicated if there is 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.130
 a lot of people who participate 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.740
 so in private message and so here's in 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.570
 Anyway I hope you go 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.840
 good and that one me I expect your 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:38.570
 impatient answers so voila and 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.220
 then I hope that not bad 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.120
 of them participated I tell you to 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.380
 puce and see you next time 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.380
 go bye everyone
