hours<00:01:26.880> with<00:01:27.600> squeeze<00:01:27.840> ninja<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.770> lot

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
hours with squeeze ninja it's a lot

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.350 
hours with squeeze ninja it's a lot
faster<00:01:29.310> than<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.000> take<00:01:30.150> you

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
faster than that it can take you

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.420 
faster than that it can take you
anywhere<00:01:30.390> from<00:01:30.780> 30<00:01:31.110> seconds<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.710> about<00:01:32.100> three

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
anywhere from 30 seconds to about three

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.219 
anywhere from 30 seconds to about three

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
minutes so you're saving a lot of time

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.080 
minutes so you're saving a lot of time
and<00:01:34.530> that's<00:01:35.159> time<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:35.729> spent<00:01:36.030> doing

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and that's time you can be spent doing
