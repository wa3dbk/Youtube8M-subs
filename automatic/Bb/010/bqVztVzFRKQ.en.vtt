00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
to that in a minute so first let's take

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.280 
to that in a minute so first let's take
a<00:01:08.340> closer<00:01:08.640> look<00:01:08.760> at<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.390> case<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> expo

that i have so this is similar to the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.270

you<00:02:09.209> can<00:02:09.450> feel<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.840> we're<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:11.039> can<00:02:11.280> hit<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:12.110> so

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
you can feel the we're you can hit it so

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.730 
you can feel the we're you can hit it so
that's

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
that's

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.080 
that's
very<00:02:13.860> much<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.160> again<00:02:14.370> it's<00:02:14.580> worth<00:02:14.850> noting

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
very much it again it's worth noting

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.200 
very much it again it's worth noting
that<00:02:15.270> all<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.840> edges<00:02:16.140> are<00:02:16.290> covered<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.210> the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
that all the edges are covered and the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.030 
that all the edges are covered and the
fit<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.720> pretty<00:02:19.140> perfect<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:19.680> let<00:02:19.800> me<00:02:19.860> just

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
fit is pretty perfect so let me just

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.950 
fit is pretty perfect so let me just
take<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.490> out<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.970> as<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.570> can<00:02:21.690> see<00:02:21.720> it's

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
take it out and as you can see it's

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.250 
take it out and as you can see it's
pretty<00:02:22.500> easy<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.950> take<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.340> out<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:24.230> let<00:02:25.230> me

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
pretty easy to take it out and let me

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.450 
pretty easy to take it out and let me
just<00:02:25.350> pop<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:26.030> do<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.900> yeah<00:02:28.470> into<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.220> flip

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
just pop it in do and yeah into the flip

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.770 
just pop it in do and yeah into the flip
case<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:32.130> as<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.370> can<00:02:32.490> see<00:02:32.700> it's<00:02:33.000> easy<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.600> take

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
case so as you can see it's easy to take

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.350 
case so as you can see it's easy to take
out<00:02:33.900> it's<00:02:34.260> easy<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.620> pop<00:02:34.800> in<00:02:34.980> but<00:02:35.880> it's<00:02:36.150> pretty

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
out it's easy to pop in but it's pretty

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.530 
out it's easy to pop in but it's pretty
secure<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.580> it's<00:02:38.580> got<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.790> magnet<00:02:39.300> for<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
secure and it's got a magnet for the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.210 
secure and it's got a magnet for the
flip<00:02:39.750> case<00:02:39.990> so<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:41.220> doesn't<00:02:41.610> come<00:02:41.820> off<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:43.220> its

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
flip case so it doesn't come off and its

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.820 
flip case so it doesn't come off and its
really<00:02:44.520> secure<00:02:45.270> here<00:02:45.510> as<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:46.050> can<00:02:46.140> see<00:02:46.230> are

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
really secure here as you can see are

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.860 
really secure here as you can see are
there<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.250> an<00:02:47.370> absolutely<00:02:47.820> no<00:02:48.060> risk<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.510> the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
there is an absolutely no risk of the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.520 
there is an absolutely no risk of the
phone<00:02:49.080> popping<00:02:49.440> out<00:02:50.540> it's<00:02:51.540> pretty<00:02:52.050> good<00:02:52.290> and

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
phone popping out it's pretty good and

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.710 
phone popping out it's pretty good and
again<00:02:52.890> even<00:02:53.370> with<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.820> flip<00:02:54.000> case<00:02:54.210> you<00:02:54.540> can

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
again even with the flip case you can

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.110 
again even with the flip case you can
see<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.930> all<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.920> edges<00:02:56.160> are<00:02:56.310> covered<00:02:56.940> and

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
see that all the edges are covered and

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.510 
see that all the edges are covered and
the<00:02:57.780> cutouts<00:02:57.960> are<00:02:58.350> pretty<00:02:58.860> well<00:02:59.220> down<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:01.520> to

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
the cutouts are pretty well down and to

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.860 
the cutouts are pretty well down and to
access<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.910> charge<00:03:03.150> code<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.450> need<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.660> open

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
access the charge code you need to open

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.750 
access the charge code you need to open
it<00:03:04.140> one<00:03:04.800> more<00:03:04.980> thing<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.250> like<00:03:05.430> about<00:03:05.460> these

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
it one more thing I like about these

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.900 
it one more thing I like about these
cases<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.210> that<00:03:06.510> this<00:03:07.290> part<00:03:07.760> generally<00:03:08.760> with

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
cases is that this part generally with

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.060 
cases is that this part generally with
some<00:03:09.210> flip<00:03:09.540> cases<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:10.110> tends<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.410> be<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.620> little

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
some flip cases it tends to be a little

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.790 
some flip cases it tends to be a little
firm<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.910> little<00:03:12.240> hard<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:13.170> when<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.650> actually

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
firm a little hard so when you actually

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.830 
firm a little hard so when you actually
put<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.340> this<00:03:14.490> way<00:03:14.760> there<00:03:15.270> is<00:03:15.300> some<00:03:15.630> resistance

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
put it this way there is some resistance

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.340 
put it this way there is some resistance
but<00:03:16.500> no<00:03:16.710> not<00:03:17.130> with<00:03:17.340> this<00:03:17.570> with<00:03:18.570> Jackson<00:03:18.990> cases

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
but no not with this with Jackson cases

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.430 
but no not with this with Jackson cases
premium<00:03:19.740> cases<00:03:20.190> it's<00:03:20.430> pretty<00:03:21.240> good<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:22.320> have

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
premium cases it's pretty good you have

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.420 
premium cases it's pretty good you have
absolutely<00:03:22.680> no<00:03:24.650> stress<00:03:25.650> or<00:03:25.860> tension<00:03:25.980> over

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
absolutely no stress or tension over

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.520 
absolutely no stress or tension over
here<00:03:26.610> so<00:03:26.760> it's<00:03:27.300> easy<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.780> hold<00:03:27.990> the<00:03:28.140> phone<00:03:28.320> this

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
here so it's easy to hold the phone this

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.130 
here so it's easy to hold the phone this
way<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:29.730> same<00:03:29.970> with<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.300> SPO<00:03:30.660> kind<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:30.960> cover

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
way the same with the SPO kind of cover

note<00:03:53.490> 2<00:03:54.290> since<00:03:55.290> they<00:03:55.440> have<00:03:55.650> opening<00:03:56.280> here<00:03:56.430> for

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
note 2 since they have opening here for

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.260 
note 2 since they have opening here for
the<00:03:56.700> stylus<00:03:57.440> this<00:03:58.440> end<00:03:58.770> alone<00:03:59.430> is<00:03:59.580> not<00:03:59.700> covered

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
the stylus this end alone is not covered

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.540 
the stylus this end alone is not covered
but<00:04:00.600> about<00:04:00.990> from<00:04:01.200> that<00:04:01.230> I<00:04:01.620> kind<00:04:02.070> of<00:04:02.160> feel<00:04:02.340> this

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
but about from that I kind of feel this

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.880 
but about from that I kind of feel this
is<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.700> pretty<00:04:03.150> decent<00:04:03.600> case<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:04.110> is<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.620> little

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
is a pretty decent case it is a little

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.040 
is a pretty decent case it is a little
bit<00:04:05.100> on<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.340> expensive<00:04:05.520> side<00:04:05.850> dope<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:06.630> if

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
bit on the expensive side dope and if

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.630
