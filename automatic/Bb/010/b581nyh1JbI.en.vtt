00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello today we will talk about the company 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.710
 chickens with update 15 has been added 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.050
 funnel or hopper bucket of himself 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.460
 represents there are five slots 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.170
 which can be downloaded any items and 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.170
 with the help of such hoppers copiers 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.689
 do pipe that can pass 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.039
 various items and store them 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.150
 chests as you see on the table this 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.320
 craft hatira choose iron ingot 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.690
 do something like a cone of 5 cells and 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.430
 the center is set the chest is not 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.670
 a trap chest immediately say because 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.670
 the chest trap was also remembered 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:52.320
 updates but about him later as you 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.719
 see on an example I made two firms 1c 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.239
 rings other without chicken 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.840
 this is the final look how it will be 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.170
 look at you and here I want 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.240
 show you that every hacker 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.240
 not funnel takes 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:14.170
 well, or whatever convenient items 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.400
 all 16 prostration that we put the boat chicken 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.570
 glohla well 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.570
 this she probably it happens but how are you 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.380
 see the process goes and not quite quickly 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:36.840
 I built it not so long ago probably 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.420
 two or three minutes ago let's get started 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.440
 do the construction yourself 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.910
 standard 9 blocks on the hood 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.979
 clean this up 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:53.800
 in one unit to do this until the height here 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.410
 you can recover without six 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.700
 blocks 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:02.890
 set in the middle of the chest on it 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.030
 we set spears directed exactly 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.390
 then we send the rest to the chest 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.270
 haber and spider central like you 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.230
 see this is an indication that he 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.440
 directed precisely our central hockey 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:25.450
 with the last two the other four you 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:28.450
 can fit in anyone want it without 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.890
 the main differences were to be 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.890
 crystal connected with the central 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:39.080
 and now close our funnels or 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.080
 hoppers 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.840
 for 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.879
 more or less 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.709
 with acceptable because a company will do 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:55.610
 can be from any block except 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.610
 loose think for real 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.700
 make two and a half blocks this 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.390
 optimal if you will post 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.340
 more than 25 smokes because they start 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.090
 push each other and they sometimes 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.790
 fly over two blocks then how will you 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.739
 to colonize it with chickens 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:21.459
 discretion you can start and twist out 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:26.510
 call and make a few chickens can 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.110
 eggs don't like chickens yet or 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.350
 millet 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.970
 but itâ€™s best to have two hens there 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.170
 already multiply them to the desired number you 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.120
 thank you all for watching 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.160
 if anyone has any questions write to 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.370
 comments will try to answer 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.470
 who can will answer you from other spectators 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.470
 but thank you all so far
