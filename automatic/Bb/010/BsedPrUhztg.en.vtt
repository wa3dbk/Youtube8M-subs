really cool delay thing I like to throw
something<00:01:20.190> like<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.820> my<00:01:20.970> shows

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
something like this in on my shows

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.940 
something like this in on my shows
everything<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:21.810> maybe<00:01:22.080> once<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.530> night<00:01:22.710> but

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
everything like maybe once a night but

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.100 
everything like maybe once a night but
if<00:01:23.550> you<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> delay<00:01:24.270> going<00:01:24.720> at<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> right

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
if you get the delay going at the right

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.750 
if you get the delay going at the right
time<00:01:25.410> and<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.620> get<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.130> loud<00:01:26.340> enough<00:01:26.610> and

time and you get it just loud enough and
upload<00:01:27.720> nothing<00:01:28.050> that<00:01:28.140> makes<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.440> got<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.680> get

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
the right mix going on but it makes like

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.240 
the right mix going on but it makes like
the<00:01:31.800> most<00:01:31.980> elementary<00:01:33.440> sounds<00:01:34.440> you<00:01:34.740> know<00:01:34.860> very

cool so you can just use like the you
know<00:01:37.500> pentatonic<00:01:38.130> scale<00:01:38.400> or<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:39.240> couple<00:01:39.660> of

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
know pentatonic scale or a couple of

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.060 
know pentatonic scale or a couple of
different<00:01:39.990> scales<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.380> play<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.680> right<00:01:40.710> along

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
different scales you play it right along

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.680 
different scales you play it right along
with<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> timing<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.730> the<00:01:41.850> delay<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.300> it's<00:01:42.450> it

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
with the timing of the delay and it's it

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:54.770 
with the timing of the delay and it's it
can<00:01:42.870> be<00:01:43.050> a<00:01:43.080> really<00:01:43.290> cool<00:01:43.500> effect

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780

so you know it's another nice sound the

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.250 
so you know it's another nice sound the
delay<00:01:57.700> sounds<00:01:58.150> really<00:01:58.540> good<00:01:58.690> I<00:01:58.750> mean<00:01:58.900> this<00:01:59.110> is

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
delay sounds really good I mean this is

natural<00:04:41.099> sounding<00:04:41.820> kind<00:04:41.940> of<00:04:42.090> compression

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
natural sounding kind of compression

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:43.700 
natural sounding kind of compression

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
that you would get from the closed back

00:04:43.710 --> 00:05:31.020
