00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.330
 he writes there 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.490
 now off 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.139
 I am very satisfied injured this year 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.199
 he goes there occasionally 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.829
 that would be wonderful 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.310
 you can also do the cleaning 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.000
 Yes correct 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 but I have done something right 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.150
 the hydrochloric acid did not mean that it was over eighty 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.580
 is it true that we can in the rhine sector? 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.510
 it is time for a road 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.330
 you can work works 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.840
 the app too 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.840
 another example pro too long 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.930
 otherwise it costs us know 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.050
 when I haven't stopped this morning 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.750
 what I mean is therefore not an annual initiative to get the eu 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.300
 once you get one 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.080
 because in the plus 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.080
 that role as a lump by doing so in demolition 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.690
 we want to get you closer to this impasse 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.490
 the Turks say iot 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.490
 not so much because it is too dangerous there but 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.980
 this happened the supers happened for something 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.940
 who do not know I think 10 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.790
 well that's right 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.400
 you can also go to the show floor 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.700
 beach anp artifacts 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.970
 to enjoy 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.390
 I am happy that validation still happens in a reasonably safe environment euro 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.370
 that kind of money you are naturally in 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.069
 in the chemistry pack no the woman draws 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.050
 as you are just keep doing last week it once became the cultural 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:16.909
 to give 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.909
 it's allright you got that tmz 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:25.239
 no, you see it declining thanks 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.480
 no save his marriage no prohibition 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.390
 this permanent exactly the wrong norgrove hour 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.049
 a good punishment is delivered 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.169
 he can do a little water 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.989
 further the water closes 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.579
 I've seen regrets 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.379
 I can know 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.620
 the twelfth minute per minute it is a bit less stupid the truck wellink 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.019
 a period that all can work with 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.649
 were allowed to come 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:06.649
 nice to cook 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.759
 on the jobs that when it comes to 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:13.759
 rebels 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.289
 I also supported 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:18.569
 arsenal 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.569
 and that he is taking you now is free 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:27.919
 also at stake 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.929
 after two years ago 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:31.539
 the fourth period was that 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:33.389
 barely two years 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.409
 world action 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.409
 in a response 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.669
 the city i don't like the sickness i can 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.799
 the back seat 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.699
 that is not always complete 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.519
 I see the main village 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.859
 7 it goes is unknown 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.669
 after two others 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.669
 the top 

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:03.680
 when they are here 2006 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.650
 dismissal of projects waterpop I have not asked Saab granted that mission 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.650
 may do so 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.759
 it becomes less green there 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.779
 top place 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:24.749
 cinemagnus not there yet 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:27.749
 the word white becomes yes 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.349
 both stood later in the day 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.349
 succeeded after the break 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.639
 but nothing to worry about this time 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:48.860
 he's up a bit 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.860
 but it is wondering or already 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.819
 the trade was 0 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:03.370
 it is quite possible that they get clean 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.439
 unbelievably ago they suddenly came up x 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:09.249
 rarely pilot such layton 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:10.259
 that she succeeded with us
