all bundled together and they lay them
down<00:00:56.790> in<00:00:57.090> front<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.450> big<00:00:57.720> tractor

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.740 

and<00:01:01.680> that's<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.640> Pikeville<00:01:03.240> pipeline

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and that's for Pikeville pipeline

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.780 
and that's for Pikeville pipeline
building<00:01:04.230> pretty<00:01:05.010> much<00:01:05.100> any<00:01:05.280> construction

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.899 

a<00:01:09.880> lot<00:01:10.360> of<00:01:10.390> times<00:01:10.600> don't<00:01:11.080> do

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.580 

and<00:01:15.030> then<00:01:15.149> they'll<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.479> just<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.960> gap<00:01:16.170> with<00:01:16.409> no

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
and then they'll have just a gap with no

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.029 
and then they'll have just a gap with no
snows<00:01:17.450> four-by-fours<00:01:18.450> up<00:01:19.319> here<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:19.679> I<00:01:19.740> had<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
snows four-by-fours up here but I had to

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.130 
snows four-by-fours up here but I had to
do<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.429> particular<00:01:20.609> case<00:01:21.210> not<00:01:22.109> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
do it in this particular case not a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.209 
do it in this particular case not a
problem<00:01:22.909> 645<00:01:23.909> whores<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:25.140> always<00:01:25.740> run<00:01:26.009> my

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
problem 645 whores I always run my

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.520 
problem 645 whores I always run my
straps<00:01:26.520> over<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.909> center<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.479> like<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.500> a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
straps over the center I like to have a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.919 
straps over the center I like to have a
couple<00:01:28.920> right<00:01:29.100> there<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.759> they<00:01:30.569> were<00:01:30.630> pushed

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
couple right there and they were pushed

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:33.099 
couple right there and they were pushed
a<00:01:31.200> little<00:01:31.319> bit<00:01:31.500> further<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.549> rear<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.000> I

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
a little bit further to the rear so I

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:40.330 
a little bit further to the rear so I
traps<00:01:34.109> are<00:01:34.289> not<00:01:34.490> as<00:01:35.490> even<00:01:36.060> as

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.099 

at<00:01:40.700> least<00:01:40.909> now<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:41.179> get<00:01:41.479> to<00:01:41.570> see<00:01:41.600> what<00:01:41.960> the

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
at least now you get to see what the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.830 
at least now you get to see what the
heck<00:01:42.259> it<00:01:42.439> is<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.460> this<00:01:43.640> is

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.440 

quite<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.530> load<00:01:47.859> so<00:01:48.759> when<00:01:48.939> you<00:01:49.060> load<00:01:49.270> these

quite the load so when you load these

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.410 
quite the load so when you load these
things<00:01:49.840> if<00:01:50.200> you<00:01:50.320> guys<00:01:51.060> he's<00:01:52.060> going<00:01:52.210> to<00:01:52.270> make

everything is legal you know it's all

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.650 
everything is legal you know it's all
inside<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.160> rail<00:02:12.370> because<00:02:13.360> that's<00:02:13.570> the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
inside of the rail because that's the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.370 
inside of the rail because that's the
only<00:02:13.720> thing<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.020> want<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.230> make<00:02:14.350> sure

only thing you want to make sure
especially<00:02:14.830> when<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.310> tighten<00:02:15.520> down<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:16.480> if

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
especially when you tighten down so if

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.090 
especially when you tighten down so if
you<00:02:16.600> got<00:02:16.750> stuff<00:02:16.990> like<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:17.350> I<00:02:17.530> wouldn't<00:02:17.950> worry

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
you got stuff like this I wouldn't worry

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.670 
you got stuff like this I wouldn't worry
about<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:18.760> just<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.570> just<00:02:19.630> sloppy<00:02:20.490> so<00:02:22.470> if<00:02:23.470> it

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
about this just is just sloppy so if it

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.990 
about this just is just sloppy so if it
looks<00:02:23.830> like<00:02:23.980> it's<00:02:24.130> going<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.280> fall<00:02:24.370> off<00:02:24.520> take

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
looks like it's going to fall off take

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.330 
looks like it's going to fall off take
it<00:02:25.030> off<00:02:25.240> it<00:02:26.050> looks<00:02:26.230> like<00:02:26.320> got<00:02:26.590> huge<00:02:26.890> amounts<00:02:27.250> of

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
it off it looks like got huge amounts of

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.470 
it off it looks like got huge amounts of
mud<00:02:27.520> which<00:02:27.730> sometimes<00:02:27.940> you're<00:02:28.210> going<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.390> get

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
mud which sometimes you're going to get

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.910 
mud which sometimes you're going to get
some<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.780> these<00:02:28.840> they're<00:02:29.080> going<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.260> be<00:02:29.350> just

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
some of these they're going to be just

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.500 
some of these they're going to be just
full<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.220> mud<00:02:30.610> rock<00:02:31.140> try<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.260> take<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.410> time

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
full of mud rock try and take the time

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.970 
full of mud rock try and take the time
scrape<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.690> crap<00:02:34.959> off<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.230> there<00:02:35.500> let's<00:02:35.800> go
