00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
two on the floor top now all together

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:47.190 
two on the floor top now all together
really<00:02:27.550> slow<00:02:27.940> sounds<00:02:28.540> like<00:02:28.660> this

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.070 

and<00:02:48.200> that's<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:48.830> so<00:02:49.069> super<00:02:49.670> simple

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
and that's it so super simple

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.110 
and that's it so super simple
beautifully<00:02:51.080> flowing<00:02:51.319> lick<00:02:51.709> that<00:02:52.220> uses<00:02:53.090> a

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
beautifully flowing lick that uses a

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.869 
beautifully flowing lick that uses a
quad<00:02:53.510> in<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.870> new<00:02:54.110> way<00:02:54.260> so<00:02:54.549> let's<00:02:55.549> try<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:55.819> at

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
quad in a new way so let's try that at

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.110 
quad in a new way so let's try that at
85<00:02:56.420> beats<00:02:56.599> a<00:02:56.720> minute<00:02:56.840> which<00:02:57.079> is<00:02:57.110> roughly<00:02:57.409> about

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
85 beats a minute which is roughly about

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.699 
85 beats a minute which is roughly about
60<00:02:59.120> off<00:02:59.299> of<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.659> gold<00:02:59.870> temple<00:03:00.079> the<00:03:00.409> Reimann

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
60 off of the gold temple the Reimann

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:48.509 
60 off of the gold temple the Reimann
for<00:03:23.980> now<00:03:24.980> let's<00:03:25.159> try<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.370> touch<00:03:25.609> faster<00:03:26.090> at<00:03:26.599> 1:15

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.089 

and<00:03:49.519> finally<00:03:50.060> let's<00:03:50.690> chuck<00:03:50.870> up<00:03:51.019> to<00:03:51.140> 145<00:03:51.830> and

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
and finally let's chuck up to 145 and

00:03:52.099 --> 00:04:14.080 
and finally let's chuck up to 145 and
see<00:03:52.220> how<00:03:52.340> it<00:03:52.459> says<00:04:11.620> so<00:04:12.620> as<00:04:13.099> you<00:04:13.310> can<00:04:13.400> see<00:04:13.459> it's<00:04:14.030> a

see how it says so as you can see it's a

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.539 
see how it says so as you can see it's a
pretty<00:04:14.299> kick-ass<00:04:14.629> job<00:04:14.739> and<00:04:15.739> it's<00:04:16.190> a<00:04:16.310> simple

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549
