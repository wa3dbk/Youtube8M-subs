and then start blending it upwards which

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.430 
and then start blending it upwards which
is<00:02:22.239> going<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.480> warm<00:02:22.660> up<00:02:22.780> your<00:02:22.900> brow<00:02:23.080> bone<00:02:23.319> as

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
can kind of take it kind of rub in

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.900 
can kind of take it kind of rub in
between<00:03:34.660> where<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:34.900> put<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.320> mulch<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:35.910> the

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
between where you put the mulch and the

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.220 
between where you put the mulch and the
mystery<00:03:37.830> just<00:03:38.830> so<00:03:39.040> it's<00:03:39.250> extremely<00:03:40.230> seamless

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
mystery just so it's extremely seamless

I've said before I love it because it

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.150 
I've said before I love it because it
places<00:05:50.180> the<00:05:50.390> color<00:05:50.720> but<00:05:50.990> it<00:05:51.020> also<00:05:51.260> this<00:05:51.890> brush

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
places the color but it also this brush

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.270 
places the color but it also this brush
smokes<00:05:52.520> it<00:05:52.730> out<00:05:52.850> at<00:05:53.030> the<00:05:53.090> same<00:05:53.300> time<00:05:54.190> and<00:05:55.190> you

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
smokes it out at the same time and you

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.670 
smokes it out at the same time and you
definitely<00:05:55.460> want<00:05:55.850> to<00:05:55.910> have<00:05:56.060> a<00:05:56.120> lid

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
definitely want to have a lid

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.920 
definitely want to have a lid
bit<00:05:56.770> of<00:05:56.800> smoky<00:05:57.789> liner<00:05:58.030> when<00:05:58.300> you're<00:05:58.449> doing<00:05:58.750> a

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
bit of smoky liner when you're doing a

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:16.010 
bit of smoky liner when you're doing a
smoky<00:05:59.650> look

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.930 

and<00:06:16.590> the<00:06:16.800> last<00:06:17.009> step<00:06:17.099> for<00:06:17.400> your<00:06:17.520> eyes<00:06:17.610> is

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
and the last step for your eyes is

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:25.559 
and the last step for your eyes is
getting<00:06:18.360> launched<00:06:18.599> on<00:06:19.020> mascara

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:25.569 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.510 

so<00:06:26.139> that's<00:06:26.349> it<00:06:26.469> for<00:06:26.499> the<00:06:26.649> eyes<00:06:26.800> I<00:06:27.099> also<00:06:27.309> went

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
so that's it for the eyes I also went

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.600 
so that's it for the eyes I also went
ahead<00:06:27.610> and<00:06:27.969> I<00:06:28.059> lined<00:06:28.389> my<00:06:29.129> bottom<00:06:30.129> waterline
