with<00:01:04.680> surgery<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.010> most<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> time<00:01:05.729> we

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
with surgery and most of the time we

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.160 
with surgery and most of the time we
want<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> teach<00:01:06.270> people<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.780> take<00:01:06.930> care<00:01:07.080> of

themselves so that they know what to do

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.600 
themselves so that they know what to do
so<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.500> they<00:01:10.590> don't<00:01:10.710> need<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.070> come<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.280> and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
so that they don't need to come in and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.789 
so that they don't need to come in and
be<00:01:12.330> dependent<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:12.930> somebody<00:01:13.320> else<00:01:13.470> taking

be dependent on somebody else taking
care<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.040> them<00:01:14.250> better<00:01:14.880> if<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.119> know<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:15.420> to

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
care of them better if you know what to

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.940 
care of them better if you know what to
do<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:15.810> yourself<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.530> take<00:01:16.680> care<00:01:16.860> of

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
of the time most back pain is actually

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.620 
of the time most back pain is actually
treatable<00:01:25.759> symptom<00:01:26.759> management<00:01:26.909> that's<00:01:27.479> what

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
treatable symptom management that's what

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.210 
treatable symptom management that's what
we're<00:01:27.750> doing<00:01:28.020> we're<00:01:28.229> making<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.650> feel<00:01:29.009> better

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
we're doing we're making you feel better

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.660 
we're doing we're making you feel better
so<00:01:29.729> your<00:01:29.880> body<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.180> get<00:01:30.750> better<00:01:30.930> by<00:01:31.110> itself

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
so your body can get better by itself

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.800 
so your body can get better by itself
for<00:01:32.670> patients<00:01:33.479> with<00:01:34.490> back<00:01:35.490> pain<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.090> no<00:01:36.570> leg

pain very few of those patients need
surgery<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.259> fact<00:01:40.439> I'd<00:01:40.560> say<00:01:40.619> none<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.130> those

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400

business need surgery there may be a

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.480 
business need surgery there may be a
very<00:01:44.280> small<00:01:44.570> minority<00:01:45.860> for<00:01:46.860> whom<00:01:47.040> surgery

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
very small minority for whom surgery

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.710 
very small minority for whom surgery
would<00:01:47.579> lead<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> better<00:01:48.240> outcome<00:01:48.360> than

would lead to a better outcome than

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.690 
would lead to a better outcome than
non-operative<00:01:49.470> treatment<00:01:49.829> but<00:01:50.399> again<00:01:50.579> it's

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
non-operative treatment but again it's

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.069 
non-operative treatment but again it's
very<00:01:50.880> hard<00:01:51.119> for<00:01:51.180> us<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.450> predict<00:01:51.780> who<00:01:51.930> those

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
very hard for us to predict who those

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.920 
very hard for us to predict who those
patients<00:01:52.590> might<00:01:53.159> be<00:01:53.450> for<00:01:54.450> patients<00:01:54.810> who<00:01:54.869> have

patients might be for patients who have

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.780 
patients might be for patients who have

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
symptoms of nerve compression those are

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.869 
symptoms of nerve compression those are
patients<00:02:05.250> who<00:02:05.340> might<00:02:05.549> benefit<00:02:06.149> from<00:02:06.740> surgery

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:07.879 
patients who might benefit from surgery

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:09.919 
patients who might benefit from surgery
they're<00:02:08.879> also<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.179> type<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.390> patients<00:02:09.840> when

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
they're also the type of patients when

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.180 
they're also the type of patients when
they<00:02:10.020> see<00:02:10.170> their<00:02:10.319> primary<00:02:10.470> care<00:02:10.679> doctor<00:02:10.830> if

they see their primary care doctor if
those<00:02:11.400> are<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.610> symptoms<00:02:11.940> they're<00:02:12.090> having

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
those are the symptoms they're having

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.559 
those are the symptoms they're having
it's<00:02:13.140> appropriate<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.800> get<00:02:13.920> an<00:02:14.040> MRI<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:15.060> that

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
it's appropriate to get an MRI in that

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.890 
it's appropriate to get an MRI in that
situation<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.680> we<00:02:16.830> can<00:02:17.270> document<00:02:18.270> and

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
situation so we can document and

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.110 
situation so we can document and
diagnose<00:02:19.349> where<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.830> nerve<00:02:20.040> compression<00:02:20.730> is

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
diagnose where the nerve compression is

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.970 
diagnose where the nerve compression is
occurring<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.930> try<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.380> determine<00:02:22.770> your

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
occurring and try to determine your

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.430 
occurring and try to determine your
surgery<00:02:23.400> would<00:02:23.550> make<00:02:23.760> make<00:02:24.390> sense<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:24.989> think

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
surgery would make make sense I think

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.830 
surgery would make make sense I think
people<00:02:25.920> have<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.099> misconception<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:27.420> we<00:02:27.690> can

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
people have a misconception that we can

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.720 
people have a misconception that we can
do<00:02:27.989> more<00:02:28.290> than<00:02:28.349> we<00:02:28.650> can<00:02:28.890> sometimes<00:02:29.550> in

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
do more than we can sometimes in

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.340 
do more than we can sometimes in
medicine<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.510> can<00:02:30.660> put<00:02:30.840> people<00:02:30.989> on<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
medicine and you can put people on the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.550 
medicine and you can put people on the
moon<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.890> we<00:02:32.430> can<00:02:32.580> send<00:02:32.930> spaceships<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.350> Mars

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
moon and we can send spaceships to Mars

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.559 
moon and we can send spaceships to Mars
but<00:02:34.890> how<00:02:35.340> come<00:02:35.489> we<00:02:35.610> can't<00:02:35.819> make<00:02:35.970> our<00:02:36.120> back<00:02:36.300> pain

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
but how come we can't make our back pain

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.229 
but how come we can't make our back pain
better<00:02:36.860> or<00:02:37.860> why<00:02:38.550> isn't<00:02:38.850> there<00:02:38.970> something

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
better or why isn't there something

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.750 
better or why isn't there something
fancy<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.810> snazzy<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.890> we<00:02:41.220> can<00:02:41.400> do<00:02:41.580> to

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
fancy and snazzy that that we can do to

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.030 
fancy and snazzy that that we can do to
make<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:41.940> better<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:43.290> know<00:02:43.319> it's<00:02:43.680> it's

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
make it better and you know it's it's

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.100 
make it better and you know it's it's
interesting<00:02:44.519> but<00:02:45.030> most<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.870> time<00:02:46.019> you

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
interesting but most of the time you

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.270 
interesting but most of the time you
have<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.319> power<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.650> make<00:02:46.769> yourself<00:02:47.130> better
