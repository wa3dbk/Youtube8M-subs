00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.359
 hi hello everyone dear subscribers 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.700
 and viewers of my channel in this video 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:16.609
 I would also like to go as always 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:22.410
 toy called bombs speech and so 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:25.800
 what exactly so here so we can 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:31.140
 see what 's going on at my base like this 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.290
 I have been hit again , but they found me 2 2 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.090
 damn two pieces of crystals this one personally 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.980
 it is quite normal and so 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:45.620
 proper 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:48.329
 so what we hired our paratroopers 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.800
 on anyway earn a tree 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:56.340
 let's near the base again means 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.680
 here are these three better three big 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.030
 houses can simply crush the defeat of 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:07.850
 any press a button in the attack before 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:14.760
 I stop the mouse there you can remember 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:16.490
 they damn that so well what am I 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.950
 certainly very risky 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.430
 oh well all go and let's go 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:30.750
 here's how to put the ball 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:32.509
 checker so that we can just 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.430
 attacked this 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:40.439
 then let's veto on it it all 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:45.509
 on the fly so that all our units 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:48.149
 kill faster one thing but of course 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.780
 we probably will lose sleep now with 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.680
 this base because damn getting you 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.490
 there is no water and I missed 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:04.969
 damn and 1 I got a little bit all 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:08.520
 wonderful we got there and the course 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:10.800
 the kid gun doesn't get on at all perfectly 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.190
 here now we just come forward 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.920
 of course there was a gun 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:21.370
 it lacks ours she wants everything 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.210
 just super 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:38.650
 See how the ship is considered volumetric 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:45.940
 so here he is seeing cool of course so 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.940
 now he will finish it like this 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:03.709
 but come on come on like Satan on 100 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:07.500
 video is recorded so 2 minutes left 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.730
 damn I thought so he we hope as in 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.820
 the last part will not be 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.850
 that we beat hit beat beat yes I am wrong and 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.260
 not finished off 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.260
 it certainly was very bad 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:37.790
 Well, that's the principle to finish them should 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:52.599
 in general, the headquarters are starting to burn already 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:57.560
 our boat and figs for now our 1 unit 1 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:04:01.900
 the landing hits what he see what we have 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:13.189
 brave brave little and brave 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:18.459
 but okay, but let's beat hit beat hit 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:18.459
 because read too silent he beats 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.800
 there will not be such that he is not now 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:38.010
 will develop as in the past pancake and I no longer 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.920
 like we have 30 seconds left and won 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.660
 still means rowing damn come on let's 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.110
 Now again we will consider the contract 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:51.930
 start here and 98 end up with horseradish 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:54.860
 oiled damn what a strong base and just 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:59.190
 were we now again lose everything let's 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:08.190
 come on two ten nine eight seven 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:11.340
 six five four three two one no yes how 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:16.890
 so generally you can yo-ma-yo 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:21.780
 how was it yes damn yes then I generally 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:32.940
 don't understand these goats damn edison not 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:39.960

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.380
 the next part I am not at all I am no longer 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:50.430
 I will go to attack abudl from 20 on base 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:53.430
 will develop everything because for sure I 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.720
 I will we Well, in general, I will not all 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:06:00.930
 Immediately speak, therefore, in general, wait
