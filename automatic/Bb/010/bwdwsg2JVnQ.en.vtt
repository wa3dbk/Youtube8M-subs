00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
one one if you look at the outsole we

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.540 
one one if you look at the outsole we
have<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.379> slight<00:00:40.710> amount<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.070> lugs<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.030 
have a slight amount of lugs on the
bottom<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.329> ATR<00:00:43.230> stands<00:00:43.590> for<00:00:43.739> all-terrain

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
bottom so ATR stands for all-terrain

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.740

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
running and the idea here is that you

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.000 
running and the idea here is that you
can<00:00:45.899> use<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> shoe<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> little<00:00:46.680> bit<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
can use the shoe a little bit on the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.010 
can use the shoe a little bit on the
road<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.760> use<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> trail<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.930> it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
road you can use it on the trail so it

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.319 
road you can use it on the trail so it
gives<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.289> really<00:00:49.530> smooth<00:00:49.860> ride<00:00:50.190> as<00:00:51.000> well<00:00:51.180> as
