with our tactic to have a short chain of
command<00:01:21.470> although<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:22.130> could<00:01:22.460> combine<00:01:22.700> and

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
command although you could combine and

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
timely actions of course but right now

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.240 
timely actions of course but right now
it<00:01:26.420> is<00:01:26.570> easier<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.049> directly<00:01:27.650> engage<00:01:27.860> the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250

enemy<00:01:28.280> because<00:01:28.850> our<00:01:29.060> mercs<00:01:29.420> are<00:01:29.600> already

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
noise in this case it shouldn't be a

closer to the nearest enemies and make

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:38.520 
closer to the nearest enemies and make
