 landscape architect who cooperation that 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.180
 interaction that is incredibly important 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.500
 and one side can learn a lot from it 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.149
 the landscape architect what their 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.890
 experiences we are the objectives of 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.410
 are the plants and anticipate 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.850
 in that there are on the plants which then 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.449
 perhaps best 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.460
 can come 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.570
 Well another side is the role of the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.329
 green contractor 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.340
 crucial because the good planting and the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.210
 good care and you can get the result 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.380
 guarantee and the trees will succeed 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.240
 van den berk

 the project is actually trackers in me 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.259
 delivered the full width in 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.549

 Sweden's Kristianstad so it stretches 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.369
 really all over europe and that 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.829
 projects then it is actually quite 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.210
 important t the good cooperation in the 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.759
 for example, in Greece 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.710
 through a landscape architect and construction there 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.659
 from greece would have met at each 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.100
 it starts with looking something special 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.259
 separate to the true plan 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.630
 how can we best deep garden 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.640
 Preparing to even temporarily 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.909
 Do not steal any of them so that they are first on with 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.500
 new opera has been put down that

 path we have are good together 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.380
 viewed and if it is very beautiful it is over 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.570
 optimally digital 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.770
 Many other companies provide you with a catalog 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.600
 and we didn't really want the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.630
 really the knowledge that we have that want 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.220
 bundle and a very nice work of it 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.099
 Well we did we want to 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.440
 more 800 species have been described and yours 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.510
 beautiful photos provided in the book 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.310
 expressed and is not only about 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.560
 it also present the good kind 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.970
 descriptions and the applications we 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.849
 For example, listed may be a fur 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.709
 stories alkali headwind cannot stand 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.480
 get around or maybe not 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.160
 which temperature zones and search in 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.569
 europe is suitable for this 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.040
 they are nice facebook though 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.560
 at the same time an enormously important 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.849
 tool for planning and some 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.250
 years later very natural gamblers 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.880
 digitally made is also via the site 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.549
 the book 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.440
 be very innovative again 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.569
 the most in a vase from the past 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.099
 in the sphere of mechanization a huge 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.030
 large claw the plug developed eg 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.700
 to have 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.530
 ordinary bim machines develop the first 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.090
 we have a piece of normal machine 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.799
 contributed to development 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.319
 smoke in the products play various 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.170
 types of varieties actually on our 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.420
 name and they also feel very 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.450
 nice to mention the swing it is one 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.069
 brand name of us a soft ash shaped 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.620
 plane tree 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.150
 you are yes the model rights and if 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.250
 mark a screen 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.959
 often recognize and in Belgium is the 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.359
 love of natural forms ge 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.010
 maybe just a little less tight 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.630
 completed design 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.459
