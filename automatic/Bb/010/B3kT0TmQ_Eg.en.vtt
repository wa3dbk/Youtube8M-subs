00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hi everyone especially today 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.490
 for a simple recipe 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.440
 it's going to be a dessert a dessert cream 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.809
 with that and vegan chocolate so this is a 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.269
 recipe that my laurine friend of the chain 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.070
 pop in blush advised me and since 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.690
 yesterday made me discover that I 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.980
 would often celebrate since it's really 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.869
 very very simple to do 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.250
 and it's really excellent 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.330
 I hope you enjoy it I will 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.810
 leave right away with the list of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.420
 ingredients 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.150
 so to make two ramekins of 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.590
 chocolate cream this veg you will have 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.539
 need two oars in the heart of milk of 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.880
 so soy there I use the ramekin 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.300
 like as a measuring cup you will have 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.770
 need four squares of dark chocolate 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.070
 you will also need two 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.989
 tablespoons cornstarch 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.180
 potatoes you can even tried 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.370
 with another flour and you will have 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.890
 also need two tablespoons 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.510
 shave sugar so I have sugar 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.250
 refined is better to take sugar 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.379
 unrefined where you do with that 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.660
 Now you finally pay all 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.309
 our ingredients in a saucepan for 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.309
 can start to heat them 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.000
 now you dilute well before 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.439
 to heat since otherwise you go 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.299
 to have lumps is really it's 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.330
 important to dilute your flour 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.680
 in your liquid and once that is 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.110
 well said better you can turn on your 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.580
 fire on low heat and start doing 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.580
 heat until his cp 6 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.200
 so that's created an email is really in 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.390
 to thicken 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.010
 and you can continue until 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.620
 it has the consistency that you like 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.150
 in fact more or less more or less 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.640
 consistent I like it when it's 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.110
 like that a little bit harder and a 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.030
 once these loans that it suits you 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.550
 you extinguish the fire around 6am in your 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.940
 ramekins and hop direction the fridge for 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.940
 a few hours 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.010
 here is my cream is well taken 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.369
 look a little bit at the 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.130
 texture that we really have a texture of 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.500
 crem so it really looks like cream 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.900
 you buy in supermarkets and 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.310
 this alone and dan is more or less taken 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.080
 according to whether you have put more or 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.060
 less flour you can adjust yourself 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.230
 even to have the consistency that 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.620
 you agree me I had to do it 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.940
 many times in order to really find 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.800
 dosages that I like 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.800
 so now I have not tasted all that 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.700
 I still have success now 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.080
 frankly I tested several flour 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.600
 it works with everything and I'm waiting 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.910
 to try this with almond powder 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.590
 Milk tracking cut too short 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.930
 coconut crumbs all so I'll you 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.880
 imagine that the possibilities of 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.400
 variations on the background of variants are 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.810
 infinite so do not hesitate to put a 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.250
