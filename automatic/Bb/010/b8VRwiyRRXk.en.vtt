00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
okay so here we are building a fence and

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.599 
okay so here we are building a fence and
I'll<00:00:03.330> show<00:00:03.540> you<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.750> little<00:00:03.899> bit<00:00:04.020> about<00:00:04.609> the

build<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.429> fence<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:12.030> first<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.690> all<00:00:12.870> we'll<00:00:13.259> talk

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
build a fence so first of all we'll talk

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.180 
build a fence so first of all we'll talk
a<00:00:13.500> little<00:00:13.799> bit<00:00:13.980> about<00:00:14.009> structure<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:16.039> to<00:00:17.039> do

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
a little bit about structure and to do

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.500 
a little bit about structure and to do
that<00:00:17.460> I'm<00:00:17.760> going<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:19.550> show<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:20.880> corner

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
that I'm going to show you this corner

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:30.679 
that I'm going to show you this corner
here<00:00:22.070> we<00:00:23.070> use<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> four<00:00:23.789> by<00:00:23.970> four<00:00:24.000> post<00:00:29.689> in

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
here we use a four by four post in

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.180 
here we use a four by four post in
cement<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.500> ground<00:00:31.830> now<00:00:33.890> if<00:00:34.890> you're<00:00:35.160> using

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
cement on the ground now if you're using

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.580 
cement on the ground now if you're using
a<00:00:35.460> fence<00:00:35.700> section<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.750> decide<00:00:37.320> what

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
a fence section you have to decide what

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.830 
a fence section you have to decide what
section<00:00:38.129> you're<00:00:38.280> going<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.550> use<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.030> make

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
section you're going to use and make

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.040 
section you're going to use and make
those<00:00:40.050> posts<00:00:40.559> eight<00:00:40.739> feet<00:00:41.040> apart<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:42.050> standard

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
those posts eight feet apart a standard

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.360 
those posts eight feet apart a standard
2x4<00:00:43.520> eight<00:00:44.520> foot<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.180> usually<00:00:45.739> eight<00:00:46.739> feet<00:00:47.129> one

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
2x4 eight foot is usually eight feet one

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.569 
2x4 eight foot is usually eight feet one
quarter<00:00:47.850> inch<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:49.050> if<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.440> set<00:00:49.649> your<00:00:49.770> posts<00:00:50.250> 8

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
quarter inch so if you set your posts 8

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.069 
quarter inch so if you set your posts 8
feet<00:00:50.940> 1/4<00:00:51.570> inch<00:00:51.980> apart<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.780> cement<00:00:54.780> them<00:00:54.930> in

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
feet 1/4 inch apart and cement them in

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.709 
feet 1/4 inch apart and cement them in
that<00:00:55.260> way<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:56.430> quite<00:00:56.579> difficult<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:57.570> you

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
that way it's quite difficult but if you

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.750 
that way it's quite difficult but if you
use<00:00:57.899> if<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.590> put<00:00:58.829> your<00:00:58.980> rails<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.550> at<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
use if you put your rails in it at the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.060 
use if you put your rails in it at the
same<00:00:59.940> time<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.570> then<00:01:01.320> submit<00:01:01.590> your<00:01:01.859> post

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
same time and then submit your post

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.270 
same time and then submit your post
later<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.969> little<00:01:03.239> easier<00:01:04.129> when<00:01:05.129> you're

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
later it's a little easier when you're

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.190 
later it's a little easier when you're
using<00:01:05.489> pickets<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.750> not<00:01:06.900> quite

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
using pickets like this it's not quite

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.399 
using pickets like this it's not quite
so<00:01:08.030> important<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.270> exactly<00:01:09.810> 8<00:01:09.930> feet<00:01:10.200> but

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
so important to be exactly 8 feet but

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.490 
so important to be exactly 8 feet but
when<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.710> use<00:01:10.920> pre-made<00:01:11.729> sections<00:01:12.500> then

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
when you use pre-made sections then

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.109 
when you use pre-made sections then
you'll<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.130> kind<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.430> put<00:01:14.640> them<00:01:14.790> all<00:01:14.939> in

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
you'll have to kind of put them all in

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.700 
you'll have to kind of put them all in
at<00:01:15.240> once<00:01:15.479> that's<00:01:15.810> at<00:01:15.960> least<00:01:16.110> that's<00:01:16.320> how<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.500> do

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
at once that's at least that's how I do

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.280 
at once that's at least that's how I do
it<00:01:17.030> now<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.420> very<00:01:18.570> sturdy<00:01:18.930> fence

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
it now this is a very sturdy fence

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.340 
it now this is a very sturdy fence
because<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:19.799> got<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> top<00:01:20.310> rail<00:01:21.320> which<00:01:22.320> is

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
because it's got a top rail which is

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.550 
because it's got a top rail which is
this<00:01:23.280> piece<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.909> then<00:01:24.630> an<00:01:24.869> under<00:01:25.170> support

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
this piece and then an under support

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.580 
this piece and then an under support
that<00:01:25.860> makes<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.330> very<00:01:27.330> nice<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.320> what<00:01:28.470> they

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
that makes a very nice and what they

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.530 
that makes a very nice and what they
call<00:01:28.799> strong<00:01:29.490> back<00:01:29.759> when<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.180> put<00:01:30.360> two

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
call strong back when you put two

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.330 
call strong back when you put two
together<00:01:30.689> like<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.560> becomes<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.040> strong

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
together like this it becomes a strong

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.030 
together like this it becomes a strong
back<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.540> bottom<00:01:33.750> rail<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.290> also<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.860> and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
back and the bottom rail is also up and

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.609 
back and the bottom rail is also up and
down<00:01:35.450> you<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.509> see<00:01:36.810> when<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.110> fasten<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
down you can see when you fasten the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.929 
down you can see when you fasten the
picket<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:39.390> has<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.750> actually<00:01:39.869> bend<00:01:40.939> 7

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
picket to that it has to actually bend 7

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.749 
picket to that it has to actually bend 7
inches<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.329> 2x4<00:01:42.869> also<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.159> make<00:01:44.189> sure<00:01:44.610> you

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
inches of 2x4 also if you make sure you

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.359 
inches of 2x4 also if you make sure you
get<00:01:44.970> your<00:01:45.180> crowns<00:01:45.530> which<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.890> slope<00:01:47.159> of

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
get your crowns which is the slope of

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.270 
get your crowns which is the slope of
your<00:01:47.430> wood<00:01:48.439> pointing<00:01:49.439> up<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.799> gives<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.159> even

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
your wood pointing up it gives it even

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.590 
your wood pointing up it gives it even
more<00:01:50.670> support<00:01:51.119> because<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:53.090> lumber<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.240> is

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
more support because the lumber is is

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.459 
more support because the lumber is is
more<00:01:54.979> structurally<00:01:56.810> favorable<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.170> crown

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
more structurally favorable to the crown

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.420 
more structurally favorable to the crown
part<00:01:59.420> now<00:02:00.420> when<00:02:00.750> you're<00:02:00.869> doing<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.350> slope<00:02:02.159> about

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
part now when you're doing a slope about

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.359 
part now when you're doing a slope about
fence<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.170> it's<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.560> wise<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.159> keep

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
fence like this it's it's wise to keep

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.690 
fence like this it's it's wise to keep
it<00:02:05.549> slightly<00:02:06.500> maybe<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.619> little<00:02:08.009> bit<00:02:08.129> off<00:02:08.340> level

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
it slightly maybe a little bit off level

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.260 
it slightly maybe a little bit off level
is<00:02:08.970> fine<00:02:09.239> but

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
is fine but

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.840 
is fine but
if<00:02:10.750> you<00:02:11.050> make<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.680> great<00:02:11.890> deal<00:02:12.100> off<00:02:12.370> level

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
if you make it a great deal off level

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.380 
if you make it a great deal off level
then<00:02:13.810> your<00:02:14.140> your<00:02:14.500> fence<00:02:14.770> boards<00:02:15.220> will<00:02:15.430> end<00:02:15.850> up

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
then your your fence boards will end up

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.560 
then your your fence boards will end up
looking<00:02:16.750> like<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:17.430> if<00:02:18.430> you're<00:02:18.730> off<00:02:18.850> level<00:02:19.330> so

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
looking like that if you're off level so

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.900 
looking like that if you're off level so
and<00:02:19.750> you'll<00:02:19.930> have<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.230> cut<00:02:20.410> everyone<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.760> it's

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
and you'll have to cut everyone so it's

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.030 
and you'll have to cut everyone so it's
often<00:02:22.120> better<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.600> them<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.380> rather<00:02:23.590> than<00:02:23.860> do

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
often better to them to rather than do

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.310 
often better to them to rather than do
that<00:02:24.070> is<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.940> step<00:02:25.210> your<00:02:25.360> fence<00:02:25.660> down<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.230> you

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
that is to step your fence down so you

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.760 
that is to step your fence down so you
can<00:02:26.470> keep<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.890> top<00:02:27.160> rail<00:02:27.460> as<00:02:27.640> close<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.120> level

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
can keep the top rail as close to level

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.440 
can keep the top rail as close to level
in<00:02:29.770> this<00:02:29.980> case<00:02:30.250> we<00:02:30.520> didn't<00:02:30.850> have<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.150> do<00:02:31.270> that

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
in this case we didn't have to do that

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.360 
in this case we didn't have to do that
because<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.870> lot<00:02:32.020> is<00:02:32.230> very<00:02:32.440> level<00:02:32.800> but<00:02:32.980> as<00:02:33.160> you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
because the lot is very level but as you

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.150 
because the lot is very level but as you
as<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.940> step<00:02:34.210> it<00:02:34.390> down<00:02:34.530> then<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.710> can<00:02:35.740> use

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
as you step it down then you can use

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.850 
as you step it down then you can use
your<00:02:36.870> new<00:02:37.870> fence<00:02:38.200> board<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.740> it

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
your new fence board and it

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.830 
your new fence board and it
automatically<00:02:39.580> stays<00:02:40.000> Square<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.650> top

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
automatically stays Square to the top

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.260 
automatically stays Square to the top
what<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:43.870> do<00:02:44.050> is<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:44.500> shoot<00:02:44.950> those<00:02:45.190> on<00:02:45.430> with<00:02:45.700> 16

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
what I do is I shoot those on with 16

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.030 
what I do is I shoot those on with 16
gauge<00:02:47.250> galvanized<00:02:48.250> pins<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:50.230> in<00:02:50.770> a<00:02:50.860> real

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
gauge galvanized pins and in a real

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.950 
gauge galvanized pins and in a real
windy<00:02:51.460> area<00:02:51.790> then<00:02:52.000> I'll<00:02:52.180> screw<00:02:52.480> everything

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
windy area then I'll screw everything

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.620 
windy area then I'll screw everything
together<00:02:53.140> after<00:02:53.740> that<00:02:53.920> but<00:02:54.220> it's<00:02:55.060> nice<00:02:55.300> to<00:02:55.510> use

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
together after that but it's nice to use

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.730 
together after that but it's nice to use
pins<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.110> start<00:02:56.500> with<00:02:56.710> because<00:02:58.410> if<00:02:59.410> you<00:02:59.590> need

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
pins to start with because if you need

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.540 
pins to start with because if you need
to<00:02:59.890> take<00:03:00.070> anything<00:03:00.340> apart<00:03:00.550> it's<00:03:00.940> easy<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:02.550> on

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
to take anything apart it's easy and on

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.580 
to take anything apart it's easy and on
top<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:03.880> these<00:03:04.240> little<00:03:04.480> sections<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:05.140> left<00:03:05.380> them

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
top of these little sections I left them

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.170 
top of these little sections I left them
to<00:03:05.650> sit<00:03:05.860> up<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.130> little<00:03:06.160> bit<00:03:06.520> so<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.820> can<00:03:06.880> put<00:03:07.150> a

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
to sit up a little bit so I can put a

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.590 
to sit up a little bit so I can put a
post<00:03:07.450> cap<00:03:07.750> on<00:03:07.990> that<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:09.130> seal<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.610> water<00:03:09.850> from

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
post cap on that to seal the water from

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.770 
post cap on that to seal the water from
coming<00:03:10.810> in<00:03:11.110> here<00:03:11.380> it's<00:03:11.530> more<00:03:11.830> than<00:03:11.980> decorative

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
coming in here it's more than decorative

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.240 
coming in here it's more than decorative
also<00:03:13.780> make<00:03:14.170> sure<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.470> get<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.680> coat<00:03:14.920> of<00:03:15.070> paint

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
also make sure you get a coat of paint

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.670 
also make sure you get a coat of paint
on<00:03:15.550> that<00:03:15.820> or<00:03:16.030> something<00:03:16.420> if<00:03:16.600> you've<00:03:16.810> so<00:03:17.320> I<00:03:17.350> like

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
on that or something if you've so I like

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.330 
on that or something if you've so I like
to<00:03:17.710> put<00:03:17.980> stain<00:03:18.250> on<00:03:18.490> if<00:03:19.390> you<00:03:19.750> cut<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:20.290> so<00:03:21.160> that

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
to put stain on if you cut it so that

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.450 
to put stain on if you cut it so that
the<00:03:21.960> water<00:03:22.960> doesn't<00:03:23.110> have<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.590> chance<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:24.130> soak

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
the water doesn't have a chance to soak

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.520 
the water doesn't have a chance to soak
into<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.970> even<00:03:25.270> if<00:03:25.390> it's<00:03:25.570> treated<00:03:26.110> wood<00:03:26.290> when

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
into it even if it's treated wood when

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.100 
into it even if it's treated wood when
you<00:03:26.650> cut<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.070> it's<00:03:28.030> not<00:03:28.210> so<00:03:28.480> treated<00:03:28.870> in<00:03:29.020> the

middle it's only treated you're on the

middle it's only treated you're on the
outside<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.870> let's<00:03:35.560> see<00:03:35.800> what<00:03:36.010> else<00:03:36.190> do<00:03:36.460> I

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
outside and let's see what else do I

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.170 
outside and let's see what else do I
want<00:03:36.550> to<00:03:36.820> tell<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.210> I<00:03:37.950> guess<00:03:38.950> not<00:03:39.190> much<00:03:39.400> after

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
want to tell you I guess not much after

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.910 
want to tell you I guess not much after
that<00:03:40.210> a<00:03:40.390> little<00:03:40.810> bit<00:03:40.930> of<00:03:41.050> Education<00:03:41.740> you

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
that a little bit of Education you

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.180 
that a little bit of Education you
should<00:03:42.130> be<00:03:42.280> ready<00:03:42.460> to<00:03:42.990> go<00:03:43.990> and<00:03:44.590> support<00:03:45.070> your

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
should be ready to go and support your

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.760 
should be ready to go and support your
local<00:03:45.370> lumberyard<00:03:45.910> try<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:46.990> stay<00:03:47.200> local<00:03:47.620> if

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
local lumberyard try and stay local if

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.890 
local lumberyard try and stay local if
you<00:03:47.920> can<00:03:48.900> nothing<00:03:49.900> against<00:03:51.900> multinationals

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
you can nothing against multinationals

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.480 
you can nothing against multinationals
but<00:03:53.200> if<00:03:53.320> you've<00:03:53.470> got<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.650> local<00:03:54.160> lumberyard

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
but if you've got a local lumberyard

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.220 
but if you've got a local lumberyard
that<00:03:54.910> does<00:03:55.120> their<00:03:55.330> best<00:03:55.510> to<00:03:55.690> bring<00:03:55.960> everything

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
that does their best to bring everything

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.850 
that does their best to bring everything
in<00:03:56.730> then<00:03:57.730> maybe<00:03:58.570> it's<00:03:58.780> wise<00:03:59.020> to<00:03:59.290> support<00:03:59.680> them

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
in then maybe it's wise to support them

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.750 
in then maybe it's wise to support them
at<00:04:00.010> least<00:04:00.130> that's<00:04:00.460> what<00:04:00.940> I<00:04:00.970> try<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:01.420> do<00:04:01.660> I

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
at least that's what I try and do I

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.370 
at least that's what I try and do I
might<00:04:03.760> share<00:04:04.000> from<00:04:04.240> every<00:04:04.540> lumberyard<00:04:05.080> so<00:04:05.350> I

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
might share from every lumberyard so I

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.670 
might share from every lumberyard so I
guess<00:04:05.620> nobody<00:04:06.360> goes<00:04:07.360> out<00:04:07.600> of<00:04:07.780> how<00:04:08.170> to<00:04:08.230> business

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
guess nobody goes out of how to business

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.280 
guess nobody goes out of how to business
with<00:04:08.890> me<00:04:09.100> but<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.520> try<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:09.730> support<00:04:10.090> local

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
with me but I try and support local

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.840 
with me but I try and support local
Manakin<00:04:11.760> all<00:04:12.760> right<00:04:13.200> that's<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.380> fence<00:04:14.850> it's

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
Manakin all right that's the fence it's

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.729
