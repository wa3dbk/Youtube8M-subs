also the pixel pitch now what that is is

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.889 
also the pixel pitch now what that is is
you<00:00:35.340> know<00:00:35.430> how<00:00:35.670> dense<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.149> actual<00:00:36.480> pixels<00:00:36.780> are

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
you know how dense the actual pixels are

you know how dense the actual pixels are
it's<00:00:37.129> 0.26<00:00:38.129> now<00:00:38.820> that's<00:00:39.059> actually<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> very<00:00:39.750> I

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
up two of these and then mount them on

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.730 
up two of these and then mount them on
the<00:01:14.549> lean<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> arms<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.509> they<00:01:16.110> swivel<00:01:16.409> and

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the lean of the arms and they swivel and

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.170 
the lean of the arms and they swivel and
you've<00:01:17.040> got<00:01:17.189> two<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.490> these<00:01:17.580> running<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.090> know

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
you've got two of these running you know

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.550 
you've got two of these running you know
dual<00:01:18.420> monitors<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.840> put<00:01:18.990> something<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.320> one

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
dual monitors you put something on one

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.780 
dual monitors you put something on one
screen<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:20.009> something<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> other<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.670> go

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
screen but something on the other you go

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.999 
screen but something on the other you go
back<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.090> forth<00:01:21.180> very<00:01:21.840> very<00:01:22.229> easy<00:01:22.409> now<00:01:22.799> let<00:01:22.950> me

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
back and forth very very easy now let me

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.109 
back and forth very very easy now let me
show<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> inputs<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:23.850> one<00:01:24.000> it's

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
show you the inputs on this one it's

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.700 
show you the inputs on this one it's
it's<00:01:24.299> got<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.720> flipped<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.320> around<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.590> I'm

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
it's got I flipped it around and I'm

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.590 
it's got I flipped it around and I'm
taking<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.040> base<00:01:26.189> off<00:01:26.430> here<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> can

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
taking the base off here and so I can

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.550 
taking the base off here and so I can
