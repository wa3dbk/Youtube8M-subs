00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.260
 I 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.970
 he 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.090
 hi everyone knows of the game of 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.789
 girls hero and today we get 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.130
 found on call of duty 4 for you 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.289
 present a mode you do not know 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.149
 maybe not or not sure 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.550
 since it is a mode that is very little 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:34.180
 played right now so it's called the 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.970
 aliens mode so this is a mode like his 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.820
 the indicated name composed of alien and also 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:44.739
 of conventional military so that can 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.989
 to be marines or russians so 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.510
 in this mode you have two teams 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.710
 as usual and in fact it is played 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.619
 in team death match 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.010
 so what is the particularity of this 

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:56.920
 fashion 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.420
 first I will start with gravity 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.309
 so in fact gravity she is 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.040
 modified on this game so what is that 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.330
 I mean by gravity and well in fact 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.070
 that's what you see there so it's 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.140
 the jumps so for example you jump 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.909
 in the normal game it's a little jump 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.729
 classic and there actually seen that the 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.549
 gravity is altered eh well you fly 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:19.119
 literally on tens of meters 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.670
 which is quite interesting that it is 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.830
 when you're on the side of the aliens so 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.960
 on the side of the aliens you have small 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.390
 things that are changed of course for 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.670
 to do well aliens so for example 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.530
 apart from the jumps that are with a 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.540
 different gravity like on a planet 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.040
 finally like on a planet not like the 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.150
 ours rather like on the moon by 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.680
 example you have modified weapons so 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.990
 when you are on the alien side you have 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.979
 that two or three weapons it depends on the 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.460
 fashion because actually there you have the 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.979
 m4 with the laser balls so it makes a 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.320
 blue flash and a lighter really a 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.090
 laser noise then you have the 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.250
 laser sniper so in secondary weapons 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.979
 it's mandatory every time so 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.630
 you have these two weapons there and I know 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.970
 more if it's on this mode then the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.369
 3.31 mode or another mode 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.670
 since before I was playing on 2.0 mode 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.260
 we had a rocket launcher so I did not 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.110
 had time to see if there was a 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.930
 rocket launcher on this mode 3.31 but in 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.080
 anyway I know that there is who has the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.800
 laser sniper and then the m4 the laser m4 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.290
 so I tested this mode on a map where 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.480
 there was nobody on the server on 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.980
 an empty server like that I was 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.140
 quiet I could do everything 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.190
 I wanted to introduce you 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.870
 this mode so the map so it's a map 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.150
 really very different from what you 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.040
 you usually see is proof 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.239
 not even a map as you see when 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.810
 I'm in the menu it's small 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:54.079
 squares it's just because it's a 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.810
 map word words of old-fashioned ones we're going 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.760
 say is in celebration so this map she is 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.100
 really nice since it's actually 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.110
 like a kind of space station 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.890
 finally not really a space station 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.130
 but 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.140
 a kind of futuristic factory and we are 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.590
 in the sky so we are if we go out of 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.020
 the map 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.920
 Well there is no there's nothing for us 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:19.250
 stop we can really fall so there 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.140
 you see well and then there is 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.660
 really high quality scenery 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.830
 so I do not know what you think 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.870
 but frankly I find that 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.020
 really nice 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.370
 the colors are really nice 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:35.450
 many things that are of quality 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.130
 then what do I have to say to you 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.050
 in this mode so when you're from 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.190
 side of the navies now or 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.920
 Russian and well the difference is that 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.290
 in fact you have you do not have the 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.019
 gravity and you have all the weapons 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.630
 automatically in gold finally not all 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.370
 weapons and all the weapons 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.750
 we will say of each category as on 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.850
 that finally on call of duty 4 you have 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.340
 used to see that once we have 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.150
 all unlocked on on each weapon a 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.140
 category of weapons 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:10.579
 we get the main army in gold so 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.610
 it can be the rifle ak-47 the m60 and 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:15.410
 the sweep an offer I believe 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.870
 So here you have those weapons 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.700
 automatically gold weapons and 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.640
 all the challenges unblocked for 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.820
 what mode and what do you have 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.350
 others e you all have 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.120
 accessories and all camouflages 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.090
 unlock so that really does it 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.180
 nice thing and in addition to conclude 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.590
 I show you a little the menu so the 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.870
 menu edit so that's you 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.400
 may recall the movie alien so 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.660
 with the monsters and where so that's 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.250
 really something very different 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.400
 it changes the experience on call of duty 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.169
 and it could really be good that I 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.870
 give the address so to have 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.730
 the server address you go on my 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.610
 chain and you find the video aliens 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:05:00.020
 in in my videos and I'll put you 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:03.260
 the link finally not the link but the number 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.720
 from the server the ip address of the server in 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.710
 the description of the video 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.240
 so that's it so I think I have 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.270
 ended up with the presentation of this mode 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.890
 I hope you enjoyed and that 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.480
 you may go on this server is 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.010
 maybe we will cross that was 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.720
 so I tell you see you soon all 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.720
 world greets bye bye to more everyone
