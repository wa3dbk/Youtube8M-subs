about<00:01:34.590> seven<00:01:34.979> hours<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.400> total<00:01:35.790> use<00:01:35.939> into

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
about seven hours of total use into

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.109 
about seven hours of total use into
these<00:01:36.479> headphones<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:38.130> terms<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.670> comfort

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
these headphones and in terms of comfort

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.969 
these headphones and in terms of comfort
they're<00:01:39.299> actually<00:01:39.689> pretty<00:01:39.900> comfortable<00:01:40.140> they

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
they're actually pretty comfortable they

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.800 
they're actually pretty comfortable they
do<00:01:41.040> way<00:01:41.400> more<00:01:41.640> than<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.909> thought<00:01:42.090> they<00:01:42.270> would<00:01:42.450> so

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
do way more than I thought they would so

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.149 
do way more than I thought they would so
to<00:01:42.869> me<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.200> was<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.740> little<00:01:43.829> bit<00:01:44.009> of

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
to me that was just a little bit of

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.590 
to me that was just a little bit of
knowing<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.880> guess<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.420> should<00:01:45.570> have

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
knowing but I guess I should have

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.149 
knowing but I guess I should have
expected<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.200> considering<00:01:46.829> these<00:01:46.979> are

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
expected that considering these are

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.069 
expected that considering these are
metal<00:01:47.880> headphones<00:01:50.299> now<00:01:51.299> if<00:01:51.479> i<00:01:51.570> zoom<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.990> a

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
metal headphones now if i zoom in a

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.139 
metal headphones now if i zoom in a
little<00:01:52.200> bit<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:52.710> see<00:01:52.950> here<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.759> I

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
little bit you can see here on the I

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.330 
little bit you can see here on the I
believe<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> left<00:01:55.079> ear<00:01:55.350> cup<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:56.280> the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
the reviews on this a little bit through

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.650

on dealextreme and other people were
experiencing<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.440> issue<00:03:13.650> some<00:03:14.430> people

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
experiencing this issue some people

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.240 
experiencing this issue some people
weren't<00:03:14.940> but<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.140> right<00:03:16.560> headphone<00:03:17.010> is

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
weren't but the right headphone is

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.819 
weren't but the right headphone is
noticeably<00:03:18.060> louder<00:03:18.239> than<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.720> left<00:03:18.930> one<00:03:19.019> now

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
noticeably louder than the left one now

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.830 
noticeably louder than the left one now
I<00:03:20.220> have<00:03:20.400> used<00:03:20.669> these<00:03:20.849> for<00:03:21.000> about<00:03:21.090> seven<00:03:21.569> hours

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
I have used these for about seven hours

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.920 
I have used these for about seven hours
in<00:03:22.049> total<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:23.220> audio<00:03:23.790> levels<00:03:24.419> weren't

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
in total and the audio levels weren't

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.050 
in total and the audio levels weren't
getting<00:03:25.470> any<00:03:25.620> better<00:03:25.859> so<00:03:26.609> I<00:03:26.639> guess<00:03:26.849> that's

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
getting any better so I guess that's

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.580 
getting any better so I guess that's
just<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.450> way<00:03:27.569> they<00:03:27.720> were<00:03:27.780> made<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.079> don't<00:03:28.470> know

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
just the way they were made I don't know

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.440 
just the way they were made I don't know
if<00:03:28.769> there<00:03:28.919> was<00:03:29.010> an<00:03:29.160> issue<00:03:29.400> in<00:03:29.700> manufacturing

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
if there was an issue in manufacturing

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.020 
if there was an issue in manufacturing
or<00:03:30.630> if<00:03:31.230> they<00:03:31.349> were<00:03:31.410> just<00:03:31.500> lazy<00:03:31.829> or<00:03:32.280> whatever<00:03:32.940> I

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
or if they were just lazy or whatever I

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.789 
or if they were just lazy or whatever I
have<00:03:33.239> no<00:03:33.389> idea<00:03:33.660> why<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.049> would<00:03:34.290> be<00:03:34.319> like<00:03:34.560> that

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
have no idea why it would be like that

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.860 
have no idea why it would be like that
but<00:03:35.400> these<00:03:35.790> are<00:03:35.940> fake<00:03:36.150> products<00:03:36.599> so<00:03:36.690> I'm<00:03:36.780> not

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
but these are fake products so I'm not

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.080 
but these are fake products so I'm not
expecting<00:03:37.019> everything<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.799> be<00:03:37.919> perfect<00:03:38.340> but

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
expecting everything to be perfect but

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.330 
expecting everything to be perfect but
this<00:03:39.750> moves<00:03:40.139> on<00:03:40.319> to<00:03:40.349> my<00:03:40.590> next<00:03:40.859> issue<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.280> that

this moves on to my next issue and that

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.879 
this moves on to my next issue and that
is<00:03:41.549> with<00:03:41.790> audio<00:03:42.299> quality<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:43.260> overall<00:03:43.620> audio

highs are very poor they're a bit dull

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.020 
highs are very poor they're a bit dull

mids and highs they're not clear they

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.319 
mids and highs they're not clear they
just<00:03:53.010> don't<00:03:53.160> sound<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.579> good<00:03:53.849> nothing<00:03:54.180> is

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329

just don't sound that good nothing is
really<00:03:54.569> separated<00:03:55.139> nothing<00:03:55.440> as<00:03:55.560> well<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.889> find

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
really separated nothing as well to find

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.190 
really separated nothing as well to find
I<00:03:56.459> will<00:03:57.000> say<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:57.329> these<00:03:57.450> headphones<00:03:57.660> do<00:03:58.079> have

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
I will say that these headphones do have

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.009 
I will say that these headphones do have
plenty<00:03:58.379> of<00:03:58.560> bass<00:03:58.790> so<00:03:59.790> if<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.269> like<00:04:00.540> listening

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
plenty of bass so if you like listening

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.839 
plenty of bass so if you like listening
to<00:04:01.200> rap<00:04:01.470> or<00:04:01.709> hip-hop<00:04:01.919> then<00:04:02.370> these<00:04:02.519> headphones

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
to rap or hip-hop then these headphones

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.809 
to rap or hip-hop then these headphones
will<00:04:03.540> be<00:04:03.629> pretty<00:04:03.870> good<00:04:04.049> for<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.319> but<00:04:05.310> in<00:04:05.519> terms

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
will be pretty good for you but in terms

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.309 
will be pretty good for you but in terms
of<00:04:05.970> clarity<00:04:06.359> there's<00:04:06.569> just<00:04:06.750> not<00:04:06.870> much<00:04:07.019> there

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
of clarity there's just not much there

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.140 
of clarity there's just not much there
it's<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:07.829> was<00:04:08.069> just<00:04:08.250> very<00:04:08.430> disappointed<00:04:09.060> with

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
it's I was just very disappointed with

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150 
it's I was just very disappointed with
the<00:04:09.269> audio<00:04:09.510> quality<00:04:09.690> I<00:04:10.139> know<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.919> these<00:04:11.040> are

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
the audio quality I know that these are

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.069 
the audio quality I know that these are
fake<00:04:11.310> headphones<00:04:11.760> but<00:04:11.970> at<00:04:12.150> $100<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:12.900> was

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
fake headphones but at $100 I was

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.099 
fake headphones but at $100 I was
expecting<00:04:13.650> decent<00:04:14.430> audio<00:04:14.760> quality<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.359> to<00:04:15.989> me

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
expecting decent audio quality and to me

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.779 
expecting decent audio quality and to me
I<00:04:16.139> wasn't<00:04:16.620> even<00:04:16.799> getting<00:04:16.949> that<00:04:17.190> out<00:04:17.489> of<00:04:17.699> these

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
I wasn't even getting that out of these

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.060 
I wasn't even getting that out of these
headphones<00:04:18.269> so<00:04:18.660> in<00:04:19.019> terms<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.650> audio<00:04:19.889> quality

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
headphones so in terms of audio quality

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.430 
headphones so in terms of audio quality
lots<00:04:20.789> of<00:04:20.910> bass<00:04:21.090> but<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.630> audio<00:04:21.870> is<00:04:21.930> just<00:04:22.079> dull

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
lots of bass but the audio is just dull

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.390 
lots of bass but the audio is just dull
and<00:04:23.360> nothing<00:04:24.360> is<00:04:24.479> just<00:04:24.630> really<00:04:24.870> that<00:04:25.050> clay

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
and nothing is just really that clay

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.730 
and nothing is just really that clay
it's<00:04:25.550> just<00:04:25.759> sort<00:04:25.910> of<00:04:26.030> bad<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:26.870> I<00:04:27.229> guess<00:04:27.500> if<00:04:27.650> you

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
it's just sort of bad so I guess if you

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.050 
it's just sort of bad so I guess if you
listen<00:04:28.009> to<00:04:28.070> rap<00:04:28.220> or<00:04:28.400> hip-hop<00:04:28.580> where<00:04:28.910> there's

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
listen to rap or hip-hop where there's

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.689 
listen to rap or hip-hop where there's
not<00:04:29.210> where<00:04:30.080> it's<00:04:30.199> more<00:04:30.350> vocal<00:04:30.800> ish<00:04:31.009> and<00:04:31.310> it's

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
not where it's more vocal ish and it's

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.430 
not where it's more vocal ish and it's
sort<00:04:32.000> of<00:04:32.060> more<00:04:32.479> focused<00:04:32.900> on<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.199> bass<00:04:33.410> and

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
sort of more focused on the bass and

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.230 
sort of more focused on the bass and
things<00:04:33.860> like<00:04:34.070> that<00:04:34.280> and<00:04:34.820> I<00:04:34.910> guess<00:04:35.060> these

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
things like that and I guess these

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.610 
things like that and I guess these
headphones<00:04:35.449> would<00:04:35.750> be<00:04:35.870> good<00:04:36.020> for<00:04:36.289> you

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
headphones would be good for you

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.860 
headphones would be good for you
even<00:04:36.979> these<00:04:37.100> fake<00:04:37.370> ones<00:04:37.400> as<00:04:37.820> opposed<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.780> the

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
even these fake ones as opposed to the

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.590 
even these fake ones as opposed to the
real<00:04:39.050> ones<00:04:39.370> they<00:04:40.370> look<00:04:40.550> cool<00:04:40.759> so<00:04:41.150> I<00:04:41.180> guess<00:04:41.419> if

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
real ones they look cool so I guess if

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.210 
real ones they look cool so I guess if
you<00:04:41.690> wanted<00:04:41.900> to<00:04:42.020> buy<00:04:42.139> these<00:04:42.199> to<00:04:42.620> look<00:04:42.770> cool<00:04:42.949> if

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
you wanted to buy these to look cool if

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.770 
you wanted to buy these to look cool if
you're<00:04:43.400> if<00:04:43.880> you<00:04:43.970> want<00:04:44.120> to<00:04:44.180> put<00:04:44.300> these<00:04:44.389> on<00:04:44.570> while

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
you're if you want to put these on while

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.140 
you're if you want to put these on while
walking<00:04:44.990> around<00:04:45.289> campus<00:04:45.530> then<00:04:46.100> I<00:04:46.400> guess<00:04:47.120> that

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
walking around campus then I guess that

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.900 
walking around campus then I guess that
would<00:04:47.539> be<00:04:47.840> a<00:04:48.110> good<00:04:48.289> option<00:04:48.680> for<00:04:48.710> you<00:04:48.979> and<00:04:49.220> it's

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
would be a good option for you and it's

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.400 
would be a good option for you and it's
an<00:04:50.060> affordable<00:04:50.330> one<00:04:50.720> I<00:04:50.750> suppose

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
an affordable one I suppose

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.040 
an affordable one I suppose
but<00:04:51.979> overall<00:04:52.490> I'm<00:04:52.910> not<00:04:53.120> very<00:04:53.300> satisfied<00:04:53.840> with

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050

these<00:04:54.199> headphones<00:04:54.410> so<00:04:54.830> I'm<00:04:54.919> gonna<00:04:55.070> go<00:04:55.160> ahead
