00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.940
 quickly about ride on it in the end 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:38.239

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:05.790

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.220
 installed an animated player mod yes he 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.110

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:17.700
 realistic so what else is here yes we are 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.980
 Of course, the parachute is also behind me, I think you 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.970
 noticed but for the time being we don't use it 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.010
 we will see first what we have 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.980

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.180
 that why are we no shorter for me I need 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.510

 just trudge axis honestly everything is very 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:15.720
 beautiful very beautiful yes I did not think 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.739
 so that you can improve minekravt 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.669

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:24.780
 yes guys everything is possible everything 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:29.370
 maybe here I immediately notice this 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:32.010
 the dam is the dam as I know it all from 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.050
 san andreas cool enough all 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.419
 copied, I think it's great 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:42.000
 Well done developers, of course, without 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.370
 super build too hard too 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.180
 get such an effect 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:51.139
 but as they say everything is possible our time 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:54.750
 let's look further our miracle city 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:57.810
 just super big huge bridge yes 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.650
 cool bridge here such bridges 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:04.000
 enough 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.990
 so then guys i thought 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.509
 appeared 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:17.970
 and the idea to take such a blow yes finish 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:21.580
 like this or there is part of the bridge destroyed 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.620
 how do i love somewhere in minecraft it 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.220
 looks much better 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:31.530
 much cooler 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.530
 buildings will destroy u and 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.780
 super super super super but you need 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.820

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.889

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:23.320
 the helicopter is not real, of course 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:25.780
 helicopter but still but still here 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.490

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.190
 many know what the building is here 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:34.199
 races were held 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:37.479
 I will give yes all this from san andreas 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:42.039
 look further look further here an hour 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:45.760
 the bridge i destroyed it is good too but we 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:48.659
 probably returning home if I find 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:51.400
 of course, but what is there to find 

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:53.620
 the city is big enough i'm sure you 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.750
 You will find what to do in it especially with 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:07:01.539
 This is the assembly of mods disconnect and 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.919
 jump here and so let's still try 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:06.099
 a couple of guns 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:08.990
 Well, for starters, of course, my favorite is he 

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:18.150
 I don't like this bridge 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:28.610

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:34.890

 This is a super assembly 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:43.290
 I advise everyone to try 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:46.260
