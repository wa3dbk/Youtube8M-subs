00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
you're going down the freeway when it's

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.940 
you're going down the freeway when it's
wet<00:02:18.989> or<00:02:19.140> cold<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:21.380> don't<00:02:22.380> know<00:02:22.590> what<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.800> gear

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
wet or cold I don't know what the gear

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.770 
wet or cold I don't know what the gear
ratio<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.400> but<00:02:23.580> it's<00:02:23.700> geared<00:02:23.910> low<00:02:24.120> for<00:02:24.330> offroad

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
so he stays off the freeway

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.970
