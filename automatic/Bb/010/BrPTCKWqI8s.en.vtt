00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.340
 Welcome friends to another 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.290
 kreisfusion secret challenge 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.420
 We book in the event in the center 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.210
 few meters on the track park and ride 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.980
 drive around the challenge game set and 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.660
 victory to complete we have to 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.460
 win tennis and not 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.800
 against a human but against you 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.269
 penguin I have no idea what that 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.010
 Developers here with the penguins have 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.240
 in this game sometime for me 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.830
 no sense last time it was yes 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.480
 saves the squirrel that's fit 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.550
 I'm sorry is definitely 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.180
 Squirrel at the last time in a trance 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.710
 evolution 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.110
 this time, a penguin i know 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.489
 not why with red wings yes red lux 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.140
 it is clear to me last time 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.129
 makes that my are after little 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.989
 but youtube maybe you would like 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.930
 just plead with every animal 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.940
 give in their games and 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.640
 accordingly are just everywhere 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.230
 penguins and we are looking for 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.129
 a tennis court is already there and 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.940
 here must cost now once 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:04.170
 then the screen will stay black 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.030
 and we can fight a penguin 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.040
 playing tennis that's pretty funny 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.810
 but not so easy honestly 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.540
 said you think so penguin is only 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.770
 with nothing can but it is somehow 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.270
 a little bit harder than you think 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.860
 because on the one hand you have to beat that 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.799
 reasonable topics as you have seen 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.250
 it's all a bit earlier 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.340
 better 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.990
 I'll say after coming up soon 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.310
 is one has a short time window and 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.950
 which you can beat if you are late 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.780
 beats then it is just final problem 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.490
 is just the whole thing that I am 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.920
 I do not have it out for so 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.540
 often played this game 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.780
 I just can not figure out like me 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.399
 can play the ball somewhere else 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.770
 My husband always plays happily 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.270
 the middle and as long as the penguin the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.630
 center is available each would naturally ball 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:58.649
 catch is clear and higher 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.180
 that really is not easy and me 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.860
 I said I have all the typical ones 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.479
 tried it out with the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.020
 Stick somehow to do something is bring 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.329
 everything nothing 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.789
 My husband always plays in the middle 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.190
 Always nice to open the penguin 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.700
 I mean 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.840
 and accordingly you can be so in here 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.010
 The form does not win or I am 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.330
 just too cheap now is ours 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.640
 chance if he demands now he gets 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.870
 her again if he serves from the outside 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.040
 then you usually get one 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.170
 point because he is not fast enough in the 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.470
 middle comes but it is not the 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.470
 sense of the thing 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.670
 the ass is looking forward to everything honestly 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.470
 I do not know somehow possible 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.360
 be where to play it differently 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.560
 I just scratch a nose each one 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.660
 That was risky 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.750
 what would have been if boris becker himself 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.580
 would then scraped into swarmed nose 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.990
 and did not make the becker pike 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.940
 namely , I'm on a needle 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:06.620
 then you will not become like me 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.750
 I have no idea unfortunately how 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.370
 I play here somewhere else than in the 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.050
 middle if someone owns this game 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.500
 and then this challenge sometimes makes 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.489
 Can he explain how to please me 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.489
 plays somewhere else than in the middle 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.160
 The stupid ass anyway the ball 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.150
 even though he is on the edge 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.190
 here most likely not to 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:34.459
 null null So round to round 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.950
 my kind of hurt a bit 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.980
 I touch my nose again 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.709
 why did my nose have to damn now 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.820
 it's supposed to be too late again 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.310
 reasonably middle of the way 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.600
 corresponding now is our chance 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.980
 we can get a point now 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:55.120
 I 'm friends, yes 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.120
 we have a point 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.340
 what a shame 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.060
 so now feel solo again is now 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.610
 conclusion is simply enough yes yes yes 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.360
 well i 'm sorry i know but beside 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:17.359
 the track to the end europe book caution 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:21.890
 and as I said if you just save 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.680
 we have the strength to have someone this 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.780
 masters or challenges 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.370
 Find out how to make the ball too 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.440
 can play somewhere else than in the 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.250
 middle then please in the comments and 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.460
 then I will be in one of the next 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.840
 challenge the video now 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.500
 Of course there are a few more here 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.280
 There is still some secret talent 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.870
 I will do it again very fast 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.910
 If I do that again quickly 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.860
 Run as rich as you possibly can 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.480
 Here indeed elsewhere 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.650
 can play as in the middle makes 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.880
 Of course, little sense if we do the whole thing 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.520
 time in the middle plays then the 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.990
 of course, set it up 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.090
 Well you know in any case like it 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.680
 here is the tennis game against 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.600
 You can try the penguin yourself 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.130
 if you own this game otherwise 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.990
 See you next time in here 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.490
 a transfusion challenge or 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.350
 just in the singleplayer campaign ever 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.640
 after what your bock have 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.229

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.669
 do not know maybe revolution ' 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.900
