00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.430
 hello hello my beautiful I hope 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:10.639
 they find very well do not scare that 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.040
 I am without makeup but this video is 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.060
 for those who do not like 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.550
 make up so much but need to see 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:22.340
 very beautiful arrangements very natural to 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.530
 this makeup is called makeup no 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.160
 maker so let's start 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.320
 so that the skin looks more natural I will 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.960
 moisturize it very well this cream is from the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.030
 body shop and it's vitamin e place 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.550
 already first on my face and then with 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.440
 my fingers I'm going to put it to touch 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.260
 like poking it into the pores 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.920
 I'll start by applying my concealer from 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:52.670
 yesterday and it is a tone very similar to me 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.190
 skin tone if it is something a tone to what 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.190
 better below and I'll start covering 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.699
 dark circles and acne marks that I have in 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.699
 my face 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.450
 since I have all the zones 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.160
 corrector covers I'm going to blur it 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.860
 very well with my fingers I think it's the 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.530
 best tool since we heat the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.410
 product and it's easier to blur it 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.840
 we do not steal so much product and what 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.550
 come I'm taking part of my eyelid 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.970
 to match tones and not look so 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.370
 dark and then I will blur 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.770
 also the marquitas without taking us 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:41.399
 so much product this is a little touch 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.740
 now seal in all my proofreader and with 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.439
 my brush I will be using this 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.530
 mineral powder of citi color which is very 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.590
 very finite and it will give me one more aspect 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.009
 natural and I will place it in all the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.009
 face 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.860
 with a bronze in matt tone I will begin to 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.440
 give contour to my face and then with 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.680
 help from my finger I will define my nose 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.899
 and I'm going to pull the same sunscreen 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.349
 the basin to make the eye bigger 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.780
 I have a very populated eyebrow so I do not 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.870
 it is necessary to fill in the diary 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.840
 so I'm just going to brush the and 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.689
 Then I will light my face 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.640
 this is a visu illuminator and also 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:29.010
 I will place it in the part of the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.370
 lacrimal and the part of the bone of the 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.370
 eyebrow 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.080
 I will start applying my mascara this is 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.240
 disarm drama queen and as you know me 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.570
 leaves huge eyelashes only 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.110
 I need a layer to see the difference 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.330
 totally change the look 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.020
 I always put my lips and I'm 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.570
 using an ido is and this is one of 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.540
 my favorites later I will apply a touch 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.720
 very subtle blush is a coral tone is 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.110
 the number one of visu and now I will apply 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.030
 a very subtle glitter very little 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.310
 love because it is very natural 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.050
