that too you will want to note most

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.369 
that too you will want to note most
likely<00:00:57.610> have<00:00:57.760> another<00:00:58.089> reactor<00:00:58.659> and<00:00:59.019> then<00:00:59.170> get

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
likely have another reactor and then get

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.110 
likely have another reactor and then get
some<00:00:59.620> melon<00:00:59.949> and<00:01:00.100> everything<00:01:00.550> make<00:01:00.730> a<00:01:00.760> melon

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
some melon and everything make a melon

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.600 
some melon and everything make a melon
farm<00:01:01.420> so<00:01:01.780> then<00:01:01.960> you<00:01:02.260> can<00:01:02.500> do<00:01:02.769> this<00:01:03.010> so<00:01:03.460> then

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
farm so then you can do this so then

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.429 
farm so then you can do this so then
people<00:01:03.790> can<00:01:04.119> break<00:01:04.299> the<00:01:04.479> melon<00:01:04.809> on<00:01:04.960> their<00:01:05.560> way

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
people can break the melon on their way

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.719 
people can break the melon on their way
next<00:01:08.439> it's<00:01:08.590> your<00:01:08.680> choice<00:01:09.039> you<00:01:09.340> can<00:01:09.520> make<00:01:09.579> a

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
next it's your choice you can make a

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.819 
next it's your choice you can make a
path<00:01:10.270> to<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.600> land<00:01:10.899> or<00:01:11.079> you<00:01:11.229> can<00:01:11.439> let<00:01:11.619> them

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:11.829 
path to the land or you can let them

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:13.859 
path to the land or you can let them
swim<00:01:12.159> there<00:01:12.399> or<00:01:12.609> if<00:01:12.729> you're<00:01:12.909> re<00:01:13.060> on<00:01:13.329> land<00:01:13.659> it

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
swim there or if you're re on land it

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.719 
swim there or if you're re on land it
doesn't<00:01:14.200> matter<00:01:14.380> like<00:01:15.100> I<00:01:15.250> said<00:01:15.490> it's<00:01:15.610> your

choice
and<00:01:18.520> oh<00:01:18.700> yeah<00:01:19.060> once<00:01:19.330> you<00:01:19.510> make<00:01:19.660> it<00:01:19.690> to<00:01:20.020> land<00:01:20.200> and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
and oh yeah once you make it to land and

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.290 
and oh yeah once you make it to land and
everything<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:22.750> you<00:01:23.230> know<00:01:23.350> you<00:01:23.440> can<00:01:24.300> do

and<00:01:30.050> I<00:01:30.320> since<00:01:30.710> I<00:01:30.800> just<00:01:30.860> kind<00:01:31.190> of<00:01:31.220> did<00:01:31.400> this<00:01:31.490> in

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
and I since I just kind of did this in

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.340 
and I since I just kind of did this in
Korean<00:01:32.000> mode<00:01:32.150> I<00:01:32.180> had<00:01:32.450> a<00:01:32.480> bunch<00:01:32.750> of<00:01:32.900> diamonds

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
Korean mode I had a bunch of diamonds

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.110 
Korean mode I had a bunch of diamonds
everywhere<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:33.980> in<00:01:34.220> case<00:01:34.430> people<00:01:35.080> got<00:01:36.080> a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
everywhere so in case people got a

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.980 
everywhere so in case people got a
diamond<00:01:38.120> pickaxe

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
diamond pickaxe

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.410 
diamond pickaxe
I<00:01:39.020> mean<00:01:39.860> iron<00:01:40.280> pickaxe<00:01:40.820> or<00:01:41.000> anything<00:01:41.210> that

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
I mean iron pickaxe or anything that

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.380 
I mean iron pickaxe or anything that
they<00:01:41.930> could<00:01:42.140> break<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.500> diamonds<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.390> we

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
they could break the diamonds and we

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.140 
they could break the diamonds and we
should<00:01:44.630> be<00:01:44.840> able<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.890> switch<00:01:46.190> in<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.850> next

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
should be able to switch in the next

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.440 
should be able to switch in the next
update<00:01:47.300> from<00:01:47.690> creative<00:01:48.260> mode<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:49.450> survival

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
update from creative mode to survival
