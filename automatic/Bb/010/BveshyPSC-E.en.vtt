00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
from there creating a long-term

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.840 
from there creating a long-term
relationship<00:00:57.960> with<00:00:58.770> them<00:00:58.949> allowed<00:00:59.340> us<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.550> do

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
relationship with them allowed us to do

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.790

this<00:01:00.059> three<00:01:00.690> miles<00:01:00.870> down<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.289> road<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.500> mean

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
this three miles down the road I mean

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
this three miles down the road I mean
it's<00:01:02.039> all<00:01:02.219> synergistic<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.120> each<00:01:03.270> other<00:01:03.539> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
it's all synergistic with each other and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.370 
it's all synergistic with each other and
I<00:01:04.350> think<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.250> know<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.960> visions

of<00:01:07.439> where<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.710> want<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.979> go<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.280> future

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
of where you want to go on the future

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.710 
of where you want to go on the future
you<00:01:08.670> kind<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.030> change<00:01:09.360> them<00:01:09.510> as<00:01:09.600> you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
you kind of have to change them as you

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.590 
you kind of have to change them as you
go<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.400> so<00:01:11.400> far<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:12.060> kind<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.420> gone

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
go but so far it's it's kind of gone

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.429 
go but so far it's it's kind of gone
