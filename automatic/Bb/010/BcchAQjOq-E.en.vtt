last year we saw the library section it
was<00:00:49.290> a<00:00:49.320> pretty<00:00:50.160> linear<00:00:50.370> compared<00:00:51.330> to<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:51.540> we

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
was a pretty linear compared to what we

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.440

stealth or a mix of the of the two types

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.460 
stealth or a mix of the of the two types
in<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.430> demo<00:01:50.670> we<00:01:51.240> saw<00:01:51.480> you<00:01:51.540> killing<00:01:52.170> all<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
in the demo we saw you killing all the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.380 
in the demo we saw you killing all the
targets<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:53.340> what<00:01:53.610> happens<00:01:53.640> if<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.180> kill

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
targets but what happens if you kill

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.310 
targets but what happens if you kill
innocents<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.080> example<00:01:55.560> well<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.320> what

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
innocents for example well that is what

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.590 
innocents for example well that is what
the<00:01:58.710> most<00:01:58.890> obvious<00:01:59.430> thing<00:02:00.030> that's<00:02:00.210> happened

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the most obvious thing that's happened

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.200 
the most obvious thing that's happened
is<00:02:00.690> that<00:02:00.900> your<00:02:01.140> score<00:02:01.530> gets<00:02:02.190> reflects<00:02:02.970> a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
is that your score gets reflects a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.920 
is that your score gets reflects a
reflex<00:02:03.990> you've<00:02:04.470> killing<00:02:04.950> civilians<00:02:05.580> and<00:02:05.930> it's

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
reflex you've killing civilians and it's

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.070 
reflex you've killing civilians and it's
a<00:02:07.729> we<00:02:08.729> don't<00:02:08.910> make<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> judgment<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.810> how<00:02:10.019> you

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
a we don't make a judgment on how you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.710 
a we don't make a judgment on how you
solve<00:02:10.530> your<00:02:11.060> assignment<00:02:12.060> which<00:02:12.269> is<00:02:12.300> taking

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
solve your assignment which is taking

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.360 
solve your assignment which is taking
out<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.959> targets<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.100> strength

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
out the targets and that is the strength

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.949 
out the targets and that is the strength
of<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.760> series<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.450> player<00:02:15.690> can<00:02:15.900> choose

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
of the series the player can choose

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.870 
of the series the player can choose
however<00:02:16.530> way<00:02:16.709> he<00:02:16.890> wants<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.280> play<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.700> game

fine we just want to give him the tools

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.990 
fine we just want to give him the tools
to<00:02:22.140> experience<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:23.040> rewarding<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:23.670> satisfying

gameplay no matter what he does but

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.699 
gameplay no matter what he does but
taking<00:02:27.480> out<00:02:27.630> civilians<00:02:28.140> it's<00:02:28.320> not<00:02:28.440> really<00:02:28.650> the

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
taking out civilians it's not really the

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.860 
taking out civilians it's not really the
most<00:02:28.920> elegant<00:02:29.370> way<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.549> doing<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.540> we<00:02:30.690> try

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
most elegant way of doing it so we try

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.070 
most elegant way of doing it so we try
to<00:02:30.900> reflect<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.860> score<00:02:32.220> for<00:02:32.850> in

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
to reflect that in the score for in

you guys also released the sniper
challenge<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.810> few<00:04:09.290> weeks<00:04:09.410> ago<00:04:09.650> this<00:04:10.040> has<00:04:10.790> been

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819

challenge a few weeks ago this has been
the<00:04:11.090> reception<00:04:11.569> so<00:04:11.810> far<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.920> reception<00:04:13.400> for

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
the reception so far the reception for

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.490 
the reception so far the reception for
the<00:04:13.910> hitman<00:04:14.300> sniper<00:04:14.330> challenge<00:04:14.720> which<00:04:15.200> is<00:04:15.319> our

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
the hitman sniper challenge which is our

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.740 
the hitman sniper challenge which is our
pre-order<00:04:16.070> incentive<00:04:16.609> has<00:04:16.940> been<00:04:17.239> exceptional

so<00:04:18.200> far<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:18.709> we<00:04:19.700> have<00:04:19.880> I<00:04:20.329> think<00:04:20.690> 18<00:04:21.440> million

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
so far and we have I think 18 million

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.640 
so far and we have I think 18 million
kills<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:22.639> Counting<00:04:23.240> right<00:04:23.389> now<00:04:23.570> which<00:04:24.139> is<00:04:24.169> a

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
kills and Counting right now which is a

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.450 
kills and Counting right now which is a
huge<00:04:25.460> amount<00:04:25.760> and<00:04:26.500> we<00:04:27.500> developed<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:28.250> sniper

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
huge amount and we developed the sniper

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.760 
huge amount and we developed the sniper
challenge<00:04:28.610> as<00:04:29.000> a<00:04:29.030> test<00:04:29.360> case<00:04:29.479> to<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.200> tooth<00:04:30.500> to

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
challenge as a test case to the tooth to

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.909

figure<00:04:31.310> out<00:04:31.400> how<00:04:31.669> sniper<00:04:32.330> would<00:04:32.990> work<00:04:33.290> in<00:04:33.710> our
