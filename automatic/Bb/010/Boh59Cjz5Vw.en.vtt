doing<00:00:35.850> there<00:00:36.060> is<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> couple<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.540> teaspoons<00:00:36.750> of

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
doing there is a couple of teaspoons of

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.220

that's the most humane way to dispatch
of<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> animal<00:01:21.290> otherwise<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.680> put<00:01:22.860> it

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
of the animal otherwise you can put it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.810 
of the animal otherwise you can put it
in<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.190> freezer<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:25.400> do<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.610> way

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
in the freezer and and do it that way

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.840 
in the freezer and and do it that way
and<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.210> puts<00:01:27.600> them<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> sleep<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:29.610> what<00:01:29.760> I'm

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
and and puts them to sleep so what I'm

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.080 
and and puts them to sleep so what I'm
doing<00:01:29.880> now<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.750> am<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.729> inserting<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
doing now is I am just inserting the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.789 
doing now is I am just inserting the
tail<00:01:33.390> with<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.690> skewer<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.440> reason<00:01:34.680> for

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
tail with the skewer and the reason for

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.399 
tail with the skewer and the reason for
that<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.190> it<00:01:35.549> will<00:01:35.640> come<00:01:35.850> out<00:01:36.140> nice<00:01:37.140> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
that is that it will come out nice and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.620 
that is that it will come out nice and
flat<00:01:37.650> as<00:01:37.920> opposed<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.610> curl<00:01:38.970> tails<00:01:39.360> that

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
flat as opposed to the curl tails that

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.250 
flat as opposed to the curl tails that
you<00:01:39.750> may<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:39.990> been<00:01:40.049> served<00:01:42.049> this<00:01:43.049> way<00:01:43.200> you

bisque in our next recipe so save the
shells<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.930> what<00:02:21.170> I'm<00:02:21.260> doing<00:02:21.290> now<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:21.800> just

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
shells so what I'm doing now is just

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.510 
shells so what I'm doing now is just
releasing<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.840> meat<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.410> basically<00:02:25.310> I'm

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
releasing the meat and basically I'm

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.790 
releasing the meat and basically I'm
just<00:02:25.550> blanching<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.480> tails<00:02:26.750> for<00:02:27.080> 30<00:02:27.380> seconds

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
just blanching the tails for 30 seconds

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.220 
just blanching the tails for 30 seconds
in<00:02:27.920> boiling<00:02:28.250> water<00:02:28.420> that<00:02:29.420> will<00:02:29.600> release<00:02:29.959> the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
in boiling water that will release the

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.229 
in boiling water that will release the
meat<00:02:30.530> from<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.890> shell<00:02:31.489> and<00:02:32.090> then<00:02:33.020> we<00:02:33.650> will

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
meat from the shell and then we will

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.640 
meat from the shell and then we will
shock<00:02:35.239> it<00:02:35.420> in<00:02:35.510> an<00:02:35.600> ice<00:02:35.720> bath<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.320> will

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
shock it in an ice bath and that will

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.960 
shock it in an ice bath and that will
prevent<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.100> from<00:02:37.130> cooking<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:37.760> you're<00:02:37.880> not

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
prevent it from cooking so you're not

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.830 
prevent it from cooking so you're not
cooking<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.660> meat<00:02:38.840> at<00:02:38.989> all<00:02:39.080> you're<00:02:39.950> just

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
cooking the meat at all you're just

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.660 
cooking the meat at all you're just
releasing<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.260> meat<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:43.070> that<00:02:43.280> it's

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
releasing the meat so that that it's

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.420 
releasing the meat so that that it's
easier<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.480> take<00:02:44.989> off<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.320> shell<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:45.770> then

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
easier to take off the shell and then

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.570 
easier to take off the shell and then
we're<00:02:46.610> gonna<00:02:46.730> cook<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:47.180> sous-vide<00:02:48.580> without

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
we're gonna cook it sous-vide without

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.780 
we're gonna cook it sous-vide without
the<00:02:49.700> shell<00:02:49.880> obviously<00:02:50.390> so<00:02:51.170> once<00:02:51.709> you<00:02:51.950> plunge

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
the shell obviously so once you plunge

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.060 
the shell obviously so once you plunge
it<00:02:52.940> in<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.209> ice<00:02:53.540> bath<00:02:53.780> leave<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:54.800> in<00:02:54.890> there<00:02:55.040> for

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
it in the ice bath leave it in there for

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.830 
it in the ice bath leave it in there for
about<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.430> minute<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.510> will<00:02:56.600> cool<00:02:56.780> down

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
about a minute and it will cool down

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.160 
about a minute and it will cool down
completely<00:02:58.090> grab<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.120> pair<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.510> kitchen<00:02:59.989> shears

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
completely grab a pair of kitchen shears

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.860 
completely grab a pair of kitchen shears
and<00:03:00.799> then<00:03:01.670> just<00:03:01.910> cut<00:03:02.090> through<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.360> underside

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
and then just cut through the underside

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
and then just cut through the underside
of<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.230> shell<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:05.750> will<00:03:06.260> make<00:03:06.380> it<00:03:06.440> easy

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
of the shell and that will make it easy

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.080 
of the shell and that will make it easy
to<00:03:07.330> remove<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.750> meat<00:03:08.989> so<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.739> just<00:03:10.070> you<00:03:10.880> might

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
to remove the meat so it just you might

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.190 
to remove the meat so it just you might
want<00:03:11.330> to<00:03:11.390> use<00:03:11.570> a<00:03:12.040> towel<00:03:13.120> because<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.330> the

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
want to use a towel because the the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.160 
want to use a towel because the the
shell<00:03:15.440> is<00:03:15.680> kind<00:03:16.130> of<00:03:16.220> sharp<00:03:16.489> and<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.930> avoid

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
shell is kind of sharp and to avoid

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.880 
shell is kind of sharp and to avoid
cutting<00:03:18.470> yourself<00:03:18.530> but<00:03:19.100> I'm<00:03:20.350> just<00:03:21.350> popping<00:03:21.620> it

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
cutting yourself but I'm just popping it

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.470 
cutting yourself but I'm just popping it
open<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:24.040> removing<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.190> meat<00:03:25.370> so<00:03:26.120> it's<00:03:26.239> nice

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
open and removing the meat so it's nice

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.870 
open and removing the meat so it's nice
and<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:27.440> flat<00:03:27.769> as<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:27.950> see<00:03:28.190> there<00:03:28.400> obviously

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
and and flat as you see there obviously

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.990 
and and flat as you see there obviously
this<00:03:29.060> is<00:03:29.239> still<00:03:29.480> raw<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:31.370> looks<00:03:31.610> kind<00:03:31.910> of

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
this is still raw and it looks kind of

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.949 
this is still raw and it looks kind of
cooked<00:03:32.269> but<00:03:32.480> that<00:03:32.630> was<00:03:32.780> just<00:03:32.810> from<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.380> brief

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
cooked but that was just from the brief

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.360 
cooked but that was just from the brief
blanching<00:03:35.959> so<00:03:36.170> it's<00:03:36.290> not<00:03:36.470> cooked<00:03:36.769> at<00:03:36.920> all<00:03:37.010> and

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
blanching so it's not cooked at all and

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.039 
blanching so it's not cooked at all and
then<00:03:38.030> what<00:03:38.209> we're<00:03:38.360> gonna<00:03:38.480> do<00:03:38.690> is<00:03:38.840> we're<00:03:38.989> gonna

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
then what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.160 
then what we're gonna do is we're gonna
add<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.410> Belmonte<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.690> that<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:41.870> for

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
add the Belmonte and that is for

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.720 
add the Belmonte and that is for
approaching<00:03:42.470> another<00:03:43.010> advantage<00:03:43.579> of

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
approaching another advantage of

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.030 
approaching another advantage of
sous-vide<00:03:44.120> is<00:03:44.420> that<00:03:45.079> normally<00:03:45.500> with<00:03:45.650> Vermont

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
sous-vide is that normally with Vermont

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.470 
sous-vide is that normally with Vermont
a<00:03:46.190> you<00:03:46.400> need<00:03:46.610> a<00:03:46.970> ton<00:03:47.390> of<00:03:47.420> it<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:48.650> poach<00:03:49.480> the

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
a you need a ton of it to poach the

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.300 
a you need a ton of it to poach the
lobster<00:03:50.510> but<00:03:51.290> since<00:03:51.590> we're<00:03:51.739> gonna<00:03:51.829> do<00:03:52.010> a<00:03:52.040> to

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
lobster but since we're gonna do a to

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.520 
lobster but since we're gonna do a to
vite<00:03:52.549> a<00:03:52.850> small<00:03:53.540> amount<00:03:53.870> is<00:03:54.049> sufficient

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
vite a small amount is sufficient

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.040 
vite a small amount is sufficient
because<00:03:54.650> we're

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
because we're

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.610 
because we're
vacuum<00:03:56.769> packet<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.660> will<00:03:58.750> distribute<00:03:59.170> the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
vacuum packet and it will distribute the

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.040 
vacuum packet and it will distribute the
drum<00:04:00.220> on<00:04:00.340> tape<00:04:00.580> so<00:04:01.500> for<00:04:02.500> 12<00:04:02.950> minutes<00:04:04.050> you're

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
drum on tape so for 12 minutes you're

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.140 
drum on tape so for 12 minutes you're
going<00:04:05.319> to<00:04:05.500> pop<00:04:05.800> that<00:04:05.830> into<00:04:06.280> your<00:04:06.670> sous-vide

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
going to pop that into your sous-vide

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.970 
going to pop that into your sous-vide
machine<00:04:07.209> and<00:04:10.110> for<00:04:11.110> the<00:04:11.260> tail<00:04:11.530> you're<00:04:11.830> gonna

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
machine and for the tail you're gonna

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.089 
machine and for the tail you're gonna
want<00:04:12.190> to<00:04:12.220> cook<00:04:12.400> it<00:04:12.519> at<00:04:12.670> 54<00:04:13.299> degrees<00:04:14.010> for<00:04:15.010> about

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
want to cook it at 54 degrees for about

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.479 
want to cook it at 54 degrees for about
12<00:04:16.030> minutes<00:04:16.269> and<00:04:16.810> that<00:04:17.500> will<00:04:17.680> get<00:04:17.799> you<00:04:18.070> a

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
12 minutes and that will get you a

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.840 
12 minutes and that will get you a
beautiful<00:04:19.979> perfectly<00:04:20.979> cooked<00:04:21.190> lobster<00:04:21.639> tail

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
beautiful perfectly cooked lobster tail

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.030 
beautiful perfectly cooked lobster tail
and<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:23.320> thing<00:04:23.500> with<00:04:23.620> sous-vide<00:04:23.979> cooking

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
and the thing with sous-vide cooking

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.580 
and the thing with sous-vide cooking
sometimes<00:04:24.970> you're<00:04:25.870> gonna<00:04:25.990> be<00:04:26.199> probably

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
sometimes you're gonna be probably

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.180 
sometimes you're gonna be probably
thrown<00:04:27.130> off<00:04:27.340> by<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:27.639> texture<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.270> little<00:04:28.630> bit

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
thrown off by the texture a little bit

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.440 
thrown off by the texture a little bit
but<00:04:30.190> that's<00:04:30.280> probably<00:04:30.880> just<00:04:31.000> because<00:04:31.120> you

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
but that's probably just because you
