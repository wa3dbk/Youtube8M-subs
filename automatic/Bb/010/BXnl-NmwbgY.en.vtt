00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.480
 Hello everyone 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.910
 so today it's my card that I 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.830
 will introduce you to an art that I have 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.500
 found rather easy to do especially if 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.820
 you stop at the gradient step 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.869
 and for this nanar I was inspired 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.869
 a photo of lady gaga 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.619
 so I already applied my polish 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.349
 holographic is a color varnish 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:33.230
 club the 976 and then I'm going to use the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.090
 pbo acrylic paints 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:41.280
 and my father is rafael leucate and have 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:45.180
 so we're going to draw the lightning for that I 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.989
 start from the top then I go down one 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.829
 little bit in tickets I come back with a 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.930
 very right here here I go down until 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.850
 I have the same thickness 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:06.320
 illustrated here and here and then I'm leaving 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.320
 from there to defend and I close 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:13.430
 so I start with the most blue 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:17.350
 dark and I'm going to draw my is clear 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.350
 as I wanted to show on paper 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:41.899
 and then I will roughly fill 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:43.220
 all that so I put a first layer 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.720
 fine and I will iron a second 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.399
 layer after now that's what 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.299
 I opened my two pots of paint 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.310
 in front of me and I'm going to do my gradient 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.960
 so I have a blue one that I'm in 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:06.289
 train to use and a little blue a little 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:17.209
 lighter I stay my brush and I 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:19.489
 clear terminais with light blue and 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.120
 without rinsing my brush I will take 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.640
 a little bit of dark blue then I 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.799
 take a little bit of light blue and 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.090
 I'm mixing a little bit of it 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.090
 before it dries 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.170
 Alas 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.610
 so here to degrade I did 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.790
 that mix the colors between them 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.800
 as long as she was not dry yet 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:09.990
 now I take my black paint 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:12.630
 and I come to do and contout so you 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:17.130
 can you stop at this step or 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.459
 add patterns inside 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.459
 lightning 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:31.670
 so for that I use the blue paint 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:31.670
 clear and I draw fine arabesques 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.560
 6 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:58.219
 I can also add small ones 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:59.840
 drops of points and that's what it 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.519
 gives with the final coat of final coat 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.920
 it's not too much the style of the shots I 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.489
 do it usually but the less you'll do 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.689
 a pretty easy nail art idea 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.340
 I hope you enjoyed it anyway 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:13.450
 I give you lots of kisses and I 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.450
 see you soon bye bye 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.570
 with two points 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.920
 I am 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.340
