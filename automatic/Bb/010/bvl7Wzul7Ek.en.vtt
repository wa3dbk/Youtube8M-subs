behind you this is really simple and it
only<00:00:13.860> requires<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.790> few<00:00:15.330> command<00:00:15.690> blocks<00:00:16.020> which

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
only requires a few command blocks which

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.490 
only requires a few command blocks which
is<00:00:17.160> isn't<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.000> many<00:00:18.180> compared<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.050> other

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
is isn't that many compared to other

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.880 
is isn't that many compared to other
things<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.279> i<00:00:21.119> am<00:00:21.390> proud<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.260> say<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.619> I'm

things and i am proud to say that I'm
probably<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.699> only<00:00:23.910> person<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.660> hasn't

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
probably the only person that hasn't

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.640 
probably the only person that hasn't
done<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> video<00:00:26.220> about<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.939> but<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.439> this

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
done a video about this but I but this

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.580 
done a video about this but I but this
is<00:00:29.010> 1.8<00:00:29.880> snapshot<00:00:30.630> if<00:00:30.929> you're<00:00:31.140> watching<00:00:31.320> us

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
is 1.8 snapshot if you're watching us

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.360 
is 1.8 snapshot if you're watching us
later<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.329> then<00:00:33.329> you'll<00:00:33.930> probably<00:00:34.320> be<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.739> 1.8

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
later on then you'll probably be in 1.8

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.000 
later on then you'll probably be in 1.8

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
stuff so i have two different versions

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.799 
stuff so i have two different versions
here<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.399> slow<00:00:44.850> version<00:00:45.090> we're<00:00:45.539> done

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
here this is the slow version we're done

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.670 
here this is the slow version we're done
do<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.440> fast<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:48.600> then<00:00:48.899> over<00:00:49.170> here<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.559> a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
do is fast and then over here it's a

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.850 
do is fast and then over here it's a
really<00:00:49.890> fast<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.579> now<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.180> set<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> full<00:00:52.079> area

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
really fast one now I set a full area

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.770 
really fast one now I set a full area
where<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:54.420> where<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.050> has<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.530> where<00:00:55.770> this

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
where the where it has it where this

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.180 
where the where it has it where this
well<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:58.140> an<00:00:58.289> objective<00:00:59.480> cold<00:01:00.829> fire<00:01:01.829> which

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
well I have an objective cold fire which

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.479 
well I have an objective cold fire which
is<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.579> dummy<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.239> then<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.379> sets<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> person

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
is a dummy and then this sets the person

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.660 
is a dummy and then this sets the person
to<00:01:05.790> fire<00:01:06.450> well<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.439> nearest<00:01:08.280> person<00:01:08.549> ER

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
to fire well it's that nearest person ER

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.530 
to fire well it's that nearest person ER
to<00:01:09.420> fire<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.869> one<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:10.890> sets

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
to fire the one and that one sets

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.780 
to fire the one and that one sets
there's<00:01:12.540> 4<00:01:12.810> 20<00:01:13.200> but<00:01:14.750> this<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:17.040> for<00:01:17.369> a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
there's 4 20 but this one is like for a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.539 
there's 4 20 but this one is like for a
command<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.869> guess<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.259> could<00:01:19.320> say<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.310> i<00:01:20.369> can

you in action and then i'll explain it

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.559 
you in action and then i'll explain it
so<00:02:25.310> command<00:02:26.510> let's<00:02:27.510> go<00:02:27.660> in<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.050> testing<00:02:28.620> area

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
so command let's go in the testing area

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.890 
so command let's go in the testing area
let<00:02:30.569> me<00:02:30.660> just<00:02:30.870> click<00:02:31.200> yes<00:02:32.540> okay<00:02:33.540> i<00:02:33.569> need<00:02:33.750> to

let me just click yes okay i need to

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.050 
let me just click yes okay i need to
start<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.050> clock<00:02:37.290> like<00:02:38.280> i<00:02:38.430> said<00:02:38.489> this<00:02:38.790> one's

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
start the clock like i said this one's

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.199 
start the clock like i said this one's
really<00:02:39.360> slow<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:40.290> don't<00:02:40.920> really<00:02:41.040> like<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.640> but<00:02:41.910> I

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
really slow I don't really like it but I

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.600 
really slow I don't really like it but I
created<00:02:42.750> faster<00:02:43.500> version<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:44.190> yeah<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:46.610> let

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
created faster version that yeah so let

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.720 
created faster version that yeah so let
me<00:02:47.730> show<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.290> my<00:02:49.950> first<00:02:50.220> version

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
me show you this is the my first version

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.400 
me show you this is the my first version
i<00:02:50.880> made<00:02:51.120> its<00:02:51.780> really<00:02:52.140> slow<00:02:54.019> like<00:02:55.019> so<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.260> can

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
i made its really slow like so you can

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.699 
i made its really slow like so you can
see<00:02:55.680> barely<00:02:56.250> does<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.840> so<00:02:57.840> let<00:02:57.930> me<00:02:57.989> reset<00:02:58.530> my

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
see barely does it so let me reset my

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.479 
see barely does it so let me reset my
score<00:02:59.190> so<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.569> doesn't<00:03:00.870> do<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.019> anymore<00:03:01.400> let<00:03:02.400> me

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
score so it doesn't do it anymore let me

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.430 
score so it doesn't do it anymore let me
just<00:03:02.730> stop<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.630> by<00:03:03.930> destroying<00:03:04.860> this<00:03:06.350> there<00:03:07.350> we

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
just stop it by destroying this there we

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.920 
just stop it by destroying this there we
go<00:03:07.700> so<00:03:09.110> yeah<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.380> haven't<00:03:11.310> made<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.180> yet<00:03:12.360> where

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
go so yeah I haven't made it yet where

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.620 
go so yeah I haven't made it yet where
it<00:03:13.200> destroys<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.310> items<00:03:14.700> because<00:03:15.150> for<00:03:15.450> some

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
it destroys the items because for some

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.720 
it destroys the items because for some
reason<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:16.709> wont<00:03:16.890> let<00:03:16.950> me<00:03:17.100> do<00:03:17.280> stuff<00:03:17.519> with

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
reason it wont let me do stuff with

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.920 
reason it wont let me do stuff with
scoreboard<00:03:18.329> much<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:19.670> yeah<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:21.570> I'm<00:03:21.660> going<00:03:21.870> to

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
scoreboard much so yeah so I'm going to

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.500 
scoreboard much so yeah so I'm going to
quickly<00:03:22.489> put<00:03:23.489> out<00:03:23.610> all<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:23.910> fire<00:03:26.299> and<00:03:27.299> there

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
quickly put out all the fire and there

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.819 
quickly put out all the fire and there
we<00:03:27.630> go<00:03:28.880> now<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:29.940> faster<00:03:30.660> version<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:31.440> creates

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
we go now the faster version it creates

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.640 
we go now the faster version it creates
a<00:03:31.950> little<00:03:32.190> leg<00:03:32.790> but<00:03:33.329> it's<00:03:33.720> fine<00:03:34.200> mostly<00:03:35.450> so

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
a little leg but it's fine mostly so

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.949 
a little leg but it's fine mostly so
there<00:03:37.650> we<00:03:37.709> go<00:03:37.970> there<00:03:38.970> we<00:03:39.000> go<00:03:39.209> really<00:03:39.690> fast

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
there we go there we go really fast

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.870 
there we go there we go really fast
clock<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.709> they<00:03:40.829> keep<00:03:41.010> on<00:03:41.160> spawning<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:43.880> now

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
clock and they keep on spawning and now

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.069 
clock and they keep on spawning and now
yes<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.799> now<00:03:47.010> it's<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.340> little<00:03:47.579> more<00:03:47.730> faster<00:03:48.299> so

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
yes and now it's a little more faster so

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.650 
yes and now it's a little more faster so
if<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.320> gone<00:03:49.530> five<00:03:50.040> mode<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:51.090> can<00:03:51.120> see<00:03:51.299> I<00:03:51.329> kind

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
if I gone five mode you can see I kind

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.099 
if I gone five mode you can see I kind
of<00:03:51.690> got<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:51.900> little<00:03:51.959> tail<00:03:52.470> behind<00:03:52.680> me<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.070> fire

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
of got a little tail behind me a fire

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.960 
of got a little tail behind me a fire
now<00:03:55.109> this<00:03:55.260> is<00:03:55.320> really<00:03:55.680> cool<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.070> can<00:03:56.549> have<00:03:56.820> it

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
now this is really cool you can have it

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.229 
now this is really cool you can have it
on<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.150> server<00:03:58.019> as<00:03:58.440> long<00:03:58.680> as<00:03:58.799> it's<00:03:59.010> 1.8<00:03:59.880> and<00:04:00.090> all

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
on a server as long as it's 1.8 and all

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.530 
on a server as long as it's 1.8 and all
that<00:04:00.769> so<00:04:01.769> yeah<00:04:01.950> see<00:04:02.489> it's<00:04:02.850> clearing<00:04:03.269> up<00:04:03.359> my

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
that so yeah see it's clearing up my

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.870 
that so yeah see it's clearing up my
items<00:04:03.900> now<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:04.680> probably<00:04:04.980> want<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.370> stop<00:04:05.670> it

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
items now I probably want to stop it

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.630 
items now I probably want to stop it
before<00:04:06.000> i<00:04:06.269> set<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.630> whole<00:04:06.750> place<00:04:06.780> on<00:04:07.200> fire<00:04:09.350> so

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
before i set the whole place on fire so

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.330 
before i set the whole place on fire so
water<00:04:11.640> water<00:04:14.390> so<00:04:15.620> you<00:04:16.620> probably<00:04:16.919> saw<00:04:17.310> that

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
water water so you probably saw that

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.370 
water water so you probably saw that
it's<00:04:18.209> like<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.720> fire<00:04:19.229> writing<00:04:20.160> cow<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:22.019> is<00:04:22.349> a

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
it's like a fire writing cow it is a

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.170 
it's like a fire writing cow it is a
little<00:04:22.740> weird<00:04:23.010> but<00:04:23.310> yeah

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
little weird but yeah

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.999 
little weird but yeah
so<00:04:24.570> let<00:04:24.750> me<00:04:24.810> go<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.199> quickly<00:04:25.620> stop<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.310> clock

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
so let me go and quickly stop the clock

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.840 
so let me go and quickly stop the clock
so<00:04:29.009> it's<00:04:29.340> a<00:04:29.430> simple<00:04:29.820> task<00:04:30.630> clock<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:31.410> then

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
so it's a simple task clock and then

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.710 
so it's a simple task clock and then
it's<00:04:32.850> some<00:04:33.389> info<00:04:33.900> falling<00:04:34.800> sand<00:04:35.100> and<00:04:35.910> then

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
it's some info falling sand and then

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
it's some info falling sand and then
it's<00:04:36.990> up<00:04:37.350> there<00:04:37.800> in<00:04:38.100> the<00:04:38.400> glass<00:04:38.759> tile<00:04:39.750> ID<00:04:39.960> 51

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
it's up there in the glass tile ID 51

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.749 
it's up there in the glass tile ID 51
that's<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.789> fire<00:04:42.060> ID<00:04:42.680> time<00:04:43.680> one<00:04:44.100> so<00:04:44.400> it<00:04:44.550> is

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
that's the fire ID time one so it is

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.689 
that's the fire ID time one so it is
actually<00:04:45.090> there<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:45.990> drop<00:04:46.500> item<00:04:46.949> 0<00:04:47.310> so<00:04:47.580> if

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
actually there and drop item 0 so if

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.760 
actually there and drop item 0 so if
it's<00:04:47.850> destroyed<00:04:48.389> by<00:04:48.570> torchy<00:04:49.080> doesn't<00:04:49.530> drop

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
it's destroyed by torchy doesn't drop

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.310 
it's destroyed by torchy doesn't drop
the<00:04:49.949> item<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.370> then<00:04:51.210> I<00:04:51.419> have<00:04:51.600> it<00:04:51.750> writing<00:04:52.199> a

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
the item and then I have it writing a

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.590 
the item and then I have it writing a
cap<00:04:52.620> you're<00:04:53.220> probably<00:04:53.490> wondering<00:04:53.669> why<00:04:54.389> it's

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
cap you're probably wondering why it's

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.159 
cap you're probably wondering why it's
writing<00:04:54.930> cal<00:04:55.440> that's<00:04:56.370> so<00:04:56.729> like<00:04:57.479> when<00:04:57.750> it<00:04:57.870> falls

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
writing cal that's so like when it falls

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.670 
writing cal that's so like when it falls
well<00:04:59.009> it<00:04:59.550> wouldn't<00:04:59.789> let<00:04:59.940> me<00:05:00.150> select<00:05:00.680> the

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
well it wouldn't let me select the

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.460 
well it wouldn't let me select the
falling<00:05:02.160> sand<00:05:02.550> entity<00:05:03.300> so<00:05:03.900> I<00:05:03.960> had<00:05:04.199> to<00:05:04.229> make<00:05:04.410> it

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
falling sand entity so I had to make it

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.560 
falling sand entity so I had to make it
writing<00:05:04.949> a<00:05:05.070> Cal<00:05:05.340> so<00:05:05.639> i<00:05:05.669> can<00:05:05.880> select<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.330> cow

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
writing a Cal so i can select the cow

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.740 
writing a Cal so i can select the cow
you<00:05:07.380> can<00:05:07.560> do<00:05:07.889> it<00:05:08.009> with<00:05:08.190> any<00:05:08.400> mob<00:05:08.759> you<00:05:09.000> like<00:05:09.300> but

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
you can do it with any mob you like but

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.939 
you can do it with any mob you like but
i<00:05:10.020> just<00:05:10.229> did<00:05:10.410> the<00:05:10.530> cow<00:05:10.849> so<00:05:11.849> it's<00:05:12.560> so<00:05:13.560> i<00:05:13.590> can<00:05:13.860> do

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
i just did the cow so it's so i can do

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.270 
i just did the cow so it's so i can do
it<00:05:14.070> peaceful<00:05:14.490> mode<00:05:15.330> and<00:05:15.599> here<00:05:16.530> it<00:05:16.710> teleports

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
it peaceful mode and here it teleports

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.230 
it peaceful mode and here it teleports
the<00:05:17.520> cow<00:05:17.990> to<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.199> person<00:05:19.620> with<00:05:19.770> a<00:05:20.039> fire<00:05:20.699> with

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
the cow to the person with a fire with

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.710 
the cow to the person with a fire with
the<00:05:21.360> score<00:05:21.690> fire<00:05:22.050> one<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.449> here<00:05:24.449> it<00:05:24.660> just

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
the score fire one and here it just

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.469 
the score fire one and here it just
kills<00:05:25.289> the<00:05:25.410> cow<00:05:25.789> so<00:05:26.789> you<00:05:26.880> probably<00:05:27.180> saw<00:05:27.449> the

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
kills the cow so you probably saw the

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.700 
kills the cow so you probably saw the
cows<00:05:28.080> down<00:05:28.470> behind<00:05:28.800> me<00:05:30.080> when<00:05:31.080> i<00:05:31.229> was<00:05:31.260> doing<00:05:31.500> it

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
cows down behind me when i was doing it

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.070 
cows down behind me when i was doing it
and<00:05:32.599> these<00:05:33.919> kill<00:05:34.919> the<00:05:35.039> items<00:05:35.430> over<00:05:35.820> here<00:05:36.150> so<00:05:36.810> if

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
and these kill the items over here so if

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.990 
and these kill the items over here so if
they<00:05:37.260> die<00:05:37.500> over<00:05:37.919> here<00:05:38.130> they<00:05:38.280> don't<00:05:38.400> drop<00:05:38.789> items

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
they die over here they don't drop items

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.490 
they die over here they don't drop items
and<00:05:40.190> this<00:05:41.190> and<00:05:41.520> these<00:05:42.090> are<00:05:42.539> supposed<00:05:42.870> to<00:05:42.990> clear

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
and this and these are supposed to clear

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.580 
and this and these are supposed to clear
the<00:05:43.860> beef<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:44.699> all<00:05:44.880> that<00:05:45.120> and<00:05:45.409> with<00:05:46.409> some

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
the beef and all that and with some

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.620 
the beef and all that and with some
reason<00:05:46.919> the<00:05:47.070> scoreboard<00:05:47.639> wouldn't<00:05:47.789> let<00:05:48.120> me<00:05:48.330> do

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
reason the scoreboard wouldn't let me do

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.200 
reason the scoreboard wouldn't let me do
it<00:05:48.659> correctly<00:05:49.220> but<00:05:50.220> it<00:05:50.400> probably<00:05:50.610> will<00:05:50.909> if<00:05:51.060> you

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.399 
it correctly but it probably will if you
do<00:05:51.389> it<00:05:51.539> so<00:05:52.409> yeah<00:05:53.120> so<00:05:54.120> if<00:05:54.539> you<00:05:54.690> like<00:05:54.840> all<00:05:55.050> the

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
well if you want to do this yourself the
