00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.770
 hello friends to welcome you to simone 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.470
 gianlorenzi at this lesson on joe 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.660
 satriani today we will study the five rich 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.390
 and the five idiomatic sentences that there 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.599
 they can bring you closer to joe's style 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.599
 satriani 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.820
 the first thing we can learn from 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.470
 satriani and certainly the delegated use the 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.020
 went in his preferred technique in 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.700
 the one where he and cell are a part 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.730
 main important of all his 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.810
 technique and its style is one of the things 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.400
 which I like best about the technique 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.380
 aggregate of satriani and the fact that 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.239
 manages to combine making 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.200
 very large moves on the keyboard 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.790
 simply by using the index as 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.680
 single finger to switch between positions 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.480
 at the other end of the scale 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.920
 an example that has not been reported about who 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.960
 give it and what will now need 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.350
 shows just this the application of 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.350
 this technique 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.630
 in this case as we have seen 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:35.600
 the index that the main architect of the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.490
 therefore displacement of the movement 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.500
 let's say from one position to another e 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.500
 then moving along the keyboard 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.170
 no 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.780
 we can learn satriani style are 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.880
 i power cosmi inter worse than those 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.350
 arpeggios that he himself redefined in 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.630
 this way they are geometric shapes 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.180
 of luminita precisely doing the 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.860
 move the left hand on the handle 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.620
 in a very geometric way 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.270
 allow precisely to exploit the 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.640
 geometry of our tool for 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.460
 create arpeggios with sounds 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.560
 always new and interesting 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.960
 then the form I proposed to you on 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.880
 on whom degrees are based let's say up about two 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.530
 on two main forms the one on the three 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.060
 lower middle strings are really gods 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.060
 mine of the of the king that is the following 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.730
 and the second form is the one found 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.150
 on the three highest ropes then months e 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.150
 soul 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.360
 therefore the complete form would become 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.010
 in the example that I wrote that 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.100
 also part of what it usually does 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.140
 even just about three years 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.819
 lower part of this arpeggio shape 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.459
 remains unchanged while the part 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.050
 upper moves a semitone of 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.790
 semitones in semitones always creating 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.280
 then some interesting new sounds 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.769
 more than a theoretical discourse that is 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.140
 just a practical aspect related to 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.790
 creation of these sounds 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.739
 the particularity of the execution of 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.140
 this of these forms of worse but 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.450
 lies in the fact that satriani does everything 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.720
 using the hand in the left hand e 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.310
 using the right hand on panic 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.310
 to keep the ropes locked 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.549
 the right hand in this case serves 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.629
 just to make the meeting for 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.250
 put precisely that there are not 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.250
 unwanted resonances 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.489
 to talk so she satriani and use 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.950
 of the pc you hear you will see widely 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.110
 described and explained on guitars 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.489
 I will show you the exercise I have 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.489
 written right in the magazine 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.570
 another thing you can learn from 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.930
 satriani style is a pretty use 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.250
 bizarre of the werning bar using 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.010
 just a technique and this would be 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:16.060
 finished lizard down the front means 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:19.510
 just lizard tucking into the throat e 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.460
 simply consists of playing 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.750
 note a new one that goes up with your hand 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.270
 left sliding on the handle 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.190
 simultaneously lowering the lever into 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.680
 this way we try to keep the 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.060
 always new to that same intonation 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.860
 obviously the effect cannot be achieved 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.430
 which always produces like what it is not 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.430
 certainly the first 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.360
 a test but we can learn from 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:06:03.540
 satriani style and use of 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:05.430
 tapping played with the pick well 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.710
 I hope this lesson on style 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.110
 satriani i liked it i hope that 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.140
 you have discovered some new secrets 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.240
 of the great sachs and above all I hope that 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.490
 help you to enrich enrich the 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.200
 your style with some influence of 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.950
 see you, great American guitarist 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.700
 to the next 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.700
 hello from simone gianlorenzi
