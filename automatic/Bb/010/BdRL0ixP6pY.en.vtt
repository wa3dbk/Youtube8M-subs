00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
episode talked about and yo is he a long

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.980 
episode talked about and yo is he a long
recovery<00:02:45.070> period<00:02:45.580> for<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:45.970> four<00:02:46.780> then<00:02:46.870> of

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
recovery period for a four then of

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.710 
recovery period for a four then of
course<00:02:47.170> as<00:02:47.290> he<00:02:47.380> comes<00:02:47.560> out<00:02:47.710> of<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:47.920> recovery

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
course as he comes out of that recovery

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.310 
course as he comes out of that recovery
he's<00:02:49.720> offered<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.350> new<00:02:50.470> position<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:52.020> he<00:02:53.020> has<00:02:53.140> to

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
he's offered a new position so he has to

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.570 
he's offered a new position so he has to
do<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.470> lot<00:02:53.650> of<00:02:53.710> thinking<00:02:54.070> about<00:02:54.130> whether<00:02:54.430> we

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
do a lot of thinking about whether we

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.460 
do a lot of thinking about whether we
can<00:02:54.760> do<00:02:55.030> that<00:02:55.060> whether<00:02:55.780> it's<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.110> sort<00:02:56.440> of

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
can do that whether it's the sort of

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:14.270 
can do that whether it's the sort of
thing<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:56.680> he<00:02:56.890> can<00:02:57.130> do<00:03:05.880> really

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.850 

well<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.000> thing<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:15.180> point<00:03:16.050> is<00:03:16.320> there<00:03:16.650> with

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
well the thing is point is there with

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.830 
well the thing is point is there with
Lance<00:03:17.100> he's<00:03:17.580> not<00:03:17.760> trying<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.060> find<00:03:18.270> out<00:03:18.450> who<00:03:18.630> he

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
Lance he's not trying to find out who he

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.020 
Lance he's not trying to find out who he
is<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:19.170> mean<00:03:19.320> he<00:03:19.350> obviously<00:03:19.760> made<00:03:20.760> very<00:03:21.000> good

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
is I mean he obviously made very good

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.690 
is I mean he obviously made very good
efforts<00:03:21.330> on<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.600> front<00:03:21.780> in<00:03:22.170> season<00:03:22.620> one<00:03:22.800> and

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
efforts on that front in season one and

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.280 
efforts on that front in season one and
maybe<00:03:23.880> he<00:03:24.120> still<00:03:24.330> has<00:03:24.510> an<00:03:24.630> inkling<00:03:24.870> of<00:03:25.050> who<00:03:25.200> it

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
maybe he still has an inkling of who it

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.110 
maybe he still has an inkling of who it
might<00:03:25.410> be<00:03:25.470> but<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.550> him<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.820> doesn't<00:03:27.000> actually

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
might be but to him it doesn't actually

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.850 
might be but to him it doesn't actually
matter<00:03:27.480> who<00:03:27.990> it<00:03:28.080> is<00:03:28.230> because<00:03:28.560> he's<00:03:28.710> obviously

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
matter who it is because he's obviously

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.470 
matter who it is because he's obviously
on<00:03:29.100> his<00:03:29.670> side<00:03:29.910> now

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
on his side now

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.980 
on his side now
fundamentally<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:32.570> realizes<00:03:33.570> that<00:03:33.600> for<00:03:33.930> the

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
fundamentally and realizes that for the

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.480 
fundamentally and realizes that for the
good<00:03:34.140> of<00:03:34.200> Starling<00:03:34.620> city<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.310> bigger

good of Starling city and a bigger

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.440 
good of Starling city and a bigger
