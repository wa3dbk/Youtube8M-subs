hey when we did it if I was a really

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.060 
hey when we did it if I was a really
great<00:00:35.199> array<00:00:35.499> and<00:00:35.710> I<00:00:36.519> want<00:00:37.149> to<00:00:37.949> make<00:00:38.949> it

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
great array and I want to make it

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.610 
great array and I want to make it
smaller<00:00:39.129> because<00:00:39.730> you<00:00:40.329> speak<00:00:40.570> quite<00:00:41.140> quite

redstone<00:00:54.670> dust<00:00:54.999> and<00:00:56.429> this<00:00:57.429> is<00:00:57.579> how<00:00:57.699> look<00:00:57.909> like

00:00:59.989 --> 00:00:59.999 
redstone dust and this is how look like

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:07.590 
redstone dust and this is how look like
yeah<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:03.460> very<00:01:03.819> big<00:01:04.120> and<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:06.790> still<00:01:07.090> it's

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
yeah it's very big and but still it's

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.480 
yeah it's very big and but still it's
very<00:01:07.899> useful<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:10.119> a<00:01:10.149> thing<00:01:13.950> for<00:01:14.950> your<00:01:15.070> awesome

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
see it's quite smaller and less read

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.060 
see it's quite smaller and less read
some<00:02:05.859> face

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
some face

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.680 
some face
five<00:02:07.790> repeaters<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.539> 1<00:02:09.410> redstone<00:02:09.679> torches

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
five repeaters a 1 redstone torches

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.720 
five repeaters a 1 redstone torches
torch<00:02:12.190> at<00:02:13.190> one<00:02:13.430> button<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:13.940> free<00:02:14.570> redstone

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
torch at one button and free redstone

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.180 
torch at one button and free redstone
for<00:02:16.730> rats<00:02:17.090> on<00:02:17.270> us<00:02:17.560> excuse<00:02:18.560> me<00:02:19.630> yeah<00:02:20.980> is<00:02:21.980> the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
for rats on us excuse me yeah is the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.949 
for rats on us excuse me yeah is the
same<00:02:22.400> speed<00:02:24.730> do<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.760> think<00:02:26.470> di<00:02:27.470> an<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.959> it's

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
same speed do I think di an and it's

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.430 
same speed do I think di an and it's
cheaper<00:02:30.590> smaller<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.520> I<00:02:32.270> know<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.320> looks

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
cheaper smaller and I know it looks

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.690 
cheaper smaller and I know it looks
better<00:02:34.330> it's<00:02:35.330> not<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.600> complicated<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:39.700> yeah

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
better it's not a complicated and yeah

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.190 
better it's not a complicated and yeah
it's<00:02:41.660> better<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:43.450> look<00:02:44.450> at<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:46.630> you<00:02:47.630> see<00:02:47.840> it's

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
it's better I look at it you see it's

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.250 
it's better I look at it you see it's
not<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:48.950> lot<00:02:49.239> we<00:02:50.239> don't<00:02:50.270> need<00:02:50.570> this<00:02:50.720> pottery<00:02:50.989> as

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
not a lot we don't need this pottery as

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.220 
not a lot we don't need this pottery as
for<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.650> circuit<00:02:52.610> I<00:02:52.790> know<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.300> type<00:02:54.020> Oh

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
for the circuit I know the type Oh

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.949 
for the circuit I know the type Oh
output<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.700> Razon<00:02:56.980> lamp<00:02:58.660> we<00:02:59.660> don't<00:02:59.780> need

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.430 
output to the Razon lamp we don't need
it<00:03:00.820> but<00:03:01.820> yeah<00:03:02.269> so<00:03:03.140> yeah<00:03:04.300> yeah<00:03:05.300> I'm<00:03:06.260> bed

but I'm kind of it was kind of
accidentally<00:03:13.370> when<00:03:13.580> I<00:03:13.610> made<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:13.940> I<00:03:14.180> won't

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
accidentally when I made it I won't

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.440 
accidentally when I made it I won't
transmit<00:03:15.110> made<00:03:15.650> other<00:03:16.160> thing<00:03:16.459> but<00:03:17.180> still<00:03:19.450> yeah

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450

transmit made other thing but still yeah
Oh<00:03:21.370> remove<00:03:22.370> this

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.750 

oh<00:03:27.410> I<00:03:28.010> know<00:03:28.490> that<00:03:28.570> step<00:03:29.570> yeah<00:03:30.550> now<00:03:31.550> we're<00:03:31.670> going

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
oh I know that step yeah now we're going

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:40.930 
oh I know that step yeah now we're going
to<00:03:31.850> compare<00:03:32.030> with<00:03:32.390> them<00:03:37.210> yeah<00:03:39.100> my<00:03:40.100> way<00:03:40.340> you

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
to compare with them yeah my way you

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.040 
to compare with them yeah my way you
don't<00:03:41.150> need<00:03:41.620> this<00:03:42.620> is<00:03:42.860> output<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:44.440> redstone

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
don't need this is output of redstone

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:57.190 
don't need this is output of redstone
circuit<00:03:49.600> so<00:03:51.280> if<00:03:52.280> you<00:03:52.490> need<00:03:52.640> no<00:03:52.790> result<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:56.200> I

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
circuit so if you need no result and I

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:05.590 
circuit so if you need no result and I
hope<00:03:57.500> you<00:03:57.830> enjoyed<00:03:58.130> this<00:03:58.280> video<00:03:58.430> and<00:04:02.590> say
