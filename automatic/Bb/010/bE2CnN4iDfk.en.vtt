00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.760
 thank you so much i would like to say all 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.070
 my team that made the maximum 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:22.020
 effort to have us here today 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:26.609
 gathered and talked about how everyone 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.339
 happened and how hard for broke 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:35.420
 this belt even if i lost i 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:37.950
 I think what it means so it means so 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.809
 God forbid such a way 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.940
 so it would be necessary if I 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.890
 lost but I do not count if 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.809
 I have no difference with who is boxing here 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.570
 little will probably depend on me 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.850
 because there are promoters there are managers 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.829
 they pick up rivals ie i have 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.570
 famous asking not to box or 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.840
 No, but I do not know that I have no answer 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.840
 not 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:10.290
 I have sat all the friends and acquaintances who I am 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.740
 the city to the meeting why why aren't you 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.970
 finished you could have done that if i helped 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.490
 did it i know what 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.880
 professional after sleep that people in 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.340
 America love a fight they love to 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.040
 head from the shoulders flew all love knockout and 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.930
 everyone loves blood there meat I tried it 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.409
 do I tried to try to finish 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.610
 fight ahead of time but if i didn't do it 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.610
 it means I did not succeed 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.420
 I do not know the way the generation of such which 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.180
 which are valid in a row up to father and mother and 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.960
 from the prices to be there big 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.320
 champions 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.090
 I do not have much hope for it 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.030
 lay down and they again would like to have 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.600
 my children were always healthy 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.600
 obeyed dad and 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.030
 occupied doing just sports led 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.489
 healthy lifestyle and were good 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.090
 decent people not to be ashamed of 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.090
 they are not god
