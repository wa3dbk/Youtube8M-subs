these trees that grow up through the
concrete<00:00:36.830> what<00:00:37.830> I<00:00:38.330> discovered<00:00:39.330> recently

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
concrete what I discovered recently

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.930 
concrete what I discovered recently
walking<00:00:40.650> over<00:00:40.890> these<00:00:41.010> things<00:00:41.310> that<00:00:41.490> under<00:00:41.790> my

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
walking over these things that under my

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.660 
walking over these things that under my
feet<00:00:42.240> were<00:00:42.480> these<00:00:42.660> amazing<00:00:43.350> marks<00:00:44.070> made<00:00:44.640> by

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
feet were these amazing marks made by

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.020 
feet were these amazing marks made by
the<00:00:45.030> excrement<00:00:45.810> of<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.500> blue<00:00:46.920> heron<00:00:47.400> and<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
white egrets and they trickle down the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.240 
white egrets and they trickle down the
sides<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.450> the<00:00:51.600> concrete<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:52.829> they<00:00:53.190> do

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
sides of the concrete and as they do

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.420 
sides of the concrete and as they do
they<00:00:53.790> make<00:00:54.239> these<00:00:54.450> forms<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.770> me<00:00:55.980> always

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
they make these forms that to me always

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.360 
they make these forms that to me always
look<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.270> creatures<00:00:58.200> like<00:00:58.530> sometimes<00:00:59.130> even

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
look like creatures like sometimes even

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.740 
look like creatures like sometimes even
like<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.610> birds<00:00:59.820> themselves<00:00:59.970> they<00:01:00.720> have

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
like the birds themselves they have

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.889 
like the birds themselves they have
heads<00:01:01.620> sometimes<00:01:02.040> beaks<00:01:02.690> appendages<00:01:03.690> and

heads sometimes beaks appendages and

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.919 
heads sometimes beaks appendages and
they<00:01:04.710> can<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.640> know<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:06.030> long<00:01:06.210> as<00:01:06.359> 20<00:01:06.689> feet

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:06.929 
they can be you know as long as 20 feet

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:10.010 
they can be you know as long as 20 feet
and<00:01:07.369> once<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.549> started<00:01:08.939> seeing<00:01:09.270> them<00:01:09.539> as<00:01:09.719> these

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
and once I started seeing them as these

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.160 
and once I started seeing them as these
creatures<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.679> couldn't<00:01:11.009> unsee<00:01:11.249> them<00:01:11.759> and<00:01:12.170> what

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
creatures I couldn't unsee them and what

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.899 
creatures I couldn't unsee them and what
i<00:01:13.200> would<00:01:13.619> do<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.950> i<00:01:14.039> would<00:01:14.069> take<00:01:14.310> photographs

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
i would do is i would take photographs

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.770 
i would do is i would take photographs
of<00:01:15.090> these<00:01:15.270> excrements<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.619> then<00:01:17.189> i<00:01:17.219> would

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
of these excrements and then i would

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.709 
of these excrements and then i would
have<00:01:18.780> them<00:01:18.959> produced<00:01:19.380> using<00:01:19.649> albumin

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
have them produced using albumin

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.219 
have them produced using albumin
photography<00:01:21.719> which<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.049> a

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
photography which is a

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.039 
photography which is a
nineteenth-century<00:01:22.979> process<00:01:23.969> it<00:01:24.450> uses<00:01:24.840> egg

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
nineteenth-century process it uses egg

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.889 
nineteenth-century process it uses egg
whites<00:01:25.350> as<00:01:25.649> the<00:01:26.219> emulsion<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.179> suspends<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
whites as the emulsion that suspends the

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.819 
whites as the emulsion that suspends the
gold<00:01:28.200> or<00:01:28.499> silver<00:01:29.539> pigment<00:01:30.539> and<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:31.560> me<00:01:31.679> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
gold or silver pigment and for me the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.209 
gold or silver pigment and for me the
egg<00:01:32.009> sort<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.819> is<00:01:32.999> bringing<00:01:33.569> back<00:01:33.600> another

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
egg sort of is bringing back another

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.129 
egg sort of is bringing back another
aspect<00:01:35.219> of<00:01:35.429> the<00:01:35.549> bird<00:01:35.789> and<00:01:36.090> materiality<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:37.139 
aspect of the bird and materiality and

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:38.569 
aspect of the bird and materiality and
then<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.619> would<00:01:37.799> see<00:01:38.100> them<00:01:38.310> three

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
then I would see them three

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.160 
then I would see them three
dimensionally<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.149> got<00:01:39.329> very<00:01:39.600> good<00:01:39.929> at

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
dimensionally I got very good at

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.419 
dimensionally I got very good at
interpreting<00:01:40.700> flat<00:01:41.700> things<00:01:42.029> as<00:01:42.209> 3d<00:01:42.719> and<00:01:43.429> weld

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
interpreting flat things as 3d and weld

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.160 
interpreting flat things as 3d and weld
up<00:01:44.609> these<00:01:44.759> structures<00:01:45.420> almost<00:01:45.779> like<00:01:45.929> line

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
up these structures almost like line

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.730 
up these structures almost like line
drawings<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.979> then<00:01:47.789> I<00:01:48.149> would<00:01:48.659> start<00:01:49.499> to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
drawings and then I would start to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.039 
drawings and then I would start to
gather<00:01:50.009> all<00:01:50.249> these<00:01:50.520> things<00:01:50.729> from<00:01:50.880> my<00:01:50.999> walks<00:01:51.630> in

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
gather all these things from my walks in

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.179 
gather all these things from my walks in
you<00:01:52.319> know<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.529> I<00:01:52.560> would<00:01:52.679> bring<00:01:52.829> home<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
you know that I would bring home in the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.730 
you know that I would bring home in the
backpacks<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.969> grab<00:01:54.869> these<00:01:55.139> things<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.560> mix

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
backpacks and grab these things and mix

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.349 
backpacks and grab these things and mix
it<00:01:55.829> with<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.039> plaster<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.670> paper<00:01:56.880> mache

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
it with the plaster in the paper mache

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.929 
it with the plaster in the paper mache
and<00:01:57.389> and<00:01:57.929> and<00:01:58.259> some<00:01:58.770> glue<00:01:59.069> and<00:01:59.249> start<00:01:59.759> putting

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
and and and some glue and start putting

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.599 
and and and some glue and start putting
it<00:02:00.149> all<00:02:00.270> over<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.899> steel<00:02:01.139> armature<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.919> these

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
it all over the steel armature and these
