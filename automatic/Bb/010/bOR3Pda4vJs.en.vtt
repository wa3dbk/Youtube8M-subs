00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
country so you're saying that this extra

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.450 
country so you're saying that this extra
funding<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:36.990> needed<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.920> keep<00:01:38.280> you

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
funding is needed just to keep you

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.810 
funding is needed just to keep you
standing<00:01:38.700> still<00:01:39.149> as<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.420> were<00:01:40.549> yeah<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.579> mean

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
standing still as it were yeah I mean

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.670 
standing still as it were yeah I mean
we've<00:01:42.000> calculated<00:01:42.390> here<00:01:42.840> for<00:01:43.020> example<00:01:43.500> that

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
we've calculated here for example that

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.800 
we've calculated here for example that
we<00:01:44.250> would<00:01:44.399> require<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.759> tuition<00:01:45.299> fee<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.600> around

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
we would require a tuition fee of around

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.840 
we would require a tuition fee of around
seven<00:01:46.170> thousand<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.649> year<00:01:46.680> just<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.640> stand

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
seven thousand a year just to stand

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.940 
seven thousand a year just to stand

the<00:04:25.680> key<00:04:25.890> thing<00:04:26.160> is<00:04:26.190> that<00:04:26.520> it's<00:04:26.670> not<00:04:26.790> students

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
the key thing is that it's not students

the key thing is that it's not students
who<00:04:27.390> pay<00:04:27.600> its<00:04:28.110> graduates<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:28.920> only<00:04:29.550> when<00:04:29.700> they

can afford to do so Tom it isn't in a
bit<00:04:32.940> little<00:04:33.090> bit<00:04:33.300> like<00:04:33.450> taking<00:04:33.660> out<00:04:33.900> a
