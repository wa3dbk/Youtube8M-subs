comparison<00:00:26.519> right<00:00:26.970> now<00:00:27.119> actually<00:00:27.920> both<00:00:28.920> of

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
comparison right now actually both of

android<00:00:31.859> 4.0<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:33.210> both<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.540> them<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.899> skins

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
android 4.0 the both of them have skins

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.540 
android 4.0 the both of them have skins
on<00:00:34.800> top<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.670> there's<00:00:36.059> sense<00:00:36.390> for<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.710> 1x

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
on top so there's sense for on the 1x

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.080 
on top so there's sense for on the 1x
and<00:00:39.230> i<00:00:40.230> believe<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.129> called<00:00:41.370> TouchWiz<00:00:41.879> with

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
and i believe so called TouchWiz with

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.930 
and i believe so called TouchWiz with
samsung<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.860> an<00:00:44.040> upgraded<00:00:44.670> it's

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
samsung but it's a it's an upgraded it's

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.010 
samsung but it's a it's an upgraded it's
a<00:00:45.030> new<00:00:45.180> skin<00:00:45.800> they're<00:00:46.800> trying<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.809> go<00:00:48.809> with<00:00:48.989> a

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
a new skin they're trying to go with a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.260 
a new skin they're trying to go with a
more<00:00:49.170> natural<00:00:49.739> user<00:00:49.980> interface<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.030> has

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
more natural user interface so this has

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.510 
more natural user interface so this has
been<00:00:51.360> acquired<00:00:51.690> by<00:00:51.809> inspired<00:00:52.559> by<00:00:52.800> water<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
been acquired by inspired by water and

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.939 
been acquired by inspired by water and
pebbles<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.449> leaves<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.469> all<00:00:55.620> sorts<00:00:55.890> of

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
pebbles and leaves and all sorts of

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.279 
pebbles and leaves and all sorts of
natural<00:00:56.309> things<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.140> part<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
natural things like that part of the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.779 
natural things like that part of the
unlocking<00:00:58.649> process<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.280> Samsung<00:00:59.489> is

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
unlocking process with the Samsung is

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.219 
unlocking process with the Samsung is
actually<00:01:00.350> this<00:01:01.350> whole<00:01:01.530> idea<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:02.030> you

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
actually this whole idea of you

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.420 
actually this whole idea of you
essentially<00:01:04.229> dabbing<00:01:04.769> your<00:01:04.890> finger<00:01:05.220> into

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
essentially dabbing your finger into

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.960 
essentially dabbing your finger into
water<00:01:06.290> which<00:01:07.290> can<00:01:07.439> take<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.619> look<00:01:07.770> at<00:01:07.920> now<00:01:08.070> it's

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
water which can take a look at now it's

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.060 
water which can take a look at now it's
not<00:01:09.420> particularly<00:01:10.020> intuitive<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.890> don't

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
not particularly intuitive you don't

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.320 
not particularly intuitive you don't
really<00:01:11.189> know<00:01:11.400> when<00:01:11.670> you've<00:01:11.820> done<00:01:11.939> enough<00:01:12.090> to

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
really know when you've done enough to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.480 
really know when you've done enough to
unlock<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.020> there<00:01:13.080> if<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:14.280> take<00:01:14.430> a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
unlock it but it's there if we take a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.429 
unlock it but it's there if we take a
look<00:01:14.610> at<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.000> window<00:01:15.479> shade<00:01:15.720> menu<00:01:16.080> up<00:01:16.229> at<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
look at the window shade menu up at the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.679 
look at the window shade menu up at the
top<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:17.369> still<00:01:17.610> quite<00:01:17.850> familiar<00:01:18.030> for

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
top it's still quite familiar for

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.080 
top it's still quite familiar for
samsung<00:01:19.439> touch<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.799> users<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.060> a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
samsung touch with users you have a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.690 
samsung touch with users you have a
bunch<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.509> Launcher<00:01:22.320> icons<00:01:22.350> at<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.189> very<00:01:23.460> top

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
bunch of Launcher icons at the very top

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.399 
bunch of Launcher icons at the very top
then<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.180> have<00:01:24.360> your<00:01:24.409> notifications

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
then you have your notifications

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.999 
then you have your notifications
underneath<00:01:26.570> ongoing<00:01:27.570> items<00:01:27.990> which<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.829> can

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
underneath ongoing items which you can

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.700 
underneath ongoing items which you can
swipe<00:01:29.460> away<00:01:29.640> presumably<00:01:30.360> yeah<00:01:30.930> that's<00:01:31.200> very

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
swipe away presumably yeah that's very

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.859 
swipe away presumably yeah that's very
much<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.880> standard<00:01:33.090> under<00:01:33.299> four<00:01:33.659> point

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
much like the standard under four point

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.450 
much like the standard under four point
oh<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.590> see<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> lot<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.159> standard

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
oh so you can see a lot of the standard
