00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
front foot it just goes straight down

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.310

you pop your board up and then your

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
front foot just goes straight into the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.929 
front foot just goes straight into the
ground<00:01:21.600> now<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.850> flick<00:01:24.479> has<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.560> your<00:01:26.310> toe

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
ground now the flick has to be your toe

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.380 
ground now the flick has to be your toe
sliding<00:01:27.930> up<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.439> board<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.009> then<00:01:29.520> your<00:01:29.939> ankle

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
sliding up the board and then your ankle

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.429 
sliding up the board and then your ankle
pops<00:01:30.720> up<00:01:31.049> at<00:01:31.530> no<00:01:32.250> point<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.970> your<00:01:33.390> leg<00:01:33.930> your

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
pops up at no point is your leg your

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.740 
pops up at no point is your leg your
foot<00:01:34.829> or<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.130> direction<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.970> your<00:01:36.119> toe<00:01:36.360> going

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
foot or the direction of your toe going

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.550 
foot or the direction of your toe going
down<00:01:37.049> at<00:01:37.409> all<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.040> know<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:38.850> very<00:01:39.560> confusing

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
down at all I know it's very confusing

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.249 
down at all I know it's very confusing
because<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.640> seems<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.600> should<00:01:42.630> pop<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
because it seems like you should pop the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.560 
because it seems like you should pop the
board<00:01:43.500> up<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.950> then<00:01:44.159> push<00:01:44.430> down<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.030> that'll

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
board up and then push down and that'll

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.340 
board up and then push down and that'll
make<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.780> flick<00:01:46.200> or<00:01:47.060> flip<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.329> should<00:01:48.570> say<00:01:48.600> but

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
make it flick or flip I should say but

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.230 
make it flick or flip I should say but
that's<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.979> difference<00:01:50.159> between<00:01:50.399> pushing

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that's the difference between pushing

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.120 
that's the difference between pushing
down<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.960> landing<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> ground<00:01:52.829> with<00:01:52.950> your

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
down and landing on the ground with your

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.460 
down and landing on the ground with your
front<00:01:53.340> foot<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.880> actually<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> proper<00:01:54.990> flick

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
front foot and actually a proper flick

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.639 
front foot and actually a proper flick
which<00:01:56.130> would<00:01:56.310> be<00:01:56.460> dragging<00:01:56.939> your<00:01:57.060> toe<00:01:57.360> up

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
which would be dragging your toe up

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.020 
which would be dragging your toe up
popping<00:01:58.649> your<00:01:58.770> toe<00:01:58.979> up<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.520> off<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.790> board

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
popping your toe up and off the board

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.569 
popping your toe up and off the board
and<00:02:00.210> popping<00:02:00.600> your<00:02:00.719> ankle<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:02.159> let's<00:02:02.369> check
