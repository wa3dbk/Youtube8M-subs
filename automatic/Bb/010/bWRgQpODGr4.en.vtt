let's do a new computer over the Wi-Fi

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.150 
let's do a new computer over the Wi-Fi
or<00:02:37.380> wired<00:02:37.560> network<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.680> can<00:02:40.830> see<00:02:40.920> what<00:02:41.070> is

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
or wired network so you can see what is

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.190 
or wired network so you can see what is
-<00:02:41.280> here<00:02:41.610> is<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:42.030> PCmover<00:02:42.690> already<00:02:42.870> scanned

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
- here is that PCmover already scanned

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.840 
- here is that PCmover already scanned
the<00:02:43.470> network<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.370> automatically

the network and it automatically

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.620 
the network and it automatically
detected<00:02:45.420> my<00:02:45.660> old<00:02:46.020> PC<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.240> that's<00:02:48.420> the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
detected my old PC so and that's the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.730 
detected my old PC so and that's the
name<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.810> my<00:02:48.930> old<00:02:49.170> PC<00:02:49.500> right<00:02:49.680> here<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:51.740> if

it can't find the PC that you were

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.730 
it can't find the PC that you were
working<00:02:54.780> on<00:02:54.810> your<00:02:54.930> old<00:02:55.080> PC<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.500> can<00:02:55.620> also

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
working on your old PC you can also

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.280 
working on your old PC you can also
input<00:02:56.010> an<00:02:56.220> IP<00:02:56.370> address<00:02:56.520> but<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.450> automatically

first let's start with application
selections<00:03:47.390> if<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:49.140> application<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.769> green

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
selections if the application is green

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.560 
selections if the application is green
it<00:03:50.280> means<00:03:50.580> that<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:50.910> application<00:03:51.390> has<00:03:51.510> been

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
it means that the application has been

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.630 
it means that the application has been
tested<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.320> will<00:03:52.620> most<00:03:52.769> likely<00:03:52.950> work<00:03:53.340> on<00:03:53.489> your

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
tested and will most likely work on your

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.420 
tested and will most likely work on your
new<00:03:53.730> PC<00:03:54.380> yellow<00:03:55.380> means<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.040> might<00:03:56.220> work

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
new PC yellow means that it might work

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.539 
new PC yellow means that it might work
but<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.120> hasn't<00:03:57.450> been<00:03:57.540> tested<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.160> red<00:03:59.160> means

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
but it hasn't been tested and red means

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.360 
but it hasn't been tested and red means
that<00:03:59.820> it<00:03:59.910> probably<00:03:59.940> won't

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
that it probably won't

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.130 
that it probably won't
sometimes<00:04:02.370> applications<00:04:03.030> are<00:04:03.180> red<00:04:03.390> because

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
sometimes applications are red because

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.229 
sometimes applications are red because
they<00:04:04.709> already<00:04:04.830> exist<00:04:05.250> on<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.459> new<00:04:05.580> PC<00:04:05.910> so

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
they already exist on the new PC so

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.720 
they already exist on the new PC so
that's<00:04:06.420> also<00:04:06.600> a<00:04:06.690> possibility

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
that's also a possibility

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.560 
that's also a possibility

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
this transfer is 64 to 64 bits so it

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.090 
this transfer is 64 to 64 bits so it

transfer<00:04:36.500> like<00:04:36.740> in<00:04:36.920> a<00:04:37.010> 32<00:04:37.490> to<00:04:37.640> 64<00:04:37.670> bit<00:04:38.300> transfer

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
transfer like in a 32 to 64 bit transfer

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.580 
transfer like in a 32 to 64 bit transfer
then<00:04:39.260> only<00:04:39.530> Green<00:04:39.980> is<00:04:40.160> selected<00:04:40.520> by<00:04:40.640> default

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
then only Green is selected by default

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.530 
then only Green is selected by default
these<00:04:42.590> are<00:04:42.800> just<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.220> default<00:04:43.610> selections<00:04:44.120> so

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
these are just the default selections so

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.770 
these are just the default selections so
you<00:04:45.470> can<00:04:45.590> change<00:04:45.830> them<00:04:45.980> if<00:04:46.100> you'd<00:04:46.220> like

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
you can change them if you'd like

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.640 
you can change them if you'd like
example<00:04:47.780> you'd<00:04:47.900> have<00:04:48.020> to<00:04:48.110> transfer<00:04:48.410> this<00:04:48.530> if

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
example you'd have to transfer this if

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.760 
example you'd have to transfer this if
you<00:04:48.710> don't<00:04:48.890> want<00:04:49.010> to<00:04:49.600> and<00:04:50.600> then<00:04:50.840> with<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.590> red

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
you don't want to and then with the red

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.370 
you don't want to and then with the red
one<00:04:52.040> and<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.340> red<00:04:52.490> ones<00:04:52.730> a<00:04:53.270> piece<00:04:54.110> of<00:04:54.200> Weaver

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
one and the red ones a piece of Weaver

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.410 
one and the red ones a piece of Weaver
is<00:04:54.470> telling<00:04:54.770> you<00:04:54.860> that<00:04:54.890> it<00:04:55.760> probably<00:04:56.240> won't

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
is telling you that it probably won't

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.090 
is telling you that it probably won't
work<00:04:56.510> but<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:56.870> can<00:04:57.020> override<00:04:57.230> that<00:04:57.410> too<00:04:57.800> it'll

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
work but you can override that too it'll

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.230 
work but you can override that too it'll
just<00:04:58.280> give<00:04:58.460> you<00:04:58.580> a<00:04:58.610> warning

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
just give you a warning

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.820 
just give you a warning
over<00:04:59.690> here<00:05:01.990> okay<00:05:02.990> and<00:05:03.260> if<00:05:03.650> there<00:05:03.800> are

over here okay and if there are

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.560 
over here okay and if there are
applications<00:05:04.460> you<00:05:04.670> are<00:05:04.700> unsure<00:05:04.970> about<00:05:05.150> you

we<00:05:55.760> can<00:05:55.880> continue<00:05:56.210> with<00:05:56.300> the<00:05:56.360> transfer

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.690 

okay<00:06:00.720> now<00:06:01.020> that<00:06:01.200> I<00:06:01.230> have<00:06:01.530> now<00:06:02.490> that<00:06:02.520> I've

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
okay now that I have now that I've

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.220 
okay now that I have now that I've
configured<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.330> things<00:06:03.720> I<00:06:03.840> want<00:06:04.020> to<00:06:04.110> move

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
configured the things I want to move

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.130 
configured the things I want to move
over<00:06:04.470> and<00:06:04.620> transfer<00:06:05.330> piece<00:06:06.330> mover<00:06:06.660> is<00:06:06.780> going

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.140 
over and transfer piece mover is going

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.990 
over and transfer piece mover is going
to<00:06:07.320> configure<00:06:07.680> that<00:06:10.550> so<00:06:11.550> this<00:06:11.700> is<00:06:11.760> what

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
to configure that so this is what

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.880 
to configure that so this is what
PCmover<00:06:12.510> came<00:06:12.660> up<00:06:12.780> with<00:06:12.960> I<00:06:13.200> have<00:06:13.650> 30

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
PCmover came up with I have 30

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.280 
PCmover came up with I have 30
applications<00:06:14.070> to<00:06:14.610> transfer<00:06:15.120> total<00:06:15.990> 15

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
applications to transfer total 15

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.550 
applications to transfer total 15
gigabytes<00:06:16.740> and<00:06:17.040> the<00:06:17.910> the<00:06:18.900> transfer<00:06:19.320> take

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
gigabytes and the the transfer take

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.670 
gigabytes and the the transfer take
around<00:06:19.740> four<00:06:20.070> hours<00:06:20.100> so<00:06:20.670> I<00:06:20.730> can<00:06:20.910> just<00:06:21.680> click

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
around four hours so I can just click

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.720 
around four hours so I can just click

Next here once again you have the option
of<00:06:26.880> having<00:06:26.940> PCmover<00:06:27.900> email<00:06:28.260> you<00:06:28.440> once<00:06:28.650> it's

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
of having PCmover email you once it's

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.020 
of having PCmover email you once it's
finished<00:06:28.980> that's<00:06:29.880> optional
