so up in these upper reaches of the
plantation<00:00:11.380> here<00:00:11.590> we<00:00:11.740> have<00:00:11.920> the<00:00:12.160> area<00:00:12.730> where

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
plantation here we have the area where

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.800 
plantation here we have the area where
where<00:00:13.810> the<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:15.460> Dutch<00:00:16.029> actually<00:00:16.299> had

where the the Dutch actually had

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.840 
where the the Dutch actually had
plantations<00:00:17.620> very<00:00:17.890> earlier<00:00:18.250> on<00:00:18.430> the<00:00:18.580> piece

plantations very earlier on the piece

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.540 
plantations very earlier on the piece
that's<00:00:19.810> probably<00:00:20.080> 1600<00:00:20.920> meters<00:00:21.250> above<00:00:21.490> sea

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.800 
that's probably 1600 meters above sea
level<00:00:21.850> and<00:00:23.190> the<00:00:24.190> actual<00:00:24.610> copy<00:00:24.970> that<00:00:25.330> they<00:00:25.480> grew

level and the actual copy that they grew

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.010 
level and the actual copy that they grew
up<00:00:25.990> in<00:00:26.140> that<00:00:26.260> region<00:00:26.590> was<00:00:26.949> the<00:00:27.250> the<00:00:27.699> Copa<00:00:28.480> Java

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
up in that region was the the Copa Java

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.239 
up in that region was the the Copa Java
or<00:00:29.260> coffee<00:00:29.920> Java<00:00:30.510> which<00:00:31.510> is<00:00:31.750> where<00:00:32.409> we<00:00:32.589> suspect

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:33.249 
or coffee Java which is where we suspect

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:36.869 
or coffee Java which is where we suspect
it's<00:00:34.179> quite<00:00:34.449> possible<00:00:34.989> that<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:36.550> actual

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
it's quite possible that the actual

it's quite possible that the actual
terminology<00:00:37.620> Java<00:00:38.620> coffee<00:00:39.069> Java<00:00:39.489> may<00:00:39.789> have

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
terminology Java coffee Java may have

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.149 
terminology Java coffee Java may have
come<00:00:40.179> from<00:00:40.359> and<00:00:40.690> when<00:00:41.229> we<00:00:41.350> first<00:00:41.649> went<00:00:41.890> up<00:00:41.979> in

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.159 
come from and when we first went up in

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:44.509 
come from and when we first went up in
here<00:00:42.370> it<00:00:42.460> was<00:00:42.550> very<00:00:42.879> very<00:00:43.210> very<00:00:43.809> dense<00:00:44.199> with

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
here it was very very very dense with

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.959 
here it was very very very dense with
jungle<00:00:45.519> and<00:00:47.219> that's<00:00:48.219> where<00:00:48.429> we<00:00:48.550> bumped<00:00:48.850> into

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
jungle and that's where we bumped into

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.559 
jungle and that's where we bumped into
the<00:00:49.269> old<00:00:49.449> plantation<00:00:50.019> whilst<00:00:50.530> I<00:00:50.920> was<00:00:51.129> picking

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:51.569 
the old plantation whilst I was picking

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:54.599 
the old plantation whilst I was picking
leeches<00:00:52.569> off<00:00:52.749> my<00:00:52.960> legs<00:00:53.229> because<00:00:54.190> I<00:00:54.280> was<00:00:54.399> silly

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
leeches off my legs because I was silly

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.910 
leeches off my legs because I was silly
enough<00:00:54.879> not<00:00:55.120> to<00:00:55.210> have<00:00:55.299> the<00:00:55.479> right<00:00:55.659> Footwear<00:00:56.559> on

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
enough not to have the right Footwear on

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.699 
enough not to have the right Footwear on
so<00:00:57.479> we'll<00:00:58.479> go<00:00:58.629> up<00:00:58.780> in<00:00:58.929> there<00:00:59.109> and<00:00:59.229> check<00:00:59.469> it<00:00:59.589> out

00:00:59.699 --> 00:00:59.709 
so we'll go up in there and check it out

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:01.529 
so we'll go up in there and check it out
and<00:00:59.949> we'll<00:01:00.850> have<00:01:01.030> a<00:01:01.059> look<00:01:01.179> at<00:01:01.299> the<00:01:01.420> old

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
and we'll have a look at the old

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.350 
and we'll have a look at the old
original<00:01:02.019> species<00:01:02.289> of<00:01:02.589> coffee<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:04.030> is<00:01:04.210> the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
original species of coffee this is the

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.730 
original species of coffee this is the
original<00:01:04.839> plantation<00:01:05.289> up<00:01:05.680> here<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:07.740> probably

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
original plantation up here and probably

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.609 
original plantation up here and probably
about<00:01:08.829> sixty<00:01:09.579> years<00:01:09.850> ago<00:01:09.939> the<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:11.350> actual

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
about sixty years ago the the actual

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.209 
about sixty years ago the the actual
people<00:01:12.039> that<00:01:12.070> farmed<00:01:12.610> this<00:01:12.759> area<00:01:14.159> were<00:01:15.159> very

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
people that farmed this area were very

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.639 
people that farmed this area were very
successful<00:01:15.640> with<00:01:16.119> their<00:01:16.420> coffee<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:16.930> they

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
successful with their coffee and they

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.270 
successful with their coffee and they
all<00:01:18.100> went<00:01:18.310> as<00:01:18.430> a<00:01:18.460> big<00:01:18.700> group<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:20.380> Mecca

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
all went as a big group to Mecca

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.529 
all went as a big group to Mecca
Taji<00:01:21.880> where<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.539> the<00:01:23.020> Islamic<00:01:23.590> religion<00:01:24.250> I

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
Taji where the the Islamic religion I

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.779 
Taji where the the Islamic religion I
guess<00:01:25.539> it's<00:01:25.750> once-in-a-lifetime<00:01:26.789> thing

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
guess it's once-in-a-lifetime thing

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.999 
guess it's once-in-a-lifetime thing
where<00:01:28.390> they<00:01:28.479> go<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.659> cleanse<00:01:29.079> themselves<00:01:29.320> and

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
where they go to cleanse themselves and

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.730 
where they go to cleanse themselves and
prepare<00:01:30.909> themselves<00:01:31.479> for<00:01:31.840> older<00:01:32.259> life<00:01:32.469> and

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
prepare themselves for older life and

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.770 
prepare themselves for older life and
there<00:01:33.670> was<00:01:33.759> a<00:01:33.789> group<00:01:34.030> of<00:01:34.149> guys<00:01:34.210> that<00:01:34.630> grew

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
there was a group of guys that grew

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.389 
there was a group of guys that grew
their<00:01:35.049> coffee<00:01:35.320> up<00:01:35.590> here<00:01:35.829> and<00:01:36.009> they<00:01:36.100> were<00:01:36.159> very

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
their coffee up here and they were very

very successful they had very very good
harvests<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.420> got<00:01:40.420> very<00:01:40.450> good<00:01:40.750> prices<00:01:41.320> for

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350

is easily tainted by other other things

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.460 
is easily tainted by other other things
like<00:04:09.639> if<00:04:10.269> it's<00:04:10.510> close<00:04:10.720> to<00:04:10.750> petrol

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
like if it's close to petrol

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.399 
like if it's close to petrol
it'll<00:04:11.949> take<00:04:12.129> on<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.989> taste<00:04:14.199> of

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
it'll take on the the the taste of

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.250 
it'll take on the the the taste of
petrol<00:04:15.570> anything<00:04:16.570> like<00:04:16.750> that<00:04:16.780> so<00:04:17.229> these<00:04:18.190> these

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
petrol anything like that so these these

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.030 
petrol anything like that so these these
berries<00:04:20.260> will<00:04:20.469> really<00:04:21.039> affect<00:04:21.130> this

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
berries will really affect this
