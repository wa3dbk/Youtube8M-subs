00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.780
 Then, reading the book in English is 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.989
 giving a beautiful headache I so 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.600

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.720
 I told you to get a book in the 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:09.580
 My niece's library from my 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:13.930
 Americanized niece and earned denies

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:28.090

 decido life of bees and put me lie othon 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.300
 of the king and a boy was undone there pulling me 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.340
 ear in the question of pronunciation that he 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.319
 say that was not how I said it 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.800
 it was something from birth 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:44.440
 Thank you so much, I'm worshiping who 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.119
 I want you to continue there by giving 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.920
 pronunciation can write the way he 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.920
 pronounced that I'm loving 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:56.619
 so this is free what I'm going to read 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:59.830
 good maybe until 2025 and I'm done 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.500
 It will but it will take a little bit of people. 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.130
 because so she told me she said it's from 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:11.950
 Easy level cool but for me nef that was 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:16.590
 Literacy in America and left 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.060
 yesterday everything lies is a year two and so 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.880
 she said she had easy level and perhaps 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.890
 I'd take it cool but he also has a 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.440
 Gentleman telling me it was cool he 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.480
 first children 's books because it has a 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.960
 more accessible language for auntie who 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.960
 Do not know much, so I said one. 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.970
 little for the first ones and the project 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.860
 She said she is in no hurry to give it back. 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.930
 but it is a book I wanted 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.970
 caring very well is a book of those 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.480
 editions that we call issues of 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.670
 It does not even look like you have a newspaper 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.470
 for that newspaper is that but she loves 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.220
 There's even a movie in this book. 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:58.120
 said then this book is going to be what I 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:02.410
 I'll hopefully she will not have as much 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.200
 time difference is this people 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:10.690
 I entered several channels there on youtube 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:13.060
 to see the question of learning I found 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.380
 cool tv culture I think I'm going 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.320
 put down here but I'm 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.830
 fooled I think I have is that the 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:27.880
 people learn with music so 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:33.580
 delta being mine more is top ten 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:36.130
 the ten more of the case of a tie because 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.960
 I'm listening already, I 'm trying to 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.990
 I have that hot melody I like 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:47.500
 I also like the alice here is that 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:50.800
 I just wanted to correct my family vision. 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.350
 my challenge 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:58.030
 so that's it folks keep giving me the 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.550
 strength and support I need to read this 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.950
 blessed free and since I threw the ball 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.420
 now you have to kick to the goal, right? 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.000
 People are not good for me. 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.780
 the boom is not staying there alone in the middle 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.550
 Back in the field waiting for the guys 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.700
 Make a goal and I will not 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.430
 watching the band pass but I will not read 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.880
 I hope so by the end of the year 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.760
 can read all he comes here speaks and 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.040
 understands every word and such case 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.270
 otherwise it will be a goal for those 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.020
 goals at the end of the year if I do not 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.690
 get from 2013 to 2014 one of my 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.330
 orders on my wish list to 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.950
 2014 will be to continue in Brazil there is no 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.900
 people but I think the dollar will give 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.300
 beach - only I need a little bit 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.100
 more discipline I have a type in 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.410
 week you have to give three times a week 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.240
 but I think it will improve 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.510
 a little bit this but your lot of 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.720
 thing but it's not the case so this is it 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.729

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:02.060

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.340
 But I think it 's very small in 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.729
 this October and that was what 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.729
