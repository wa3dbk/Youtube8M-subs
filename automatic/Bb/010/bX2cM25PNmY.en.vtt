are<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:16.949> guess<00:00:17.600> cuz<00:00:18.600> from<00:00:19.260> what<00:00:19.439> han<00:00:19.590> ji<00:00:19.770> said

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
are I guess cuz from what han ji said

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.820 
are I guess cuz from what han ji said
they<00:00:20.220> do<00:00:20.340> experiments<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.380> like<00:00:22.380> titans

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
they do experiments and like titans

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
titan said it felt like nothing and she

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.110 
titan said it felt like nothing and she
cut<00:00:49.050> off<00:00:49.200> an<00:00:49.410> arm<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.430> wasn't<00:00:50.760> nearly<00:00:50.969> as

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
cut off an arm and it wasn't nearly as

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.119 
cut off an arm and it wasn't nearly as
heavy<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.780> should<00:00:52.020> be<00:00:52.170> even<00:00:52.530> if<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.800> was<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
heavy as it should be even if it was a

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.860 
heavy as it should be even if it was a
skinny<00:00:53.730> arm<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:55.879> what<00:00:56.879> she<00:00:57.120> was<00:00:57.270> saying<00:00:57.570> is

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
skinny arm so what she was saying is

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.990 
skinny arm so what she was saying is
that<00:00:58.410> like<00:00:58.649> what<00:00:58.859> are<00:00:59.039> these<00:00:59.219> she<00:00:59.489> wants<00:00:59.730> find

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
that like what are these she wants find

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.080 
that like what are these she wants find
what<00:01:00.270> titans<00:01:01.199> are<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.680> i<00:01:02.579> know<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.820> lot<00:01:02.940> of

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
what titans are and i know a lot of

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.479 
what titans are and i know a lot of
people<00:01:03.210> thought<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.870> idea<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.680> they're

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
people thought of this idea but they're

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.469 
people thought of this idea but they're
probably<00:01:05.760> people<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.689> honest<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.619> like

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
probably people to be honest just like

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.179 
probably people to be honest just like
aaron<00:01:09.479> cuz<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.380> know<00:01:10.500> how<00:01:10.619> when<00:01:10.830> she<00:01:10.979> took

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
aaron cuz you know how when she took

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.100 
aaron cuz you know how when she took
when<00:01:11.520> he<00:01:11.549> turns<00:01:11.939> into<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.299> Titan<00:01:12.630> like<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.960> see

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
when he turns into a Titan like you see

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.249 
when he turns into a Titan like you see
a<00:01:13.140> lightning<00:01:13.560> bolt<00:01:13.710> happen<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.310> when<00:01:15.259> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
a lightning bolt happen and when the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.440 
a lightning bolt happen and when the
huge<00:01:17.070> ass<00:01:17.280> titan<00:01:17.700> from<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.030> beginning<00:01:18.390> i

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
huge ass titan from the beginning i

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.710 
huge ass titan from the beginning i
forget<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:19.170> they<00:01:19.350> call<00:01:19.530> him<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:20.720> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
forget what they call him but the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.390 
forget what they call him but the
Colossus<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.380> tightened<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.950> think<00:01:23.220> that's

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
Colossus is tightened I think that's

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.870 
Colossus is tightened I think that's
what<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:24.650> he<00:01:25.650> when<00:01:26.159> he<00:01:26.310> appears<00:01:26.670> it's

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
what it is but he when he appears it's

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.730 
what it is but he when he appears it's
lightning<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.390> what<00:01:27.570> he<00:01:27.869> disappears<00:01:28.439> just

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
lightning and what he disappears just

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.620 
lightning and what he disappears just
like<00:01:28.979> he<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:29.970> vanishes<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.860> I<00:01:31.860> believe<00:01:32.630> those

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
like he just vanishes so I believe those

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.660 
like he just vanishes so I believe those
titans<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> armored<00:01:35.130> titan<00:01:35.310> are

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
titans and the armored titan are

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.359 
titans and the armored titan are
probably<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.900> like<00:01:37.140> Aaron<00:01:37.650> but<00:01:37.920> they<00:01:38.159> can

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
probably just like Aaron but they can

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.539 
probably just like Aaron but they can
control<00:01:38.790> themselves<00:01:39.049> now<00:01:40.049> whether<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.369> might

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
control themselves now whether it might

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.730 
control themselves now whether it might
be<00:01:41.759> his<00:01:41.939> dad<00:01:42.210> or<00:01:42.600> his<00:01:42.750> dad<00:01:42.960> helped<00:01:43.350> create

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
be his dad or his dad helped create

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.090 
be his dad or his dad helped create
these<00:01:44.159> or<00:01:44.899> or<00:01:45.899> what<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.439> i'm<00:01:46.649> not<00:01:46.860> i'm<00:01:47.040> not
