00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.900
 hello I am alexis poacher 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.610
 welcome to kitchen - drawings 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.080
 today we will realize the one 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.370
 of game that comes from Picardy 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.720
 so I remind you of the principle of 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.290
 the show you see me your recipes 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.670
 in drawing and I cook them for 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.300
 this recipe we will need water 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.150
 potable 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.789
 a rice cake a few beans the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.470
 shrimp oil piquillo 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.180
 olive oil peanut vinegar 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.990
 white balsamic must be attacked 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.800
 with our shrimps 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.370
 we are going to dissect them nicely 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.250
 raise your head and then we dissect 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.450
 on the other hand we will keep the last rings 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.250
 who won a little aesthetic side to 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.630
 our set 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.340
 we 're just going away loyal is called 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.870
 castrated one says more sacred for a 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.570
 langoustine but hey we can see 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.410
 today for a shrimp see with 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.860
 the toothpick we made a small hole at the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.110
 basis that avoids the opening two one 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.660
 removed the casing from each shrimp 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.030
 now we go snacks and net 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.569
 peanut oil 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.569
 let it be said break 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.729
 we think to season of course that 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.490
 instead of beans so everything is eaten 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.140
 the cause if we remove this this little 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.159
 film that there is inside preferred 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.360
 choose young beans 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.619
 they are much more tender and 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.659
 especially if you have to write kitchens 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.119
 as we will do 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.450
 the piquionne we will carve a thin 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.450
 brunoise 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.049
 for the facts we will just crush them 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.850
 we're going to take shrimp 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.000
 we get the beans we will mix them 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.770
 the piquillos we will be surprised with 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.890
 white balsamic vinegar one to two 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:13.470
 spoons of olive oil and of course a 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.910
 little bit of salt the poutargue started to 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.260
 serve just increased it's very very good 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.850
 juice on a small toast of bread with a 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.860
 little butter we will cook it 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.870
 differently mule's cde agrees 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.320
 watch out for the wax that's around 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.320
 do not eat 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.530
 we almost all of you 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.090
 ask what are we going to do with that this 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.689
 rice cake we'll just fry it 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:49.730
 we will try to have a form of 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:55.969
 tortillas kids because out of the 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:03:00.019
 fryer up well the snacks and salty 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:03:01.689
 immediately to fix the salt go on 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.689
 will start to train we will start 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:09.500
 our little condiments at the bottom our 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:17.049
 chips over it halal is what 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:17.049

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.910
 and we will get some candy man back 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.910
 inside 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.629
 we will just finish with the little 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.629
 Vinaigrette 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.250
 we will finish with some leaves of 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:42.470
 cilantro here and there and then basta 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.080
