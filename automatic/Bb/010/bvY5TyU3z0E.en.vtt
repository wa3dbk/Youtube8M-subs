but<00:01:32.590> once<00:01:33.520> they're<00:01:33.729> in<00:01:33.850> there<00:01:34.000> usually<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.630> good

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
but once they're in there usually a good

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.350 
but once they're in there usually a good
enough<00:01:35.560> fit<00:01:35.800> so<00:01:36.009> that<00:01:36.040> they<00:01:36.280> stay<00:01:36.520> in<00:01:36.550> might

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
enough fit so that they stay in might

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.480 
enough fit so that they stay in might
just<00:01:37.570> need<00:01:37.780> to<00:01:37.990> press<00:01:38.619> them<00:01:38.830> home<00:01:39.040> properly

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
just need to press them home properly

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.550 
just need to press them home properly
and<00:01:39.759> then<00:01:40.509> you've<00:01:40.659> got<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.930> mirrors<00:01:41.200> fitted

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
and then you've got the mirrors fitted

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.070 
and then you've got the mirrors fitted
on<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.759> ma<00:01:43.119> n<00:01:43.240> tractor<00:01:43.630> there's<00:01:43.810> also<00:01:43.960> a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
on this ma n tractor there's also a

side door mirror and that just pushes

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.859 
side door mirror and that just pushes
into<00:01:48.610> place<00:01:48.850> although<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.450> might<00:01:49.600> need<00:01:49.780> to

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
into place although you might need to

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.060 
into place although you might need to
trim<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.170> molding<00:01:50.470> a<00:01:50.530> little<00:01:50.710> bit<00:01:50.830> to<00:01:50.920> get<00:01:51.009> a

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
trim the molding a little bit to get a

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.060 
trim the molding a little bit to get a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
good fit the last bits of it can be fun

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.770 
good fit the last bits of it can be fun
packed<00:01:54.340> or<00:01:54.550> frustrating<00:01:55.210> depending<00:01:55.570> on<00:01:55.660> how

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
packed or frustrating depending on how

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.910 
packed or frustrating depending on how
you<00:01:55.840> look<00:01:55.990> at<00:01:56.050> it<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.350> that's<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.649> get<00:01:56.770> the

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
you look at it and that's to get the

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.330 
you look at it and that's to get the
roof<00:01:57.100> aerial<00:01:57.670> in<00:01:57.850> place<00:01:58.179> in<00:01:58.420> its<00:01:58.600> hole

sometimes<00:02:00.340> these<00:02:00.550> go<00:02:00.700> in<00:02:00.820> easily<00:02:00.970> and

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
sometimes these go in easily and

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.820 
sometimes these go in easily and
sometimes<00:02:01.720> not<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.110> it's<00:02:02.259> best<00:02:02.440> to<00:02:02.500> try<00:02:02.679> and

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
sometimes not and it's best to try and

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.100 
sometimes not and it's best to try and
use<00:02:02.950> tweezers<00:02:03.250> like<00:02:03.460> this<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:04.060> just<00:02:04.360> put<00:02:04.840> the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
use tweezers like this to just put the

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.749 
use tweezers like this to just put the
downward<00:02:05.530> pressure<00:02:05.710> right<00:02:06.130> into<00:02:06.520> where<00:02:06.640> the

details<00:02:32.500> such<00:02:32.709> as<00:02:32.739> plastic<00:02:33.250> lenses<00:02:33.640> on<00:02:33.790> the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
details such as plastic lenses on the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.030 
details such as plastic lenses on the
lights<00:02:34.120> but<00:02:34.540> there's<00:02:35.380> no<00:02:35.500> number<00:02:35.799> plates

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
lights but there's no number plates

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.140 
lights but there's no number plates
which<00:02:36.310> would<00:02:36.459> have<00:02:36.549> made<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.850> bit<00:02:37.000> more

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
which would have made it a bit more

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.789 
which would have made it a bit more
realistic<00:02:37.480> although<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.200> wheel<00:02:38.350> hubs<00:02:38.590> do

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
realistic although the wheel hubs do

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.620 
realistic although the wheel hubs do
look<00:02:38.980> good<00:02:39.190> at<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.910> back<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.239> wheel<00:02:40.390> arches

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
look good at the back the wheel arches

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.420 
look good at the back the wheel arches
look<00:02:40.930> fine<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.500> lights<00:02:41.769> have<00:02:42.010> plastic<00:02:42.040> lenses

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
look fine the lights have plastic lenses

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.150 
look fine the lights have plastic lenses
but<00:02:43.060> again<00:02:43.299> there's<00:02:43.480> no<00:02:43.600> number<00:02:43.930> plates<00:02:44.170> the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
but again there's no number plates the

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.039 
but again there's no number plates the

bit like suspension but there's no swing

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.890 
bit like suspension but there's no swing
involved<00:03:55.430> it's<00:03:55.609> just<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.969> up<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:56.750> down

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
involved it's just a up and down

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.080 
involved it's just a up and down

couple of plastic stabilizer feet that

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.479 
couple of plastic stabilizer feet that
can<00:04:02.359> be<00:04:02.629> pulled<00:04:02.870> down<00:04:02.930> but<00:04:03.319> gosh<00:04:03.889> they<00:04:04.129> can<00:04:04.340> be

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
can be pulled down but gosh they can be

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.729 
can be pulled down but gosh they can be
stiff<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:04.939> pull<00:04:05.150> out<00:04:05.299> but<00:04:06.109> once<00:04:06.409> they're<00:04:06.620> out

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
stiff to pull out but once they're out

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.530 
stiff to pull out but once they're out
then<00:04:07.010> they<00:04:07.129> do<00:04:07.189> support<00:04:07.609> the<00:04:07.760> trailer<00:04:08.150> really

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
then they do support the trailer really

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.839 
then they do support the trailer really
quite<00:04:08.840> well<00:04:09.049> of<00:04:09.469> course<00:04:10.370> tractors<00:04:10.729> and

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
quite well of course tractors and

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.069 
quite well of course tractors and
trailers<00:04:11.030> like<00:04:11.359> to<00:04:11.540> spend<00:04:11.750> their<00:04:11.900> lives

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
trailers like to spend their lives

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.319 
trailers like to spend their lives
together<00:04:12.290> so<00:04:12.530> it's<00:04:13.069> easy<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.609> join<00:04:13.760> them<00:04:14.030> up

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
together so it's easy to join them up

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.589 
together so it's easy to join them up
the<00:04:14.780> kingpin<00:04:15.739> on<00:04:15.949> the<00:04:16.099> trailer<00:04:16.310> just<00:04:16.599> pushes

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:17.599 
the kingpin on the trailer just pushes

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:20.319 
the kingpin on the trailer just pushes
and<00:04:17.840> clips<00:04:18.229> into<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:19.099> fifth<00:04:19.880> wheel<00:04:19.940> on<00:04:20.180> the

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
and clips into the fifth wheel on the

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.600 
and clips into the fifth wheel on the
tractor<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.169> then<00:04:21.889> you've<00:04:22.010> formed<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:22.370> smart

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
tractor and then you've formed a smart

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.040 
tractor and then you've formed a smart
looking<00:04:22.849> vehicle<00:04:23.300> which<00:04:23.479> looks<00:04:23.750> ready<00:04:23.960> for

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
looking vehicle which looks ready for

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.920 
looking vehicle which looks ready for
some<00:04:24.320> action<00:04:24.440> of<00:04:25.300> course<00:04:26.300> a<00:04:26.479> tipper<00:04:26.780> is

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
some action of course a tipper is

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.659 
some action of course a tipper is
designed<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.409> tip<00:04:27.650> and<00:04:27.889> this<00:04:28.159> model<00:04:28.370> works

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
designed to tip and this model works

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.610 
designed to tip and this model works
pretty<00:04:29.120> well<00:04:29.300> there's<00:04:29.930> a<00:04:29.990> multistage

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
pretty well there's a multistage

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.909 
pretty well there's a multistage
cylinder<00:04:31.280> that<00:04:31.639> just<00:04:32.330> pulls<00:04:32.599> out<00:04:32.810> and<00:04:33.169> you<00:04:33.740> can

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
cylinder that just pulls out and you can

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.860 
cylinder that just pulls out and you can
get<00:04:34.039> a<00:04:34.070> decent<00:04:34.280> angle<00:04:34.760> of<00:04:34.849> about<00:04:35.060> 40<00:04:35.780> degrees

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
get a decent angle of about 40 degrees

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.550 
get a decent angle of about 40 degrees
on<00:04:36.229> the<00:04:36.349> tipper<00:04:36.710> the<00:04:37.580> tailgate<00:04:38.150> opens<00:04:38.599> it's<00:04:38.960> a

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
on the tipper the tailgate opens it's a

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.080 
on the tipper the tailgate opens it's a
little<00:04:40.190> bit<00:04:40.280> stiff<00:04:40.490> on<00:04:40.639> the<00:04:40.729> review<00:04:40.970> model

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
little bit stiff on the review model

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.149 
little bit stiff on the review model
it's<00:04:41.360> better<00:04:41.599> if<00:04:41.750> they<00:04:41.900> flap<00:04:42.710> about<00:04:42.949> a<00:04:42.979> little

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:43.159 
it's better if they flap about a little

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:46.210 
it's better if they flap about a little
bit<00:04:43.250> I<00:04:43.340> think<00:04:43.400> but<00:04:43.849> it<00:04:44.300> works<00:04:44.509> fine<00:04:44.870> and<00:04:45.220> when

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
bit I think but it works fine and when

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.680 
bit I think but it works fine and when
you've<00:04:46.340> tipped<00:04:46.550> your<00:04:46.729> load<00:04:46.880> you<00:04:47.060> can<00:04:47.210> push<00:04:47.419> the

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
you've tipped your load you can push the

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.980 
you've tipped your load you can push the
tipper<00:04:48.020> body<00:04:48.169> back<00:04:48.440> down<00:04:48.710> quite<00:04:49.340> easily

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
tipper body back down quite easily

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.210 
tipper body back down quite easily
there's<00:04:50.990> one<00:04:51.229> other<00:04:51.380> small<00:04:51.560> feature<00:04:51.919> on<00:04:52.130> the

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
there's one other small feature on the

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.490 
there's one other small feature on the
model<00:04:52.340> and<00:04:52.699> that<00:04:52.759> is<00:04:52.849> that<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:53.509> access<00:04:53.930> ladder

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
model and that is that the access ladder

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.159 
model and that is that the access ladder
up<00:04:54.830> to<00:04:54.889> the<00:04:55.190> access<00:04:55.880> platform<00:04:56.389> can<00:04:56.810> be<00:04:56.960> folded

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
up to the access platform can be folded

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.920 
up to the access platform can be folded
down<00:04:57.530> and<00:04:57.800> it<00:04:58.009> folds<00:04:58.220> back<00:04:58.490> up<00:04:58.729> but<00:04:59.720> there's<00:04:59.840> a

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
down and it folds back up but there's a

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.270 
down and it folds back up but there's a
small<00:05:00.050> problem<00:05:00.380> in<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.740> scaling<00:05:01.130> of<00:05:01.220> the

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
small problem in the scaling of the

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.740 
small problem in the scaling of the
model<00:05:01.610> because<00:05:01.940> if<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.180> tractor<00:05:02.570> and<00:05:02.659> trailer

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
model because if the tractor and trailer

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.570 
model because if the tractor and trailer
are<00:05:03.080> straight<00:05:03.349> you<00:05:03.949> then<00:05:04.130> can't<00:05:04.400> actually

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
are straight you then can't actually

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.909 
are straight you then can't actually
lower<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.120> ladder<00:05:05.440> this<00:05:06.440> is<00:05:06.650> a<00:05:06.680> pretty

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
lower the ladder this is a pretty

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.620 
lower the ladder this is a pretty
good-looking<00:05:07.190> model<00:05:07.729> from<00:05:07.880> Conrad<00:05:07.940> really

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
good-looking model from Conrad really

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.170 
good-looking model from Conrad really
because<00:05:08.930> of<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.139> eurovia<00:05:09.590> livery<00:05:09.979> the<00:05:10.909> level

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
because of the eurovia livery the level

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.760 
because of the eurovia livery the level
of<00:05:11.270> detail<00:05:11.630> is<00:05:11.750> not<00:05:11.900> particularly<00:05:12.259> high<00:05:12.530> but

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
of detail is not particularly high but

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.290 
of detail is not particularly high but
it<00:05:12.889> works<00:05:13.099> well<00:05:13.310> enough<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:13.849> if<00:05:13.940> you<00:05:14.030> want<00:05:14.210> to

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
it works well enough and if you want to

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.089 
it works well enough and if you want to
pose<00:05:14.479> it<00:05:14.659> with<00:05:14.810> other<00:05:14.960> models<00:05:15.380> then<00:05:15.950> it's

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
pose it with other models then it's

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.700 
pose it with other models then it's
recommended
