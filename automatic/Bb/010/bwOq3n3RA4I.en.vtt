00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
as outside hitter just because he knew

pretty fast the guy said it looked like
it<00:04:17.639> was<00:04:17.729> roughly<00:04:17.970> 60<00:04:18.359> miles<00:04:18.570> an<00:04:18.720> hour<00:04:18.840> which<00:04:19.109> is

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
it was roughly 60 miles an hour which is

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.360 
it was roughly 60 miles an hour which is
kind<00:04:19.440> of<00:04:19.500> surprising<00:04:19.620> because<00:04:20.100> I<00:04:20.220> have<00:04:20.340> a

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
kind of surprising because I have a

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.130 
kind of surprising because I have a
pretty<00:04:20.609> weak<00:04:20.910> arm<00:04:21.150> when<00:04:21.659> it<00:04:21.750> comes<00:04:21.930> to

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
pretty weak arm when it comes to

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.770 
pretty weak arm when it comes to
volleyball<00:04:22.919> hitting<00:04:23.099> so<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:23.909> hit<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.360> ball<00:04:24.539> and

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
volleyball hitting so I hit the ball and

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.990 
volleyball hitting so I hit the ball and
it<00:04:24.930> just<00:04:25.169> so<00:04:25.349> turns<00:04:25.680> out<00:04:25.890> that<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.280> guy<00:04:26.460> on<00:04:26.700> the

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
it just so turns out that the guy on the

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000 
it just so turns out that the guy on the
team<00:04:27.300> just<00:04:27.840> happens<00:04:28.290> to<00:04:28.470> be<00:04:28.530> at<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.860> wrong

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
team just happens to be at the wrong

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.490 
team just happens to be at the wrong
place<00:04:29.070> at<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.520> wrong<00:04:29.760> time<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.420> like<00:04:31.320> I<00:04:31.440> said

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
place at the wrong time and like I said

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.560 
place at the wrong time and like I said
these<00:04:31.800> guys<00:04:31.860> are<00:04:32.160> Timmy<00:04:32.340> no<00:04:32.580> thumbs<00:04:32.910> so<00:04:33.180> the

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
these guys are Timmy no thumbs so the

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.590 
these guys are Timmy no thumbs so the
ball<00:04:33.780> goes<00:04:34.050> directly<00:04:34.710> for<00:04:35.130> his<00:04:35.430> nose<00:04:35.820> and<00:04:36.150> the

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
ball goes directly for his nose and the

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.840 
ball goes directly for his nose and the
first<00:04:36.840> thing<00:04:37.020> I<00:04:37.200> hear<00:04:37.590> is<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.980> loudest<00:04:38.250> crunch

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
first thing I hear is the loudest crunch

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.970 
first thing I hear is the loudest crunch
crunch<00:04:39.840> heard<00:04:40.140> around<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.500> world<00:04:40.560> just<00:04:40.920> like

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
crunch heard around the world just like

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.230 
crunch heard around the world just like
the<00:04:41.130> shot<00:04:41.340> heard<00:04:41.550> around<00:04:41.640> the<00:04:41.820> world<00:04:41.880> this<00:04:42.120> was

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
the shot heard around the world this was

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.730 
the shot heard around the world this was
the<00:04:42.360> crunch<00:04:42.660> heard<00:04:42.900> around<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.140> world<00:04:43.200> so<00:04:43.710> I

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
the crunch heard around the world so I

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.050 
the crunch heard around the world so I
knew<00:04:44.130> right<00:04:44.370> from<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.670> start<00:04:44.730> that<00:04:44.940> I

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
knew right from the start that I

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.510 
knew right from the start that I
accidentally<00:04:45.930> broke<00:04:46.230> something<00:04:46.710> I<00:04:46.860> felt<00:04:47.370> that

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
accidentally broke something I felt that

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.800

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
it literally got so quiet so after he

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.510 
it literally got so quiet so after he
was<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:52.380> know<00:04:52.440> lying<00:04:52.740> on<00:04:52.920> the<00:04:53.010> ground<00:04:53.190> for<00:04:53.460> a
