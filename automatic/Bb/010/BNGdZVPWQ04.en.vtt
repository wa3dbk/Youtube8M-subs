dongles which we don't want but if we

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.410 
dongles which we don't want but if we
carry<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.410> let's<00:02:28.410> have<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.680> look<00:02:28.970> it's<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.030> tomtom

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
carry on let's have a look it's a tomtom

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.150 
carry on let's have a look it's a tomtom
receive<00:02:30.720> that's<00:02:30.900> 45<00:02:31.380> pounds<00:02:31.680> but<00:02:31.800> you<00:02:31.890> can<00:02:32.010> get

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
receive that's 45 pounds but you can get

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.940 
receive that's 45 pounds but you can get
them<00:02:32.340> quite<00:02:32.880> cheap<00:02:33.410> let's<00:02:34.410> have<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.739> look<00:02:34.920> for

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
them quite cheap let's have a look for

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.360 
them quite cheap let's have a look for
one<00:02:35.310> for<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:36.440> there's<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.560> bluetooth<00:02:37.950> one<00:02:38.160> here

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
one for you there's a bluetooth one here

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.400 
one for you there's a bluetooth one here
which<00:02:38.549> also<00:02:38.760> runs<00:02:39.120> off<00:02:39.269> solar<00:02:39.959> power<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.379> you

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
which also runs off solar power so you

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.229 
which also runs off solar power so you
don't<00:02:40.650> have<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.830> charge<00:02:41.099> it<00:02:41.250> up<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.610> much<00:02:44.239> and

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
don't have to charge it up that much and

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.300 
don't have to charge it up that much and
here's<00:02:45.510> one<00:02:45.690> from<00:02:45.840> hong<00:02:46.080> kong<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.890> range<00:02:47.160> from

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
pounds depending this one here i'll just

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.520 
pounds depending this one here i'll just
click<00:02:52.769> on<00:02:52.829> it<00:02:53.069> just<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.310> give<00:02:53.549> you<00:02:53.670> an<00:02:53.760> idea

connecting to satellite up in space and

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.569 
connecting to satellite up in space and
then<00:03:10.590> you'll<00:03:10.829> be<00:03:10.860> able<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.099> find<00:03:11.310> out<00:03:11.459> where

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
so if I have a look at let's go view map

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.400 
so if I have a look at let's go view map
now<00:04:57.480> it's<00:04:57.600> going<00:04:57.690> to<00:04:57.750> search<00:04:57.930> for<00:04:58.110> satellite

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410
