00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.860
A dry lakebed is a great place to shoot. 
It has an incredible span.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.800
It is the closest thing we have to a Sahara within reach.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm thrilled with what we did last time but I would like

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.849
to see this one in daylight as well because
I think it would look completely different

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:32.200
not using any of the LED lights on it, just
blue sky, we will overpower the sun with flash

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:40.200
and darken the sky a bit, just to give it
a very rich blue background but the feeling

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.469
is daytime. It's very beautiful when it is
lit up and we want to get it on the desert

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.400
floor so I can get a little bit more off the sides.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.000
Do you like seeing this much left and right,
like a little off here and here?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.089
Let's push in a tiny bit. 
Okay, cool.

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.500
I want to get more sky. Lower blue.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.050
Previously with the gas station I was giving a lot of room

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.770
because we were shooting the jungle on Maui
and for these since we are in a desert location,

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.720
we are cropping into it because when you see
these images of refineries, they seem to go

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.570
on forever, and by cropping into it, it gives
that illusion that this futuristic little

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:35.300
city could go on forever by not showing the
ends of it. Here I chose the option to have

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.860
a little bit of the sides because we are in
this big dry lakebed and maybe get some of

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.200
the mountains in the background.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.200
Do you think we should try having the light
coming from over here to fill in the shadow?

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.500
But then if we are exposing for the sun 
we are not going to get as rich a sky.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.500
Okay. 
I still can move that light around.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I like that better, John, lower angle. 
You like the lower one better?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.200
Yeah.
Me too.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.200
Go big daddy! Wow, okay, 
hold on! Go back one.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.200
You're talking to the machine. 
Why can't it just listen to my voice?

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.300
That's on right there.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.600
Look, how great!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Those are architectural drawing tools and 
I saw one of our model builders using it,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.600
and I said: Oh, I love how that looks!
Kind of look like platforms of some sort.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.600
1, 2, 3.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.040
I'm very much into the technique of photography.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.969
I spent 12 years in the darkroom,
6 years printing black and white, 6 years

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:08.180
printing color of my work when I first started
out. For me it is the opposite of a snapshot.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.859
These are very much considered in terms of
the thought and work that goes into it.

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:19.600
This one is getting lost. Do you want to put two there? They are really cool.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.500
Now we will go to evening.
We will turn on all the lights,

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.000
and we will get that twilight evening kind of glow.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.989
Two completely different looks because
it also looks beautiful in daylight with sun

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.989
and bright blue sky but at night they come
alive. Little LEDs all over are going to glow

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.700
and get that feeling of a refinery at night
and it looks like a crazy city.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:04.100
It is just getting prettier and prettier. 
Looking really good!

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:18.000
I'd stay with 10 minutes. 
And then it is killing steak time.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.000
Go a little less with your wave, 
just a little wiggle. It's the wrist action.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
More chopping, less talking.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Everything from the Phase One camera
systems to Capture One Pro,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
it's all about the flow of how these things get made 
and get finished and look the way they do.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.889
That's why I leave imperfections in, 
so you can see the humanity

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.020
and see that these are not digitally created
or CGI. These are photographs, I'm a photographer

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.030
and it would be boring for me to spend my
life on a computer sort of illustrating,

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.860
that is not my thing. I'm sort of indebted to Phase
One and Capture One Pro because it is a very

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.100
important part of what I do and how I can do it.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.200
I wouldn't use it if it wasn't the best. I just can't afford to.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Alright, we got it. We did it. Yay!

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:28.000
I'm thrilled. I had a pretty good idea 
that they were going to be really great

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.100
seeing them come to life in the studio, and I think 
it really helps to be in a dry lakebed.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:39.100
To be on a mountain where we have been
shooting them as opposed to in a studio set.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.729
It just bring these variables you can't recreate.
