Pachycephalosaurus and if you haven't
guessed<00:00:45.970> already<00:00:46.150> it's<00:00:46.810> very<00:00:47.290> similar<00:00:47.680> to<00:00:48.010> the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
guessed already it's very similar to the

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.520

design<00:00:48.460> of<00:00:48.700> the<00:00:49.450> package<00:00:49.810> surplus<00:00:50.110> or<00:00:50.260> as<00:00:50.380> we

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
design of the package surplus or as we

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.370 
design of the package surplus or as we
see<00:00:50.740> in<00:00:50.980> the<00:00:51.100> lost<00:00:51.310> world<00:00:51.930> even<00:00:52.930> down<00:00:53.170> to<00:00:53.200> the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
see in the lost world even down to the

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.540 
see in the lost world even down to the
color<00:00:53.590> scheme<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:55.860> almost<00:00:56.860> exactly<00:00:57.040> the

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
color scheme it's almost exactly the

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.550 
color scheme it's almost exactly the
same<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.820> you<00:01:00.880> can<00:01:01.180> see<00:01:01.480> some<00:01:01.900> wonderful
