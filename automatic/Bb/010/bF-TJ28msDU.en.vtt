00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
normally with any other type of pizza

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.539 
normally with any other type of pizza
the<00:01:39.659> sauce<00:01:39.960> goes<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.380> first<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:40.860> with<00:01:41.009> Chicago

style the sauce goes on last and the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.770 
style the sauce goes on last and the
reason<00:01:44.280> why<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.490> because<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.720> to

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
reason why is because this is going to

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.899 
reason why is because this is going to
take<00:01:45.930> about<00:01:45.990> 25<00:01:46.590> minutes<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.159> bake<00:01:47.399> at<00:01:47.700> about

take about 25 minutes to bake at about
425<00:01:48.689> degrees<00:01:49.200> which<00:01:49.979> means<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.399> anything<00:01:50.700> on

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
425 degrees which means that anything on

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.639 
425 degrees which means that anything on
