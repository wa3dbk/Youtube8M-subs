00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:18.919
 on the other hand, I find it very dangerous 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:23.579
 setting to be content means life 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:27.390
 the growth of the tree also does not stop growing 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:31.110
 says that now she is happy with what 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.100
 she reached observing nature we 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:41.280
 we can state everything lives while it is 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:45.000
 grows and while it grows she lives if 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.930
 we want to live right we have to grow 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.770
 and I think it applies to ours. 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.590
 welfare 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.590
 only so can we do much 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.010
 more things that will make our lives 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.520
 it is better 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.989
 you want to grow 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:08.200
 the question is how ready are you ready 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.500
 do you for this leave that comfortable 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.210
 the zone in which you are most 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:19.710
 people do not want problems but growth 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.260
 only happens where there are problems 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.660
 perhaps you are interested in more reliable 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.290
 way to leave the comfort zone 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.580
 I will show it to you in this program we 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.880
 will discuss 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:39.049
 how can you increase your income 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:43.070
 try to increase your income not by 5 10 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:47.360
 or 15 percent at once for a thousand 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:50.439
 percent try to earn 10 times 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.170
 more than I ask you to do it 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:57.679
 because only in this way can we realize 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.450
 that for such big changes we 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.450
 must change themselves
