okay<00:00:01.170> so<00:00:01.230> important<00:00:02.010> things<00:00:02.220> are<00:00:03.859> great

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
okay so important things are great

sounding<00:00:05.250> guitar<00:00:05.540> then<00:00:06.540> for<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.410> clean<00:00:07.830> sound<00:00:08.160> I

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
sounding guitar then for a clean sound I

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.629 
sounding guitar then for a clean sound I
like<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.120> use<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.300> compressor<00:00:10.070> just<00:00:11.070> because<00:00:11.429> it

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
like to use a compressor just because it

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.940 
like to use a compressor just because it
just<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:12.210> can<00:00:12.389> really<00:00:12.660> hit<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.019> strings<00:00:13.410> and

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
just you can really hit the strings and

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.769 
just you can really hit the strings and
I<00:00:15.590> have<00:00:16.590> been<00:00:16.800> known<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.369> get<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.119> think<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.630> have

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
I have been known to get I think I have

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.960 
I have been known to get I think I have
every<00:00:19.289> compressor<00:00:19.830> ever<00:00:20.130> made<00:00:20.400> there's

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
every compressor ever made there's

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.759 
every compressor ever made there's
probably<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.390> few<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.630> don't<00:00:21.900> have<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.380> if<00:00:22.500> any<00:00:22.650> of

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
probably a few I don't have so if any of

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.490 
probably a few I don't have so if any of
you<00:00:22.830> guys<00:00:22.980> know<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.820> any<00:00:24.109> that<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.140> don't<00:00:25.380> have

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
you guys know of any that I don't have

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.820 
you guys know of any that I don't have
let<00:00:26.010> me<00:00:26.130> know<00:00:26.160> but<00:00:27.050> one<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.260> really<00:00:28.500> like

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
let me know but one that I really like

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.770 
let me know but one that I really like
is<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.580> AIA<00:00:30.000> comp<00:00:30.949> which<00:00:32.210> is<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.540> guy<00:00:33.750> over

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
is the AIA comp which is this guy over

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.670 
is the AIA comp which is this guy over
here<00:00:35.000> it's<00:00:36.000> got<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.840> can<00:00:37.020> get<00:00:37.200> anywhere<00:00:37.620> from

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
here it's got you can get anywhere from

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:52.660 
here it's got you can get anywhere from
just<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:39.890> subtle<00:00:41.210> compression

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:27.510 

you<00:01:00.340> can<00:01:01.000> get<00:01:01.120> a<00:01:01.149> real<00:01:01.390> squash

one<00:01:35.479> of<00:01:35.570> my<00:01:35.659> favorites<00:01:36.350> is<00:01:36.800> this<00:01:37.220> orange

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
one of my favorites is this orange

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.920 
one of my favorites is this orange
squeezer<00:01:38.479> that<00:01:39.470> analog<00:01:39.950> man<00:01:40.250> makes<00:01:40.610> I<00:01:41.300> used<00:01:41.750> to

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
squeezer that analog man makes I used to

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.980 
squeezer that analog man makes I used to
have<00:01:42.140> an<00:01:42.380> orange<00:01:42.619> squeezer<00:01:43.420> way<00:01:44.420> back<00:01:44.690> when

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
have an orange squeezer way back when

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.630 
have an orange squeezer way back when
they<00:01:45.080> were<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.350> real<00:01:45.560> orange<00:01:45.920> squeezers<00:01:46.430> and

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
they were the real orange squeezers and

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.889 
they were the real orange squeezers and
I<00:01:46.700> loved<00:01:47.119> it<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:47.630> over<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:48.740> years<00:01:49.009> I<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:49.759> know

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
I loved it and over the years I you know

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.530 
I loved it and over the years I you know
lost<00:01:50.899> it<00:01:51.170> or<00:01:51.320> something<00:01:51.770> and<00:01:52.360> there<00:01:53.360> were<00:01:53.509> a

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
lost it or something and there were a

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.450 
lost it or something and there were a
couple<00:01:53.899> other<00:01:54.170> ones<00:01:54.470> that<00:01:54.649> were<00:01:54.830> supposed<00:01:55.040> to

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
couple other ones that were supposed to

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.760 
couple other ones that were supposed to
be<00:01:55.670> real<00:01:56.030> orange<00:01:56.509> squeezers<00:01:56.990> that<00:01:57.320> I<00:01:57.350> tried

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
be real orange squeezers that I tried

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.340 
be real orange squeezers that I tried
they<00:01:58.130> were<00:01:58.250> never<00:01:58.429> quite<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:58.910> same<00:01:59.080> this<00:02:00.080> one

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
they were never quite the same this one

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.650 
they were never quite the same this one
which<00:02:00.619> my<00:02:00.830> friend<00:02:01.160> I<00:02:01.910> have<00:02:02.179> a<00:02:02.210> friend<00:02:02.509> named

dan Warner who's a big studio guy in
Miami<00:02:05.860> he<00:02:06.860> gave<00:02:07.070> it<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:07.310> me<00:02:07.460> as<00:02:07.550> a<00:02:07.580> gift<00:02:07.910> and

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
Miami he gave it to me as a gift and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.710 
Miami he gave it to me as a gift and
it's<00:02:08.869> I've<00:02:09.320> used<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:10.039> ever<00:02:10.250> since<00:02:10.420> one<00:02:11.420> side

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
it's I've used it ever since one side

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.110 
it's I've used it ever since one side
it's<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.380> buy<00:02:12.620> comp<00:02:13.010> one<00:02:13.310> side<00:02:13.550> is<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.910> Ross

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
it's the buy comp one side is the Ross

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.979 
it's the buy comp one side is the Ross
compressor<00:02:14.840> which<00:02:15.110> is<00:02:15.440> cool<00:02:16.310> but<00:02:17.300> I<00:02:17.510> like<00:02:17.780> the

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
compressor which is cool but I like the

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.350 
compressor which is cool but I like the
orange<00:02:18.320> squeezer<00:02:18.709> which<00:02:19.459> is<00:02:19.640> this<00:02:19.880> yellow

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
orange squeezer which is this yellow

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.750 
orange squeezer which is this yellow
side<00:02:20.690> which<00:02:21.019> all<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.500> have<00:02:21.620> is<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.130> choice<00:02:22.459> of

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
side which all you have is a choice of

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.150 
side which all you have is a choice of
volume<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.209> don't<00:02:23.540> have<00:02:23.690> any<00:02:23.870> attack<00:02:24.709> time<00:02:25.010> or

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
volume you don't have any attack time or

00:02:25.160 --> 00:03:00.400 
volume you don't have any attack time or
anything<00:02:25.370> but

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.230 

so<00:03:01.410> it's<00:03:01.590> great<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:01.950> me<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.430> like<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.910> great

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
so it's great to me it's like the great

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.660 
so it's great to me it's like the great
you<00:03:03.930> know<00:03:04.050> really<00:03:04.530> when<00:03:04.710> you<00:03:04.800> want<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.160> really

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
you know really when you want to really

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.200 
you know really when you want to really
have<00:03:05.880> an<00:03:06.000> effect<00:03:06.410> that's<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.680> one<00:03:08.000> when<00:03:09.000> you

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
have an effect that's the one when you

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.000 
have an effect that's the one when you
have<00:03:09.690> no<00:03:09.930> doubt<00:03:10.170> about<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.530> there's<00:03:10.920> a

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
have no doubt about that there's a

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.770 
have no doubt about that there's a
compressor<00:03:11.550> on<00:03:11.580> your<00:03:11.820> sound<00:03:12.030> which<00:03:12.480> at<00:03:12.660> the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
compressor on your sound which at the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.660 
compressor on your sound which at the
AIA<00:03:12.960> can<00:03:13.380> do<00:03:13.530> too<00:03:13.800> when<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.280> turn<00:03:14.520> the

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
AIA can do too when you turn the

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.180 
AIA can do too when you turn the
compression<00:03:15.210> way<00:03:15.570> up<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.470> have<00:03:16.560> more<00:03:16.770> control

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
compression way up you have more control

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.840 
compression way up you have more control
on<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.580> AIA<00:03:17.730> as<00:03:18.510> far<00:03:18.870> as<00:03:19.080> subtle<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:20.010> squash

on the AIA as far as subtle to squash

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.380 
on the AIA as far as subtle to squash
but<00:03:21.420> when<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.440> don't<00:03:23.220> want<00:03:23.460> it<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.820> really<00:03:24.120> sound

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
but when I don't want it to really sound

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.760 
but when I don't want it to really sound
like<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.720> compressor<00:03:25.020> I<00:03:25.530> use<00:03:26.460> the<00:03:26.790> Demeter

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
like the compressor I use the Demeter

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.510 
like the compressor I use the Demeter
opto<00:03:28.770> compa<00:03:29.580> later<00:03:29.900> because<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.800> adds<00:03:32.040> just<00:03:32.340> a

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
opto compa later because it adds just a

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.450 
opto compa later because it adds just a
real<00:03:32.730> nice<00:03:32.910> boost<00:03:33.450> this<00:03:33.780> is<00:03:33.840> what<00:03:34.080> that<00:03:37.460> it

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
real nice boost this is what that it

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.970 
real nice boost this is what that it
adds<00:03:38.700> I<00:03:39.210> like<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:39.990> it<00:03:40.110> keeps<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.560> high<00:03:40.710> end

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
adds I like that it keeps the high end

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.070 
adds I like that it keeps the high end
it<00:03:41.520> keeps<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.820> high<00:03:41.970> end<00:03:42.180> real<00:03:42.420> nice<00:03:44.570> and<00:03:45.570> it's

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
it keeps the high end real nice and it's

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.720 
it keeps the high end real nice and it's
for<00:03:46.290> when<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.560> don't<00:03:46.770> want<00:03:47.130> it<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.400> be<00:03:47.520> really

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
for when you don't want it to be really

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.030 
for when you don't want it to be really
squashed<00:03:48.270> it's<00:03:49.160> kind<00:03:50.160> of<00:03:51.650> sometimes<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.860> want

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
squashed it's kind of sometimes you want

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.740 
squashed it's kind of sometimes you want
to<00:03:53.130> really<00:03:53.310> be<00:03:53.400> able<00:03:53.580> to<00:03:53.700> slack<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.330> chords

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
to really be able to slack the chords

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.580 
to really be able to slack the chords
and<00:03:54.900> hear<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.590> compression<00:03:56.490> and<00:03:56.790> sometimes

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
and hear that compression and sometimes

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.780 
and hear that compression and sometimes
you<00:03:58.590> want<00:03:58.770> that<00:03:58.950> definition<00:03:59.459> like

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.160 

so<00:04:06.790> that<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.209> Demeter<00:04:07.599> is<00:04:07.660> great<00:04:07.959> for<00:04:08.140> that

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
so that the Demeter is great for that

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.020 
so that the Demeter is great for that
you<00:04:08.379> can<00:04:08.590> turn<00:04:08.769> up<00:04:08.830> the<00:04:09.099> compression<00:04:11.790> it's<00:04:12.790> a

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
you can turn up the compression it's a

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:24.030 
you can turn up the compression it's a
little<00:04:13.330> different<00:04:22.020> it's<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.350> stays<00:04:23.680> pretty

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
little different it's it stays pretty

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.090 
little different it's it stays pretty
subtle<00:04:24.460> though<00:04:24.760> which<00:04:25.030> which<00:04:25.449> I<00:04:25.600> like<00:04:25.900> so<00:04:26.500> to

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
subtle though which which I like so to

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.950 
subtle though which which I like so to
me<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.520> you<00:04:27.580> can<00:04:27.729> even<00:04:27.880> use<00:04:28.090> humbuckers<00:04:28.720> with

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
me and you can even use humbuckers with

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.720 
me and you can even use humbuckers with
with<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.040> Demeter<00:04:30.880> which<00:04:31.090> is<00:04:31.270> pretty<00:04:31.479> nice
