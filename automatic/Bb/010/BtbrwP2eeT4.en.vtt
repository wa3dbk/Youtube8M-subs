with my back flips and finish with a
very<00:01:00.909> aggressive<00:01:01.260> 720<00:01:02.260> which<00:01:02.439> will<00:01:02.589> be<00:01:02.710> the

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
very aggressive 720 which will be the

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.619 
very aggressive 720 which will be the
key<00:01:03.039> to<00:01:03.070> complete<00:01:03.519> my<00:01:03.640> last<00:01:03.909> spin<00:01:04.210> during<00:01:04.479> the

I<00:01:15.250> start<00:01:15.819> by<00:01:15.850> connecting<00:01:16.179> both<00:01:16.509> flips<00:01:16.810> in<00:01:16.960> the

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
I start by connecting both flips in the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.080 
I start by connecting both flips in the
air<00:01:17.110> without<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.649> board<00:01:17.890> once<00:01:18.700> this<00:01:18.819> feels

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
air without the board once this feels

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.949 
air without the board once this feels
comfortable<00:01:19.539> I<00:01:19.659> attempted<00:01:20.049> open<00:01:20.440> twist<00:01:20.649> 9<00:01:21.959> the

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:22.959

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.430 
game teams due to the weight of the
board<00:01:24.670> I<00:01:24.880> drop<00:01:25.390> my<00:01:25.420> shoulder<00:01:25.899> aggressively

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
during the first flip to reach for my

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.960 
during the first flip to reach for my
grab<00:01:28.240> I<00:01:28.799> tried<00:01:29.799> holding<00:01:29.979> onto<00:01:30.250> my<00:01:30.490> board<00:01:30.729> as

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970

grab I tried holding onto my board as
long<00:01:31.000> as<00:01:31.270> I<00:01:31.360> can<00:01:31.420> during<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.959> first<00:01:32.229> flip<00:01:32.530> and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
long as I can during the first flip and

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.649 
long as I can during the first flip and
release<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.399> grab<00:01:33.640> as<00:01:33.850> I<00:01:34.000> initiate<00:01:34.479> my

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
release the grab as I initiate my

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.260 
release the grab as I initiate my
backside<00:01:35.110> rodeo<00:01:35.440> on<00:01:35.619> my<00:01:35.740> second<00:01:36.130> trip<00:01:36.280> due<00:01:37.090> to

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
backside rodeo on my second trip due to

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.639 
backside rodeo on my second trip due to
a<00:01:37.299> lack<00:01:37.479> of<00:01:37.509> height<00:01:37.810> I'm<00:01:38.020> having<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.409> hard<00:01:38.590> time

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
a lack of height I'm having a hard time

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.520 
a lack of height I'm having a hard time
again<00:01:38.890> in<00:01:39.159> my<00:01:39.250> last<00:01:39.459> 180-degree<00:01:40.179> turnaround

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
again in my last 180-degree turnaround

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.529 
again in my last 180-degree turnaround
so<00:01:41.530> I<00:01:41.560> cheated<00:01:41.920> from<00:01:42.159> now<00:01:42.280> with<00:01:42.520> a<00:01:42.549> 180<00:01:43.119> degree

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
so I cheated from now with a 180 degree

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.800 
so I cheated from now with a 180 degree
I<00:01:44.259> am<00:01:44.979> 180<00:01:45.399> degrees<00:01:45.789> away<00:01:46.000> from<00:01:46.149> between<00:01:46.570> the

I am 180 degrees away from between the

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.660 
I am 180 degrees away from between the

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
dobe McTwist flow with a little more

dobe McTwist flow with a little more
height<00:01:48.939> and<00:01:49.119> better<00:01:49.450> connection<00:01:49.960> between<00:01:50.079> my

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
height and better connection between my

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
little hop at the end that made it a 12

little hop at the end that made it a 12
hopefully<00:02:07.440> this<00:02:07.740> video<00:02:07.920> broke<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.490> down<00:02:08.610> a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
hopefully this video broke it down a
