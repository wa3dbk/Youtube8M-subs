00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
but if your England Julie you've got to

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.660 
but if your England Julie you've got to
feel<00:00:49.539> very<00:00:49.750> good<00:00:49.870> about<00:00:50.289> yourself<00:00:51.070> especially

at<00:00:51.820> this<00:00:52.089> stage<00:00:52.530> zero<00:00:53.530> zero<00:00:53.920> this<00:00:54.489> was<00:00:54.670> the

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
at this stage zero zero this was the

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:56.819 
at this stage zero zero this was the
play<00:00:54.969> with<00:00:55.870> Wambach<00:00:56.260> with<00:00:56.469> the<00:00:56.559> elbow

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
play with Wambach with the elbow

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.790 
play with Wambach with the elbow
apparently<00:00:57.550> but<00:00:58.089> if<00:00:58.180> your<00:00:58.300> England<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:59.620> said

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
apparently but if your England we said

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.200 
apparently but if your England we said
before<00:01:00.129> they<00:01:00.219> their<00:01:00.579> play<00:01:00.820> with<00:01:01.000> confidence

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
before they their play with confidence

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.180 
before they their play with confidence
you<00:01:01.719> would<00:01:01.870> think<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.409> longer<00:01:02.710> they<00:01:02.800> stay<00:01:02.859> in

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
you would think the longer they stay in

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.410 
you would think the longer they stay in
is<00:01:03.339> the<00:01:03.460> more<00:01:03.610> confidence<00:01:04.059> they<00:01:04.149> will<00:01:04.299> have

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
is the more confidence they will have

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.670 
is the more confidence they will have
that<00:01:04.659> they<00:01:04.750> could<00:01:04.960> pull<00:01:05.229> off<00:01:05.259> and<00:01:06.100> upset<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
that they could pull off and upset the

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.350 
that they could pull off and upset the
way<00:01:08.890> they're<00:01:09.130> moving<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.640> ball<00:01:09.789> around<00:01:09.850> it

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
way they're moving the ball around it

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.350 
way they're moving the ball around it
just<00:01:10.570> wears<00:01:10.899> on<00:01:11.229> a<00:01:11.259> team<00:01:11.530> it's<00:01:11.740> so<00:01:11.890> frustrating

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
just wears on a team it's so frustrating

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.990 
just wears on a team it's so frustrating
to<00:01:13.380> defend<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.770> constantly<00:01:15.310> chase<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:15.909> when

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
to defend and constantly chase and when

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.820 
to defend and constantly chase and when
you<00:01:16.090> see<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.330> United<00:01:16.750> States<00:01:17.049> constantly<00:01:17.710> on

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
you see the United States constantly on

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.520 
you see the United States constantly on
their<00:01:17.979> heels<00:01:18.250> it<00:01:19.179> just<00:01:19.539> lifts<00:01:20.020> up<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.200> team

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
their heels it just lifts up the team

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.649 
their heels it just lifts up the team
that's<00:01:20.740> offensive<00:01:21.340> ly<00:01:21.520> doing<00:01:22.119> so<00:01:22.270> many<00:01:22.450> great

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
that's offensive ly doing so many great

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.100 
that's offensive ly doing so many great
things<00:01:22.690> and<00:01:23.200> so<00:01:23.380> I<00:01:23.619> think<00:01:23.950> anemic<00:01:24.490> England

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
things and so I think anemic England

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.690 
things and so I think anemic England
hopes<00:01:26.110> to<00:01:26.440> continue<00:01:26.740> that<00:01:27.009> possession<00:01:27.399> and

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
hopes to continue that possession and

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.149 
hopes to continue that possession and
that<00:01:27.789> rhythm<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.270> that<00:01:28.360> flow<00:01:28.860> she<00:01:29.860> is<00:01:29.950> one<00:01:30.130> of

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
that rhythm and that flow she is one of

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.249 
that rhythm and that flow she is one of
