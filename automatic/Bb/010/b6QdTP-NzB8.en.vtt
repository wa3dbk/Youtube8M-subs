00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 go we find ourselves for a new 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.009
 video print is here now we're going 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.509
 always talk about a mini games 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.919
 nintendo moors that we had also 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.559
 the opportunity to try to May 3 which has 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.750
 been improved since the legend of 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.450
 zelda batelco is then who puts us 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.580
 in the skin and well as you can 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.500
 the names indicate it from zelda and its 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.359
 compatriots who go and well everything 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.220
 just have to go through the way 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.680
 a rail shooter and many levels 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.439
 to go beat enemies undo 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.359
 bumps and save the triforce then 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.800
 it's controlled in two ways 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.120
 different a bit like all games 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.309
 nintendo moors to know that there are 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.710
 people who necessarily play with the wiimote 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.660
 and others who play with one another 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.219
 forgiveness who plays with the gamepad then 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.469
 with the gamepad you have a target a 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.289
 little bit I was going to say the way 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.360
 of a fps you have your bow and you 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.760
 truly lead in space in 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.399
 made for power and well returned the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.750
 camera is aimed after it's a bit like 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.000
 in real life ie more 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.910
 you good effort the bow more and well 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.859
 your shots will be effective and so the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.300
 well, we'll have to aim for 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.430
 go out to support your little comrades who 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.540
 they play with the wiimotes and playing 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.970
 with the wiimotes and well they will 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.490
 just to see 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.290
 opponents and move the wrist of 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.700
 way to put big blows for 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.119
 to be able to defeat enemies 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.850
 it's rather amusing there are 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.830
 bonus to collect that risk just 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.920
 to be maybe a little tiring at the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.710
 long at least when you hold it 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.110
 gamepad because frankly we have to get 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.680
 still turn anyway 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.850
 enough enough to uncle I was going to say that's it 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.340
 there are quite ample movements to do 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.689
 and finally the gamepad ps rather not 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.250
 hand in hand so maybe it's too 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.030
 because it's not yet version 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.540
 definitive wireless that this game pad weighs 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.220
 so we will have to see the used level 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.009
 technical it's to his ends will be same 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.200
 its finer on the gamepad than on the 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.610
 tail on the TV it's pretty cute 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.670
 it's colorful it's really in the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.140
 Here's the wiiu and games 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.270
 in any case nintendo languages that are 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.270
 nevertheless, it must be pointed out 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.220
 of a quality enough 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.739
 pretty friendly and frankly ben 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.019
 it's small I know it's fun 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.879
 but it still looks pretty complete 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.560
 it's saying that it's not just 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.420
 10 min excuse me it's not 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.760
 just mini games as we have 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.989
 the habit of seeing one usually 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.209
 is in something maybe a little 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.190
 more here a little more pushed a little 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.480
 more chiadÃ© they want to say and that 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.799
 should be enough for for 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.799
 have fun with friends
