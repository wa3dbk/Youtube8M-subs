select shapes on the stage without

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.359 
select shapes on the stage without
actually<00:00:24.750> having<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.199> select<00:00:25.829> the<00:00:26.099> layer

first now in the past if you had a bunch

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.240 
first now in the past if you had a bunch
of<00:00:29.849> layers<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.419> I<00:00:30.540> do<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.079> project<00:00:31.410> some

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
of layers like I do in this project some

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.979 
of layers like I do in this project some
people<00:00:32.520> can<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.850> hundreds<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.450> layers<00:00:33.629> in

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
people can have hundreds of layers in

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.229 
people can have hundreds of layers in
any<00:00:34.290> given<00:00:34.590> project<00:00:34.969> but<00:00:35.969> would<00:00:36.090> usually

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
any given project but would usually

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.450 
any given project but would usually
happen<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.899> let's<00:00:37.289> say<00:00:37.440> for<00:00:37.469> instance<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:38.250> I

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
happen is let's say for instance that I

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.880 
happen is let's say for instance that I
want<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.910> select<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.420> pupils<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.170> this

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
want to select the pupils on this

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.360 
want to select the pupils on this
character<00:00:41.280> well<00:00:42.239> with<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.260> layer<00:00:43.949> selector

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
character well with the layer selector

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.579 
character well with the layer selector
tool<00:00:44.579> I'll<00:00:44.879> click<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.269> but<00:00:45.749> it<00:00:46.050> wouldn't

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589 
tool I'll click that but it wouldn't

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:48.319 
tool I'll click that but it wouldn't
allow<00:00:46.769> me<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.070> select<00:00:47.399> those<00:00:47.489> pupils<00:00:47.760> because

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
allow me to select those pupils because

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.899 
allow me to select those pupils because
right<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:48.809> I'm<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:50.039> layer<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.670> Zack

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:50.909 
right now I'm on this layer the Zack

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:53.930 
right now I'm on this layer the Zack
side<00:00:51.449> layer<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.559> what<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.339> would<00:00:53.489> need<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.819> do

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
side layer so what I would need to do

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.049 
side layer so what I would need to do
then<00:00:54.179> is<00:00:54.539> then<00:00:54.839> go<00:00:55.050> into<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.499> layer<00:00:56.059> then

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
then is then go into this layer then

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.419 
then is then go into this layer then
scroll<00:00:57.719> all<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> way<00:00:58.109> down<00:00:58.199> find<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> pupils

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
scroll all the way down find the pupils

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.229 
scroll all the way down find the pupils
and<00:00:59.579> click<00:00:59.819> them<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:00.479> allow<00:01:00.690> myself<00:01:00.899> to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
edit them in that fashion however as I

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.070 
edit them in that fashion however as I
said<00:01:05.610> if<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.300> lot<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.659> different

said if you have a lot of different

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.500 
said if you have a lot of different
layers<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:07.979> kind<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.340> pain<00:01:08.550> trying

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
layers this can be kind of a pain trying

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.719 
layers this can be kind of a pain trying
to<00:01:09.750> locate<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.470> exact<00:01:10.830> layer<00:01:11.190> that<00:01:11.520> that

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
to locate the exact layer that that

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.590 
to locate the exact layer that that
shape<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.710> well<00:01:13.710> with<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:15.000> tool<00:01:15.300> right

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
shape is on well with this tool right

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.140 
shape is on well with this tool right
here<00:01:15.870> the<00:01:16.380> vector<00:01:16.560> shape<00:01:16.920> selector<00:01:17.430> what<00:01:18.060> you

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
here the vector shape selector what you

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.390 
here the vector shape selector what you
can<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.660> click<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.470> simply<00:01:20.250> then

click on anything you want on the stage

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.120 
click on anything you want on the stage
to<00:01:23.460> select<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.120> layer<00:01:24.420> even<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.410> they<00:01:25.620> are<00:01:25.830> in

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
to select that layer even if they are in

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.060 
to select that layer even if they are in
a<00:01:26.430> bone<00:01:26.880> grouping<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.350> let's<00:01:28.530> say<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.740> want<00:01:29.010> to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
a bone grouping so let's say I want to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.580 
a bone grouping so let's say I want to
select<00:01:29.370> this<00:01:29.610> character<00:01:30.060> space<00:01:30.330> I<00:01:30.660> click<00:01:31.440> it

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
select this character space I click it

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.250 
select this character space I click it
and<00:01:31.970> it'll<00:01:32.970> automatically<00:01:33.570> open<00:01:33.990> up<00:01:34.110> that

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
and it'll automatically open up that

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.100 
and it'll automatically open up that
layer<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.220> take<00:01:36.060> me<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:38.420> shape<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.810> can

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
layer and take me to that shape so I can

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.500 
layer and take me to that shape so I can
edit<00:01:40.230> it<00:01:40.440> or<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.980> what<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.160> want<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:42.270> goes

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
edit it or do what I want and this goes

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.790 
edit it or do what I want and this goes
for<00:01:42.720> anything<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.230> could<00:01:43.350> go<00:01:43.410> back<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.710> those

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
for anything I could go back to those

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.280 
for anything I could go back to those
pupils<00:01:44.250> now<00:01:44.400> I<00:01:44.670> want<00:01:44.910> to<00:01:44.970> set<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.210> pupils<00:01:45.570> it

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
pupils now I want to set the pupils it

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.560 
pupils now I want to set the pupils it
opens<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.740> layer<00:01:46.980> and<00:01:47.280> brings<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
opens that layer and brings up the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.600 
opens that layer and brings up the
pupils<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.890> again<00:01:50.580> it's<00:01:50.940> a<00:01:51.060> really<00:01:51.390> simple

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
pupils so again it's a really simple

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.820 
pupils so again it's a really simple
addition<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:54.180> anime<00:01:54.480> studio<00:01:54.690> but<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.620> works

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
addition to anime studio but it works

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.170 
addition to anime studio but it works
similar<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.220> flash<00:01:56.730> if<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.510> are<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> flash<00:01:58.200> user

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
similar to flash if you are a flash user

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
similar to flash if you are a flash user
basically<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.300> would<00:02:00.420> have<00:02:00.570> all<00:02:00.810> your<00:02:00.960> layers

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
basically you would have all your layers

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.320 
basically you would have all your layers
on<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.680> timeline<00:02:02.160> and<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.520> could<00:02:02.700> select<00:02:02.910> the

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
on the timeline and you could select the

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.810
