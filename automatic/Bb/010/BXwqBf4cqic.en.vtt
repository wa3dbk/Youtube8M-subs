00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
car when we look at it on the car and if

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.649 
car when we look at it on the car and if
you<00:01:08.159> can<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.549> don't<00:01:08.820> know<00:01:09.000> how<00:01:09.210> well<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.570> going

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
you can I don't know how well it's going

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.880 
you can I don't know how well it's going
to<00:01:09.720> photograph<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.350> you'll<00:01:10.530> see<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.740> very

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
to photograph but you'll see that very

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.350 
to photograph but you'll see that very
dark<00:01:11.460> line<00:01:11.760> right<00:01:12.150> where<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:13.320> throttle<00:01:13.740> plate

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
dark line right where the throttle plate

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.149 
dark line right where the throttle plate
let's<00:01:15.360> put<00:01:15.509> all<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.689> butterflies<00:01:16.259> close<00:01:16.830> you

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
let's put all the butterflies close you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.920 
let's put all the butterflies close you
can<00:01:17.340> see<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.640> really<00:01:17.820> good<00:01:18.119> right<00:01:18.299> there<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
can see it really good right there and

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.289 
can see it really good right there and
right<00:01:19.439> here<00:01:19.619> at<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> bottom<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.280> when<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.119> get

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
right here at the bottom and when we get

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.240 
right here at the bottom and when we get
finished<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:22.020> expect<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.830> just

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
finished we expect that to be just

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.539 
finished we expect that to be just
completely<00:01:23.400> shiny<00:01:24.000> clean<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:25.320> real<00:01:25.920> nice<00:01:26.159> so

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
completely shiny clean and real nice so

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.620 
completely shiny clean and real nice so
that's<00:01:26.729> what<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:26.909> look<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.119> when<00:01:27.299> we<00:01:27.509> look

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
that's what we look for when we look

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.149 
that's what we look for when we look
look<00:01:27.990> at<00:01:28.110> dirty<00:01:28.380> through<00:01:28.680> all<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.770> my<00:01:29.009> knees

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
look at dirty through all of my knees

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.679 
look at dirty through all of my knees
when<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.729> dark<00:01:30.030> ring<00:01:30.329> around<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
when I see that dark ring around the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.740 
when I see that dark ring around the
edges<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.229> know<00:01:31.680> that's<00:01:32.130> gunk<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.119> carbon<00:01:33.479> foot

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
edges I know that's gunk and carbon foot

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.480 
edges I know that's gunk and carbon foot
not<00:01:33.900> all<00:01:34.079> built<00:01:34.350> up<00:01:35.270> on<00:01:36.270> there<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.990> then<00:01:37.200> that

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
not all built up on there and then that

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.990 
not all built up on there and then that
actually<00:01:38.490> blocks<00:01:39.119> some<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.570> airflow

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
actually blocks some of the airflow

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.220 
actually blocks some of the airflow
around<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:43.130> blades<00:01:43.520> or<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.390> butterflies

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
around the blades or the butterflies

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.320 
around the blades or the butterflies
so<00:01:45.620> it<00:01:45.740> actually<00:01:45.980> kind<00:01:46.280> of<00:01:46.340> cuts<00:01:46.580> down<00:01:46.910> on<00:01:46.970> some

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
so it actually kind of cuts down on some

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.450 
so it actually kind of cuts down on some
of<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.540> hair<00:01:47.780> alright<00:01:48.410> can<00:01:48.770> change<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.190> idle

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
of the hair alright can change the idle

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.370 
of the hair alright can change the idle
thing<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:50.150> we'll<00:01:50.630> get<00:01:50.720> started<00:01:50.840> here

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
thing so we'll get started here

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.970 
thing so we'll get started here

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
okay so let's take this one this is the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.460 
okay so let's take this one this is the
air<00:01:55.220> cleaner<00:01:55.580> hose<00:01:55.940> so<00:01:56.420> follow<00:01:56.840> this<00:01:57.110> around

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
air cleaner hose so follow this around

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.710 
air cleaner hose so follow this around
this<00:01:57.710> going<00:01:58.010> back<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:59.000> air<00:01:59.180> cleaner<00:01:59.510> you

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
this going back to the air cleaner you

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.410 
this going back to the air cleaner you
go<00:01:59.900> ahead<00:02:00.760> so<00:02:01.760> if<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:01.880> follow<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.300> air

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
go ahead so if you follow the air

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.550 
go ahead so if you follow the air

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
throttle bodies especially with some of

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.940 
throttle bodies especially with some of
these<00:02:56.540> electronic<00:02:57.140> ones<00:02:57.320> this<00:02:57.650> things<00:02:57.830> are

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
these electronic ones this things are

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.490 
these electronic ones this things are
pretty<00:02:58.100> safe<00:02:58.810> but<00:02:59.810> I'll<00:02:59.930> turn<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.410> ignition

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
pretty safe but I'll turn the ignition

pretty safe but I'll turn the ignition
on<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.310> I'll<00:03:01.790> use<00:03:01.970> my<00:03:02.000> throttle<00:03:02.630> stick<00:03:03.970> and

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
on and I'll use my throttle stick and

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.140 
on and I'll use my throttle stick and
I'll<00:03:05.120> let<00:03:05.270> the<00:03:05.390> motor<00:03:05.630> open<00:03:06.020> itself<00:03:07.000> right<00:03:08.000> if

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
I'll let the motor open itself right if

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.820 
I'll let the motor open itself right if
you<00:03:08.210> can't<00:03:08.420> get<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.690> butterfly<00:03:09.050> valve<00:03:09.320> open

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
you can't get the butterfly valve open

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.280 
you can't get the butterfly valve open
with<00:03:10.280> your<00:03:10.400> finger<00:03:10.670> yeah<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.720> sometimes<00:03:11.930> it's

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
with your finger yeah and sometimes it's

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.780 
with your finger yeah and sometimes it's
just<00:03:12.470> safer<00:03:12.920> right<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:16.220> don't<00:03:16.370> want<00:03:16.550> to<00:03:16.610> spray

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
just safer right you don't want to spray

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.690 
just safer right you don't want to spray
a<00:03:16.820> bunch<00:03:17.060> of<00:03:17.270> liquid<00:03:17.950> through<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.250> throttle

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
a bunch of liquid through the throttle

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.580 
a bunch of liquid through the throttle
body<00:03:19.850> though<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.450> have<00:03:20.780> it<00:03:20.900> go<00:03:21.020> down<00:03:21.230> into<00:03:21.440> the

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
body though and have it go down into the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.140 
body though and have it go down into the
engine<00:03:21.740> trying<00:03:22.130> to<00:03:22.220> let<00:03:22.370> it<00:03:22.490> drain<00:03:22.700> out<00:03:22.760> I'll

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
engine trying to let it drain out I'll

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.730 
engine trying to let it drain out I'll
get<00:03:23.330> as<00:03:23.420> much<00:03:23.570> out<00:03:23.810> if<00:03:24.020> you<00:03:24.140> can<00:03:24.290> see<00:03:24.560> the

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
get as much out if you can see the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.160 
get as much out if you can see the
difference<00:03:25.100> on<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.250> rags<00:03:25.580> and<00:03:26.390> some<00:03:26.630> of<00:03:26.750> some

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
difference on the rags and some of some

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.540 
difference on the rags and some of some
of<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.350> stuff<00:03:27.590> that<00:03:27.740> I<00:03:27.830> yeah<00:03:28.070> that<00:03:28.280> was<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.400> nice

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
of the stuff that I yeah that was a nice

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.960 
of the stuff that I yeah that was a nice
little<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:28.970> drag<00:03:29.350> pull<00:03:30.350> it<00:03:30.470> now<00:03:30.820> and<00:03:31.820> believe

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
little you drag pull it now and believe

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.420 
little you drag pull it now and believe
it<00:03:32.210> or<00:03:32.270> not<00:03:32.390> just<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.870> small<00:03:33.290> amount<00:03:33.470> of<00:03:33.800> carbon

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
it or not just a small amount of carbon

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.060 
it or not just a small amount of carbon
and<00:03:34.820> gunk<00:03:35.180> buildup<00:03:35.660> in<00:03:35.810> there<00:03:35.990> will<00:03:36.230> give<00:03:36.950> you

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
and gunk buildup in there will give you

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.400 
and gunk buildup in there will give you
a<00:03:37.100> fluctuating<00:03:37.820> idles<00:03:38.450> after<00:03:38.870> sitting<00:03:39.200> in<00:03:39.260> a

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
a fluctuating idles after sitting in a

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.790 
a fluctuating idles after sitting in a
stoplight<00:03:39.710> that<00:03:40.420> rpm<00:03:41.420> gauge<00:03:41.840> might<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.710> know

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
stoplight that rpm gauge might you know

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.130 
stoplight that rpm gauge might you know
bounce<00:03:43.100> up<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:43.430> down<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:44.600> gets<00:03:44.750> really<00:03:44.930> bad

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
bounce up and down it gets really bad

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.730 
bounce up and down it gets really bad
it'll<00:03:45.560> it'll<00:03:46.160> die<00:03:46.510> because<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:47.690> kind<00:03:47.900> of<00:03:47.960> hunts

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
it'll it'll die because it kind of hunts

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.400 
it'll it'll die because it kind of hunts
and<00:03:48.890> pecks<00:03:49.100> for<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.550> for<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.570> idle<00:03:50.870> speed<00:03:50.990> so

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
and pecks for the for the idle speed so

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.230 
and pecks for the for the idle speed so
it's<00:03:51.560> trying<00:03:51.830> to<00:03:52.070> maintain<00:03:52.520> a<00:03:52.550> certain<00:03:52.880> idle

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
it's trying to maintain a certain idle

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.479 
it's trying to maintain a certain idle
speed<00:03:53.420> to<00:03:53.510> keep<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.840> car<00:03:54.020> running

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:05.890 

yeah<00:03:59.489> that'd<00:03:59.730> be<00:03:59.879> in<00:04:00.060> there<00:04:00.470> much<00:04:01.470> better

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.809 

absolution<00:04:06.530> there<00:04:06.800> look<00:04:07.280> like<00:04:07.430> still<00:04:07.670> got<00:04:07.790> a

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
absolution there look like still got a

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.400 
absolution there look like still got a
little<00:04:08.090> left<00:04:08.420> in<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.599> other<00:04:08.780> corner<00:04:08.989> on<00:04:09.290> the

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
little left in the other corner on the

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.460 
little left in the other corner on the
backside<00:04:09.830> it's<00:04:10.010> hard<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.280> see<00:04:10.459> just<00:04:11.230> like<00:04:12.230> this

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
backside it's hard to see just like this

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.300 
backside it's hard to see just like this
one<00:04:12.650> looks<00:04:12.890> pretty<00:04:13.879> clean<00:04:14.510> here<00:04:15.100> but<00:04:16.100> when<00:04:16.220> you

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
one looks pretty clean here but when you

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.090 
one looks pretty clean here but when you
flip<00:04:16.549> it<00:04:16.579> over<00:04:16.850> you<00:04:17.120> can<00:04:17.150> really<00:04:17.570> see<00:04:17.930> all<00:04:18.350> the

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
flip it over you can really see all the

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.699 
flip it over you can really see all the
buildup<00:04:19.729> in<00:04:19.880> here<00:04:20.290> and<00:04:21.290> that's<00:04:21.410> what<00:04:21.620> he's

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
buildup in here and that's what he's

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.330 
buildup in here and that's what he's
trying<00:04:21.859> to<00:04:22.010> remove<00:04:23.410> and<00:04:24.410> that's<00:04:24.979> pretty<00:04:25.220> much

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
trying to remove and that's pretty much

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.250 
trying to remove and that's pretty much
the<00:04:25.550> first<00:04:26.060> step<00:04:26.330> in<00:04:26.510> the<00:04:26.600> throw<00:04:26.810> lovely<00:04:27.110> now

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
the first step in the throw lovely now

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.290 
the first step in the throw lovely now
what<00:04:27.470> we<00:04:27.590> do<00:04:27.860> is<00:04:29.020> we<00:04:30.020> now<00:04:30.169> have<00:04:30.199> a<00:04:31.270> service<00:04:32.270> that

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
what we do is we now have a service that

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.969 
what we do is we now have a service that
we're<00:04:32.540> using<00:04:32.780> literally<00:04:33.290> while<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.740> cars

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
we're using literally while the cars

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.490 
we're using literally while the cars
running<00:04:34.280> is<00:04:34.460> literally<00:04:34.760> going<00:04:34.910> to<00:04:34.970> spray<00:04:35.500> this

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
running is literally going to spray this

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.590 
running is literally going to spray this
cleaner<00:04:37.040> through<00:04:37.490> here<00:04:37.760> while<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.360> cars

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
cleaner through here while the cars

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.570 
cleaner through here while the cars
running<00:04:38.840> a<00:04:38.990> little<00:04:39.380> spray<00:04:39.620> for<00:04:39.800> about<00:04:40.070> 10

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
running a little spray for about 10

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.610 
running a little spray for about 10
minutes<00:04:40.940> and<00:04:41.750> that<00:04:41.900> goes<00:04:42.080> ahead<00:04:42.200> and<00:04:42.320> cleans

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
minutes and that goes ahead and cleans

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.620 
minutes and that goes ahead and cleans
up<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:42.919> stuff<00:04:43.160> I<00:04:43.430> can't<00:04:43.820> get<00:04:44.090> to<00:04:44.270> with<00:04:44.450> my

ahead and cleans through the intake and
if<00:04:49.970> we're<00:04:50.210> lucky<00:04:50.330> enough<00:04:50.510> hey<00:04:50.840> it<00:04:51.050> gets<00:04:51.200> on<00:04:51.320> the

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
if we're lucky enough hey it gets on the

if we're lucky enough hey it gets on the
back<00:04:51.620> of<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:51.830> valley

that's<00:04:52.700> the<00:04:52.910> induction<00:04:53.360> clean<00:04:53.720> we<00:04:54.320> will<00:04:54.440> do<00:04:54.620> a

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
that's the induction clean we will do a

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.820 
that's the induction clean we will do a

fuel injection service on this vehicle
where<00:04:58.310> we<00:04:58.460> were<00:04:58.550> actually<00:04:59.169> putting<00:05:00.169> all<00:05:00.860> of

where we were actually putting all of
our<00:05:01.100> cleaning<00:05:01.340> fluid<00:05:01.760> right<00:05:01.970> through<00:05:02.210> the

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
that's the other part of your service

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.499 
that's the other part of your service
which<00:05:12.479> that<00:05:13.479> takes<00:05:13.750> a<00:05:13.870> while<00:05:15.150> and<00:05:16.150> we<00:05:16.300> just

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
which that takes a while and we just

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:18.629 
which that takes a while and we just
happen<00:05:16.780> to<00:05:16.900> notice<00:05:17.080> something<00:05:17.620> that<00:05:17.650> if<00:05:18.490> you

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
happen to notice something that if you

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.709 
happen to notice something that if you
can<00:05:18.789> hear<00:05:19.000> me<00:05:20.129> this<00:05:21.129> battery<00:05:21.430> table<00:05:22.090> over<00:05:22.360> here

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719 
can hear me this battery table over here

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:25.589 
can hear me this battery table over here
probably<00:05:23.590> get<00:05:23.860> more<00:05:24.129> cars<00:05:24.550> on<00:05:24.849> a<00:05:24.879> wrecker<00:05:25.210> for

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
probably get more cars on a wrecker for

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.200 
probably get more cars on a wrecker for
a<00:05:25.659> dirty<00:05:26.020> battery<00:05:26.500> cable<00:05:26.949> and<00:05:27.129> at<00:05:27.639> this<00:05:27.759> angle

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
a dirty battery cable and at this angle

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.959 
a dirty battery cable and at this angle
it<00:05:28.360> looks<00:05:28.389> pretty<00:05:28.960> clean<00:05:29.610> but<00:05:30.610> if<00:05:30.699> you<00:05:30.819> look

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:30.969 
it looks pretty clean but if you look

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.339 
it looks pretty clean but if you look
over<00:05:31.120> at<00:05:31.419> this<00:05:31.689> angle<00:05:33.539> you<00:05:34.539> can<00:05:34.719> see<00:05:34.930> all<00:05:35.110> that

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
over at this angle you can see all that

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.290 
over at this angle you can see all that
corrosion<00:05:35.680> buildup<00:05:36.370> and<00:05:36.550> that<00:05:37.030> corrosion

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
corrosion buildup and that corrosion

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.320 
corrosion buildup and that corrosion
inside<00:05:38.340> that<00:05:39.340> connection<00:05:39.879> between<00:05:40.030> the

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
inside that connection between the

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.420 
inside that connection between the
battery<00:05:40.659> post<00:05:40.990> right<00:05:41.349> here<00:05:41.379> in<00:05:41.800> this<00:05:41.919> cable

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
battery post right here in this cable

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.559 
battery post right here in this cable
and<00:05:42.639> that<00:05:43.629> will<00:05:43.840> actually<00:05:43.960> make<00:05:44.169> a<00:05:44.319> ground<00:05:44.830> and

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.569 
and that will actually make a ground and

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:47.670 
and that will actually make a ground and
cause<00:05:46.569> the<00:05:46.689> battery<00:05:46.990> cause<00:05:47.229> the<00:05:47.409> engine<00:05:47.650> to

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
cause the battery cause the engine to

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.909 
cause the battery cause the engine to
start<00:05:48.219> I<00:05:48.599> think<00:05:49.599> we<00:05:49.870> probably<00:05:50.020> saw<00:05:50.349> more<00:05:50.620> cars

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
start I think we probably saw more cars

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.159 
start I think we probably saw more cars
on<00:05:51.159> a<00:05:51.189> wrecker<00:05:51.490> for<00:05:51.819> that<00:05:52.000> than<00:05:52.360> anything<00:05:52.779> else

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
on a wrecker for that than anything else

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.649 
on a wrecker for that than anything else
and<00:05:53.560> it's<00:05:54.009> such<00:05:54.219> a<00:05:54.250> simple<00:05:54.849> little<00:05:55.029> fix<00:05:55.389> and<00:05:55.599> we

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:55.659 
and it's such a simple little fix and we

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:57.540 
and it's such a simple little fix and we
just<00:05:55.870> happen<00:05:56.139> to<00:05:56.169> notice<00:05:56.379> it<00:05:56.650> here<00:05:56.800> so<00:05:57.069> always

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
just happen to notice it here so always

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.269 
just happen to notice it here so always
check<00:05:57.789> that<00:05:57.819> when<00:05:58.180> you<00:05:58.270> get<00:05:58.389> a<00:05:58.449> oil<00:05:58.689> change

00:05:59.269 --> 00:05:59.279 
check that when you get a oil change

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:02.189 
check that when you get a oil change
okay<00:06:00.279> Walter<00:06:00.610> carry<00:06:00.879> on<00:06:01.029> thanks<00:06:01.750> for<00:06:01.870> watching
