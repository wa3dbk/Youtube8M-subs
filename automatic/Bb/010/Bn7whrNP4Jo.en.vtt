00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
be using is the saiga-12 the saiga-12 is

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.240 
be using is the saiga-12 the saiga-12 is
an<00:01:01.720> interesting<00:01:01.960> shotgun<00:01:02.530> used<00:01:02.770> in<00:01:02.980> its<00:01:03.100> own

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
an interesting shotgun used in its own

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.580 
an interesting shotgun used in its own
right<00:01:03.629> even<00:01:04.629> though<00:01:04.750> statistically<00:01:04.930> the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
right even though statistically the

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.710 
right even though statistically the
shotgun<00:01:06.010> lacks<00:01:06.280> an<00:01:06.490> accuracy<00:01:06.850> and<00:01:07.060> range<00:01:07.300> in

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
shotgun lacks an accuracy and range in

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.680 
shotgun lacks an accuracy and range in
the<00:01:07.900> semi-automatic<00:01:08.590> shotgun<00:01:08.979> department<00:01:09.880> it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
the semi-automatic shotgun department it

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.359 
the semi-automatic shotgun department it
definitely<00:01:10.990> makes<00:01:11.229> up<00:01:11.470> with<00:01:11.650> that<00:01:11.860> for<00:01:12.340> the

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
definitely makes up with that for the

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.920 
definitely makes up with that for the
power<00:01:12.670> that<00:01:12.940> it<00:01:13.090> has<00:01:13.240> behind<00:01:13.570> it<00:01:13.780> in

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
power that it has behind it in

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.980 
power that it has behind it in
comparison<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:14.710> USA<00:01:15.130> s12<00:01:15.690> but<00:01:16.690> that's<00:01:16.869> as

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
comparison to the USA s12 but that's as

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.440 
comparison to the USA s12 but that's as
far<00:01:17.020> as<00:01:17.229> statistics<00:01:17.860> go<00:01:18.040> this<00:01:18.729> shotgun<00:01:19.000> is

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
far as statistics go this shotgun is

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.570 
far as statistics go this shotgun is
definitely<00:01:20.080> powerful<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.830> even<00:01:21.100> though<00:01:21.280> it

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
definitely powerful and even though it

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.480 
definitely powerful and even though it
shows<00:01:21.820> that<00:01:22.090> it's<00:01:22.330> low<00:01:22.990> accuracy<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:23.830> rate<00:01:24.460> of

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
shows that it's low accuracy and rate of

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.150 
shows that it's low accuracy and rate of
fire<00:01:24.760> as<00:01:25.030> well<00:01:25.510> as<00:01:25.750> a<00:01:25.780> range<00:01:26.170> on<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.680> shotgun

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
fire as well as a range on the shotgun

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.820 
fire as well as a range on the shotgun
it<00:01:27.729> still<00:01:28.149> has<00:01:28.390> its<00:01:28.660> great<00:01:28.930> effectiveness<00:01:29.320> and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
it still has its great effectiveness and

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.499 
it still has its great effectiveness and
the<00:01:30.250> only<00:01:30.399> thing<00:01:30.520> that's<00:01:30.820> really<00:01:31.000> keeping<00:01:31.360> it

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
the only thing that's really keeping it

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.420 
the only thing that's really keeping it
up<00:01:31.630> there<00:01:31.869> is<00:01:32.110> definitely<00:01:32.649> the<00:01:32.830> higher<00:01:33.160> damage

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
up there is definitely the higher damage

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.609 
up there is definitely the higher damage
ratio<00:01:33.910> has<00:01:34.119> for<00:01:34.479> being<00:01:34.720> a<00:01:34.930> magazine<00:01:35.410> load

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
ratio has for being a magazine load

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.330 
ratio has for being a magazine load
shotgun<00:01:37.440> also<00:01:38.440> one<00:01:38.649> of<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.860> nicer<00:01:39.160> things

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
shotgun also one of the nicer things

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.639 
shotgun also one of the nicer things
about<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.759> saiga-12<00:01:40.090> is<00:01:40.570> that<00:01:40.899> its<00:01:41.259> rate<00:01:41.530> of

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
about the saiga-12 is that its rate of

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.490 
about the saiga-12 is that its rate of
fire<00:01:41.830> per<00:01:42.130> click<00:01:42.430> that<00:01:42.700> you<00:01:42.789> make<00:01:42.970> is

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
fire per click that you make is

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.650 
fire per click that you make is
relatively<00:01:44.500> on<00:01:44.740> par<00:01:45.070> if<00:01:45.369> you<00:01:45.729> pace<00:01:46.210> your<00:01:46.360> shots

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
relatively on par if you pace your shots

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.120 
relatively on par if you pace your shots
correctly

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
correctly

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.709 
correctly
the<00:01:48.610> total<00:01:48.820> amount<00:01:48.939> of<00:01:49.119> bullets<00:01:49.360> that<00:01:49.479> you<00:01:49.570> get

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
the total amount of bullets that you get

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.279 
the total amount of bullets that you get

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.629 
headshot in that's when the only time i
would<00:03:11.049> suggest<00:03:11.200> assuming<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.220> with<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.370> shotgun

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
would suggest assuming it with a shotgun

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.330 
would suggest assuming it with a shotgun
but<00:03:12.940> other<00:03:13.090> than<00:03:13.299> that<00:03:14.069> you<00:03:15.069> can<00:03:15.100> get<00:03:15.220> away

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
but other than that you can get away

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.840 
but other than that you can get away
with<00:03:15.549> it<00:03:15.670> both<00:03:15.819> ways<00:03:16.139> also<00:03:17.430> reload<00:03:18.430> time<00:03:18.639> isn't

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
with it both ways also reload time isn't

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.610 
with it both ways also reload time isn't
bad<00:03:19.060> for<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.269> shotgun<00:03:19.720> as<00:03:19.840> well<00:03:19.989> i<00:03:20.290> mean<00:03:20.530> it's

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
bad for the shotgun as well i mean it's

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.259 
bad for the shotgun as well i mean it's
not<00:03:20.769> in<00:03:20.889> comparison<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.579> pump<00:03:21.760> shotguns

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269

the shotgun this actually just has a

the shotgun this actually just has a

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
magazine load so it's really nice of

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.240 
magazine load so it's really nice of
course<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.989> negative<00:03:32.590> aspects<00:03:32.950> with<00:03:33.130> the

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
shotgun

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.509 
shotgun
which<00:03:34.629> really<00:03:34.930> are<00:03:35.019> many<00:03:35.290> but<00:03:35.890> one<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.459> the

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
which really are many but one of the

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.970 
which really are many but one of the
bigger<00:03:36.670> ones<00:03:36.730> that<00:03:37.060> stand<00:03:37.299> out<00:03:37.540> is<00:03:38.530> of<00:03:38.799> course

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
bigger ones that stand out is of course

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.670 
bigger ones that stand out is of course
that<00:03:39.280> it's<00:03:39.579> not<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:40.030> as<00:03:40.719> effective<00:03:41.200> damage<00:03:41.500> wise

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
that it's not a as effective damage wise

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.229 
that it's not a as effective damage wise
as<00:03:42.040> considering<00:03:42.730> you<00:03:42.819> know<00:03:42.849> the<00:03:43.030> pump

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
as considering you know the pump

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.020 
as considering you know the pump
shotguns<00:03:43.750> how<00:03:44.049> effective<00:03:44.739> they<00:03:44.859> are<00:03:44.890> but<00:03:45.730> it

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
shotguns how effective they are but it

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.660 
shotguns how effective they are but it
still<00:03:46.299> gets<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.540> job<00:03:46.750> done<00:03:46.810> otherwise<00:03:47.670> also

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
still gets the job done otherwise also

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.130 
still gets the job done otherwise also
if<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:48.849> don't<00:03:49.030> pace<00:03:49.239> your<00:03:49.390> shots<00:03:49.629> correctly

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
if you don't pace your shots correctly

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.289 
if you don't pace your shots correctly
when<00:03:50.349> firing<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:51.040> shotgun<00:03:51.489> sometimes<00:03:52.090> you

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
when firing the shotgun sometimes you

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.119 
when firing the shotgun sometimes you
can<00:03:52.540> miss<00:03:52.719> an<00:03:52.840> opportunity<00:03:53.079> to<00:03:53.620> fire<00:03:53.769> a<00:03:53.799> shot

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
can miss an opportunity to fire a shot

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.339 
can miss an opportunity to fire a shot
off<00:03:54.310> which<00:03:54.730> will<00:03:55.079> cause<00:03:56.079> a<00:03:56.109> bit<00:03:56.319> of

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
off which will cause a bit of

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.860 
off which will cause a bit of
frustration<00:03:56.500> there<00:03:57.129> but<00:03:57.730> it's<00:03:58.480> all<00:03:58.629> a<00:03:58.659> matter

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
frustration there but it's all a matter

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.240 
frustration there but it's all a matter
of<00:03:59.019> pacing<00:03:59.439> yourself<00:03:59.530> on<00:03:59.859> fire<00:03:59.980> in<00:04:00.129> your

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
of pacing yourself on fire in your

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.580 
of pacing yourself on fire in your
shotgun<00:04:00.700> so<00:04:01.000> you<00:04:01.719> know<00:04:01.840> once<00:04:02.139> you<00:04:02.170> figure<00:04:02.439> it

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
shotgun so you know once you figure it

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.920 
shotgun so you know once you figure it
out<00:04:02.739> I'm<00:04:03.010> sure<00:04:03.250> you'll<00:04:03.400> do<00:04:03.549> fine<00:04:03.689> of<00:04:04.689> course

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
out I'm sure you'll do fine of course

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.500 
out I'm sure you'll do fine of course
the<00:04:05.500> other<00:04:05.620> negative<00:04:05.980> aspects<00:04:06.430> is<00:04:06.669> being<00:04:07.329> that

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
the other negative aspects is being that

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.179 
the other negative aspects is being that
it's<00:04:07.659> a<00:04:07.720> shotgun<00:04:08.139> you<00:04:08.319> can't<00:04:08.530> kill<00:04:08.680> anybody<00:04:08.919> at

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:09.189 
it's a shotgun you can't kill anybody at

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:11.369 
it's a shotgun you can't kill anybody at
long<00:04:09.370> ranges<00:04:09.760> with<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.180> but<00:04:10.930> if<00:04:11.139> you<00:04:11.260> have<00:04:11.349> a

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
long ranges with it but if you have a

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.110 
long ranges with it but if you have a
good<00:04:11.530> enough<00:04:11.620> secondary<00:04:12.220> weapon<00:04:12.579> or<00:04:12.730> pistol

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
good enough secondary weapon or pistol

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.420 
good enough secondary weapon or pistol
that<00:04:13.329> should<00:04:13.510> not<00:04:13.599> be<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:13.780> problem<00:04:14.189> other<00:04:15.189> than

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
that should not be a problem other than

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.189 
that should not be a problem other than
that<00:04:15.489> probably<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.359> preferred<00:04:16.660> class<00:04:16.930> with

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
that probably the preferred class with

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.900 
that probably the preferred class with
the<00:04:17.320> saiga-12<00:04:17.650> as<00:04:18.099> I<00:04:18.220> would<00:04:18.400> suggest<00:04:18.549> with

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
the saiga-12 as I would suggest with

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.670 
the saiga-12 as I would suggest with
probably<00:04:19.239> any<00:04:19.389> shotgun<00:04:19.810> in<00:04:19.870> this<00:04:19.989> game<00:04:20.169> would

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
probably any shotgun in this game would

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.230 
probably any shotgun in this game would
be<00:04:20.799> to<00:04:20.919> use<00:04:21.070> it<00:04:21.190> with<00:04:21.310> your<00:04:21.430> assault<00:04:21.699> class<00:04:21.940> so

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
be to use it with your assault class so

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.999 
be to use it with your assault class so
that<00:04:22.389> way<00:04:22.539> you<00:04:22.599> have<00:04:22.930> infinite<00:04:23.410> ammo<00:04:23.560> so<00:04:23.889> it

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:24.009 
that way you have infinite ammo so it

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:26.300 
that way you have infinite ammo so it
doesn't<00:04:24.280> become<00:04:24.460> a<00:04:24.639> problem<00:04:24.699> with<00:04:25.120> ammo

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
doesn't become a problem with ammo

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.439 
doesn't become a problem with ammo
secondary<00:04:27.310> class<00:04:27.550> i'll<00:04:27.759> probably<00:04:28.000> suggest

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
secondary class i'll probably suggest

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.629 
secondary class i'll probably suggest
this<00:04:28.630> for<00:04:28.690> would-be<00:04:29.500> medic<00:04:29.979> so<00:04:30.280> that<00:04:30.430> way<00:04:30.580> you

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
this for would-be medic so that way you

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.520 
this for would-be medic so that way you
can<00:04:30.880> get<00:04:31.000> on<00:04:31.090> good<00:04:31.240> killing<00:04:31.630> sprees<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:31.960> get

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
can get on good killing sprees and get

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.600 
can get on good killing sprees and get
close<00:04:32.740> enough<00:04:32.860> to<00:04:33.039> your<00:04:33.130> enemies<00:04:33.280> while

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
close enough to your enemies while

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.999 
close enough to your enemies while
maintaining<00:04:33.970> health<00:04:34.360> thirdly<00:04:35.199> i<00:04:35.590> would<00:04:35.800> say

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
maintaining health thirdly i would say

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.499 
maintaining health thirdly i would say
for<00:04:36.220> engineers<00:04:36.639> so<00:04:36.849> that<00:04:37.000> way<00:04:37.150> if<00:04:37.300> anybody

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
for engineers so that way if anybody

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.480 
for engineers so that way if anybody
tries<00:04:37.870> to<00:04:37.900> bum-rush<00:04:38.409> you<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:38.979> steal<00:04:39.220> one<00:04:39.400> of

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
tries to bum-rush you to steal one of

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.909 
tries to bum-rush you to steal one of
the<00:04:39.580> tanks<00:04:39.789> or<00:04:40.180> any<00:04:40.690> of<00:04:40.840> your<00:04:40.930> vehicles<00:04:41.440> you'll

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
the tanks or any of your vehicles you'll

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.110 
the tanks or any of your vehicles you'll
be<00:04:42.099> able<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.400> hit<00:04:42.580> them<00:04:42.760> once<00:04:42.940> with<00:04:43.090> the

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
be able to hit them once with the

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.060 
be able to hit them once with the
shotgun<00:04:43.419> and<00:04:43.840> you<00:04:43.960> you<00:04:44.349> know<00:04:44.440> damage<00:04:44.830> if<00:04:44.949> they

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
shotgun and you you know damage if they

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.629 
shotgun and you you know damage if they
come<00:04:45.220> close<00:04:45.460> enough<00:04:45.490> with<00:04:45.909> it<00:04:46.500> so<00:04:47.500> lastly<00:04:48.039> this

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
come close enough with it so lastly this

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.000 
come close enough with it so lastly this
sniper<00:04:48.970> or<00:04:49.539> recon<00:04:50.050> class<00:04:50.380> would<00:04:50.650> be<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.830> last

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
sniper or recon class would be the last

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.010 
sniper or recon class would be the last
option<00:04:51.340> for<00:04:51.760> the<00:04:51.849> shotgun<00:04:52.240> because<00:04:52.389> that<00:04:52.780> kind

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
option for the shotgun because that kind

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.629 
option for the shotgun because that kind
of<00:04:53.080> defeats<00:04:53.380> the<00:04:53.380> purpose<00:04:53.620> of<00:04:53.889> a<00:04:53.979> recon<00:04:54.370> class

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
of defeats the purpose of a recon class

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.460 
of defeats the purpose of a recon class
other<00:04:54.970> than<00:04:55.120> maybe<00:04:55.330> using<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.900> motion<00:04:56.260> mind

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
other than maybe using the motion mind

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.730 
other than maybe using the motion mind
to<00:04:56.650> find<00:04:57.190> out<00:04:57.310> where<00:04:57.430> your<00:04:57.520> targets<00:04:57.880> are<00:04:58.000> at

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
to find out where your targets are at

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.810 
to find out where your targets are at
that's<00:04:59.740> of<00:04:59.889> course<00:04:59.919> if<00:05:00.280> you<00:05:00.370> have<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.610> extra

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
that's of course if you have the extra

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.100 
that's of course if you have the extra
weapon<00:05:01.240> feature<00:05:01.479> to<00:05:01.780> where<00:05:01.870> you<00:05:01.960> can<00:05:02.050> get

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
weapon feature to where you can get

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.469 
weapon feature to where you can get
another<00:05:02.680> primary<00:05:03.039> weapon<00:05:03.610> then<00:05:04.120> you<00:05:04.360> would

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
another primary weapon then you would

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:05.760 
another primary weapon then you would
use<00:05:04.630> this<00:05:04.780> injunction<00:05:05.169> with<00:05:05.440> your<00:05:05.560> sniper

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
use this injunction with your sniper

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.219
