00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
feels like skin it's not as luminous and

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.590 
feels like skin it's not as luminous and
um<00:01:31.159> as<00:01:32.890> tacky<00:01:33.890> as<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.460> Aqua<00:01:34.820> Lumiere<00:01:35.149> this<00:01:35.420> one

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
um as tacky as the Aqua Lumiere this one

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.810 
um as tacky as the Aqua Lumiere this one
literally<00:01:36.020> just<00:01:36.350> sinks<00:01:36.710> into<00:01:36.860> your<00:01:37.100> skin<00:01:37.490> and

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
literally just sinks into your skin and

literally just sinks into your skin and

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
feels very nice and smooth my only

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.240 
feels very nice and smooth my only
concern<00:01:42.020> about<00:01:42.050> this<00:01:42.440> foundation<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.070> the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
concern about this foundation is the

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.719 
concern about this foundation is the
fragrance<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:44.090> is<00:01:44.330> so<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:45.860> fragrant<00:01:46.490> 'add

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
fragrance it is so so fragrant 'add

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.969 
fragrance it is so so fragrant 'add
right<00:01:47.390> off<00:01:47.539> the<00:01:47.720> bat<00:01:47.899> I<00:01:48.140> know<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.590> fragrance

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
right off the bat I know the fragrance

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.120 
right off the bat I know the fragrance
will<00:01:49.340> dissipate<00:01:50.000> however<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.289> is<00:01:51.470> so<00:01:51.920> much

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
will dissipate however it is so much

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.190 
will dissipate however it is so much
more<00:01:52.190> fragrant<00:01:52.819> than<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.330> vitae<00:01:53.509> a<00:01:53.600> Lumiere

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
more fragrant than the vitae a Lumiere

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.130 
more fragrant than the vitae a Lumiere
foundation<00:01:54.740> I'm<00:01:54.920> not<00:01:55.159> quite<00:01:55.729> sure<00:01:55.759> why<00:01:56.300> so<00:01:57.020> it

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
foundation I'm not quite sure why so it

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.290 
foundation I'm not quite sure why so it
takes<00:01:57.380> a<00:01:57.500> little<00:01:57.710> bit<00:01:57.860> longer<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:58.700> dissipate

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
takes a little bit longer to dissipate

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.870 
takes a little bit longer to dissipate
and<00:01:59.509> I<00:01:59.539> can<00:01:59.720> still<00:01:59.990> smell<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:00.350> right<00:02:00.500> now<00:02:00.700> so<00:02:01.700> if

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
and I can still smell it right now so if

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.270 
and I can still smell it right now so if
you<00:02:02.030> are<00:02:02.149> sensitive<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:02.899> fragrance<00:02:03.409> you're

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
you are sensitive to fragrance you're

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.950 
you are sensitive to fragrance you're

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.370 
foundation and other than the scent and
the<00:04:04.519> fragrance<00:04:05.000> which<00:04:05.209> did<00:04:05.540> take<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.959> few<00:04:06.200> hours

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
the fragrance which did take a few hours

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.740 
the fragrance which did take a few hours
to<00:04:06.590> really<00:04:06.890> dissipate<00:04:07.550> I'm<00:04:08.150> not<00:04:08.420> quite<00:04:08.720> sure

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
to really dissipate I'm not quite sure

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.920 
to really dissipate I'm not quite sure
if<00:04:09.110> it<00:04:09.590> dissipated<00:04:10.040> completely<00:04:10.670> or<00:04:10.880> if<00:04:11.570> it<00:04:11.750> was

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
if it dissipated completely or if it was

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.660 
if it dissipated completely or if it was
just<00:04:12.140> my<00:04:12.470> nostrils<00:04:12.980> got<00:04:13.160> used<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.489> the

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
just my nostrils got used to the

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.210 
just my nostrils got used to the
fragrance<00:04:13.910> but<00:04:14.900> I<00:04:15.110> don't<00:04:15.380> know<00:04:15.530> why<00:04:15.860> this

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
fragrance but I don't know why this

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.400 
fragrance but I don't know why this
fragrance<00:04:16.669> is<00:04:16.850> so<00:04:17.209> much<00:04:17.480> stronger<00:04:17.840> than<00:04:18.049> the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
fragrance is so much stronger than the

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.069 
fragrance is so much stronger than the
Aqua<00:04:18.769> Lumiere<00:04:19.160> that<00:04:19.880> one<00:04:20.090> is<00:04:20.239> also<00:04:20.390> fragranced

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
Aqua Lumiere that one is also fragranced

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.540 
Aqua Lumiere that one is also fragranced
but<00:04:21.290> that<00:04:21.620> one<00:04:21.799> almost<00:04:21.980> dissipates

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
but that one almost dissipates

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.520 
but that one almost dissipates
immediately<00:04:23.090> once<00:04:23.300> it's<00:04:23.510> set<00:04:23.780> on<00:04:23.930> your<00:04:24.140> skin

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
immediately once it's set on your skin

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.240 
immediately once it's set on your skin
so<00:04:25.310> that's<00:04:26.090> my<00:04:26.300> only<00:04:26.720> real<00:04:26.900> concern<00:04:27.380> I<00:04:27.770> do<00:04:27.890> like

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
so that's my only real concern I do like

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.100 
so that's my only real concern I do like
this<00:04:28.400> foundation<00:04:28.970> I<00:04:29.150> definitely<00:04:29.690> will<00:04:29.900> keep

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
wearing it I like it for an everyday

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.560 
wearing it I like it for an everyday
natural<00:04:33.200> finish<00:04:33.890> foundation<00:04:34.640> if<00:04:35.150> you<00:04:35.330> apply

full coverage this isn't really even a

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.950 
full coverage this isn't really even a
medium<00:04:43.130> coverage<00:04:43.370> but<00:04:44.120> I<00:04:44.150> like<00:04:44.510> that<00:04:44.720> I<00:04:44.780> like
