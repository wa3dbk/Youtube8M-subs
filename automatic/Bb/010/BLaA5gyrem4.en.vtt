 Yes to Chinen Grammar 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:12.110
 When I introduce Tomica to be in Rambol 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.820
 As I did not introduce the introduced technique 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.820
 I would like to introduce 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.690

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.980
 Excluding that 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:32.390
 I think that was introduced in one of the heating 8 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.390
 I guess 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.460
 It is event- limited to say 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.910

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.040
 Finland Limited 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.040
 There are a lot of things 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.590
 First 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.590
 I hear 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.840

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.840
 This is it 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:18.330
 Chinese area 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.350
 I think that there is a guy who strikes normally, but this is 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.130
 Shop event limited 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.130
 Erase four 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.150
 Toka one time was really 3000 yen Toka 4000 yen 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.680
 There was a case that came with option, but do not understand now 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.680
 And now it has become a kind of feeling 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.570
 Contents are twice that 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.760
 Oh 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.760

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.700
 If you can see the difference 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.640
 I wish I could discover it 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.030

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.020

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.350
 this 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:59.730
 A lot of old Tomica is also sold unsold 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.270
