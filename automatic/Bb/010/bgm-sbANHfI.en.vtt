00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
when I have more games to test with I

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.110 
when I have more games to test with I
would<00:04:00.830> definitely<00:04:01.250> post<00:04:02.120> results<00:04:03.760> as<00:04:04.760> to<00:04:04.940> what

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
would definitely post results as to what

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.520 
would definitely post results as to what
works<00:04:05.300> and<00:04:05.510> what<00:04:05.660> doesn't<00:04:05.930> but<00:04:06.200> right<00:04:06.350> now<00:04:06.470> it

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
works and what doesn't but right now it

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.800 
works and what doesn't but right now it
looks<00:04:06.590> like<00:04:07.000> everything<00:04:08.000> I<00:04:08.090> throw<00:04:08.390> at<00:04:08.570> it<00:04:08.600> is

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
looks like everything I throw at it is

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.990 
looks like everything I throw at it is
going<00:04:09.050> to<00:04:09.140> work<00:04:09.290> I'll<00:04:10.130> do<00:04:10.310> one<00:04:10.460> final<00:04:10.640> test

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
going to work I'll do one final test

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.910 
going to work I'll do one final test
