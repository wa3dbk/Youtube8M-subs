00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.690 

this<00:00:00.780> is<00:00:00.989> brute<00:00:01.290> q<00:00:01.620> 1200<00:00:02.220> from<00:00:02.879> ofm<00:00:03.449> and<00:00:04.700> you

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
this is brute q 1200 from ofm and you

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.360 
this is brute q 1200 from ofm and you
can<00:00:05.910> see<00:00:06.919> just<00:00:07.919> mounting<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:10.370> carbon-fiber

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
can see just mounting to carbon-fiber

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.939 
can see just mounting to carbon-fiber
rods<00:00:11.670> here<00:00:12.360> tubes<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.910> how<00:00:14.910> our<00:00:14.940> film<00:00:15.619> hfx<00:00:16.619> or

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
rods here tubes and how our film hfx or

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.609 
rods here tubes and how our film hfx or
now<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.400> believe<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.029> called<00:00:18.090> birdy<00:00:18.619> bounce

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
now I believe it's called birdy bounce

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.070 
now I believe it's called birdy bounce
really<00:00:20.430> nice<00:00:20.720> it's<00:00:21.720> just<00:00:21.990> plug<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.350> play<00:00:22.769> and

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
really nice it's just plug and play and

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.880 
really nice it's just plug and play and
it<00:00:25.080> stabilizes<00:00:25.890> itself<00:00:26.599> this<00:00:27.599> plate<00:00:28.109> left

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
it stabilizes itself this plate left

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.070 
it stabilizes itself this plate left
right<00:00:29.130> like<00:00:29.369> bank<00:00:29.730> pitch<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.660> roll<00:00:30.869> is

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
right like bank pitch and roll is

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.280 
right like bank pitch and roll is
stabilized<00:00:32.239> people<00:00:33.239> were<00:00:33.329> asking<00:00:33.780> if<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.079> has

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
stabilized people were asking if it has

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.260 
stabilized people were asking if it has
a<00:00:34.320> 90-degree<00:00:34.950> tilt<00:00:35.130> angle<00:00:35.520> yes<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.120> can

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
a 90-degree tilt angle yes you can

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.930 
a 90-degree tilt angle yes you can
easily<00:00:36.780> set<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.140> for<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> 90-degree<00:00:38.280> tilt<00:00:38.460> angle

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
easily set it for a 90-degree tilt angle

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.910 
easily set it for a 90-degree tilt angle
I<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.540> for<00:00:39.750> now<00:00:39.780> set<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.969> to<00:00:42.680> to<00:00:43.680> let<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
I have for now set it to to let the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.910 
I have for now set it to to let the
camera<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.309> look<00:00:44.629> completely<00:00:45.800> towards<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
camera and look completely towards the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.950 
camera and look completely towards the
ground<00:00:47.100> at<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.670> moment<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.570> little<00:00:48.840> bit

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
ground at the moment it's a little bit

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.420 
ground at the moment it's a little bit
tilted<00:00:49.289> not<00:00:49.710> 90<00:00:50.100> degree<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.910> still<00:00:51.239> move

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
tilted not 90 degree so I can still move

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.639 
tilted not 90 degree so I can still move
like<00:00:53.430> take<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.699> out<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.149> move<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.870> gitmo<00:00:55.199> till

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
like take it out and move the gitmo till

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.310 
like take it out and move the gitmo till
a<00:00:55.860> little<00:00:56.280> bit<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:57.120> make<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.390> completely<00:00:57.899> 90

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
a little bit up to make it completely 90

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.740 
a little bit up to make it completely 90
degrees<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.129> it's<00:00:59.280> all<00:00:59.460> your<00:00:59.699> choice<00:00:59.730> of<00:01:00.270> how

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
degrees so it's all your choice of how

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.720 
degrees so it's all your choice of how
you<00:01:00.809> set<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.320> up<00:01:01.440> basically<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.489> will

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
you set it up basically this will

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.479 
you set it up basically this will
actually<00:01:02.940> provide<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.719> 90-degree<00:01:04.710> tilt<00:01:04.890> very

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
actually provide you 90-degree tilt very

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.210 
actually provide you 90-degree tilt very
very<00:01:05.760> easily<00:01:06.409> it's<00:01:07.409> all<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> matter<00:01:08.010> of

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
very easily it's all the matter of

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.280 
very easily it's all the matter of
settings<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.850> your<00:01:09.479> camera<00:01:09.840> will<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.140> looking

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
settings and your camera will be looking

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.719 
settings and your camera will be looking
exactly<00:01:10.909> down<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.350> ground<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:14.400> give<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.670> a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
exactly down to the ground to give you a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:02:48.960 
exactly down to the ground to give you a
bird's<00:01:15.119> eye<00:01:15.299> view

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:03:04.690 

you

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700
