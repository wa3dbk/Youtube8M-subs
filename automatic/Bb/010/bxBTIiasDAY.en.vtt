is a chain this is an angel looks like
at<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> coloration<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.790> skin<00:01:11.939> well

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
at the coloration of the skin well

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.530 
at the coloration of the skin well
basically<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:14.220> as<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.909> top<00:01:15.210> layer<00:01:15.509> of

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
basically it's as if the top layer of

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.060 
basically it's as if the top layer of
color<00:01:15.990> got<00:01:16.259> picked<00:01:16.560> away<00:01:16.830> with<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
color got picked away with the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.440 
color got picked away with the
fingernail<00:01:17.520> okay<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:19.409> about<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.490> year<00:01:20.580> ago<00:01:20.850> go

fingernail okay so about a year ago go

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.480 
fingernail okay so about a year ago go
just<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> head<00:01:22.500> or<00:01:22.740> goes<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.220> through

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
just on in the head or goes on through

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.630 
just on in the head or goes on through
the<00:01:23.580> value<00:01:23.850> oh<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.390> goes<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.590> head<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.130> on

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the value oh it goes on the head and on

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.999 
the value oh it goes on the head and on
the<00:01:26.850> lateral<00:01:27.270> line<00:01:27.570> that's<00:01:28.500> why<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.860> called

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
the lateral line that's why it's called

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.640 
the lateral line that's why it's called
head<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.579> lateral<00:01:30.000> line<00:01:30.180> erosion<00:01:30.750> or<00:01:31.229> lateral

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
head and lateral line erosion or lateral

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.930 
head and lateral line erosion or lateral
line<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.250> line<00:01:32.490> going<00:01:32.820> along

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
line is that line going along

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.940 
line is that line going along
okay<00:01:34.940> look<00:01:35.450> out<00:01:35.600> of<00:01:35.780> there<00:01:35.990> see<00:01:36.590> that<00:01:36.619> line

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
okay look out of there see that line

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.149 
okay look out of there see that line
that<00:01:37.190> goes<00:01:37.340> kind<00:01:37.940> of<00:01:38.060> curves<00:01:38.479> up<00:01:38.799> you<00:01:39.799> can<00:01:39.950> see

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
that goes kind of curves up you can see

it right at the end of my finger yeah
okay<00:01:41.780> that's<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.740> lateral<00:01:43.190> line<00:01:45.130> while<00:01:46.130> he's

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
okay that's the lateral line while he's

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.310 
okay that's the lateral line while he's
got<00:01:46.640> head<00:01:46.909> erosion<00:01:47.450> right<00:01:47.630> now<00:01:47.810> he<00:01:48.140> doesn't

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
got head erosion right now he doesn't

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.710 
got head erosion right now he doesn't
have<00:01:48.530> lateral<00:01:48.830> line<00:01:49.159> erosion<00:01:49.700> but<00:01:50.420> it's

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
have lateral line erosion but it's

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.030 
have lateral line erosion but it's
called<00:01:50.990> head<00:01:51.290> and<00:01:51.530> lateral<00:01:51.950> line<00:01:52.100> erode<00:01:52.960> yeah

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
called head and lateral line erode yeah

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.990 
called head and lateral line erode yeah
well<00:01:55.119> it's<00:01:56.119> too<00:01:56.330> bad<00:01:56.479> we<00:01:56.750> didn't<00:01:57.020> snow<00:01:58.000> well
