00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.490
 hello my name is dresden trainers 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.199
 dark game developers assured us that 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.060
 their goal is to get rid of the image without 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.800
 sexy not powerful vampires created 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.050
 today and return them old dishes 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.519
 powerful creatures it is obvious that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.470
 developers were inspired by such 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.449
 successful games of recent years as deus 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.550
 ex edison art without forgetting 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.380
 rich universe you cut and hidden and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.100
 directly play bloodlines from now on 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.329
 retired troika games 2005 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.160
 agree it all doesn't sound so bad 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.170
 and in a way all the above 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.300
 also true desire to cut down in an easy way 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.129
 money and the classic version with hands and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.350
 assholes and the complete absence of all 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.360
 talent still prevailed because 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.760
 this shit did not go out for a long time 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.920
 the game is bad everything is gaming 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.620
 process of animation plot dialogs 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.020
 skill characters everything is done out of hand 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.340
 bad and anyone can do me 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.809
 explain why suddenly so much 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.879
 developers decided that if 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.710
 use cl shading then the graphics in their 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.049
 the game immediately turn from crappy to 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.030
 indescribably stylish and original and no 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.890
 fucking she still remains shitty 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.900
 but luckily the graphics of the game are the most 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.670
 the lesser links of wealth are much more 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.159
 cuts eyes animation especially whether from 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.900
 the main characters are your mother up to their for 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.150
 the whole game is hardly a dozen typed 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.830
 was it really impossible to make such a generous 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.080
 a gift to your hated customer 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.549
 no truth to understand the whole depth of it 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.070
 need to see with my own eyes about 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.729
 something whose power 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.320
 you really don't understand my you 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.000
 just look at the expressive eyes 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.780
 and storms of emotion on this wooden face 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.630
 boy 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.740
 your mother developers you are generally aware 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.380
 What is the year now 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.600
 most games of 2005 you would do 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.579
 you as a pro stand-up look 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.439
 heroes do not even want to talk because 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.030
 that in my opinion they were riveted in a hurry 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.549
 in the character editor any 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.079
 browser games tangled as reads 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.240
 game description plot fit in 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.219
 several proposals for dialogue are poor 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.350
 sad and more than once contradict themselves 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.060
 so at the very beginning of the game one of 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.040
 characters says all vampires are like 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.659
 one big family and a minute later 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.280
 tells that most are first 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.830
 would just have their heads torn off 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.300
 if I met I really wouldn't 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.860
 passed the game to the end 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.990
 because every minute spent in 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.730
 this game is like torture but I doubt 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.710
 what will happen next interesting 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.450
 This dialogue ring as mass effect 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.120
 can you then be a bad game 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.530
 the plot mechanics of this vysera represents 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.420
 myself as I said earlier 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.820
 and such a mixture of hordes deeson u sex and 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.740
 bloodlines but the problem is that before 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.200
 how to mix it all into a creative blender 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.180
 the creators of the game spat some drunk and 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.760
 only after that the developers did 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.410
 remember your deus ex cocktail 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.900
 he is a million opportunity to pass 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.420
 so here is the option is always only one 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.010
 shaft part of some corridor to us 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.990
 you need to remove one guard one at a time 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.030
 after another on the left wall 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.980
 like a real wall or forty 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.630
 centimeter bush which our mighty 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.700
 the vampire is not able to jump over 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.430
 because he can't jump at all 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.680
 the wall on the right is also in the middle 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.170
 some bucket for which we need 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.330
 hide behind cover otherwise we are here 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.160
 same notice and do not care what you sticks out 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.410
 hand leg head 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.690
 worry all right you be in 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.120
 shelter removed the nearest guard 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.340
 move the chair one and a half meters from 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.280
 past and repeat the procedure 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.489
 all the gameplay is ready thought apparently 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.830
 developers generally came up with this one 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.170
 called the visibility indicator as if 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.970
 because of him they are for dumb artificial 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.340
 intelligence we can full length 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.140
 pass under the noses of the guards they are all 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.360
 time will repeat what they thought 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.310
 if at all reacts but it should 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.470
 indicator blush and enemies besides 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.690
 that will raise the alarm for some reason immediately 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.850
 understand that you are a vampire and your 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.739
 I don't recognize your home address sometimes 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.320
 allowed to go a little to the right or to the left 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.700
 but do not flatter yourself again soon 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.160
 go into the gut with one option 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.739
 the development of events the second is either 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.180
 fast reboot because our 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.230
 extraordinary strong even by the standards 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.120
 other vampires 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.580
 what we say later chief 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.040
 hero kills string fucking shots 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.930
 any nitty pistol so as the case 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.150
 raising anxiety besides that to us 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.739
 all the enemies of the level come running and even from 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.660
 fictional door runs help 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.400
 alignment for our frail hero in 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.709
 open confrontation almost always 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.019
 sad but fortunately there is also a third 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.729
 option to remove this hard drive 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.639
 cancer we give out for 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.710
 the game is separately worth touching skills 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.030
 many of them are partly stolen from masquerade 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.729
 partly from dizonord 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.680
 and although in these games they worked in the dark 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.289
 almost all are absolutely useless and 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.749
 special situation does not change and so here 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.849
 in all all the ideas collected from other people's games 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:41.099
 but even this is done ineptly role-playing 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.560
 system of deus ex x-ray vision 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:45.300
 from batman and even a pointer to the path from the dead 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.639
 space which for some reason only stretches 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.439
 for the next one and a half meters even 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.479
 borrowing other people's ideas did not save and 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:53.430
 grotto failure and absolutely nominations for 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.710
 the worst game of the year is the only pleasant 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.180
 the feeling that is left of the game is 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.949
 feeling that next time 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.300
 so bad the game doesnâ€™t look in 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:02.300
 soon everyone bye 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.270
 going to the museum I was thinking over 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.930
 rose words 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.930
 vampire 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.569
 the thought itself was incredible absurd 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.840
 but the evidence was obvious and not 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:21.980
 expected 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.610
 I hoped someone would do it 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.610
 nobody found 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.830
 where 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.229
 did they really think that 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.789
 You can spizdit the main topic of 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.300
 no secret materials of this 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.300
 will notice
