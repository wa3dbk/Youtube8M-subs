00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.160 
something else I don't know what you're
gonna<00:00:16.619> begin<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.190> begin<00:00:18.090> with<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:19.020> you

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
gonna begin it begin with is that you

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.349 
gonna begin it begin with is that you
take<00:00:19.289> out<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.619> brush<00:00:20.039> tool<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.789> go<00:00:20.939> over<00:00:21.240> to

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
take out the brush tool you go over to

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.670 
take out the brush tool you go over to
the<00:00:21.480> right<00:00:21.660> side<00:00:21.930> where<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.320> should<00:00:22.500> have

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
the right side where you should have

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.580 
the right side where you should have
this<00:00:23.240> little<00:00:24.240> settings<00:00:24.840> here<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.260> take<00:00:25.439> up

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
this little settings here you take up

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.189 
this little settings here you take up
sphere<00:00:25.939> you<00:00:26.939> take<00:00:27.210> this

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
sphere you take this

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.160 
sphere you take this
I<00:00:28.609> think<00:00:29.609> it's<00:00:29.880> taught<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.330> eight<00:00:30.539> but<00:00:31.050> you

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
I think it's taught with eight but you

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.720 
I think it's taught with eight but you
should<00:00:31.289> take<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.500> at<00:00:31.619> highest<00:00:31.830> business<00:00:32.160> which

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
should take it at highest business which

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.180 
should take it at highest business which
is<00:00:33.030> 16<00:00:34.100> now<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.160> should<00:00:35.370> make<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:36.890> like<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
is 16 now you should make it like the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.670 
is 16 now you should make it like the
same<00:00:38.520> height<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.239> length<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.870> whatever<00:00:40.379> it's

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
same height and length and whatever it's

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.720 
same height and length and whatever it's
called<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.070> don't<00:00:41.129> know<00:00:41.280> what<00:00:41.370> it's<00:00:41.460> called

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
called I don't know what it's called

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.000 
called I don't know what it's called
so<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.840> looks<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.350> could<00:00:43.680> make<00:00:43.890> it

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
so it looks like this could make it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.760 
so it looks like this could make it
smaller<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.399> don't<00:00:44.789> really<00:00:45.059> care<00:00:45.500> and<00:00:46.500> yeah

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
smaller I don't really care and yeah

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.549 
smaller I don't really care and yeah
it's<00:00:47.010> gonna<00:00:47.129> move<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.760> place<00:00:48.059> okay<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:49.500> you

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.900 
like it will go faster and eventually if
you'll<00:02:33.170> fly<00:02:33.560> when<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:33.950> knife<00:02:34.099> it<00:02:35.530> like<00:02:36.530> that

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
you'll fly when you knife it like that

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.009 
you'll fly when you knife it like that
so<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:37.970> just<00:02:38.330> find<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.750> number<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.200> want<00:02:39.459> and

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
so you just find the number you want and

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:55.780 
so you just find the number you want and
bam<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:43.760> will<00:02:43.970> fly<00:02:44.150> way

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.680 

this<00:02:56.420> is<00:02:56.599> quite<00:02:56.840> funny<00:02:57.610> easy

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.270 

and<00:03:04.320> you<00:03:05.010> lower<00:03:05.220> numbers<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.730> get<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:07.890> less<00:03:08.100> it

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
and you lower numbers you get it less it

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.350 
and you lower numbers you get it less it
will<00:03:08.430> move<00:03:08.700> right<00:03:10.670> now<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.820> doesn't<00:03:12.090> move<00:03:12.180> at

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
will move right now it doesn't move at

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.050 
will move right now it doesn't move at
all

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.000
