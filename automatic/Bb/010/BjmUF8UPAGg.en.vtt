00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
buckle this under the frontier if you

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.679 
buckle this under the frontier if you
were<00:01:50.619> installing<00:01:51.039> it<00:01:51.249> because<00:01:51.579> the<00:01:52.149> buckle

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
were installing it because the buckle

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.089 
were installing it because the buckle
