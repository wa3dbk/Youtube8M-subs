00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 everyone so I have a lot 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.089
 a lot of questions to all people 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.929
 who ask me the fossils you 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.370
 take or because they are beautiful 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.620
 I admit I love me as me 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.389
 fossils today I will tell you 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.600
 it's wrong this is it comes from them they 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.939
 come from a dealer or 16 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.890
 it's a company that is based in 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:29.310
 toronto then cdc we need it's the fact 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.990
 with 10 min I do not know if talking 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.340
 clearly french but cdc of the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.930
 point 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.030
 so yes it's in the province of isfahan 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.820
 on because it's two stars 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.899
 it's not synthetic but I think 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.870
 it's really worth it 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.980
 they love horror crevice released 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.010
 that by sponsoring to other companies 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.100
 which are missing that with min it's 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.170
 still very much these important sums 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.370
 between the fossils to pray I loved 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.430
 so much the back of my reform because 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.859
 it's a city ​​so have to predict 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.359
 are still yes its super long 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.910
 but it's still very very natural 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.430
 are not long by all we can 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.070
 to contact his lawyer would have 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.110
 to see fossils of the buttocks is 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.490
 really too obvious this is when 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.860
 even very natural then lately he 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.009
 is at home I find that when people 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.680
 are offered will be doing extensions 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.850
 it's the same effect so I think 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.729
 on the sound is 25 or 30 years 25 required 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.350
 30 I think it's still a little more 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.810
 expensive but I reuse the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.280
 same since tinguely the last 15 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.290
 video it's just really for 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.829
 learn how to take care of 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.909
 fossils and then how to clean them 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.110
 because of a clean way 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.340
 dispossess a lot of people too who would me 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.340
 ask how are you doing to clean 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.470
 fossils mine this score is getting ready 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.880
 so I'll go back this but above all of 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.409
 show that despite the involvement of 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.689
 ditches I do not know if it's mentioned 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.390
 but me the style of fossils that 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.640
 name and sleep hop as it is here 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.560
 so so glue is one that 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.290
 is white that dry transparent 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.670
 well one who claw that dry black 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.280
 so I really advise you if 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.329
 you are a beginner newbie she is 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.890
 with the glue that will go down 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.569
 transparency have prevented by 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.099
 little sores we do not want 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.739
 then we can see that I'm applying a 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.129
 layer very finely on the band of 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.480
 six he 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.180
 what is really important 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.739
 it is to let dry at least thirty 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.329
 seconds and then I tell you 30 seconds 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.920
 the thing is that the glue dries a little 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.780
 like what I see and apply it in 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.299
 this moment at the base of the eyelashes 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.760
 it's really gone to the skin already 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.049
 so I make sure I'm a doctor 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.750
 let the sky fall by 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.419
 on me true style then given 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.819
 it's a bit sticky already after I 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:40.859
 I'm going to be able to slide the fossil to 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.049
 right or left as we can see 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.659
 it's already well nadery and then he 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.609
 was worth sticking the inner corner 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.219
 shortly after I will go with the water side 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.569
 of gauge man twizzers was going to push a 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.849
 little testing basis to make sure that 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.310
 everything was good to adhere to the skin 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.260
 then I advise to go curly for 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.680
 mobile with drunkenness really gave 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.629
 a nice curve then finally a 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.879
 last step it's going to be to apply 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:09.470
 a light layer of mascara that will 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.780
 join your false eyelashes with booklet 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.100
 so less bbc the me I 'm just going 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.720
 slightly tightened 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.660
 if you have a little blowing always 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.970
 put a little bit of makeup remover 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.590
 Savalou is the glue so we can see 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.810
 the fossil there is a pot of glue and some 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.890
 residues and mascara so the month 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.810
 what am I doing to go 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.380
 clean all that I say makeup remover 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.910
 on a little cotton will then have I 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:38.320
 the applied the fossil on one side 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:41.680
 since the cotton made that can be seen in 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.360
 true I tap be certain that the 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.070
 make-up remover in all styles 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.170
 a notch can be seen that at will the 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:51.640
 mascara then you take the fossil by 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.620
 the base and then I reread and follow the 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.290
 residues on the makeup remover in the 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.870
 cotton stalk after the glue has become 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.610
 really really leave him so after 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.920
 I can go with my fingers then to the 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.400
 remove the excess so that's all 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.380
 for super fast videos you 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.320
 demonstrate what is my style of 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.300
 huy's favorite fossils come how 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.660
 take care order is applied so 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.190
 I think you are really ready to 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.140
 relay challenge then go buy yourself 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.300
 difficult because everyone has 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.420
 need fossils everyone 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.990
 ok so suppose that's all 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.910
 I had to say 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.910
 then we meet again very quickly
