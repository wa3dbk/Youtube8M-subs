but<00:00:42.460> today<00:00:42.789> we're<00:00:42.940> going<00:00:43.059> to<00:00:43.149> talk<00:00:43.329> about<00:00:43.480> the

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
but today we're going to talk about the

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.290 
but today we're going to talk about the
shoulder<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.559> some<00:00:44.739> things<00:00:44.980> you<00:00:45.129> can<00:00:45.309> do<00:00:45.550> to

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
shoulder and some things you can do to

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.470 
shoulder and some things you can do to
open<00:00:46.719> up<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.109> shoulder<00:00:47.589> and<00:00:48.269> diminish<00:00:49.269> the

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
open up the shoulder and diminish the

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.239 
open up the shoulder and diminish the
stress<00:00:49.839> that<00:00:50.050> your<00:00:50.199> elbow<00:00:50.589> might<00:00:50.829> be<00:00:50.949> feeling

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:51.249 
stress that your elbow might be feeling

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.819 
stress that your elbow might be feeling
because<00:00:51.730> the<00:00:51.940> shoulder<00:00:52.390> is<00:00:52.539> not<00:00:52.569> doing<00:00:53.199> what

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
because the shoulder is not doing what

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.849 
because the shoulder is not doing what
it's<00:00:53.980> supposed<00:00:54.039> to<00:00:54.309> be<00:00:54.370> doing<00:00:54.839> so<00:00:55.839> in<00:00:56.109> today's

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
it's supposed to be doing so in today's

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.770 
it's supposed to be doing so in today's
video<00:00:57.249> we're<00:00:57.640> going<00:00:57.730> to<00:00:57.789> talk<00:00:57.969> about<00:00:58.149> shoulder

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
video we're going to talk about shoulder

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.540 
video we're going to talk about shoulder
traction<00:00:59.379> and<00:00:59.469> basically<00:00:59.769> the<00:00:59.979> concept<00:01:00.429> of

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
traction and basically the concept of

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.029 
traction and basically the concept of
shoulder<00:01:00.940> traction<00:01:01.449> is<00:01:01.629> creating<00:01:02.409> space<00:01:02.769> in

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
shoulder traction is creating space in

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.189 
shoulder traction is creating space in
the<00:01:03.219> joint<00:01:03.519> and<00:01:03.789> I<00:01:03.850> learned<00:01:04.150> this<00:01:04.930> technique

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
the joint and I learned this technique

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.710 
the joint and I learned this technique
from<00:01:05.470> dick<00:01:06.010> Hartzell<00:01:06.550> in<00:01:06.700> Youngstown<00:01:07.120> Ohio<00:01:07.150> he

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
from dick Hartzell in Youngstown Ohio he

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.899 
from dick Hartzell in Youngstown Ohio he
is<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.990> jump<00:01:08.290> stretch<00:01:08.590> band<00:01:08.950> man<00:01:09.250> he's<00:01:09.700> the

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
is the jump stretch band man he's the

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.570 
is the jump stretch band man he's the
flex<00:01:10.210> band<00:01:10.330> King<00:01:11.050> he<00:01:11.620> goes<00:01:11.800> around<00:01:12.130> he<00:01:12.310> drives

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
flex band King he goes around he drives

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.600 
flex band King he goes around he drives
around<00:01:12.760> he<00:01:13.120> flies<00:01:13.390> around<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:13.990> he<00:01:14.440> uses<00:01:14.950> these

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
around he flies around and he uses these

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.390 
around he flies around and he uses these
flex<00:01:16.150> bands<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.690> help<00:01:16.900> stretch<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:17.680> open<00:01:18.310> up

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
flex bands to help stretch and open up

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.960 
flex bands to help stretch and open up
his<00:01:18.580> body<00:01:18.820> in<00:01:19.210> a<00:01:19.570> very<00:01:19.990> healthy<00:01:20.530> way<00:01:20.800> and<00:01:21.250> he

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
his body in a very healthy way and he

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.270 
his body in a very healthy way and he
taught<00:01:22.210> taught<00:01:23.020> me<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.200> lot<00:01:23.380> about<00:01:23.440> how<00:01:23.890> I<00:01:23.920> could

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
taught taught me a lot about how I could

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.430 
taught taught me a lot about how I could
improve<00:01:24.730> the<00:01:25.540> function<00:01:25.900> of<00:01:25.990> all<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.230> joints

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
improve the function of all the joints

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.020 
improve the function of all the joints
in<00:01:26.680> my<00:01:26.770> body<00:01:27.010> and<00:01:27.250> today<00:01:27.460> we're<00:01:27.640> talking<00:01:27.790> about

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
in my body and today we're talking about

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.570 
in my body and today we're talking about
shoulder<00:01:28.510> traction<00:01:28.960> so<00:01:29.560> basically<00:01:30.340> the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
shoulder traction so basically the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.850 
shoulder traction so basically the
concepts<00:01:31.090> I<00:01:31.210> want<00:01:31.390> you<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.720> take<00:01:31.900> away<00:01:32.050> from

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
concepts I want you to take away from

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.650 
concepts I want you to take away from
today's<00:01:33.220> video<00:01:33.550> is<00:01:33.850> that<00:01:34.150> you<00:01:34.270> can<00:01:34.450> create

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
today's video is that you can create

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.170 
today's video is that you can create
space<00:01:34.990> in<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.320> joint<00:01:35.560> that<00:01:35.860> flex<00:01:36.610> bands<00:01:36.910> can

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
space in the joint that flex bands can

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.570 
space in the joint that flex bands can
help<00:01:37.390> heal<00:01:37.780> your<00:01:37.810> tennis<00:01:38.410> elbow<00:01:38.650> when<00:01:39.400> you

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
how to do shoulder traction okay as you

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.880 
how to do shoulder traction okay as you
can<00:02:00.370> see<00:02:00.550> we're<00:02:01.540> doing<00:02:01.780> shoulder<00:02:02.200> traction

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
can see we're doing shoulder traction

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
straight again it's really important to

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.900

keep<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.620> arms<00:02:41.980> straight<00:02:42.069> when<00:02:42.520> you're<00:02:42.610> doing

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
keep the arms straight when you're doing

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.490 
keep the arms straight when you're doing
traction<00:02:43.450> if<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.720> bend<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.140> arm<00:02:44.319> you're

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
traction if you bend the arm you're

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.610 
traction if you bend the arm you're
basically<00:02:44.890> strength<00:02:45.580> training<00:02:46.200> but<00:02:47.200> when<00:02:47.410> you

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
basically strength training but when you

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.920 
basically strength training but when you
keep<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.100> arms<00:02:48.520> straighter<00:02:48.880> you're<00:02:49.239> actually

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
keep the arms straighter you're actually

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.430 
keep the arms straighter you're actually
creating<00:02:50.680> more<00:02:50.860> space<00:02:51.130> in<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.730> joint<00:02:52.440> with

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
creating more space in the joint with

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.110 
creating more space in the joint with
your<00:02:53.650> shoulder<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.640> can<00:02:54.850> take<00:02:54.880> the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
your shoulder and this can take the

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.699 
your shoulder and this can take the
pressure<00:02:55.480> off<00:02:55.690> of<00:02:55.989> your<00:02:56.080> elbow<00:02:56.530> because

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
pressure off of your elbow because

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.080 
pressure off of your elbow because
there's<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:57.010> good<00:02:57.280> chance<00:02:57.610> that<00:02:57.760> if<00:02:57.940> you're

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
there's a good chance that if you're

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.620 
there's a good chance that if you're
having<00:02:58.270> elbow<00:02:58.780> pain<00:02:59.050> your<00:02:59.739> shoulder<00:03:00.370> is

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
having elbow pain your shoulder is

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.560 
having elbow pain your shoulder is
compressed<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:01.989> need<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.230> get<00:03:02.350> new<00:03:02.680> blood

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
compressed and you need to get new blood

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.810 
compressed and you need to get new blood
into<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.810> shoulder<00:03:05.260> if<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.440> feel<00:03:05.739> any<00:03:06.070> pain
