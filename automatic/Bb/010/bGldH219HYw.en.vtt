a moment we've all been waiting for okay
this<00:00:03.270> is<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:04.460> 10.1<00:00:05.460> Galaxy<00:00:06.180> Tab<00:00:06.420> 2<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:07.429> then

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
this is the 10.1 Galaxy Tab 2 and then

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.780 
this is the 10.1 Galaxy Tab 2 and then
this<00:00:08.639> is<00:00:08.820> your<00:00:08.970> SPL<00:00:09.570> lab<00:00:09.599> software<00:00:10.759> SPL<00:00:11.759> lab

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
this is your SPL lab software SPL lab

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.720 
this is your SPL lab software SPL lab
meter<00:00:12.269> right<00:00:12.990> here<00:00:14.360> pressure<00:00:15.360> sensor

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
meter right here pressure sensor

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.859 
meter right here pressure sensor
calibrated<00:00:17.730> with<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.910> term<00:00:18.060> lab<00:00:18.270> not<00:00:18.630> very

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
calibrated with the term lab not very

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.529 
calibrated with the term lab not very
far<00:00:19.140> off<00:00:19.380> as<00:00:19.770> far<00:00:20.250> as<00:00:20.400> metering<00:00:21.029> goes

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
far off as far as metering goes

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.840 
far off as far as metering goes
like<00:00:22.260> within<00:00:22.560> do<00:00:22.859> tenths<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.369> decibel<00:00:23.670> and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
like within do tenths of a decibel and

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.769 
like within do tenths of a decibel and
it's<00:00:24.000> actually<00:00:24.390> calibrated<00:00:24.990> with<00:00:26.510> the<00:00:27.510> term

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
it's actually calibrated with the term

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.590 
it's actually calibrated with the term
lab<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.519> very<00:00:30.560> respectively<00:00:31.560> accurate

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
lab so it's a very respectively accurate

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.209 
lab so it's a very respectively accurate
as<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.809> can<00:00:33.960> remember<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.590> had<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.460> buy<00:00:35.610> this

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
as you can remember I had to buy this

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.540 
as you can remember I had to buy this
micro<00:00:38.219> USB<00:00:38.940> 2<00:00:39.719> female<00:00:40.110> USB<00:00:40.649> cord<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.160> get<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.399> to

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
micro USB 2 female USB cord to get it to

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.799 
micro USB 2 female USB cord to get it to
run<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> Android<00:00:42.660> phone<00:00:43.910> and<00:00:44.910> then<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
run on the Android phone and then the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.110 
run on the Android phone and then the
dilemma<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.289> ran<00:00:46.500> into<00:00:46.680> for<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.160> tablet<00:00:47.700> was

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
dilemma I ran into for the tablet was

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.369 
dilemma I ran into for the tablet was
that<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:49.340> had<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.430> USB<00:00:50.910> cord<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.570> tried<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.020> use

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
that I had a USB cord so I tried to use

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.790 
that I had a USB cord so I tried to use
this<00:00:52.620> female-to-female

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
this female-to-female

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.869 
this female-to-female
so<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> can<00:00:56.010> plug<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:57.859> each<00:00:58.859> side<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.489> USB

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
so you can plug in each side of the USB

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.330 
so you can plug in each side of the USB
well<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.329> didn't<00:01:00.660> work<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:02.219> is

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
well that didn't work so this is this is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.320 
well that didn't work so this is this is
pointless<00:01:02.670> don't<00:01:03.120> buy<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:06.409> what<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.439> did<00:01:07.770> find

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
pointless don't buy one what I did find

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.640 
pointless don't buy one what I did find

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
readings will come off the tin tab but

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.870 
readings will come off the tin tab but
yeah<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.489> that's<00:02:23.610> your<00:02:23.820> SPL<00:02:24.300> lab<00:02:24.330> unit<00:02:25.880> show

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
yeah so that's your SPL lab unit show

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.160 
yeah so that's your SPL lab unit show
you<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.030> little<00:02:27.180> bit<00:02:27.270> how<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.540> works<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:28.050> can

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
you a little bit how this works you can

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.770 
you a little bit how this works you can
hit<00:02:28.320> peak<00:02:28.560> hold<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.220> then<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.300> loudest<00:02:30.690> sound

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
hit peak hold and then the loudest sound

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.590 
hit peak hold and then the loudest sound
it<00:02:31.140> hears<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.950> will<00:02:32.160> hold<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.970> it'll

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
it hears it will hold that and it'll

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.820 
it hears it will hold that and it'll
hold<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:34.080> at<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:35.299> frequency<00:02:36.470> that<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.620> hears

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
hold that at the frequency that it hears

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.380 
hold that at the frequency that it hears
it<00:02:38.010> at<00:02:40.940> right<00:02:41.940> now<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:42.360> just<00:02:42.450> hearing

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390
