00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
I stomped the snow down as best I could

00:01:39.530 --> 00:02:00.350 
I stomped the snow down as best I could
in<00:01:40.530> front<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> vehicle<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:59.120> we<00:02:00.120> might<00:02:00.240> be

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
in front of the vehicle and we might be

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:49.000 
in front of the vehicle and we might be
watching<00:02:00.510> oprah<00:02:00.900> today

highway<00:04:25.750> 38<00:04:26.350> two<00:04:27.070> red<00:04:27.250> ones

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:39.740 

it's<00:04:31.080> not<00:04:31.259> a<00:04:31.320> force<00:04:31.680> trip<00:04:37.250> putting<00:04:38.250> here<00:04:38.750> 24

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
it's not a force trip putting here 24

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.930 
it's not a force trip putting here 24
high<00:04:39.930> right<00:04:40.259> yeah<00:04:40.830> I<00:04:40.949> mean<00:04:41.100> for<00:04:41.400> high<00:04:41.610> right

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
high right yeah I mean for high right

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.610 
high right yeah I mean for high right
now<00:04:41.970> here<00:04:42.479> but<00:04:42.750> I<00:04:42.780> just<00:04:43.020> locked<00:04:43.199> the<00:04:43.350> sitter

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
now here but I just locked the sitter

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.100 
now here but I just locked the sitter
differential<00:04:44.330> which<00:04:45.330> forces<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.780> power<00:04:45.960> to

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
differential which forces the power to

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.159 
differential which forces the power to
all<00:04:46.199> four<00:04:46.380> corners<00:04:46.440> of<00:04:46.979> it<00:04:47.009> and<00:04:47.639> it<00:04:47.759> also

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
all four corners of it and it also

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.050 
all four corners of it and it also
disables<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.229> stability<00:04:49.740> control<00:04:49.919> so<00:04:50.880> when

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
disables the stability control so when

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.700 
disables the stability control so when
you<00:04:51.150> get<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:51.539> little<00:04:51.870> bit<00:04:51.990> out<00:04:52.139> of<00:04:52.169> shape<00:04:52.289> on<00:04:52.620> an

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
you get a little bit out of shape on an

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.350 
you get a little bit out of shape on an
angle<00:04:53.070> or<00:04:53.400> sliding<00:04:53.759> yeah<00:04:54.259> stability<00:04:55.259> control

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
angle or sliding yeah stability control

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.450 
angle or sliding yeah stability control
cuts<00:04:57.360> power<00:04:57.600> and<00:04:58.110> you<00:04:59.039> don't<00:04:59.160> want<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.340> cut

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
cuts power and you don't want to cut

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.490 
cuts power and you don't want to cut
power<00:04:59.610> you<00:04:59.820> just<00:04:59.940> want<00:05:00.090> to<00:05:00.150> keep<00:05:00.360> digging<00:05:00.600> so

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
power you just want to keep digging so

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.010 
power you just want to keep digging so
that's<00:05:01.680> what<00:05:01.830> that's<00:05:02.520> what<00:05:02.580> it<00:05:02.760> does

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
that's what that's what it does

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.990 
that's what that's what it does
so<00:05:04.620> you<00:05:04.710> want<00:05:04.919> that<00:05:04.979> off<00:05:05.220> one<00:05:05.430> here<00:05:05.610> and<00:05:05.729> snow

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
so you want that off one here and snow

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.730 
so you want that off one here and snow
yeah<00:05:06.419> well<00:05:06.720> we're<00:05:06.900> in<00:05:07.080> really<00:05:07.259> circle

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
yeah well we're in really circle

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.820 
yeah well we're in really circle
slippery<00:05:08.039> circumstances<00:05:09.259> you<00:05:10.259> want<00:05:10.470> it<00:05:10.530> off<00:05:10.620> i

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
slippery circumstances you want it off i

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.580 
slippery circumstances you want it off i
think<00:05:11.069> until<00:05:11.580> you<00:05:11.789> can<00:05:11.940> keep<00:05:12.090> digging<00:05:12.470> like<00:05:13.470> we

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
think until you can keep digging like we

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.749 
think until you can keep digging like we
were<00:05:13.680> doing<00:05:13.889> the<00:05:13.979> other<00:05:14.099> one's<00:05:14.310> gonna<00:05:14.460> get<00:05:14.639> out

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
were doing the other one's gonna get out

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:24.239 
were doing the other one's gonna get out
of<00:05:14.879> line<00:05:15.080> just<00:05:16.080> didn't<00:05:16.349> work

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:22.290 

snowed<00:06:07.000> in

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.409 

put<00:06:23.300> it<00:06:23.389> off<00:06:23.510> the<00:06:23.690> phone<00:06:24.970> see<00:06:25.970> what<00:06:26.150> he<00:06:26.270> wants

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
put it off the phone see what he wants

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:33.590 
put it off the phone see what he wants
before<00:06:26.770> for<00:06:27.770> talking<00:06:28.040> on<00:06:28.160> the<00:06:28.220> phone

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.760
