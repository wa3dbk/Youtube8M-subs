00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.530
 today again a simple recipe 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:26.850
 American cookies fresh customer speech 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:26.850
 and delicious the picture says it all 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:39.190
 the cookies we need butter butter 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:43.480
 brown-white cinnamon vanilla sugar 1 1 something 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:49.360
 cherry water mail hazelnuts or others 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:51.040
 and chocolates drop the recipes quickly 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.379
 and simply made 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.050
 but still there are certain 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.629
 Preparations needed for example the 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.989
 they have prepared hazelnuts 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:06.460
 better aroma and are in the cookies 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:09.940
 then incomparably better than rest 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:18.909
 be addressed the shell of the fur 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:21.960
 removed deposited and roughly chopped and 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.960
 now it can start 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:32.710
 under the two sugars that is under 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:35.400
 the spices are frothy and stirred 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.380
 Since I have none in the brown sugar Qatar 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.890
 I just need the week 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:46.030
 sugar in the marinette chopped small 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:49.120
 and actually uses this 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:54.820
 nothing but the knife months 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:57.550
 that can become dull the crowd becomes 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.960
 now stirred until the 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:05.530
 sugar has dissolved and the fat sugar 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.130
 eggs mix really beautiful airy look 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.130
 with is 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:22.730
 in between how could it be otherwise 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:25.580
 also from the edge solve everything correctly 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:31.580
 good with each other as we see 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.540
 as then on the edge still world champion and 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.640
 we do not want that 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.070
 we want everything nice and even 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:45.610
 have distributed 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:45.610
 so back into the machine again 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.770
 then stir until frothy 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:59.989
 stir the butter until the 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.989
 sugar is dissolved 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:11.730
 in the meantime, the higher chance 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.420
 as in a small glass fill two 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.150
 That 's enough 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.870
 and dissolve with a little liquid 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:26.360
 I suppose you come in Kirschwasser 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.360
 cookies are very good 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.910
 the flour 7 and the chopped nuts and 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.580
 chocolate drops 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:48.060
 mixing it with the nuts do not have to 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:51.800
 be as tall as here with me 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.290
 we can also be a little smaller 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:59.750
 and this mixture comes slowly 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:04.320
 under the watch butter 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:08.640
 it does not have to be dusty 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:12.330
 More are ignored now 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:17.250
 out and how can it be different from 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:23.180
 solve the edge and again everything in the 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:25.650
 I have to turn around downstairs 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.460
 nothing comes at all only the 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.330
 bare dough and then another message 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.330
 the machine 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.059
 once again 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:42.389
 why turns and the whole is done 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:42.389
 Dimensions 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.610
 with a spoon 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.199
 on baking paper do not put too tight 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.790
 together 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.610
 the cookies run while baking 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.110
 apart 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:11.520
 the wheels do not have to be nice either 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.680
 and that in the household a lot 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.850
 I've got an ice 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:21.870
 then you will be a portioner 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:26.990
 nice evenly but as I said 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.990
 you also put it with spoon that does not matter 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.639
 normal size gives this mass about 30 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.639
 piece 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.599
 packed 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:46.899
 the cookies at about 170 180 degrees 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:48.999
 celsius and circulating 14 minutes would have to 

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:50.069
 they finish according to what is open 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:52.569
 different 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:57.550
 Immediately after bake on a children 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:06:02.039
 overthrow or push and that is the 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:06.959
 Yield as 31 pieces located 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.959
 Good luck with baking
