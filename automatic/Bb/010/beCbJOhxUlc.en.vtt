00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.760
 O 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.470
 the barrel after winning gold medal 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.370
 and broke the world record 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.480
 very tired still cesar cielo now 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.309
 you 're record-breaking 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.930
 This is the time you had stuck in the 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.720
 your fourth time with you looked all over 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:01.670
 day zero hour 46 89 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:05.720
 but look two years ago in my 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.330
 career here a jump from a swimmer who 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.610
 I was trying something to sing a song. 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.869
 story without any further proof 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:21.110
 and grew above ground 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:24.340
 the evidence is very good to see how looking 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.860
 receiving the embrace of the coach 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.710
 great joy here in the region of 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.720
 interviews is very emotional as it is 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.220
 that look at the scoreboard and see not only the 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.960
 your name in front of what you already had 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.780
 seen but those two English letters 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.259
 wr which signify the world record 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.280
 Look at the dream being realized It does not have 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.989
 difficult to talk 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.509
 I'm hurting a lot now, it 's thinking about 

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:55.190
 my head before the race like never 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.830
 in my whole life , but it was worth it. 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.149
 Worth everything it's worth if it hit a lot 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:13.670
 also of proof seems that more than 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:15.319
 normal and human, there's no way you 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.239
 called the crowd a lot to celebrate 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.800
 with you and especially with the family 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:26.629
 here in this long time on my knee 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.819
 six months of training again so far 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.160
 celebrate with the greatest joy that I 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.989
 could have the national anthem will play 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:41.660

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:49.250
 podium of brazil first part 1 up 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.380
 of the Brazilian who is in Estonia is a 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.640
 brazil's contribution to swimming 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.610

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.880
 already felt this weight all over the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.360
 center of my leg 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.880

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.820

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.080

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.980
 the investment that we made worked out 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.270
 without investments but then I brought 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.090
