tweak<00:01:51.299> for<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> iPhone<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.899> think<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.470> this

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
tweak for the iPhone I think I like this

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.499 
tweak for the iPhone I think I like this
user<00:01:52.890> interface<00:01:53.130> all<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.610> would<00:01:54.000> definitely

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
user interface all I would definitely

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.899 
user interface all I would definitely
install<00:01:54.899> something<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.680> on<00:01:55.920> my<00:01:56.430> iPhone

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
install something like this on my iPhone

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.240 
install something like this on my iPhone
if<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.479> becomes<00:01:57.719> available<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.320> Cydia<00:01:58.680> you'll

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
if it becomes available in Cydia you'll

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.770 
if it becomes available in Cydia you'll
be<00:01:59.369> able<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.579> get<00:01:59.700> all<00:01:59.909> your<00:02:00.090> sections<00:02:00.540> here

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
now if you tap on the center there you

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.420 
now if you tap on the center there you
get<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.939> FUBU<00:02:03.509> if<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.170> tap<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.439> any<00:02:05.040> section

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
get a FUBU if you tap on any section

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.249 
get a FUBU if you tap on any section
it'll<00:02:05.880> zoom<00:02:06.060> into<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.479> section<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.049> tap

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
it'll zoom into that section you tap

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.960 
it'll zoom into that section you tap
words<00:02:07.530> there's<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.710> blank<00:02:07.979> space<00:02:08.190> then<00:02:08.700> assume

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
words there's a blank space then assume

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.940 
words there's a blank space then assume
right<00:02:09.300> back<00:02:09.450> out<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.229> also<00:02:10.410> use<00:02:10.709> this

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
right back out you can also use this

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.920 
right back out you can also use this
pinch<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.520> zoom<00:02:11.550> motion<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.270> think<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.690> a

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
pinch to zoom motion I think this is a

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.289 
pinch to zoom motion I think this is a
nice<00:02:13.200> concept<00:02:13.799> for<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.400> iPhone<00:02:14.819> it<00:02:15.180> would

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
nice concept for the iPhone it would

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.819 
nice concept for the iPhone it would
definitely<00:02:15.540> install<00:02:16.230> something<00:02:16.590> like<00:02:16.709> this

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
definitely install something like this

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.679 
definitely install something like this

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689
