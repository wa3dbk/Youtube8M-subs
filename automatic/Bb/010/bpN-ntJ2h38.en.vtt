00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:09.849
 glazing of balconies and loggias 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:12.070
 This is a Russian tradition which 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.570
 allows you to use these rooms for 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.879
 a variety of needs 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.830
 from storing seasonal items to 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.140
 recreation areas 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.539
 however, not everyone wants to turn a balcony into 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.910
 extra room is still more 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.009
 there are no heating systems on the balconies and 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.060
 fully attach it to the room 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.460
 want few 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.770
 so for glazing balconies perfect 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.690
 suitable profile system with online 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.730
 although it is considered a cold system 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.469
 glass width fifty eight 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.410
 millimeters allows you to achieve much 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.629
 more heat and noise insulation compared 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.789
 with aluminum counterparts internal 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.510
 reinforcement protects the structure from 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.289
 warp sunline sliding system 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.140
 multiple choice 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.210
 opening options perfectly fit with 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.460
 softline profiles which allows 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.910
 create a balcony glazing any 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.859
 forms 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.079
 brush seal with internal 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.140
 polyethylene interlayer provides 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.150
 reliable protection against dust and dirt systems 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.570
 make it possible to install is not easy 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.910
 glass and double-glazed window width 4 5 to 20 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.260
 millimeters important element is 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.940
 mosquito net 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.280
 it can be mounted on a frame with 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.370
 aluminum rails due to this 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.660
 clamping of the flap is provided 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.380
 sealing and full protection against 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.990
 insects 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.090
 thus the balconies and loggias are glazed 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.860
 and with the help of this profile look 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.770
 elegantly do not freeze through 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.750
 and easy to operate system with online 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.670
 designed for window companies 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.470
 who make a large number 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.100
 plastic windows and can not afford 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.870
 allow 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.130
 open additional production 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.800
 aluminum profile 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.540
 system is technologically flexible assembly 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.890
 possible both by welding on 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.960
 production and with 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.490
 special connecting systems 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.490
