00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.930
 this is a flash holder for the 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.969
 Kempner the children is a great thing 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.039
 they know so because looks like is 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.610
 the hut cable here with the camera 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.590
 connected 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.910
 The problem, however , I sometimes know 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.650
 is where to put it 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.180
 So if the chemnitz in the camera 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.500
 is plugged in you always have that 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.880
 problem man it always has a camera 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.900
 depending on what you have there 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.800
 not just makes it the 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.390
 optimal solution 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.270
 there is just this here 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.710
 special weather again campaign 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.789
 the whole thing is simply pinched 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.440
 works here over one 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.749
 spring mechanism with a resistance 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.329
 that means I just open this up 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:39.589
 after the campaigner purely the whole thing too 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.289
 again , and then it has too 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:44.449
 really bombproof you attached the 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.979
 this region is so he is with 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.510
 plastic encased and also the 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.829
 pad on the bottom here 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.929
 is like that with a soft foam rubber 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.129
 equipped that is to the children 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.449
 So it does not happen so come 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.050
 no scratches on there you do not have any 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.839
 be scared 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.519
 in practice that means chamberlain of 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.139
 animal in and pure at the bottom 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.600
 that's just the opposite 

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:04.070
 Connected to the pc and where to get that 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.140
 whole then the camera can fix 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.610
 can and how the whole country right 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.549
 So we're going to take some of that 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.200
 sets this is in the case 52 is 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.930
 the less interesting the camera is that 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.270
 is not about anything or Jews attached 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.909
 then it will be here 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.960
 this virtue this access for the 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.880
 Shoe simply inserted up here 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.320
 just as with a handle screw here 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.890
 Busy about that with flash devices 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.799
 also makes it look like that then 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.000
 and last but not least, it's up here 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.560
 the chemnitz pure 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.549
 I said that you just go here 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.950
 this mistake would like to join me 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.109
 spring mechanism must push upwards 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.049
 so now it has to be behind the camera 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:49.759
 always make something difficult though 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.070
 anyway so and then that's it 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.049
 fixed you can see you have that 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.579
 problem that the cambridge if we 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.869
 just then in the side with the camera 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.369
 just connected somewhere under 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.780
 hangs so they actually have now 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.590
 always up here directly on the pc 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.470
 on top 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.790
 can see when using materials 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.770
 beyond that, if you look at everyone 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.140
 advantage because you have to look what is 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.250
 here this bracket are of course 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.650
 for example, for quite normal 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.860
 connect smartphone that is also 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.450
 not quite so called because you stop 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.280
 just now we have that yes 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.080
 also stop just different apps it 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.200
 there in the store where you have just easy 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.490
 then use his smartphone thanks 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.020
 you can do that for the whole example 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.190
 used as a remote trigger so we have 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.450
 different things in you look here 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.700
 also the smart gravel among others 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.470
 over normal always the spd just has many 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.170
 that means it has just then here 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.480
 the whole court so use around 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.980
 simply attach the smartphone i 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.110
 that would help in that case that i 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.110
 then somehow and say okay I want 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.430
 yes on the smartphone itself here my 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.990
 app can still serve that is 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.490
 that's just the side that I have 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.970
 simply attached above I turn that 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.100
 whole on milk so the man behind the 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.840
 Camera practically so and you can just 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.970
 here on smartphone for example whether with this 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.090
 bracket then control my smartphone 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.410
 really great thing and for what the 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.880
 whether that is specially for the 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.840
 kemberger use only kept for 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.610
 smartphone if you have one more 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.620
 corresponding to another part have 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.209
 That's up to you 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.890
 In any case, it is a very 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.489
 meaningful extension and a very 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.489
 useful accessories
