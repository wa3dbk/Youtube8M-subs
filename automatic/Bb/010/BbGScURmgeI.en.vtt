00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.680

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.920
 here we are to say who is going to be 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.980
 the winner of the pokemon draw that is going 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.710
 to bring these three initials ginés with 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.050
 hidden abilities and with six i vents 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.090
 because here we will enforce gone 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.510
 receiving all of you 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.090
 answers is worth so good as you see 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.400
 Well, here I told you that in the draw 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.650
 would you put your name or nickname 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.260
 you usually use and your friend code from the 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.810
 nintendo 3ds as you see here are all 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.090
 all your answers are valid 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.130
 your names and all this so 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.110
 well I think the first one is that ring 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.680
 so let's copy all this worth 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.899
 let's copy all of them to see what goes 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.680
 going down to not leave or 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:01.700
 none is worth 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.210
 good to see we keep copying ok up 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.660
 here until this one called boss is worth 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.090
 so let's copy it and let's go 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.700
 here to the page this is called 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.690
 drawn and we're going to paste it here 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.479
 let's look at that so everyone is 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.490
 well there is no need to be correct 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.920
 first that ring has to be valid 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.160
 that's fine because if not, if there were 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.619
 example two for example another name here 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.360
 then it seems to me that the page is not 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.460
 it updates it well so good some 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.180

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.350
 things do not and all this and well here we have 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.330
 put in command of twitter, it's worth my 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.180
 name as a good pokemon trainer 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.640
 I leave this while I do not and I do not 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.210
 wait I'm going to erase this so it's 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.640
 do not give problems just in case it's worth 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.180

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.659
