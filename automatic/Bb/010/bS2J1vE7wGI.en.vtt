something I just noticed you see the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.290 
something I just noticed you see the
black<00:02:29.680> outlining<00:02:30.280> on<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.670> details<00:02:31.060> there

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
black outlining on the details there

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.530 
black outlining on the details there
it's<00:02:32.170> really<00:02:32.470> not<00:02:32.620> there<00:02:32.980> on<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.150> real<00:02:34.300> figure

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
it's really not there on the real figure

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.060 
it's really not there on the real figure
it's<00:02:35.110> kind<00:02:35.770> of<00:02:35.830> kind<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.459> weird<00:02:36.690> but<00:02:37.690> uh<00:02:38.040> yeah<00:02:39.040> I

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
it's kind of kind of weird but uh yeah I

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.890 
it's kind of kind of weird but uh yeah I
think<00:02:39.100> it's<00:02:39.370> just<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.610> light<00:02:39.940> has<00:02:40.300> something

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
think it's just the light has something

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.130 
think it's just the light has something
