00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.349 

now<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> treat<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.250> basically<00:00:29.670> one<00:00:29.910> value<00:00:30.270> which

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
now a treat is basically one value which

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.040 
now a treat is basically one value which
I've<00:00:30.750> talked<00:00:31.260> about<00:00:31.500> earlier<00:00:32.390> but<00:00:33.390> there's

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
I've talked about earlier but there's

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.170 
I've talked about earlier but there's
gonna<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.380> value<00:00:34.710> shifts<00:00:35.070> within<00:00:35.250> there<00:00:35.640> very

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
gonna be value shifts within there very

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.600 
gonna be value shifts within there very
slight<00:00:36.680> and<00:00:37.680> also<00:00:38.070> there's<00:00:38.250> gonna<00:00:38.370> be

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
slight and also there's gonna be

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.360 
slight and also there's gonna be
temperature<00:00:39.210> shifts<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:40.260> gonna<00:00:40.410> shift<00:00:40.710> from

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.030 

cooler<00:00:44.370> at<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.760> top<00:00:45.089> and<00:00:45.510> that's<00:00:46.410> even<00:00:46.800> warmer

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
cooler at the top and that's even warmer

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.490 
cooler at the top and that's even warmer
at<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.160> bottom<00:00:47.600> now<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.660> reason<00:00:49.019> for<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.290> is

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
at the bottom now the reason for this is

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.610 
at the bottom now the reason for this is
that<00:00:49.710> all<00:00:50.010> these<00:00:50.220> other<00:00:51.260> trees<00:00:52.260> everything

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that all these other trees everything

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.950 
that all these other trees everything
reflecting<00:00:53.220> warm<00:00:53.430> light<00:00:53.670> back<00:00:53.940> into<00:00:54.390> here<00:00:54.690> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
reflecting warm light back into here and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.790 
reflecting warm light back into here and
up<00:00:55.170> here

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
up here

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.990 
up here
the<00:00:56.670> sky<00:00:56.970> is<00:00:57.300> reflecting<00:00:57.870> into<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:59.000> because

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the sky is reflecting into this because

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.330 
the sky is reflecting into this because
it's<00:01:00.150> further<00:01:00.449> from<00:01:01.199> these<00:01:01.379> these<00:01:02.039> lighter

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
it's further from these these lighter

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.130 
it's further from these these lighter
reflections<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:05.270> this<00:01:06.270> shadow<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:06.869> will<00:01:06.990> be

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
reflections so this shadow here will be

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.590 
reflections so this shadow here will be
bluish<00:01:07.640> this<00:01:08.640> will<00:01:08.820> be<00:01:08.940> a<00:01:08.970> little<00:01:09.119> bit<00:01:09.240> warmer

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
bluish this will be a little bit warmer

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.139 
bluish this will be a little bit warmer
so<00:01:09.780> I'm<00:01:09.840> gonna<00:01:09.960> mix<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.380> up<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:11.009> was<00:01:11.940> a<00:01:11.970> little

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
so I'm gonna mix this up I was a little

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:14.389 
so I'm gonna mix this up I was a little
purple<00:01:12.509> in<00:01:12.660> it<00:01:12.780> down<00:01:12.930> here<00:01:13.259> possibly<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.280> little

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
purple in it down here possibly a little

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:20.510 
purple in it down here possibly a little
bit<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.869> transparent<00:01:15.869> earth<00:01:15.990> red<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:19.520> over

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
bit of transparent earth red and over

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.040 
bit of transparent earth red and over
here<00:01:20.700> I'll<00:01:20.850> just<00:01:20.880> shift<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.420> value<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:21.840> very

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
here I'll just shift a value it's very

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.719 
here I'll just shift a value it's very
lightly<00:01:22.289> warming<00:01:22.740> them<00:01:22.860> up<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.160> a<00:01:23.340> bit<00:01:23.460> maybe

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
lightly warming them up just a bit maybe

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.669 
lightly warming them up just a bit maybe
put<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> little<00:01:24.300> transparent<00:01:24.929> yellow<00:01:25.080> into<00:01:25.500> it

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
put a little transparent yellow into it

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:37.490 
put a little transparent yellow into it
a<00:01:25.710> little<00:01:25.950> bit<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.190> zinc<00:01:26.759> white<00:01:27.500> how<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.770> it

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.510 

that's<00:01:38.500> gonna<00:01:38.650> look<00:01:38.800> really<00:01:38.860> beautiful<00:01:39.190> on

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
that's gonna look really beautiful on

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.100 
that's gonna look really beautiful on
that<00:01:39.610> purple<00:01:40.210> right<00:01:40.330> up<00:01:40.450> against<00:01:40.690> that<00:01:40.780> yellow

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
that purple right up against that yellow

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.490 
that purple right up against that yellow
-<00:01:42.120> so<00:01:43.120> as<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.360> get<00:01:43.570> up<00:01:43.630> a<00:01:43.720> little<00:01:43.840> higher<00:01:43.990> I<00:01:44.200> want

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
- so as I get up a little higher I want

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.030 
- so as I get up a little higher I want
to<00:01:44.590> shift<00:01:44.890> that<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:46.360> cruel<00:01:46.690> so<00:01:47.140> let's<00:01:47.410> talk<00:01:47.620> a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
to shift that to cruel so let's talk a

00:01:48.040 --> 00:02:07.740 
to shift that to cruel so let's talk a
little<00:01:48.070> bit<00:01:48.370> of<00:01:49.170> greenish<00:01:50.170> blue

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.900 

because<00:02:08.260> color<00:02:09.070> gets<00:02:09.369> in<00:02:09.490> there<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:09.670> might

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
because color gets in there it might

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.580 
because color gets in there it might
warm<00:02:10.180> up<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.450> little<00:02:10.570> bit<00:02:10.720> because<00:02:11.020> there's<00:02:11.320> no

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
warm up a little bit because there's no

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:54.010 
warm up a little bit because there's no
some<00:02:12.360> reflected<00:02:13.360> lights

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.390 

basically<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.850> temperatures<00:02:57.160> more<00:02:58.160> or<00:02:58.280> less

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
basically the temperatures more or less

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.840 
basically the temperatures more or less
roughed<00:02:58.670> in<00:02:58.910> correctly<00:03:00.160> one<00:03:01.160> thing<00:03:01.400> about<00:03:01.670> it

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
roughed in correctly one thing about it

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.390 
roughed in correctly one thing about it
is<00:03:01.970> this<00:03:02.180> this<00:03:02.570> spot<00:03:03.440> up<00:03:03.590> here<00:03:03.860> probably<00:03:04.100> has

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
is this this spot up here probably has

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.610 
is this this spot up here probably has
gone<00:03:04.640> too<00:03:04.880> dark

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
gone too dark

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.900 
gone too dark
does<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.740> sky<00:03:07.750> reflections<00:03:08.750> gonna<00:03:08.990> be<00:03:09.200> a

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
does the sky reflections gonna be a

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.010 
does the sky reflections gonna be a
little<00:03:10.910> bit<00:03:11.180> more<00:03:12.160> subdued

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
little bit more subdued

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.570 
little bit more subdued
it'll<00:03:15.020> get<00:03:15.170> darker<00:03:15.590> as<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.740> gets<00:03:15.920> down<00:03:16.100> towards

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
it'll get darker as it gets down towards

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:26.199 
it'll get darker as it gets down towards
the<00:03:16.700> ground<00:03:16.930> darker<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.020> warmer

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:36.930 

the<00:03:26.689> sky<00:03:26.930> color<00:03:27.319> back<00:03:27.620> into<00:03:28.069> here

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.730 

now<00:03:37.450> we're<00:03:37.570> getting<00:03:37.960> quite<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.170> bit<00:03:38.320> of<00:03:38.440> texture

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
now we're getting quite a bit of texture

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.770 
now we're getting quite a bit of texture
so<00:03:39.070> we<00:03:39.160> need<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.490> we<00:03:39.970> need<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.150> get<00:03:40.330> rid<00:03:40.450> of<00:03:40.600> some

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
so we need to we need to get rid of some

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.290 
so we need to we need to get rid of some
of<00:03:40.810> that<00:03:40.990> this<00:03:41.230> is<00:03:41.440> a<00:03:41.650> little<00:03:42.610> painful<00:03:42.850> but

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
of that this is a little painful but

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.650 
of that this is a little painful but
necessary<00:03:46.300> I<00:03:49.170> can<00:03:50.170> use<00:03:50.320> this<00:03:51.240> to<00:03:52.240> put<00:03:52.480> back

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
necessary I can use this to put back

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:59.130 
necessary I can use this to put back
some<00:03:52.930> color<00:03:53.470> into<00:03:53.770> here<00:03:57.570> especially<00:03:58.570> on<00:03:59.050> my

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
some color into here especially on my

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:25.990 
some color into here especially on my
dark<00:03:59.440> side<00:04:00.150> really

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.760 

well<00:04:26.540> I<00:04:26.600> have<00:04:26.750> this<00:04:26.870> treaty<00:04:27.230> basically

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
well I have this treaty basically

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.940 
well I have this treaty basically
blocked<00:04:28.010> in<00:04:28.280> here<00:04:28.580> and<00:04:29.500> Michigan<00:04:30.500> see<00:04:30.680> it's

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
blocked in here and Michigan see it's

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.220 
blocked in here and Michigan see it's
got<00:04:31.100> some<00:04:31.130> Purple's<00:04:31.940> here<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.510> the<00:04:33.020> lighter

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
got some Purple's here and the lighter

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.610 
got some Purple's here and the lighter
blues<00:04:33.530> up<00:04:33.740> here<00:04:34.180> so<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.630> basic<00:04:35.960> concept<00:04:36.110> is

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.730 
blues up here so the basic concept is
I'm<00:04:36.860> trying<00:04:37.040> to<00:04:37.190> shift<00:04:37.580> my<00:04:37.850> temperatures<00:04:38.420> and

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.920 

John<00:04:42.740> Ruskin<00:04:43.010> said<00:04:43.460> that<00:04:43.640> any<00:04:43.790> patch<00:04:44.510> of<00:04:44.720> paint

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
John Ruskin said that any patch of paint

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.980 
John Ruskin said that any patch of paint
that<00:04:45.080> has<00:04:45.200> a<00:04:45.230> ship<00:04:45.950> of<00:04:46.190> hue<00:04:47.120> or<00:04:47.330> value<00:04:47.750> and<00:04:47.900> it

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
that has a ship of hue or value and it

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.170 
that has a ship of hue or value and it
is<00:04:48.110> it's<00:04:48.800> more<00:04:49.010> beautiful<00:04:49.160> and<00:04:49.610> I<00:04:49.670> tend<00:04:50.150> to

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
is it's more beautiful and I tend to

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.110 
is it's more beautiful and I tend to
agree<00:04:50.270> with<00:04:50.570> that<00:04:51.400> no<00:04:52.400> we're<00:04:52.730> getting<00:04:52.820> ready

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
agree with that no we're getting ready

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.760 
agree with that no we're getting ready
to<00:04:53.300> do<00:04:53.420> the<00:04:53.540> road<00:04:53.780> and<00:04:56.230> roads<00:04:57.230> can<00:04:57.410> be<00:04:57.470> a<00:04:57.560> little

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
to do the road and roads can be a little

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.130 
to do the road and roads can be a little
tricky<00:04:58.130> because<00:04:58.250> you<00:04:59.090> have<00:04:59.120> a<00:04:59.240> shadow<00:04:59.600> written

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
tricky because you have a shadow written

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.450 
tricky because you have a shadow written
that<00:05:00.230> looks<00:05:00.380> very<00:05:00.560> very<00:05:00.680> dark

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
that looks very very dark

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.950 
that looks very very dark
now<00:05:01.790> I'm<00:05:01.880> gonna<00:05:02.090> probably<00:05:02.330> go<00:05:02.720> ahead<00:05:02.870> and

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
now I'm gonna probably go ahead and

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.660 
now I'm gonna probably go ahead and
paint<00:05:03.140> it<00:05:03.290> dark<00:05:03.560> and<00:05:03.860> then<00:05:04.040> we'll<00:05:04.220> adjust<00:05:04.460> that

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
paint it dark and then we'll adjust that

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.720 
paint it dark and then we'll adjust that
later<00:05:05.380> in<00:05:06.380> fact<00:05:06.710> everything<00:05:07.160> here<00:05:07.400> looks<00:05:07.430> a

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
later in fact everything here looks a

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.220 
later in fact everything here looks a
little<00:05:07.820> raw<00:05:09.100> will<00:05:10.100> be<00:05:10.250> adjusted<00:05:10.990> so<00:05:11.990> that's

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
little raw will be adjusted so that's

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.460 
little raw will be adjusted so that's
what's<00:05:12.830> so<00:05:12.980> great<00:05:13.220> about<00:05:13.840> this<00:05:14.840> technique<00:05:15.290> is

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
what's so great about this technique is

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.080 
what's so great about this technique is
that<00:05:15.500> you<00:05:15.680> can<00:05:15.890> really<00:05:16.070> have<00:05:16.340> a<00:05:16.370> lot<00:05:16.640> of<00:05:16.850> time

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
that you can really have a lot of time

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.990 
that you can really have a lot of time
to<00:05:17.240> think<00:05:17.420> about<00:05:17.570> things<00:05:18.020> adjust<00:05:18.500> things<00:05:19.000> and

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
to think about things adjust things and

00:05:20.000 --> 00:06:12.560 
to think about things adjust things and
get<00:05:20.180> things<00:05:20.390> right

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.300 

that's<00:06:13.170> the<00:06:13.320> first<00:06:13.560> half<00:06:13.800> of<00:06:14.070> the

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
that's the first half of the

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.780 
that's the first half of the
entertaining<00:06:15.270> and<00:06:15.990> I'm<00:06:16.290> fairly<00:06:17.130> pleased<00:06:17.520> with

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
entertaining and I'm fairly pleased with

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:18.850 
entertaining and I'm fairly pleased with
it

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
it

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.860 
it
there's<00:06:19.860> some<00:06:20.100> trouble<00:06:20.850> spots<00:06:21.240> here<00:06:21.600> these

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
there's some trouble spots here these

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.290 
there's some trouble spots here these
are<00:06:22.080> these<00:06:22.350> are<00:06:22.740> two<00:06:22.920> high<00:06:23.070> chroma<00:06:23.400> a<00:06:23.790> little

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
are these are two high chroma a little

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.660 
are these are two high chroma a little
too<00:06:24.420> dark<00:06:24.660> and<00:06:25.470> then<00:06:26.040> this<00:06:26.160> has<00:06:26.340> gotten<00:06:26.610> a

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:26.670 
too dark and then this has gotten a

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.780 
too dark and then this has gotten a
little<00:06:26.730> too<00:06:27.030> flat<00:06:27.450> and<00:06:27.480> it<00:06:27.870> looks<00:06:28.080> a<00:06:28.200> little

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:28.790 
little too flat and it looks a little

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.270 
little too flat and it looks a little
like<00:06:29.790> a<00:06:29.820> bill<00:06:30.300> we<00:06:30.800> knowing<00:06:31.800> sheet<00:06:32.130> or

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
like a bill we knowing sheet or

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.790 
like a bill we knowing sheet or
something<00:06:32.310> so<00:06:33.020> there's<00:06:34.020> definitely<00:06:34.200> problems

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
something so there's definitely problems

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.750 
something so there's definitely problems
here<00:06:35.070> but<00:06:35.280> I've<00:06:36.270> come<00:06:36.540> through<00:06:37.020> and<00:06:37.760> flattened

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
here but I've come through and flattened

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.040 
here but I've come through and flattened
most<00:06:38.970> of<00:06:39.150> paint<00:06:39.390> as<00:06:40.190> well<00:06:41.190> and<00:06:42.180> I<00:06:42.300> can<00:06:42.480> still<00:06:42.750> I

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
most of paint as well and I can still I

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.010 
most of paint as well and I can still I
can<00:06:43.200> scrape<00:06:43.470> it<00:06:44.240> when<00:06:45.240> I<00:06:45.330> come<00:06:45.570> in<00:06:45.720> next

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
can scrape it when I come in next

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.050 
can scrape it when I come in next
session<00:06:46.280> now<00:06:47.280> what<00:06:47.430> I'm<00:06:47.520> gonna<00:06:47.610> do<00:06:47.820> is<00:06:47.910> I'm

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
session now what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.410 
session now what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna<00:06:48.150> let<00:06:48.300> this<00:06:48.450> dry<00:06:48.810> and<00:06:49.800> then<00:06:50.270> we'll<00:06:51.270> do

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.420 
gonna let this dry and then we'll do

00:06:51.420 --> 00:07:11.279 
gonna let this dry and then we'll do
part<00:06:51.660> two

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:11.289
