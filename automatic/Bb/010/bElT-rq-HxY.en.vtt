00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.499
 in terms of group in terms of 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:12.440
 be meaningful their couple 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.900
 I ask the players so I'm often told about a match and forced him to 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.859
 the image of the couple 6 8 th time 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.210
 cissé 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.140
 it's really the sport we did 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.489
 that's why surpassing is strong enough to help them 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:27.949
 the stroke of madness blood shots 2 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:28.850
 power 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.419
 so that's done 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.210
 I think that that represents the idea of ​​football in a match 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.470
 like that and 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.470
 because c sale 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.890
 like stone his own it amazed me so why do it 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.620
 school not like that 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.180
 d 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.230
 young mothers 6 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.400
 it's not building years 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.550
 it is obvious 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.380
 actually from 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.680
 to do the best possible assisted suicide finally different there is 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.580
 nothing is considerable 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.900
 in view of what we did in the shelters that is so it will be 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.450
 good it's true that it's a complicated match in addition to sport 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.850
 they still need 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.600
 traffic at her 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.750
 hesitations in this competition I mean 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.530
 we know that the task is difficult it is obvious m these oars the matter the comic 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.689
 it's a good sport that's me one point and three shots 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.070
 that none the same this competition the goal for me 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.190
 for myself why the same court is here 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.890
 so we were there 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.890
 recognize that iran throughout my people 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.070
 purpose of the guardian and tax till I dispose 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.380
 married pasquet and searched or for campos 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.549
 the injured each time a purchase that every season at every scene the vespa 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:01.610
 every day 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.810
 every game 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.960
 I do not have it like that and I have 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.559
 d the first to arrive 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:11.559
 children 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.429
 and because it's 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:17.839
 sagemcom best 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.469
 I do not really like mom 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.919
 etc little by little each time a club in respect of oneself 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:26.189
 each 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.389
 the little things with details 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:33.919
 for that I have corner point Lyon all in his famous way 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:36.279
 otherwise winter 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:38.049
 weather 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.049
 note that the hardest drive 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.839
 it was faster and others who speak a little more I always 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:45.129
 thought kiki progress 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.299
 but I always told him every time you had a good match 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.419
 each time the team was very supportive this study made us the 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:52.420
 stops that needed 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.439
 in fact that he was able to maccabi 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.469
 on average for Turkish cities to a team and players 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.910
 there is a big employment pole allying carmona is not finished he will do the 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.580
 difference because the IT team is asking us the same 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.910
 to help the individualities not come out while it can be all 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.419
 likewise it can be 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.219
 tomorrow in the middle east 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.599
 in the momentum in France sees that steph 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.599
 heyer 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.869
 with so little 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.309
 is that the senior team 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:34.989
 Japanese dd had avoided gc 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.989
 what is it and the territories 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:42.979
 but that's my way he entrusts well because in front of the go the weight of 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.079
 French 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.419
 many is enough 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:50.449
 the warrant was coming to term that the corps commander he passed 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:56.249
 yesterday g he's happy for him because the advanced 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.660
 if the state does not act to you 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.539
 I start to pass 

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:04.089
 mazette it is noticeable all this 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:09.499
 for Marc through the performance of the whole team here are the teammates 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.709
 killer 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:12.859
 it's true he's gay 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.180
 the idea was too much for the occasion for may or m 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:18.729
 he is always the same 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.799
 an intervention window the zip line 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.189
 and who says they use 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:27.619
 and now to the winged shuai peng in 40 years - in a hell why are you 

00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:30.349
 I loved to reform games 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.429
 I think we found this dynamic thesis good but victories but 

00:04:34.429 --> 00:04:36.490
 by the way badly gb 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.180
 and there we spend these last days to do when we see 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.180
 montpellier 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.800
 the possible things 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.800
 package the best possible to put the match 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.559
 6 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:52.559
 it's 4 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.479
 and that's okay 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.150
 to conclude 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.479
 and if we are going to write it is obvious 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:11.669
 why do you like me a bit like that so that's why at court 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:14.590
 the country 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.279
 Ansa 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.789
 to by
