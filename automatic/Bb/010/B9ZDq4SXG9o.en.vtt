00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
recently at least and yeah so this game

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.980 
recently at least and yeah so this game
expects<00:01:30.000> something<00:01:30.119> really<00:01:30.450> good<00:01:30.600> because

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
expects something really good because

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.210 
expects something really good because
it's<00:01:31.380> gonna<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> really<00:01:31.950> close<00:01:32.189> game

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
it's gonna be a really close game

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.600 
it's gonna be a really close game
guaranteed<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:34.009> yeah<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.280> that's<00:01:35.460> basically

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
guaranteed and yeah so that's basically

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.520 
guaranteed and yeah so that's basically
and<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.270> pylon<00:01:36.509> was<00:01:36.750> made<00:01:36.930> there<00:01:37.110> because<00:01:37.380> if

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
and that pylon was made there because if

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.380 
and that pylon was made there because if
his<00:01:37.650> /<00:01:37.920> darts<00:01:38.130> carted<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:38.640> then<00:01:39.270> he

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
his / darts carted there then he

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.370 
his / darts carted there then he
probably<00:01:39.570> would<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.869> thought<00:01:40.020> okay<00:01:40.350> he's

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
probably would have thought okay he's

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.719 
probably would have thought okay he's
making<00:01:40.740> his<00:01:40.829> pile<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.159> there<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.579> he<00:01:41.670> doesn't

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
making his pile on there so he doesn't

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.819 
making his pile on there so he doesn't
have<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.030> scout<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.079> doesn't<00:01:43.409> Scout<00:01:43.649> my

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
have to scout so I doesn't Scout my

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.980 
have to scout so I doesn't Scout my
actual<00:01:44.250> base<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.670> he's<00:01:44.759> are<00:01:44.970> gonna<00:01:45.119> assume

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
actual base and he's are gonna assume

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.510 
actual base and he's are gonna assume
that<00:01:46.200> I'm<00:01:46.320> over<00:01:46.500> there<00:01:46.680> because<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> pot

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
that I'm over there because I have a pot

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.780 
that I'm over there because I have a pot
on<00:01:47.549> there<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.259> so<00:01:49.259> yeah<00:01:49.500> that's<00:01:50.220> why<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.430> milk

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
on there and so yeah that's why I milk

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.600 
on there and so yeah that's why I milk
that's<00:01:51.240> why<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.479> made<00:01:51.780> my<00:01:51.990> pile<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:53.310> but

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
that's why I made my pile on there but

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.190 
that's why I made my pile on there but
then<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.790> realized<00:01:54.420> his<00:01:54.570> overload<00:01:54.899> went<00:01:55.079> this

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
then I realized his overload went this

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.600 
then I realized his overload went this
way<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.409> scout<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:55.890> then<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.130> canceled<00:01:56.520> it

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
way to scout so then I canceled it

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.249 
way to scout so then I canceled it
because<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.509> would<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.659> completely<00:01:57.840> useless

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
because it would be completely useless

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.350 
because it would be completely useless
and<00:01:59.130> he<00:01:59.280> did<00:01:59.430> triple<00:01:59.759> hash<00:01:59.909> that's<00:02:00.180> why<00:02:00.299> I'm

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
and he did triple hash that's why I'm

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.880 
and he did triple hash that's why I'm
going<00:02:00.570> gateway<00:02:00.869> first<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.619> thing<00:02:01.770> with

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
going gateway first and the thing with

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.230 
going gateway first and the thing with
gateway<00:02:02.070> first<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.700> can<00:02:02.850> get<00:02:02.969> my<00:02:03.060> gas

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
gateway first is I can get my gas

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.959 
gateway first is I can get my gas
extremely<00:02:04.049> early<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:05.219> also<00:02:05.369> means<00:02:05.579> i

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
extremely early and that also means i

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.229 
extremely early and that also means i
can<00:02:06.259> attack<00:02:07.259> barrier<00:02:07.619> lee<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.099> hehe<00:02:08.879> text<00:02:09.179> a

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
can attack barrier lee and hehe text a

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.699 
can attack barrier lee and hehe text a
lot<00:02:09.390> later<00:02:09.599> than<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.899> do<00:02:09.959> because<00:02:10.170> he<00:02:10.440> gets<00:02:10.619> his

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
lot later than I do because he gets his

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.180 
lot later than I do because he gets his
pool<00:02:10.920> later<00:02:11.209> sorry<00:02:12.209> he<00:02:12.390> he

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
pool later sorry he he

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.440 
pool later sorry he he
I<00:02:13.220> don't<00:02:13.400> have<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.610> get<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.760> voyage<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.180> do<00:02:14.240> have

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
I don't have to get a voyage I do have

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.820 
I don't have to get a voyage I do have
to<00:02:14.570> get<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.720> forge<00:02:14.990> but<00:02:15.170> it's<00:02:15.320> only<00:02:15.410> later<00:02:15.560> on

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
to get a forge but it's only later on

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.580 
to get a forge but it's only later on
and<00:02:16.070> so<00:02:16.880> yeah<00:02:17.060> that's<00:02:17.300> what<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.900> usefulness

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
and so yeah that's what the usefulness

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.160 
and so yeah that's what the usefulness
of<00:02:18.890> getting<00:02:19.420> that's<00:02:20.420> what<00:02:20.660> you<00:02:20.750> do<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.930> fair

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
of getting that's what you do a fair

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.450 
of getting that's what you do a fair
point<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:21.500> triple<00:02:21.680> expands<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.130> rather<00:02:22.280> than

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
point and triple expands you rather than

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.550 
point and triple expands you rather than
getting<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.730> forge<00:02:22.990> you<00:02:23.990> can<00:02:24.110> get<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.260> gateway

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
getting a forge you can get a gateway

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.050 
getting a forge you can get a gateway
first<00:02:24.800> because<00:02:25.040> you're<00:02:25.160> perfectly<00:02:25.640> safe<00:02:25.700> from

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
first because you're perfectly safe from

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.290 
first because you're perfectly safe from
speedlings<00:02:26.720> or<00:02:26.960> zerglings<00:02:27.440> of<00:02:27.530> any<00:02:27.650> sort<00:02:27.920> and

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
speedlings or zerglings of any sort and

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.210 
speedlings or zerglings of any sort and
yeah<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:29.630> that's<00:02:30.110> basically<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.950> now<00:02:31.070> i'm

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
yeah so that's basically it and now i'm

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.100 
yeah so that's basically it and now i'm
getting<00:02:31.370> my<00:02:31.670> gas<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.420> as<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.630> examine<00:02:32.810> have<00:02:33.080> a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
getting my gas and as you examine have a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.440 
getting my gas and as you examine have a
early<00:02:33.380> gasps<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:34.700> game<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:35.150> have

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
early gasps and this game I have

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.840 
early gasps and this game I have
practiced<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.350> new<00:02:36.500> build<00:02:36.770> called<00:02:37.220> say<00:02:37.490> river

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
practiced a new build called say river

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.640 
practiced a new build called say river
except<00:02:38.240> it's<00:02:38.390> like<00:02:38.540> an<00:02:38.750> updated<00:02:39.200> version<00:02:39.230> it's

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
except it's like an updated version it's

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.110 
except it's like an updated version it's
not<00:02:39.830> like<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.130> other<00:02:40.250> gay<00:02:40.520> one<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:40.880> I<00:02:40.940> had

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
not like the other gay one that I had

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.060 
not like the other gay one that I had
that<00:02:41.360> were<00:02:41.960> that<00:02:42.260> fair<00:02:42.620> we<00:02:42.740> were<00:02:42.770> actually

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
that were that fair we were actually

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.370 
that were that fair we were actually
it's<00:02:43.400> good<00:02:43.730> i<00:02:43.940> guess<00:02:44.180> but<00:02:44.450> it's<00:02:44.870> really<00:02:45.140> risky

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
it's good i guess but it's really risky

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.650 
it's good i guess but it's really risky
and<00:02:45.770> this<00:02:46.340> area<00:02:46.640> is<00:02:46.910> gonna<00:02:47.150> be<00:02:47.270> a<00:02:47.300> lot<00:02:47.450> better

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
and this area is gonna be a lot better

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.020 
and this area is gonna be a lot better
because<00:02:47.990> well<00:02:48.920> i<00:02:48.950> did<00:02:49.340> this<00:02:49.520> is<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.790> one<00:02:49.940> I've

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
because well i did this is the one I've

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.640 
because well i did this is the one I've
been<00:02:50.060> practicing<00:02:50.600> for<00:02:50.630> weeks<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.140> months<00:02:51.440> and

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
been practicing for weeks and months and

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.050 
been practicing for weeks and months and
this<00:02:52.040> is<00:02:52.190> gonna<00:02:52.280> be<00:02:52.430> this<00:02:52.550> is<00:02:52.610> basically<00:02:52.940> my

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
this is gonna be this is basically my

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.810 
this is gonna be this is basically my
new<00:02:53.780> builder<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.650> I'm<00:02:55.070> not<00:02:55.220> hiding<00:02:55.370> much<00:02:55.640> in

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
new builder and I'm not hiding much in

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.040 
new builder and I'm not hiding much in
this<00:02:55.940> game<00:02:56.120> actually<00:02:56.360> I<00:02:56.570> don't<00:02:56.840> think<00:02:56.990> I'm

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
this game actually I don't think I'm

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.530 
this game actually I don't think I'm
hiding<00:02:57.170> anything<00:02:57.500> in<00:02:57.710> this<00:02:57.800> game<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:58.340> yeah

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
hiding anything in this game so yeah

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.120 
hiding anything in this game so yeah
this<00:02:59.540> is<00:02:59.720> like<00:02:59.870> my<00:03:00.080> peak<00:03:00.290> performance<00:03:00.830> overall

and protoss zerg is my best matchup so

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.130 
and protoss zerg is my best matchup so
this<00:03:04.550> is<00:03:04.880> like<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.120> best<00:03:05.240> I<00:03:05.420> can<00:03:05.480> ever<00:03:05.690> do<00:03:05.870> so

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
this build takes a lot of APM but yeah

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.960 
this build takes a lot of APM but yeah
as<00:03:42.440> you<00:03:42.500> can<00:03:42.560> see<00:03:42.739> his<00:03:42.950> my<00:03:43.280> scouting<00:03:43.550> probe<00:03:43.760> did

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
die but I didn't get much scouts except

I got everything I needed and with this

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.770 
I got everything I needed and with this
build<00:03:48.680> I'll<00:03:48.980> get<00:03:49.280> quick<00:03:49.640> overview<00:03:49.940> of<00:03:50.090> it<00:03:50.330> you

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
build I'll get quick overview of it you

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.900 
build I'll get quick overview of it you
get<00:03:51.019> to<00:03:51.590> strike<00:03:51.860> a<00:03:52.010> Stargate<00:03:52.519> and<00:03:52.640> then<00:03:52.820> you

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
get to strike a Stargate and then you

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.580 
get to strike a Stargate and then you
get<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.060> rowboat<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:53.600> then<00:03:54.110> with<00:03:54.260> your<00:03:54.350> next

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
get a rowboat and then with your next

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.800 
get a rowboat and then with your next
150<00:03:54.860> gasps<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.310> got<00:03:55.430> another<00:03:55.790> Stargate<00:03:56.120> yes

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
150 gasps you got another Stargate yes

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.330 
150 gasps you got another Stargate yes
you<00:03:56.930> get<00:03:57.080> to<00:03:57.110> stargates<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.040> reason<00:03:58.310> for

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
you get to stargates and the reason for

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.210 
you get to stargates and the reason for
this<00:03:58.610> is<00:03:58.820> because<00:03:59.440> with<00:04:00.440> two<00:04:00.470> strikes<00:04:00.650> you

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
this is because with two strikes you

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.620 
this is because with two strikes you
don't<00:04:01.370> have<00:04:01.489> to<00:04:01.580> be<00:04:01.670> afraid<00:04:01.760> of<00:04:01.910> muralists<00:04:02.450> and

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
don't have to be afraid of muralists and

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.660 
don't have to be afraid of muralists and
only<00:04:03.080> hydralisk<00:04:03.500> spin<00:04:03.890> you<00:04:04.100> get<00:04:04.250> like<00:04:04.370> four<00:04:04.610> or

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
only hydralisk spin you get like four or

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.580 
only hydralisk spin you get like four or
five<00:04:04.730> cannons<00:04:05.180> at<00:04:05.300> the<00:04:05.390> front<00:04:05.600> so<00:04:06.110> how<00:04:06.350> you<00:04:06.410> do

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
five cannons at the front so how you do

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.500 
five cannons at the front so how you do
this<00:04:06.709> don't<00:04:06.830> do<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.310> you<00:04:07.340> either<00:04:07.519> and<00:04:07.850> say

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
this don't do to you either and say

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.210 
this don't do to you either and say
basically<00:04:08.810> say<00:04:09.050> from<00:04:09.230> everything<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:10.040> only

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
basically say from everything the only

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.009 
basically say from everything the only
thing<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:10.580> this<00:04:10.910> build<00:04:11.150> is<00:04:11.300> weak<00:04:11.510> against<00:04:11.900> is

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
thing that this build is weak against is

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.479 
thing that this build is weak against is
the<00:04:12.170> liquor<00:04:12.410> drop<00:04:12.650> because<00:04:12.830> like<00:04:13.070> a<00:04:13.100> drunk<00:04:13.370> and
