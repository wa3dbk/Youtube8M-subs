00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:13.749
 the secret is the light those reflections that emphasize the shapes they bring into 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.539
 highlight the rhythm of a metropolitan architectural structure 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.320
 these are the characteristics that a photo shoot must have for 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.640
 being able to strike in the heart and this assumption was inspired by the competition 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.780
 photographic images of architecture in the world 2008 in search of the soul 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.750
 vibrant beautiful cities of the world images architecture in the world this second 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.620
 edition 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.640
 is coming to an end in this these days 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.310
 gmail contest started towards appearing and then we collected something like 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:54.010
 600 images of architecture images the mind very different places very very much 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.500
 different settings very different from in contemporary architecture 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.500
 especially if 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.510
 giometti structural up and down colors 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.080
 every building every culture every design detail lives to express 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.680
 the essence of a form 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.200
 but the ability to grasp this essence lies above all in which it looks in whom 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.120
 photographs as underlined by the jury president of the last edition of 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.290
 competition even if there are precise strategies to be implemented 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.260
 excellent condition be perfect I lose a lot of time in the selection 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.560
 the frame 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.259
 for the digital with whom we all work, almost always surrendered 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.710
 simpler aspects of controlling dichotomous exposure 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.160
 rm relationship with light 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.820
 rent I would say that the fundamental thing is that being able to make a good one 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.950
 selection of the point of view and consequently of the framing 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.630
 final on which I work a lot in post production 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.329
 they are very different from each other I run away 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:19.119
 in some the creature that can be recognized in others are very effective shots 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:22.119
 very busy moves 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:27.859
 where the building itself is practically unrecognizable in three 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:32.539
 with the spirit of architecture the building that is ahahah in the foreground 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:37.329
 however some aspects of architecture pharmacists in the foreground 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:51.349
 travel to get to know the city from a different perspective 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.950
 this is the spirit that animates the designer architects with the suitcase 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.280
 perpetually ready to search for new ideas and stimuli 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.209
 hentay the most beautiful part of my professional experience a thousand thousand 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.259
 be free to choose 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:12.059
 release objects and within an urban structure or that of 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:16.219
 confront myself with projects of the highest level made two facts of the 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.289
 most important architects of our history 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:24.299
 and certainly one of the gifts I managed to make in my view
