00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
getting confused with the writing and

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.290 
getting confused with the writing and

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
before I kind of express my opinions on

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.270 
before I kind of express my opinions on
her<00:02:29.180> writing<00:02:29.540> style<00:02:29.570> but<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.530> definitely<00:02:30.770> think

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
her writing style but I definitely think

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.430 
her writing style but I definitely think
the<00:02:31.460> story<00:02:31.700> is<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:31.940> fascinating<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:32.900> got

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
things were going to develop so I really

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.710
