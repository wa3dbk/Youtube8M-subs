00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.319 
and this tweak is called big if I so big
if<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.600> allows<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.739> pretty<00:00:35.670> much<00:00:35.790> rotate

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
if I allows you to pretty much rotate

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.410 
if I allows you to pretty much rotate
your<00:00:36.480> icons<00:00:36.870> make<00:00:37.170> them<00:00:37.350> transparent<00:00:38.420> take

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
your icons make them transparent take

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.200 
your icons make them transparent take
away<00:00:39.629> icon<00:00:39.989> labels<00:00:40.469> rotate<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.520> badges<00:00:41.940> just

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
away icon labels rotate the badges just

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.479 
away icon labels rotate the badges just
like<00:00:42.329> my<00:00:42.510> C<00:00:42.750> minor<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.230> made<00:00:43.649> my<00:00:43.770> icons<00:00:44.100> small

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
like my C minor I made my icons small

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.639 
like my C minor I made my icons small
I'm<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.730> term<00:00:44.910> rotated<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.690> took<00:00:46.050> off<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.289> icon

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
I'm a term rotated and took off the icon

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.950 
I'm a term rotated and took off the icon
labels<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.270> pretty<00:00:48.450> cool<00:00:48.629> tweak

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
labels so it's just a pretty cool tweak

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.630 
labels so it's just a pretty cool tweak
and<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.320> free<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.829> it's<00:00:49.980> pretty<00:00:50.219> sweet<00:00:50.430> guys

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
and it's free so it's pretty sweet guys

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.119 
and it's free so it's pretty sweet guys
so<00:00:51.329> big<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> fire<00:00:51.809> right<00:00:51.960> here<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.680> your<00:00:52.860> first

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
so big a fire right here so your first

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.799 
so big a fire right here so your first
option<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.730> change<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> rotation<00:00:54.180> angle

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
option you can change the rotation angle

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.439 
option you can change the rotation angle
so<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.170> make<00:00:55.320> them<00:00:55.469> rotate<00:00:55.800> all<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.010> way

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
so you can make them rotate all the way

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.540 
so you can make them rotate all the way
just<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.600> halfway<00:00:57.960> I'll<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:59.010> rotate<00:00:59.340> mine

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
just like halfway I'll just rotate mine

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.160 
just like halfway I'll just rotate mine
like<00:00:59.850> right<00:01:00.180> about<00:01:00.359> there<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:00.960> change

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
like right about there you can change

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.110 
like right about there you can change
the<00:01:01.260> transparency<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> next<00:01:02.670> thing<00:01:02.850> right

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
the transparency in the next thing right

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.630 
the transparency in the next thing right
there<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.530> I'll<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.680> make<00:01:04.860> my<00:01:05.129> pretty

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
transparent so I'll put them right there

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.289 
transparent so I'll put them right there
you<00:01:07.590> can<00:01:07.740> hide<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:07.979> icon<00:01:08.460> label<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.119> keep

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
them on I will hide them you can do the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.820 
them on I will hide them you can do the
scale<00:01:12.720> size<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.500> your<00:01:13.590> icon

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830

really<00:01:14.430> big<00:01:14.610> or<00:01:14.909> really<00:01:14.939> small<00:01:15.299> I'll<00:01:16.049> put<00:01:16.259> mine

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
really big or really small I'll put mine

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.550 
really big or really small I'll put mine
android<00:01:17.640> right<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.270> between<00:01:18.420> or<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.409> even

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
android right in between or you can even

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.830 
android right in between or you can even
put<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.009> default<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.759> how<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.360> usually<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.810> on

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
put it a default so how it usually is on

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.100 
put it a default so how it usually is on
your<00:01:22.229> stock<00:01:22.890> icons<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:24.810> flip<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
your stock icons and you can flip the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.170 
your stock icons and you can flip the
badges<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.740> flips<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.130> around<00:01:26.220> then<00:01:27.090> all

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
badges so that flips it around then all

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.249 
badges so that flips it around then all
you<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.630> restrain<00:01:27.960> your<00:01:28.080> device
