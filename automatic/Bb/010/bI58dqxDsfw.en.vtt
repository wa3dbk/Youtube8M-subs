think a lot of people or maybe expecting

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.310 
think a lot of people or maybe expecting
it<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.239> be<00:00:48.270> set<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.600> future<00:00:48.930> i<00:00:48.989> think<00:00:49.170> some

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
it to be set in the future i think some

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.290 
it to be set in the future i think some
people<00:00:49.590> hoping<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.610> set<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300

people hoping it for it to be set in the
past<00:00:51.510> again<00:00:51.870> because<00:00:52.379> i<00:00:52.469> think<00:00:52.530> kind<00:00:52.829> of

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
past again because i think kind of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.650 
past again because i think kind of
modern<00:00:53.129> warfare<00:00:53.280> 3<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.820> delving<00:00:54.120> into<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660

modern warfare 3 is delving into the
future<00:00:54.930> thing<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> con<00:00:56.489> didn't<00:00:56.760> want

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
future thing so the con didn't want

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.389 
future thing so the con didn't want

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
like the looks of this game as much I

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.640 
like the looks of this game as much I
want<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.829> kind<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.430> not<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:34.409> do

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
want to kind of not like it I just do

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.499 
want to kind of not like it I just do
they've<00:01:35.250> definitely<00:01:35.520> set<00:01:35.970> out<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.329> make<00:01:36.360> a

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
they've definitely set out to make a

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.289 
they've definitely set out to make a
bold<00:01:37.079> new<00:01:37.320> statement<00:01:37.770> about<00:01:37.979> black<00:01:38.640> ops<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.060> I

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
bold new statement about black ops and I

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.640 
bold new statement about black ops and I
think<00:01:39.540> they<00:01:39.659> mean<00:01:39.810> business<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.259> done

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
think they mean business this done

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.200 
think they mean business this done
because<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:41.009> think<00:01:41.250> after<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.729> first<00:01:41.939> black

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
because I think after the first black

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.240 
because I think after the first black
ops<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.659> kinda<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.170> went<00:01:43.530> down<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> bit<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.159> a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
ops it kinda like went down a bit of a

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.050 
ops it kinda like went down a bit of a
failure<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.270> community<00:01:46.159> however<00:01:47.159> they've

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
failure in the community however they've

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
doing I'm sure that that's not real and

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.970 
doing I'm sure that that's not real and
it's<00:05:08.370> probably<00:05:08.640> made<00:05:08.940> up<00:05:09.150> but<00:05:09.930> anyway<00:05:10.230> um<00:05:10.500> this

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
it's probably made up but anyway um this

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.310 
it's probably made up but anyway um this
is<00:05:11.160> real<00:05:11.370> it's<00:05:12.150> a<00:05:12.270> building<00:05:12.690> that's<00:05:12.840> falling

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
is real it's a building that's falling

is real it's a building that's falling
down<00:05:13.560> that<00:05:14.340> is<00:05:14.460> real<00:05:15.320> what<00:05:16.320> relevance<00:05:16.800> it<00:05:16.980> has

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
down that is real what relevance it has

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.450 
down that is real what relevance it has
to<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:17.790> game<00:05:18.000> or<00:05:18.390> actually<00:05:19.260> making<00:05:20.040> the<00:05:20.220> game

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
to the game or actually making the game

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.390 
to the game or actually making the game
look<00:05:20.730> good<00:05:21.000> I<00:05:21.210> have<00:05:21.330> no<00:05:21.540> idea<00:05:21.720> it<00:05:22.230> just<00:05:22.740> shows<00:05:23.010> a

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
look good I have no idea it just shows a

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.720 
look good I have no idea it just shows a
building<00:05:24.120> falling<00:05:24.570> down<00:05:24.960> and<00:05:25.520> that's<00:05:26.520> about

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
building falling down and that's about

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.340 
building falling down and that's about
it<00:05:26.940> and<00:05:27.419> I'm<00:05:27.720> not<00:05:27.900> going<00:05:27.990> to<00:05:28.050> make<00:05:28.169> any

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
it and I'm not going to make any

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.120 
it and I'm not going to make any
assumptions<00:05:29.040> that<00:05:29.700> there<00:05:29.910> are<00:05:29.970> going<00:05:30.090> to<00:05:30.180> be

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
assumptions that there are going to be

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.440 
assumptions that there are going to be
destructible<00:05:32.130> environments<00:05:32.940> because<00:05:33.090> last

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
destructible environments because last

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.230 
destructible environments because last
time<00:05:33.570> I<00:05:33.720> did<00:05:33.930> that<00:05:33.990> there<00:05:34.440> wasn't<00:05:34.620> and<00:05:35.210> quite<00:05:36.210> a

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
time I did that there wasn't and quite a

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.630 
time I did that there wasn't and quite a
lot<00:05:36.360> of<00:05:36.390> people<00:05:36.600> picked<00:05:36.960> up<00:05:37.110> on<00:05:37.260> that<00:05:37.310> so<00:05:38.310> um

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
lot of people picked up on that so um

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.330 
lot of people picked up on that so um
there's<00:05:39.150> definitely<00:05:39.630> no<00:05:40.470> assumptions<00:05:41.040> that

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
there's definitely no assumptions that

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.710 
there's definitely no assumptions that
are<00:05:41.460> going<00:05:41.550> to<00:05:41.610> be<00:05:41.730> destructible<00:05:42.210> environment

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
are going to be destructible environment

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.080 
are going to be destructible environment

sumption<00:06:43.649> but<00:06:43.889> I'm<00:06:44.099> pretty<00:06:44.459> sure<00:06:44.579> that's

00:06:45.049 --> 00:06:45.059 
sumption but I'm pretty sure that's
