00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.150

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.130
 borghi in all the initial order of this 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.290
 selection that closed sampaoli 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.210
 classifying us to the world 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.730

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.490
 iquique sports welcome hello how do you 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.199
 is going good a taste jaime thanks for being 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.900
 hooked with us watching the raffle 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.650
 of the world cup and I wanted your appreciation what 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.910
 you thought Spain holland australia the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.330
 rivals of chile what is your first 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.470
 balance 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:35.980
 good are difficult rivals spain and 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:40.100
 holland are the first level 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.800
 but a nice challenge I think Chile 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.050
 is prepared to face this to 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.760
 these rivals 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.260
 and it would be nice if so good good of 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.809
 encounter and they could move on to the other 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.460
 round on paper is difficult and all the 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.590
 world to say here it was not difficult but 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.960
 you have to play first and I think that 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.840
 Chile 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.229
 has a level to fight with them 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.180
 to face equal the same and in fact 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.950
 it has been shown by the level parties 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.580
 international has had with the 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:16.450
 land with Brazil and good I believe and 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:29.560
 Spain is known because the 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:32.020
 team what is going on in the 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.630
 question is accentuated in australia 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.610
 you have your background on how he plays 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.110
 this selection spain what arch we know 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.890
 and holland also jaime 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.680
 well the authority has never lost its 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:49.280
 condition is so strong teams 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.170
 technician of a strong leg team of 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.390
 very rustic escape 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.369
 of a player who has an air gap but 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.380
 that after a bit the technical basis 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.119
 now I have the last year improved 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.570
 because it has many players how many 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.110
 England 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.500
 in europe in general and that has gone 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.810
 improving its level but I think that this 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.370
 way in jaime I send you a hug and you 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.490
 I appreciate the first balance that 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.440
 you're fine but a very kind talk 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.150
 technical director of iquique what 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.130

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.050
 technical body claudio borghi for 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.600

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.860
 rivals and I want to highlight another one that 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.180

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.890
 in 1998 he was nelson's field assistant 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.790
 Acosta worked there hand in hand with the 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.980
 coach 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.810
 exxon in spanish and I have víctor hugo

 very good víctor hugo wanted to acquire 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.700
 this balance so talk with you to 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.040
 to know what you think of the raffle 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.040
 favorable to pro bad 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.750
 first that group b 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.060
 you got the group of one wanted to scream from 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.620
 the Europeans of the second has to 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.500
 Holland and wanted to avoid me good 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.690
 I wanted to avoid and we landa landed then 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.760
 bad groups is not I think it's a group 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.420
 very complicated 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.430
 almost with the group of death but I 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.890
 I have a lot of faith in the elections that 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.629
 let's see the full glass I share a lot 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.390
 you did not want to take me with holland 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.560
 Spain type is a selection 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.720
 tremendously powerful but we the 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:36.709
 we know and we know how to play Spain 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:38.810
 more than the system of Spain spending not 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:46.099
 has had a lot of change and is a 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:47.930
 important problem but we define it 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.140
 with holland you noticed in the order 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.409
 of orders we define from holland we 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.629
 we have to beat australia 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:59.569
 australia the first game later with 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.600
 Spain I think we can win if I do not 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:07.160
 like it has been neither 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:09.440
 but this and then see how we do with 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.300
 the note but but in the look at the 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.920
 look the technician footballer more 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.690
 beyond the safe global result all 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.690
 we want to move forward and follow is a 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.640
 yellow to a mara a wonder 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.730
 hollanda-españa in the Maracaná river if or 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.730
 do not 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:33.620
 the boy's dream is about 15 kilos and 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:35.300
 you can get political story grateful 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.050
