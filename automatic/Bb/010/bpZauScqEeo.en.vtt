00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.810 
everybody or kind of make clear kind of
clarification<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:52.520> it's<00:00:53.520> not<00:00:53.790> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
clarification is that it's not a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.880 
clarification is that it's not a
four-color<00:00:54.420> dragon<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:56.420> that<00:00:57.420> means<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.829> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
four-color dragon so that means is not a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.270

limited<00:01:02.940> number<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.809> combination<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.710> will

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
limited number of combination that will

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.880 
limited number of combination that will
get<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.579> dragon<00:01:06.119> one<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.079> the<00:01:07.170> combination

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
get this dragon one of the combination

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.039 
get this dragon one of the combination
is<00:01:08.070> using<00:01:08.579> a<00:01:08.700> diamond<00:01:08.969> type<00:01:09.360> dragon<00:01:09.870> and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
another diamond type dragon which will

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.300 
another diamond type dragon which will
give<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.690> an<00:01:12.810> opportunity<00:01:13.110> at<00:01:13.710> getting<00:01:14.190> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
give you an opportunity at getting the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.080 
give you an opportunity at getting the
effect

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
effect

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.300 
effect
now<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.020> good<00:01:16.080> combination<00:01:16.680> probably

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
now is that a good combination probably

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.580 
now is that a good combination probably
not<00:01:17.490> because<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:18.390> random<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.260> can<00:01:19.440> get

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
not because it's random and you can get

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.480 
not because it's random and you can get
any<00:01:19.830> other<00:01:20.010> dragon<00:01:20.930> at<00:01:21.930> time<00:01:22.440> I<00:01:22.890> test<00:01:23.340> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
any other dragon at time I test it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.840 
any other dragon at time I test it
anyways<00:01:23.900> but<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.500> get<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.920> Infinity<00:01:26.430> dragon

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
anyways but to get the Infinity dragon

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.660 
anyways but to get the Infinity dragon
basically<00:01:27.810> well<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.799> guess<00:01:29.130> they<00:01:29.340> kind<00:01:29.580> of

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
basically well I guess they kind of

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.180 
basically well I guess they kind of
promoted<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.810> buy<00:01:31.049> it

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
promoted that you can buy it

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.520 
promoted that you can buy it
because<00:01:32.760> that's<00:01:33.180> what<00:01:33.420> they<00:01:33.570> want<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.409> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
because that's what they want for you to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.780 
because that's what they want for you to
buy<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:35.479> but<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:37.530> get<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.890> Infinity<00:01:38.369> dragon

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
buy it but to get the Infinity dragon

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.149 
buy it but to get the Infinity dragon
the<00:01:39.689> required<00:01:40.470> dragon<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.630> wizard<00:01:42.630> dragon

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
the required dragon is the wizard dragon

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.310 
the required dragon is the wizard dragon
so<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:45.420> biggest<00:01:45.869> joke<00:01:46.670> no<00:01:47.670> other

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
so that is the biggest joke no other

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.700 
so that is the biggest joke no other
dragons<00:01:49.320> out<00:01:49.560> there<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:50.490> give<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.119> an

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
wizard dragon in the combination so the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.580 
wizard dragon in the combination so the
