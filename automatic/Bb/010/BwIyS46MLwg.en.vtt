the<00:00:18.119> idea<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.990> technology<00:00:19.619> you've<00:00:19.770> seen<00:00:20.039> is

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the idea the technology you've seen is

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.210 
the idea the technology you've seen is
rather<00:00:21.000> than<00:00:21.330> wearing<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.350> head-mounted

rather than wearing a head-mounted
display<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.350> that<00:00:25.350> we<00:00:25.529> just<00:00:26.070> have<00:00:26.279> large

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
display and that we just have large

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
screens and we display scenario all

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.659 
screens and we display scenario all
around<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.230> there<00:00:31.590> are<00:00:31.679> three<00:00:31.890> vertical

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
around you so there are three vertical

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.709 
around you so there are three vertical
walls<00:00:33.290> and<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.380> floor<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:35.899> head<00:00:36.899> tracking

view of the environment urine we have a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.979 
view of the environment urine we have a
wide<00:00:46.620> range<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.160> projects<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.809> come

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
wide range of projects and that come

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.200 
wide range of projects and that come
through<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.350> lab<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:50.399> one<00:00:50.430> you've<00:00:50.730> seen<00:00:50.760> as<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
through the lab the one you've seen as a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.939 
through the lab the one you've seen as a
collaboration<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.110> group<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.440> social

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
collaboration with a group of social

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.770 
collaboration with a group of social
psychologists<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.120> collaborate<00:00:54.629> with

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
psychologists but we collaborate with

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
psychologists but we collaborate with
various<00:00:55.140> academic<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:56.010> industrial<00:00:56.250> groups

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
various academic and industrial groups

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.430 
various academic and industrial groups
but<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> background<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.910> all<00:01:00.510> our<00:01:00.960> projects

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
but the background to all our projects

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.939 
but the background to all our projects
are<00:01:01.590> our<00:01:01.710> real<00:01:01.949> interest<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.550> in

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
are our real interest is in

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.679 
are our real interest is in
understanding<00:01:04.949> what<00:01:05.129> makes<00:01:05.460> virtual<00:01:06.210> reality

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
understanding what makes virtual reality

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.590 
understanding what makes virtual reality
work<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.260> trying<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.010> improve<00:01:08.400> how<00:01:09.390> that

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
work and trying to improve how that

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.289 
work and trying to improve how that
works<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.560> there<00:01:10.890> are<00:01:10.920> critical<00:01:11.369> issues<00:01:11.640> such

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
works so there are critical issues such

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.510 
works so there are critical issues such
as<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.290> latency<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.010> head<00:01:14.189> tracking

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
as the the latency of the head tracking

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.429 
as the the latency of the head tracking
see<00:01:14.909> has<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.330> very<00:01:15.509> low<00:01:15.720> latency<00:01:16.229> very

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
see has to be very low latency very

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.320 
see has to be very low latency very
accurate<00:01:16.920> otherwise<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.850> illusion<00:01:18.240> is

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
accurate otherwise the illusion is

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.260 
accurate otherwise the illusion is
destroyed<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.250> you'll<00:01:20.250> seen<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.939> the

this<00:01:57.710> is<00:01:57.890> something's<00:01:58.160> been<00:01:58.370> studied<00:01:58.730> by

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
this is something's been studied by

this is something's been studied by
social<00:01:59.180> to<00:01:59.330> psychologists<00:02:00.050> 49<00:02:00.350> 50<00:02:00.890> years<00:02:01.190> and

social to psychologists 49 50 years and
this<00:02:02.570> is<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.840> idea<00:02:03.230> that<00:02:03.320> it's<00:02:05.320> taking<00:02:06.320> a<00:02:06.350> look

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
this is the idea that it's taking a look

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.650 
this is the idea that it's taking a look
at<00:02:06.710> under<00:02:07.430> what<00:02:07.640> conditions<00:02:08.270> people

at under what conditions people
intervene<00:02:09.410> when<00:02:10.130> they<00:02:10.460> see<00:02:10.520> an<00:02:10.940> attack<00:02:11.480> or<00:02:11.750> an

intervene when they see an attack or an

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
the more people that are around the less

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.140 
the more people that are around the less
chance<00:02:18.830> there<00:02:19.280> is<00:02:19.430> that<00:02:19.700> anyone<00:02:20.000> will

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
chance there is that anyone will

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.390 
chance there is that anyone will
intervene<00:02:20.600> and<00:02:20.900> it's<00:02:21.590> been<00:02:21.740> very<00:02:21.770> hard<00:02:22.190> to

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
intervene and it's been very hard to

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.250 
intervene and it's been very hard to
study<00:02:22.610> this<00:02:22.910> because<00:02:23.330> it's<00:02:23.540> very<00:02:23.660> difficult

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
study this because it's very difficult

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.140 
study this because it's very difficult
you<00:02:24.620> can't<00:02:24.770> set<00:02:25.010> up<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.280> real<00:02:25.430> scenario<00:02:25.970> with

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
you can't set up a real scenario with

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.360 
you can't set up a real scenario with
real<00:02:26.300> people<00:02:26.630> fighting<00:02:27.110> but<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.680> can<00:02:27.770> do<00:02:28.250> this

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
real people fighting but you can do this

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.910 
real people fighting but you can do this
in<00:02:28.580> virtual<00:02:28.910> reality<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.690> it<00:02:30.200> all<00:02:30.350> hinges<00:02:30.650> on

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
in virtual reality and it all hinges on

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.000 
in virtual reality and it all hinges on
our<00:02:31.450> technology<00:02:32.450> working<00:02:32.710> sufficiently<00:02:33.710> well

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
our technology working sufficiently well

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.820 
our technology working sufficiently well
that<00:02:34.520> people<00:02:34.880> do<00:02:35.090> respond<00:02:35.660> as<00:02:35.960> if<00:02:36.380> it's<00:02:36.530> real

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
that people do respond as if it's real

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.460 
that people do respond as if it's real
and<00:02:37.160> this<00:02:37.820> is<00:02:37.940> very<00:02:38.150> important<00:02:38.720> point<00:02:38.990> we

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
and this is very important point we

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.780 
and this is very important point we
don't<00:02:39.560> expect<00:02:39.890> people<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.190> believe<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.700> it

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
don't expect people to believe that it

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.360 
don't expect people to believe that it
is<00:02:40.820> real<00:02:41.270> obviously<00:02:42.080> doesn't<00:02:42.350> look<00:02:42.500> real<00:02:42.710> but

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
is real obviously doesn't look real but

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.000 
is real obviously doesn't look real but
people<00:02:43.700> can<00:02:43.880> respond<00:02:44.270> as<00:02:45.200> if<00:02:45.380> it's<00:02:45.500> real<00:02:45.740> then

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
people can respond as if it's real then

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.150 
people can respond as if it's real then
you<00:02:46.220> can<00:02:46.370> get<00:02:46.550> real<00:02:47.590> experimental<00:02:48.590> data<00:02:48.770> from

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
you can get real experimental data from

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.090 
you can get real experimental data from
this<00:02:49.360> this<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.510> very<00:02:51.200> interesting<00:02:51.380> time<00:02:51.860> for

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
this this is a very interesting time for

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.160 
this this is a very interesting time for
virtual<00:02:52.910> reality<00:02:53.330> research<00:02:53.660> there's<00:02:54.020> a

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
virtual reality research there's a

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.040 
virtual reality research there's a
proliferation<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.400> new<00:02:55.640> low-cost<00:02:56.150> devices

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
proliferation of new low-cost devices

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.770 
proliferation of new low-cost devices
like<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.560> oculus<00:02:58.250> rift<00:02:58.550> Edmodo<00:02:59.000> display<00:02:59.510> and

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
like the oculus rift Edmodo display and

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.730 
like the oculus rift Edmodo display and
Microsoft<00:03:00.560> Kinect<00:03:01.450> tracking<00:03:02.450> system<00:03:02.930> and

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
Microsoft Kinect tracking system and

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.920 
Microsoft Kinect tracking system and
these<00:03:04.190> are<00:03:04.400> enabling<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.240> whole<00:03:05.450> range<00:03:05.720> of

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
these are enabling a whole range of

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.900 
these are enabling a whole range of
research<00:03:06.260> that<00:03:06.320> wasn't<00:03:06.800> possible<00:03:06.980> before<00:03:07.280> and

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
research that wasn't possible before and

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.670 
research that wasn't possible before and
this<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.150> something<00:03:08.360> it's<00:03:08.720> very<00:03:09.020> exciting<00:03:09.500> for

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
this is something it's very exciting for

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.709 
this is something it's very exciting for
us
