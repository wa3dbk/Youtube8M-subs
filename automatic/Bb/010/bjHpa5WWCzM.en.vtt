section that we in the local group kind
of<00:00:29.970> know<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.359> speed<00:00:30.630> ball<00:00:30.840> field<00:00:31.080> that

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
of know is the speed ball field that

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.139 
of know is the speed ball field that
being<00:00:31.890> said<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.279> got<00:00:32.430> nothing<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:32.940> with

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
being said it's got nothing to do with

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.760 
being said it's got nothing to do with
paintball<00:00:33.630> speedball<00:00:34.200> anything<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.739> that

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
paintball speedball anything like that

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.319 
paintball speedball anything like that
obviously<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.550> can<00:00:35.700> tell<00:00:35.850> not<00:00:36.120> many

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
obviously as you can tell not many

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.209 
obviously as you can tell not many
bunkers<00:00:36.780> set<00:00:37.020> up<00:00:37.140> back<00:00:37.350> there<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:37.710> far<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
bunkers set up back there as far as the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.030 
bunkers set up back there as far as the
inflatable<00:00:38.820> ones<00:00:39.000> go<00:00:39.239> however<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.680> just

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
inflatable ones go however it's just

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.139 
inflatable ones go however it's just
kind<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.340> name<00:00:41.489> we've<00:00:41.670> given<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.030> it

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
kind of the name we've given to it

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.240 
kind of the name we've given to it
because<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.600> faster<00:00:43.079> paced<00:00:43.350> closer<00:00:43.800> quarter

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
because the faster paced closer quarter

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.920 
because the faster paced closer quarter
games<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.640> take<00:00:44.760> place<00:00:44.940> here<00:00:45.059> essentially

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
games that take place here essentially

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.569 
games that take place here essentially
essentially<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.039> kind<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.309> closer

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
essentially it's just kind of a closer

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.369 
essentially it's just kind of a closer
scattered<00:00:48.180> bunker<00:00:48.600> style<00:00:48.870> feel<00:00:49.110> what<00:00:49.289> you

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
scattered bunker style feel what you

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.810 
scattered bunker style feel what you
guys<00:00:49.500> will<00:00:49.739> be<00:00:49.800> seeing<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.430> second

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
guys will be seeing in just a second

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.700 
guys will be seeing in just a second
year<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.449> let's<00:00:51.660> go<00:00:51.780> ahead<00:00:51.809> take<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.379> little<00:00:52.590> bit

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
year so let's go ahead take a little bit

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.510 
year so let's go ahead take a little bit
of<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.860> closer<00:00:53.070> look<00:00:53.430> at<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.120> speed<00:00:54.629> ball<00:00:54.840> field

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
of a closer look at the speed ball field

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.979 
of a closer look at the speed ball field
alright<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.850> field<00:00:57.120> here<00:00:57.360> itself<00:00:57.719> is

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
alright so the field here itself is

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.380 
alright so the field here itself is
pretty<00:00:58.289> simplistic<00:00:58.800> as<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.730> see<00:01:00.030> this

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
pretty simplistic as you can see this

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.420 
pretty simplistic as you can see this
whole<00:01:00.660> field<00:01:01.050> itself<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.800> kind<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
whole field itself is kind of just a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.490 
whole field itself is kind of just a
forest<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.030> dead<00:01:03.239> trees<00:01:03.600> that's<00:01:04.229> where<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> lot

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
forest of dead trees that's where a lot

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.840 
forest of dead trees that's where a lot
of<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> material<00:01:05.220> for<00:01:05.369> these<00:01:05.489> different

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
of the material for these different

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.030 
of the material for these different
barricades<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.510> bunkers<00:01:06.869> came<00:01:07.140> from<00:01:07.409> Theresa

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
barricades and bunkers came from Theresa

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.399 
barricades and bunkers came from Theresa
died<00:01:08.369> chop<00:01:08.909> them<00:01:09.090> up<00:01:09.180> constructed<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.080> into

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
died chop them up constructed it into

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.690 
died chop them up constructed it into
this<00:01:10.560> therefore<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:11.460> bit<00:01:11.549> more

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
this therefore it's a little bit more

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.730 
this therefore it's a little bit more
simplistic<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.420> barren<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.960> kind<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
simplistic and barren I kind of like the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.870 
simplistic and barren I kind of like the
look<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.189> way<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> looks<00:01:14.729> pretty

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
look of it this way it looks pretty

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.940 
look of it this way it looks pretty
war-torn<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.780> rugged<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.350> frankly<00:01:16.770> pretty

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
war-torn and rugged and frankly pretty

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.580 
war-torn and rugged and frankly pretty
cool<00:01:17.220> if<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.369> ask<00:01:17.430> me<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.780> fields<00:01:19.200> simple

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
cool if you ask me the fields simple

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.890 
cool if you ask me the fields simple
design<00:01:19.950> consists<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.670> two<00:01:20.880> spawn<00:01:21.270> points<00:01:21.750> with

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
design consists of two spawn points with

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.420 
design consists of two spawn points with
larger<00:01:22.350> barricades<00:01:22.830> at<00:01:23.009> each<00:01:23.130> end

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430

you're<00:02:04.259> making<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.920> my<00:02:05.070> opinion<00:02:05.340> a

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
you're making this in my opinion a

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.980 
you're making this in my opinion a
little<00:02:05.759> bit<00:02:05.850> better<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.240> spawn<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.719> start

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
little bit better of a spawn to start

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.210 
little bit better of a spawn to start
because<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> little<00:02:07.320> bit<00:02:07.530> harder<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.890> see<00:02:08.129> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
because a little bit harder to see the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.040 
because a little bit harder to see the
players<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.729> also<00:02:09.270> they've<00:02:09.420> got<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.780> kind

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
players and also they've got that kind

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.750 
players and also they've got that kind
of<00:02:10.110> foliage<00:02:10.560> giving<00:02:11.220> them<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.400> little<00:02:11.520> bit<00:02:11.670> of

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
of foliage giving them a little bit of

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.580 
of foliage giving them a little bit of
cover<00:02:11.970> as<00:02:12.209> well<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.140> rather

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
cover as well so this is a rather

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.259 
cover as well so this is a rather
spawn<00:02:13.950> point<00:02:14.220> obviously<00:02:14.400> set<00:02:14.819> up<00:02:14.910> at<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.120> top

it not a big favorite during that time

it not a big favorite during that time
of<00:02:25.680> year<00:02:25.709> but<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.340> summer<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.879> really<00:02:27.180> does

here<00:02:48.900> at<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.049> bottom<00:02:49.110> end<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.829> field<00:02:50.069> for

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
here at the bottom end of the field for

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.039 
here at the bottom end of the field for
that<00:02:50.459> team<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.880> hide<00:02:51.060> behind<00:02:51.239> however<00:02:51.690> it's

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
that team to hide behind however it's

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.990 
that team to hide behind however it's
set<00:02:52.260> pretty<00:02:52.530> far<00:02:52.829> back<00:02:53.069> in<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.370> spawn<00:02:53.700> point

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
set pretty far back in the spawn point

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.759 
set pretty far back in the spawn point
therefore<00:02:54.660> it's<00:02:54.780> kind<00:02:54.989> of<00:02:55.049> impractical<00:02:55.739> to

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
therefore it's kind of impractical to

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.380 
therefore it's kind of impractical to
stay<00:02:56.010> back<00:02:56.220> here<00:02:56.250> in<00:02:56.579> order<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:56.940> win<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.090> game

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
stay back here in order to win the game

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.449 
stay back here in order to win the game
also<00:02:58.200> it's<00:02:58.319> kind<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.530> taken<00:02:58.680> some<00:02:58.980> hits<00:02:59.129> over

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
also it's kind of taken some hits over

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.039 
also it's kind of taken some hits over
the<00:02:59.489> year<00:02:59.730> from<00:02:59.940> various<00:03:00.360> different<00:03:00.540> storms

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
the year from various different storms

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.750 
the year from various different storms
and<00:03:01.379> also<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.739> fact<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.099> I've<00:03:02.250> raided<00:03:02.670> it

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
and also the fact that I've raided it

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.610 
and also the fact that I've raided it
occasionally<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.660> grab<00:03:03.900> some<00:03:04.110> wood<00:03:04.260> for<00:03:04.470> some

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
occasionally to grab some wood for some

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.559 
occasionally to grab some wood for some
additional<00:03:05.040> barricades<00:03:05.519> up<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.879> way<00:03:06.030> it's

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
additional barricades up the way it's

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.750 
additional barricades up the way it's
still<00:03:06.780> decent<00:03:07.019> cover<00:03:07.410> though<00:03:07.620> for<00:03:08.010> those<00:03:08.489> who

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
still decent cover though for those who

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.430 
still decent cover though for those who
choose<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:09.090> hide<00:03:09.450> behind<00:03:09.599> it's<00:03:09.989> connected

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
the game as you can see like I mentioned

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.910 
the game as you can see like I mentioned
about<00:03:21.299> that<00:03:21.480> staggered<00:03:21.989> bunker<00:03:22.380> feel<00:03:22.620> you

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
about that staggered bunker feel you

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.620 
about that staggered bunker feel you
can't<00:03:23.190> always<00:03:23.400> see<00:03:23.760> who's<00:03:24.000> in<00:03:24.180> front<00:03:24.450> of<00:03:24.540> you

kind of adds to the intensity of the
games<00:03:30.090> here<00:03:30.450> because<00:03:30.780> it's<00:03:30.930> kind<00:03:31.049> of<00:03:31.139> a

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.240 
mystery sort of like a CQB style field
here<00:03:33.569> and<00:03:33.720> it's<00:03:34.109> pretty<00:03:34.319> interesting<00:03:34.620> as<00:03:35.040> well

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
here and it's pretty interesting as well

here and it's pretty interesting as well
you'll<00:03:35.760> also<00:03:36.000> notice<00:03:36.329> hey<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.290> can<00:03:37.560> always
