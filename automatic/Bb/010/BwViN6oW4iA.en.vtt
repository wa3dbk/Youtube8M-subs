a little bit more

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.250 
a little bit more
for<00:01:08.610> example<00:01:09.060> stocking<00:01:09.630> from<00:01:09.810> Panty<00:01:10.140> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
for example stocking from Panty and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.840 
for example stocking from Panty and
Stocking<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:11.640> only<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.450> long<00:01:12.720> wig<00:01:13.049> but

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.070 
it's very very character specific so
it's<00:01:17.189> pretty<00:01:17.400> much<00:01:17.670> only<00:01:17.970> made<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:18.659> stocking

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080

it<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:21.990> other<00:01:22.110> things<00:01:22.500> but<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.280> mostly<00:01:23.729> made

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
it for other things but it's mostly made

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.090
