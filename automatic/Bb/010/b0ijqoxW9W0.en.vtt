00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.410
 well paolo so here we are board of 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.580
 a mitsubishi asx given exactly to 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.960
 rho does not happen a citroen c4 aircross 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.730
 I confused what is also the reason why 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.310
 in practice on the same machine shell 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.330
 platform and mechanics are practically the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.189
 same on the legs 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.620
 I imagine the chickpea engine of soloists 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.079
 horses no in this case no because 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.420
 this the already known 1800 also used by 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.030
 sx however the mitsubishi engine 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.789
 turbodiesel 150 horses 320 meters 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.090
 the other one on the twin vice sx e 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.859
 2002 68 not in the range in meaning 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.079
 which is not present instead to the range 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.910
 citroen combined with automatic transmission ed 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.219
 is the only one of these models of this 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.379
 family has things but that 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.030
 I imagine perfectly marry it 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.030
 that I see quark or the selector of the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.340
 traction to die 4 ud which has however 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.290
 the ability to do what the 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.700
 functional and then choose the 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.170
 Commissioner this moment I saw that 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.369
 the normal wet road of 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.720
 travel in two railcars for 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.180
 reduce fuel consumption the car more 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.770
 sliding switch to automatic 4d 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.240
 so it is the system that decides when 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.700
 inserted all-wheel drive 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.920
 slips are perceived or 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.070
 even in iv v of glock and therefore 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.060
 by stuck repetition I mean 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.700
 integral integral in substance 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.320
 for the funds and feels also feels 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.420
 in the joke one feels in the resistance 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.789
 at the barely perceptible progress 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.710
 clearly but it is inevitable to have 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.149
 maximum obvious traction not to be used 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.050
 in these conditions because they increase 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.630
 possible him 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.250
 here is consumption intent is also though 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.720
 the one that performed best in 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.810
 certain circumstances 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.420
 in the mixed city ​​state traffic use 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.220
 urban etcetera absolutely is with 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.899
 upper middle 15 mind the back 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.149
 however it was beaten by the record holder 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.619
 bmw only on the highway because it is not 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.440
 was clearly with the eight gears la 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.569
 bmw to 135 then travels at 2,000 rpm 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.290
 so he also takes these yes though 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.149
 defense even in a very state 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.130
 they are interesting you can see just the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.870
 comparison with the automatic essence 2002 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.860
 68 the difference in performance 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.740
 especially in the snow where we are 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.020
 going and especially also in the shot 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.180
 of the fast instead on the snow there are 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.830
 of the little differences that count that 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.940
 they are instead the construction and in this 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.020
 case we have the cross version ex 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.020
 positive pending act e 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.640
 we have a satnav I see 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.390
 also the keyless in addition to the interiors in 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.760
 leather seen fabric and then obviously on 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.190
 all the rest lacks nothing so if 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.810
 kate electric sound system with 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.940
 bluetooth voice commands a 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.950
 speech recognition, in short, a 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:58.400
 old man photo we say that 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.989
 on the set up besides the sensor of 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.209
 parking and all that series of 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.010
 treats of the plays the rearview camera does not 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.700
 really wanting nothing at all 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.530
 we could be fussy 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.010
 wanting to have an air conditioner too 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.080
 bi-zone, however, for the use that can be made of it 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.510
 do 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.980
 in short, other factors that count but you 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.710
 only things will say in this major 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.780
 to close and a very bright engine 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.150
 for a hundred meters for a 1800 are so many 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.790
 has only a little bit of laziness until 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.620
 1,500 1,600 laps which penalizes him in the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.290
 shot, however, once this is overcome 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.620
 threshold becomes almost sporty is a lot 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.180
 nice to be used true but me without 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.079
 see her in the house that 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:45.069
 we are making a politicians before however the 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.069
 true hundred ok 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.240
 lazio
