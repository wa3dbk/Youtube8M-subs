double-a rechargeables one thing about

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.199 
double-a rechargeables one thing about
the<00:01:45.270> RR<00:01:46.259> t<00:01:46.499> 0<00:01:46.859> that<00:01:47.219> the<00:01:47.369> other<00:01:47.520> two<00:01:47.759> don't<00:01:47.880> have

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
the RR t 0 that the other two don't have

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:51.620 
the RR t 0 that the other two don't have
is<00:01:48.450> an<00:01:48.899> extra<00:01:49.319> low<00:01:49.469> low<00:01:49.709> setting<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.630> basically

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
is an extra low low setting so basically

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.279 
is an extra low low setting so basically
you<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:51.959> call<00:01:52.139> it<00:01:52.259> has<00:01:52.439> five<00:01:52.740> settings<00:01:54.289> where

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
you can call it has five settings where

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.590 
you can call it has five settings where
you<00:01:55.319> have<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.679> nice<00:01:55.950> ultra-low<00:01:56.639> all<00:01:56.999> the<00:01:57.389> way<00:01:57.479> up

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
you have a nice ultra-low all the way up

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.109 
you have a nice ultra-low all the way up
to<00:01:57.749> the<00:01:57.780> high<00:01:58.069> something<00:01:59.069> phenomenal<00:01:59.249> about

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119

battery<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.420> it's<00:02:39.870> an<00:02:40.110> eye<00:02:40.320> at<00:02:40.650> 240<00:02:41.490> lumens

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
battery in it it's an eye at 240 lumens

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.280 
battery in it it's an eye at 240 lumens
okay<00:02:44.390> next<00:02:45.390> we<00:02:45.720> have<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:47.000> RR<00:02:48.000> t<00:02:48.240> 0<00:02:48.720> with<00:02:49.260> a

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
okay next we have the RR t 0 with a

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.180 
okay next we have the RR t 0 with a
double<00:02:49.740> A<00:02:49.860> in<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.700> has<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.210> high<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:52.190> 180

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
double A in it that has the high of 180

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.110 
double A in it that has the high of 180
lumens<00:02:53.640> it's<00:02:54.480> still<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> very<00:02:55.530> respectable

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
lumens it's still a very respectable

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.970 
lumens it's still a very respectable
output<00:02:57.120> as<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:58.080> can<00:02:58.230> see<00:02:58.410> it's<00:02:58.560> got<00:02:58.740> a<00:02:58.800> pretty

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
output as you can see it's got a pretty

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.950 
output as you can see it's got a pretty
nice<00:02:59.190> beam<00:02:59.490> it's<00:02:59.820> got<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.210> hybrid<00:03:00.720> roots

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
nice beam it's got that hybrid roots

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.020 
nice beam it's got that hybrid roots
lecture<00:03:01.350> in<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.640> okay<00:03:02.640> next<00:03:02.850> we<00:03:03.120> have<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.360> rrt

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
lecture in it okay next we have the rrt

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.930 
lecture in it okay next we have the rrt
to<00:03:06.260> which<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.650> next<00:03:08.070> in<00:03:08.340> line<00:03:08.550> in<00:03:08.850> the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
to which is the next in line in the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.280 
to which is the next in line in the
series<00:03:09.270> of<00:03:09.450> Lights<00:03:09.660> it's<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.960> little<00:03:10.170> bit

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
series of Lights it's a little bit

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.200 
series of Lights it's a little bit
bigger<00:03:10.470> some<00:03:10.860> medium<00:03:11.190> size<00:03:11.430> between<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.030> two

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
bigger some medium size between the two

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.960 
bigger some medium size between the two
we<00:03:12.660> got<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.870> bigger<00:03:13.140> reflector<00:03:13.800> as<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.640> can<00:03:14.760> see

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
we got a bigger reflector as you can see

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.010 
we got a bigger reflector as you can see
it's<00:03:15.120> made<00:03:15.390> with<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:16.100> more<00:03:17.100> throwing<00:03:17.490> in<00:03:18.020> in

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
it's made with a more throwing in in

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.960 
it's made with a more throwing in in
mind<00:03:19.410> it's<00:03:19.890> also<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.400> 240<00:03:21.239> lumen<00:03:21.540> high<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.970> next

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
mind it's also a 240 lumen high and next

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.880 
mind it's also a 240 lumen high and next
we<00:03:24.870> have<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.560> original<00:03:26.750> Raptor<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:28.020> rrt<00:03:28.620> one

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
we have the original Raptor the rrt one

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.120 
we have the original Raptor the rrt one
that's<00:03:29.730> also<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.209> high<00:03:30.480> output<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.959> 240<00:03:31.770> logans

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
that's also a high output of 240 logans

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.370 
that's also a high output of 240 logans
and<00:03:32.370> as<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.209> can<00:03:33.360> see<00:03:33.390> this<00:03:33.750> is<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.110> one<00:03:34.260> that

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
and as you can see this is the one that

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
and as you can see this is the one that
was<00:03:34.530> made<00:03:34.770> for<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.370> longest<00:03:36.209> throw<00:03:37.160> so<00:03:38.160> that's

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
was made for the longest throw so that's

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.320 
was made for the longest throw so that's
it<00:03:38.610> for<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:39.450> series<00:03:39.900> of<00:03:40.040> raptors<00:03:41.090> nice<00:03:42.090> set<00:03:42.300> of

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
it for a series of raptors nice set of

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.739 
it for a series of raptors nice set of
lights<00:03:42.630> so<00:03:43.080> I<00:03:43.110> highly<00:03:43.440> recommend
