00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.769
 hi girls hi everyone I 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.330
 come back in a new video for 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.660
 introduce yourself as you saw in 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.810
 title a review on canvas 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:28.629
 this magnificence which is the remington 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:30.849
 aqualys white stripes who is a leader 

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:34.570
 as its name indicates it that presents itself 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:37.539
 like these there is obviously a 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.699
 little protection that's like this 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.530
 so it's a little pocket for 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.150
 to lock up his straightener simply 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.790
 that they have term in resistant 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.380
 that's how it says the little machine 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.360
 looks like these is what I 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.090
 yours in the wii so remington ya 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.530
 remington writing right there there are 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.440
 small openings that we can see 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.329
 in which outside and also to 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.160
 interior 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.740
 simply because if it's called 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.259
 aqualys it's not for nothing is that 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.229
 just this this little gear on 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.390
 can use it on wet hair 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.020
 wet is just these little ones 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.920
 too much actually 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.420
 helps to do that which was wet 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.380
 escaping steam from the straightener and 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.219
 obviously it dries the hair so 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.619
 very very well then we have a 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.819
 LCD screen which is right there for so 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.459
 see the temperature 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:35.619
 we have the temperature variator in 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.209
 plus it's me who have it right there and then 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.749
 obviously the button on off 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:42.939
 then we have also on the 

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:45.729
 side a little black button like these 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.450
 which allows of so there it is closed when 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.700
 press it 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.920
 hop we can open it's a button 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.509
 security just who is when 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.729
 even very practical and what is still 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.029
 more practical me I'm crazy it's 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.310
 this is the rotating cord 

00:01:58.029 --> 00:02:01.890
 just great this thing because we did not 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.900
 no need to be there galore 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.430
 this high school where curly hair and 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.830
 here we can turn around and 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.350
 return his leader without this yet 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.170
 see the son who starts to get involved 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.730
 like that and it's panic after it's 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.410
 just super convenient because we can 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.580
 that's how it could normally 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.560
 obviously for the video it does not work 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.680
 not like these and after we turn 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.330
 like that it's very convenient what I 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.840
 can you also tell about this product 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.190
 it is to utter plate so the plates 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.580
 is like these, they are 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.260
 of a slightly golden color with 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.510
 some under your a little gray 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.820
 it's golden a little bit I pass if 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.300
 you will see it in short the plates 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.700
 are ceramic diamond and Teflon 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.970
 so it's just great because it 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.519
 does not damage the hair at all 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.170
 do not forget that before this high school to get 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.630
 curling the hair we always use 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.970
 a temperature protector knowing 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.810
 that this little critter mint up 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.560
 230 degrees I 'm never going to 230 myself 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.630
 degrees 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.090
 I'm too scared I'm too scared to burn 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.079
 the hair and I'm too scared of them 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.360
 simply damage 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.610
 but I still have a protector who 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.560
 goes up to 230 degrees but 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.870
 honestly I'm too scared I have not 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.930
 feel like it's a test 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.910
 until then I tested up to 190 which is 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.600
 already huge what is already a lot 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:31.290
 in general honestly I leave at 180 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.180
 it's more than enough, so once 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.820
 that I have spirit and that I can go to 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.930
 these so if it smokes and obviously 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.420
 is that the product as it is a 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.090
 liquid product obviously that's it 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.160
 escape forgiveness in steam with the 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.860
 little holes and do not forget especially to 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.350
 the end of your from your setting 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.400
 hairstyle do not forget about everything applied 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.890
 a little bit of argan oil all 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.470
 simply to protect your dying 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.590
 hair is very important 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.270
 so for advertising this little trick 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.000
 they say 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.220
 kyl that warms up after 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.630
 30 seconds and I still wanted 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.110
 do the test so I leave you with 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.110
 images 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.290
 I love them too because they 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.200
 absolutely do not damage my hair that 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.090
 its use is more than easy even 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.820
 someone who has never used 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.590
 do of all his life can come to 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.420
 do something really correct 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.520
 I use it to smooth 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.360
 curl my hair really very 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:46.270
 often I'm obviously absolutely 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.430
 not at all sponsored at all 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.560
 by the remington brand it's a brand 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.150
 I love a goat 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.760
 I use a little less now than 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.410
 I have this sublime make love I am 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.300
 obviously serves to smooth to curl 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.700
 so I needed this one in 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.550
 done so I'm not at all 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:10.600
 sponsored the price of this little 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:12.460
 angÃ¨le has yielded about 30 to 40 euros in 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.780
 these waters we can see it a month on 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.820
 the sites just look for a small 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.800
 I honestly recommend it 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.320
 it's a very, very, very, very good 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.760
 which is not very expensive because 30 40 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.660
 euros it's not very expensive for a 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.460
 remington 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.830
 it's a very very good brand I 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.750
 I really like this brand and I like 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.250
 especially really being who 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.210
 extraordinary I recommend it to you 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.280
 ten thousand one hundred thousand percent then me 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.190
 it's a game just love it 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.290
 because I'm also able to smooth 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.730
 than to curl my hair I'll you 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.940
 see him right away in a small 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.940
 video 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.330
 yes then me what I'm doing is that 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:11.379
 when I do not use it kind between 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.240
 two of the hair households I pose it 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:15.550
 just so there is my office 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.900
 I have my little pouch in fact I 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.639
 simply put on it to avoid 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.090
 at the office to have any 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:24.099
 annoyances something else to know is 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.669
 that when we bind this canton is looping 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:28.569
 failed and it's especially good to see 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:31.479
 the location where there are the holes to 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:33.849
 the outside so not a verdun twizz not 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:35.440
 to our face because it can be 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.360
 very dangerous it gives off steam 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.009
 so it's hot and it can all 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.199
 simply unburned then me it's me 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:43.120
 never happened because precisely i 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:44.949
 assad dropper I'm scared of the heat 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.560
 and all so always outside 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:49.360
 obviously like this and in addition what 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.069
 is that with the rotary cord 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.319
 here we have no problem to have 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:54.699
 always find them outside so 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:56.979
 it's super convenient 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.150
 here I hope this little video 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.340
 you will have liked 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.319
 I like a lot like you have 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.029
 understood this straightener that's why I 

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:05.979
 you did a review for you in 

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:07.659
 speak a little bit for those who are 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:10.210
 feel a little bit bought a straightener 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:14.020
 book their leader much more expensive 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.930
 frankly am here they are really going 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.639
 really blow on this I leave you 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:23.580
 I make you fat big kisses of love 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:23.580
 month to the next video and ciao
