put on it and then he uses another hydro
pump<00:05:36.400> which<00:05:36.790> it<00:05:37.090> survived<00:05:40.290> and<00:05:41.610> so<00:05:42.610> i<00:05:42.640> tried<00:05:43.120> to

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
pump which it survived and so i tried to

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.270 
pump which it survived and so i tried to
use<00:05:43.330> hypnosis<00:05:43.840> on<00:05:44.290> feraligatr<00:05:45.040> which

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
use hypnosis on feraligatr which

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.330 
use hypnosis on feraligatr which
unfortunately<00:05:45.610> i<00:05:46.000> miss<00:05:46.600> which<00:05:47.500> really<00:05:47.890> sucked

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
unfortunately i miss which really sucked

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.280 
unfortunately i miss which really sucked
because<00:05:48.580> that<00:05:48.970> might<00:05:49.330> have<00:05:49.540> turned<00:05:50.080> the

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
because that might have turned the

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.810 
because that might have turned the
battle<00:05:50.650> around<00:05:50.890> for<00:05:51.250> me<00:05:51.370> which<00:05:51.520> would<00:05:51.730> have

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
battle around for me which would have

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.530 
battle around for me which would have
been<00:05:52.000> really<00:05:52.150> nice<00:05:52.450> I<00:05:52.810> was<00:05:53.800> also<00:05:53.980> hoping<00:05:54.790> for<00:05:55.510> a
