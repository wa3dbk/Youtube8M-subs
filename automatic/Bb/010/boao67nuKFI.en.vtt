00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.539 
stone I've actually turned solid you
know<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.439> was<00:01:49.560> quite<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.100> they'd<00:01:50.369> been

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
know it was quite so they'd been

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.080 
know it was quite so they'd been
considerable<00:01:51.210> heat<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:52.070> from<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.250> source<00:01:53.729> yes

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
considerable heat and from a source yes

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.819 
considerable heat and from a source yes
did<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.960> do<00:01:55.110> any<00:01:55.290> sort<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.530> technical

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
did you do any sort of technical

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.639 
did you do any sort of technical
scientific<00:01:56.399> tests<00:01:56.909> when<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:57.930> came<00:01:58.110> down<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.409> do

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
scientific tests when we came down to do

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.410 
scientific tests when we came down to do
some<00:01:58.829> Geiger<00:01:59.250> counter<00:01:59.640> readings<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.180> found

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
some Geiger counter readings we found

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.810 
some Geiger counter readings we found
that<00:02:00.600> there<00:02:00.780> was<00:02:00.899> an<00:02:01.020> awful<00:02:01.140> when<00:02:01.820> increasing

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
that there was an awful when increasing

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.050 
that there was an awful when increasing
in<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:04.469> radiation<00:02:05.009> readings<00:02:05.159> around<00:02:05.490> here

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
in the radiation readings around here

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.119 
in the radiation readings around here
first<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.960> all<00:02:07.020> what<00:02:07.259> we<00:02:07.290> did<00:02:07.530> was<00:02:07.710> normal

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
first of all what we did was normal

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.520 
first of all what we did was normal
background<00:02:08.369> radiation<00:02:09.119> readings<00:02:09.690> which<00:02:10.229> at

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
background radiation readings which at

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.730 
background radiation readings which at
the<00:02:10.649> time<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:11.250> believe<00:02:11.640> before

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
the time I believe before

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.040 
the time I believe before
all<00:02:12.800> around<00:02:13.130> this<00:02:13.280> area<00:02:13.520> when<00:02:14.480> we<00:02:14.600> came<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.960> the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
all around this area when we came to the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.890 
all around this area when we came to the
combustion<00:02:15.500> damage<00:02:16.040> in<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.310> tree<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:16.970> the

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
combustion damage in the tree and the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.680 
combustion damage in the tree and the
radiation<00:02:18.830> really<00:02:19.400> read<00:02:19.580> up<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.820> nearly<00:02:20.150> 40

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
radiation really read up to nearly 40

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.840 
radiation really read up to nearly 40
which<00:02:20.870> is<00:02:21.020> quite<00:02:21.230> excessive<00:02:21.920> really<00:02:22.310> what's

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
which is quite excessive really what's

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.700 
which is quite excessive really what's
the<00:02:22.940> highest<00:02:23.090> one<00:02:23.420> you've<00:02:23.600> recorded<00:02:23.900> this<00:02:24.470> one

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
the highest one you've recorded this one

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.490 
the highest one you've recorded this one
floor<00:02:24.980> yeah<00:02:25.640> it's<00:02:26.180> most<00:02:26.510> interesting<00:02:26.750> one<00:02:27.350> and

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
floor yeah it's most interesting one and

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.140 
floor yeah it's most interesting one and
the<00:02:27.950> highest<00:02:28.250> reading<00:02:28.550> that<00:02:28.640> whatever<00:02:28.850> every

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
the highest reading that whatever every

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.030 
the highest reading that whatever every
record<00:02:29.540> is<00:02:29.690> four<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:30.110> yes<00:02:30.320> they<00:02:30.800> didn't

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
record is four so yes they didn't

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.330 
record is four so yes they didn't
actually<00:02:31.160> find<00:02:31.490> any<00:02:31.790> bits<00:02:32.570> of<00:02:33.160> spaceship<00:02:34.160> or

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
actually find any bits of spaceship or

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.280 
actually find any bits of spaceship or
whatever<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.880> was<00:02:35.180> but<00:02:35.480> bits<00:02:36.140> of

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
whatever you it was but bits of

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.850 
whatever you it was but bits of
machinery<00:02:36.830> no<00:02:37.400> bits<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:38.710> machinery<00:02:39.710> or

machinery no bits of machinery or

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.130 
machinery no bits of machinery or
anything<00:02:40.220> like<00:02:40.250> that<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.910> but<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.810> was<00:02:41.960> just

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
anything like that and but it was just

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.190 
anything like that and but it was just
so<00:02:42.320> all<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.830> damage<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.250> had<00:02:43.520> occurred

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
so all the damage that had occurred

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.320 
so all the damage that had occurred
later<00:02:45.200> on<00:02:45.500> when<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.520> people<00:02:46.910> phoned<00:02:47.120> was

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
later on when and the people phoned was

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.480 
later on when and the people phoned was
from<00:02:47.570> soot<00:02:47.810> more<00:02:48.020> than<00:02:48.200> some<00:02:48.410> r<00:02:48.800> EF<00:02:49.010> person<00:02:49.400> or

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
from soot more than some r EF person or

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.830 
from soot more than some r EF person or
foam<00:02:49.730> europe<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.300> they<00:02:50.480> didn't<00:02:50.690> want<00:02:50.720> to

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
foam europe and they didn't want to

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.150 
foam europe and they didn't want to
leave<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.200> names<00:02:51.410> because<00:02:51.680> i<00:02:51.830> didn't<00:02:52.010> want<00:02:52.040> to

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
leave the names because i didn't want to

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.670 
leave the names because i didn't want to
get<00:02:52.340> into<00:02:52.550> trouble<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.630> they<00:02:53.840> said<00:02:54.140> that

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
get into trouble and they said that

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.470 
get into trouble and they said that
something<00:02:55.070> was<00:02:55.340> actually<00:02:55.490> tracked<00:02:56.030> coming

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
something was actually tracked coming

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.380 
something was actually tracked coming
over<00:02:56.780> here<00:02:57.020> on<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:57.470> date<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:58.490> wasn't<00:02:58.880> an

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
over here on that date it wasn't an

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.900 
over here on that date it wasn't an
identified<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.740> it<00:03:00.830> was<00:03:00.950> very<00:03:01.130> very<00:03:01.370> low<00:03:01.640> was

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
identified and it was very very low was

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.240 
identified and it was very very low was
truck<00:03:02.150> coming<00:03:02.480> this<00:03:02.630> direction<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.530> this<00:03:04.100> is

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
truck coming this direction and this is

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.250 
truck coming this direction and this is
what<00:03:04.400> we<00:03:04.580> believe<00:03:04.880> Kate<00:03:05.180> saw<00:03:07.720> many<00:03:08.720> of<00:03:08.900> Eric's

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
what we believe Kate saw many of Eric's

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.370 
what we believe Kate saw many of Eric's
cases<00:03:09.770> turn<00:03:10.070> out<00:03:10.280> not<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.640> be<00:03:10.850> UFOs<00:03:11.480> at<00:03:11.690> all<00:03:11.900> so

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
cases turn out not to be UFOs at all so

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.410 
cases turn out not to be UFOs at all so
this<00:03:12.560> one<00:03:12.800> he<00:03:13.010> believes<00:03:13.370> is<00:03:13.610> different<00:03:14.210> I

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
this one he believes is different I

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.410 
this one he believes is different I
genuine<00:03:15.410> genuinely<00:03:16.070> believer<00:03:16.490> UFO<00:03:17.120> actually

saw because of all the the investigation

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.370 
saw because of all the the investigation
that<00:03:31.190> we<00:03:31.460> did<00:03:31.670> everything<00:03:32.360> like<00:03:33.170> I<00:03:33.200> said

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
that we did everything like I said

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.990 
that we did everything like I said
earlier<00:03:33.530> you<00:03:34.070> know<00:03:34.190> we<00:03:34.340> seem<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.790> come<00:03:34.880> up

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
earlier you know we seem to come up

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.400 
earlier you know we seem to come up
