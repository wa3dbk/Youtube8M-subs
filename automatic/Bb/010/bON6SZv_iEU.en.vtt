00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 yeah yeah the poles hi this is 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.460
 where is the big dedication for 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.440
 urban fusions too that's going on 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.690
 so do not move but to no avail a fusion 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.340
 makes the current queen of apples well 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.830
 moreover it's sure urban fusions 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.240
 point that m 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.379
 so this project she was thought of as 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.330
 all the other projects ie 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.199
 without really thinking too much without 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.029
 Too much calculate 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.350
 here I think that's what makes a 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.480
 good album that's what I got a little 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.010
 blamed on the fourth balloon album 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.240
 of gold is to have thought too much 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.710
 I was a little lost musically 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.939
 during a year when I 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.529
 searched for a lot of stuff I have too much 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.690
 listen to a little advice the people who 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.579
 talk to me about them and the requests to 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.260
 different left right of all people 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.850
 so I refocused on what I 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.020
 I knew how to do 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.420
 never needed anyone to do 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.829
 of music so in the end I stopped 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.160
 listen to some things that are right 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.700
 Left sources that occurred in 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.469
 source 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.719
 initially at the level of 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.399
 instrus themes a little bit 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.629
 everything and in the end I think it was the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.460
 better solutions because it's 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.469
 what I needed from me in my 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.059
 head I was in fashion tear everything shows 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.550
 theirs that you are there the people they speak 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.600
 they make a lot of blah blahs here we are 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.159
 in an environment where people have 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.900
 tendency to temper a little too much 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.070
 quickly 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.840
 me precisely it is this reclast which 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.869
 motivates these things so I was in 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.340
 comes out a firm album gules show 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.409
 their who was still there shows their 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.790
 that the pen is there when 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.110
 I hear people say yeah but he 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.909
 should they change nananana 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.049
 today it annoys me more than anything else 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.850
 thing because I tell myself when we have it 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.530
 did people were the first to 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.610
 to say yeah but in the end she looks at that 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.990
 changed it was better what they 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.880
 did before he did some stuff that 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.049
 separates do them and where so morality 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.070
 is that people already united will be 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.930
 never happy there will always be 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.340
 to talk about them we have to do what we 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.200
 loves to takes to listen to others 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.430
 and that's me that's how I was 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.689
 but again I tell you the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.280
 best examples these golden balloons 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.049
 these golden balloons what is it the album of 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.430
 all the changes is the one that has 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.110
 the worst market is the one that 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.040
 not been rewarded for the job provided and 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.649
 we had anyway 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.820
 so that's it I tell myself people are talking 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.380
 they ask for things but when you 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.960
 do to the ends it will make you even 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.420
 not and most of the time without them 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.189
 completely fuck so 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.080
 so I did not stay focused there 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.640
 I stopped listening to these things 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.780
 there not the title it is well in the beginning 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.580
 I was in a delirium I wanted the 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.560
 place your hand on the guen for the little one 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.119
 wink to the first album and then the 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.380
 feather and daggers that I like it me 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.580
 please more so here is there is no 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.349
 link it's just that the title i sounds 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.220
 much better and that me that me 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.510
 fits more 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.430
 in any case it speaks to me more than the hand 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.560
 on the guen that aimed a little beginners 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.610
 we will say my first album could have been 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.989
 to be called the hand on the guen by 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.310
 example is not the fifth it's 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.880
 just a way of telling people I 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.980
 you fuck 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.599
 you gave me for dead and buried 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.000
 not long ago today we are here 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.830
 we live we prepare our album we prepare 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.750
 a concert at the zenith in paris 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.250
 our tour so here it is a small 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.720
 wink at the theme level story 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.980
 to say that we must never give the 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.840
 people for me like that except when they 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.549
 even say it because most of the 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.110
 time it was going to motivate and in fact I 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.370
 thank them i want to thank people 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.989
 who have me because it's my job 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.670
 it's thanks to them that I made a bep 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.150
 albums in all the albums there are 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.799
 surprises 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.970
 the goal is not just about this 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.470
 we know how to do it is always brought back 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.610
 a touch of novelty bring back 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.170
 stuff you did not do here 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.819
 if I had the impression of doing 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.319
 eight years the same music say the same 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.370
 things or what would I have been first 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.540
 it would have been blown 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.570
 good to mix a little with young people 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.560
 to new generations of already 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.000
 the guests because we love what they 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.230
 do is also to confront a little 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.799
 you see this shock a little bit of two 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.810
 generations 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.160
 and then that's right I like brothers 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.959
 the one I was talking to you about because it's 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.609
 a piece that is purely in 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.200
 the spirit that represents exactly this 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.930
 that I am my mentality vis-Ã -vis 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.489
 my friends fidelity in friendship 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.410
 you will reveal who else I am 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.510
 attached for a very long time I 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.400
 friends I've known them for 25 to 26 years 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.690
 today you see so here it is 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.370
 piece that speaks to me besides I tell you 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.230
 the sound is still pretty true there is 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.790
 something of 2.9 and at the same time 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.900
 consolidate in this piece with respect to 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.670
 what I have always done before 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.140
 so here's after I love them all are 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.310
 if I did not love them I would not have them 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.140
 Well, I can not lie to you 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.940
 full there is I was not great 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.079
 super satisfied so we have them there are 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.000
 not passed the technical control 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.770
 they stayed outside 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.780
 The same hour the themes remain the 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.970
 not even need a gold chain for 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.680
 to be a guy with hate values and 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.690
 of monet look at everything they do our 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.060
 chains worry you I do not forget the 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.400
 pigeons suin what my mother 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.440
 years to the prophet the golden discs serves 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.510
 why in the grave will not be the 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.890
 sense but the trophy even if they do not lie 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.890
 not in support
