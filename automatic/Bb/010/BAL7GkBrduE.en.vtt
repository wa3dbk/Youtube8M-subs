00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.400 
well does she they're actually quite
thick<00:00:59.470> so<00:00:59.790> it's<00:01:00.790> almost<00:01:00.940> like<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.930> web<00:01:02.110> the

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
thick so it's almost like the web the

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.290 
thick so it's almost like the web the
website<00:01:02.770> says<00:01:03.040> it's<00:01:03.219> basically<00:01:03.940> that<00:01:04.180> you

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
website says it's basically that you

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.149 
website says it's basically that you
don't<00:01:04.510> need<00:01:04.750> to<00:01:04.960> apply<00:01:05.170> eyeliner<00:01:05.650> you<00:01:05.920> just

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
don't need to apply eyeliner you just

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.780 
don't need to apply eyeliner you just
need<00:01:06.310> to<00:01:06.460> apply<00:01:06.580> these<00:01:06.820> and<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:08.560> think<00:01:09.130> that<00:01:09.340> you

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
need to apply these and I think that you

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.870 
need to apply these and I think that you
need<00:01:09.970> to<00:01:10.150> apply<00:01:10.330> eyeliner<00:01:10.810> on<00:01:11.080> top<00:01:11.110> of<00:01:11.440> these<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
need to apply eyeliner on top of these I

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.149 
need to apply eyeliner on top of these I
don't<00:01:13.780> really<00:01:13.930> think<00:01:13.990> they<00:01:14.320> work<00:01:14.590> as<00:01:14.830> well<00:01:15.009> as

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159

don't really think they work as well as
they<00:01:15.310> say<00:01:15.340> but<00:01:16.270> still<00:01:16.420> I<00:01:16.540> think<00:01:16.690> they're

with it comes in a really like nice
little<00:02:36.799> part<00:02:37.069> they've<00:02:37.879> got<00:02:38.329> all<00:02:38.450> the

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
little part they've got all the

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:39.940 
little part they've got all the
different<00:02:39.049> little<00:02:39.200> things<00:02:39.319> that<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.769> should

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
different little things that it should

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.979 
different little things that it should
help<00:02:40.069> you<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.430> put<00:02:40.549> them<00:02:40.700> on<00:02:40.819> but<00:02:41.390> I<00:02:41.450> still<00:02:41.780> use

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
help you to put them on but I still use

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.660 
help you to put them on but I still use
the<00:02:42.140> clamp<00:02:42.379> thing<00:02:42.890> because<00:02:43.250> I<00:02:43.370> think<00:02:43.549> it's

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
the clamp thing because I think it's

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.599 
the clamp thing because I think it's
much<00:02:43.790> better<00:02:44.030> also<00:02:45.019> I<00:02:45.500> don't<00:02:46.130> use<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.430> glue

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
much better also I don't use the glue

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.660 
much better also I don't use the glue
that<00:02:46.639> they<00:02:46.910> provide<00:02:47.239> because<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:49.400> glue

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
that they provide because and the glue

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.240 
that they provide because and the glue
that<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:50.209> available<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.230> same<00:02:51.440> website<00:02:51.980> as

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
that is available the same website as

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.809 
that is available the same website as
the<00:02:52.639> eye<00:02:52.819> liner<00:02:53.329> and<00:02:53.720> is<00:02:54.620> much<00:02:55.190> better<00:02:55.430> it's

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
the eye liner and is much better it's

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.629 
the eye liner and is much better it's
much<00:02:55.970> stronger<00:02:56.269> and<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.620> I'd<00:02:58.010> suggest<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:58.609> use

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
much stronger and so I'd suggest you use

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.490 
much stronger and so I'd suggest you use
that<00:02:59.030> instead<00:02:59.630> it's<00:02:59.870> called<00:03:00.139> surgical

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
that instead it's called surgical

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.270 
that instead it's called surgical
eyelash<00:03:01.310> adhesive<00:03:02.440> so<00:03:03.440> I<00:03:03.620> think<00:03:03.709> I<00:03:03.950> don't<00:03:04.160> know

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
eyelash adhesive so I think I don't know

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.259 
eyelash adhesive so I think I don't know
why<00:03:04.760> but<00:03:05.120> it's<00:03:05.239> just<00:03:05.269> a<00:03:05.540> little<00:03:05.750> bit<00:03:05.900> stronger

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
why but it's just a little bit stronger

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.819 
why but it's just a little bit stronger
so<00:03:08.269> when<00:03:08.810> you're<00:03:08.989> applying<00:03:09.139> your<00:03:09.410> eyelash

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
so when you're applying your eyelash

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:15.430 
so when you're applying your eyelash
glue<00:03:10.780> just<00:03:11.780> really<00:03:13.359> don't<00:03:14.359> apply<00:03:14.569> too<00:03:14.690> much<00:03:14.930> to

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
glue just really don't apply too much to

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.750 
glue just really don't apply too much to
begin<00:03:15.560> with<00:03:15.739> because

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
begin with because

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.069 
begin with because
you<00:03:18.250> it's<00:03:19.250> not<00:03:19.430> more<00:03:19.909> than<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.599> more<00:03:20.780> eyelash

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
you it's not more than the more eyelash

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.520 
you it's not more than the more eyelash
with<00:03:21.349> you<00:03:22.010> put<00:03:22.220> on<00:03:22.430> it's<00:03:23.239> not<00:03:23.420> like<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:24.319> more

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
with you put on it's not like the more

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.110 
with you put on it's not like the more
it's<00:03:24.680> gonna<00:03:24.829> stick<00:03:25.220> it's<00:03:25.519> just<00:03:25.700> gonna<00:03:25.849> take

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
it's gonna stick it's just gonna take

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.509 
it's gonna stick it's just gonna take
longer<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.750> dry<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.319> then<00:03:27.500> you'll<00:03:28.220> end<00:03:28.310> up

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
longer to dry and then you'll end up

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.080 
longer to dry and then you'll end up
it'll<00:03:28.939> just<00:03:29.090> end<00:03:29.209> up<00:03:29.329> falling<00:03:29.599> off<00:03:29.870> anyway

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
it'll just end up falling off anyway

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.910 
it'll just end up falling off anyway
so<00:03:32.090> basically<00:03:32.450> put<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.900> eyeline<00:03:33.260> eyelash

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
so basically put the eyeline eyelash

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:41.530 
so basically put the eyeline eyelash
glue<00:03:34.129> on<00:03:36.579> and<00:03:37.900> wait<00:03:38.900> for<00:03:39.200> it<00:03:39.290> to<00:03:39.430> dry<00:03:40.540> because

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
glue on and wait for it to dry because

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.839 
glue on and wait for it to dry because
the<00:03:42.530> only<00:03:42.739> way<00:03:42.829> it's<00:03:42.980> gonna<00:03:43.099> attach<00:03:43.519> to<00:03:43.730> your

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
the only way it's gonna attach to your

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.160 
the only way it's gonna attach to your
eye<00:03:43.970> is<00:03:44.329> if<00:03:44.599> it's<00:03:44.780> sticky<00:03:45.019> and<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:46.760> think<00:03:47.170> when

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
eye is if it's sticky and I think when

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.649 
eye is if it's sticky and I think when
you<00:03:48.290> read<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:49.190> instructions<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:49.970> says<00:03:50.180> wait

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
you read the instructions it says wait

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.110 
you read the instructions it says wait
until<00:03:51.019> almost<00:03:51.620> dry<00:03:51.920> or<00:03:52.640> something<00:03:52.790> but<00:03:53.090> I

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
until almost dry or something but I

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.069 
until almost dry or something but I
think<00:03:53.180> that's<00:03:53.510> where<00:03:53.659> if<00:03:53.810> you've<00:03:53.959> actually

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
think that's where if you've actually

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.220 
think that's where if you've actually
got<00:03:54.409> eyelashes<00:03:54.980> to<00:03:55.190> attach<00:03:55.430> them<00:03:55.730> to<00:03:56.049> we<00:03:57.049> need

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
got eyelashes to attach them to we need

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.589 
got eyelashes to attach them to we need
to<00:03:57.260> wait<00:03:57.500> till<00:03:57.739> it's<00:03:57.889> sticky<00:03:58.159> for<00:03:59.030> it<00:03:59.359> to

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
to wait till it's sticky for it to

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.780 
to wait till it's sticky for it to
attach<00:03:59.900> there's<00:04:00.260> just<00:04:00.470> me<00:04:00.650> there's<00:04:01.340> no<00:04:01.489> point

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
attach there's just me there's no point

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.690 
attach there's just me there's no point
and<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:02.690> just<00:04:02.870> have<00:04:03.049> to<00:04:03.079> kind<00:04:03.889> of<00:04:03.980> hold<00:04:04.489> onto

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
and you just have to kind of hold onto

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.059 
and you just have to kind of hold onto
the<00:04:04.940> clamp<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.510> just<00:04:06.500> think<00:04:06.769> of<00:04:06.889> something

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
the clamp and just think of something

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.099 
the clamp and just think of something
else<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.489> do<00:04:07.639> for<00:04:07.670> a<00:04:08.150> couple<00:04:08.720> of<00:04:08.750> minutes

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
else to do for a couple of minutes

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.119 
else to do for a couple of minutes
because<00:04:09.700> you<00:04:11.500> really<00:04:12.500> do<00:04:12.650> need<00:04:12.799> to<00:04:12.859> make<00:04:13.069> sure

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
because you really do need to make sure

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.270 
because you really do need to make sure
that<00:04:13.760> you<00:04:13.909> wait<00:04:14.060> until<00:04:14.389> it<00:04:14.780> is<00:04:14.989> gone<00:04:15.859> almost

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
that you wait until it is gone almost

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.129 
that you wait until it is gone almost
clear<00:04:16.820> before<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.239> try<00:04:17.510> and<00:04:17.630> touch<00:04:17.810> it<00:04:18.079> I

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
clear before you try and touch it I

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.759 
clear before you try and touch it I
think<00:04:18.440> this<00:04:18.530> is<00:04:18.590> ready<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:19.190> go<00:04:19.669> on<00:04:19.699> though

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
think this is ready to go on though

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.420 
think this is ready to go on though
fingers<00:04:21.769> crossed

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
fingers crossed

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.000 
fingers crossed
work<00:04:22.820> for<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.180> camera<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:26.690> what<00:04:27.620> you<00:04:27.740> want<00:04:27.949> to

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
work for the camera so what you want to

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.939 
work for the camera so what you want to
make<00:04:28.220> sure<00:04:28.250> is<00:04:28.760> you're<00:04:29.210> not<00:04:29.300> gonna<00:04:29.449> put<00:04:29.750> it<00:04:29.840> on

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
make sure is you're not gonna put it on

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.659 
make sure is you're not gonna put it on
anywhere<00:04:30.949> near<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.550> tear<00:04:32.300> duct<00:04:32.599> because<00:04:33.669> it

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
anywhere near the tear duct because it

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.600 
anywhere near the tear duct because it
just<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:36.110> tear<00:04:36.320> duct<00:04:36.500> just<00:04:36.800> gets<00:04:37.010> moist<00:04:37.250> and

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
just the tear duct just gets moist and

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:56.480 
just the tear duct just gets moist and
it<00:04:37.760> makes<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.240> eyelash<00:04:38.780> fall<00:04:39.080> off<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.620> just

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.720 

so<00:04:57.030> you<00:04:57.090> can<00:04:57.270> see<00:04:57.419> there

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
so you can see there

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.600 
so you can see there
I<00:04:58.840> left<00:05:00.580> and<00:05:01.580> it's<00:05:01.700> really<00:05:02.000> nice<00:05:02.180> and<00:05:02.600> bubbly

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
I left and it's really nice and bubbly
