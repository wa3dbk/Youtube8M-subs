 for wine or something that is 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.429

 we have been friends for a few years 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.630
 I know that Abruzzo 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.119
 started producing these slowly 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.160
 very good wines and sent some 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.460
 bottles a few years ago 2 2 or 3 years 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.320
 does 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.350
 I have now started a new business

 for prague qui milano then I need 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.320
 to take everything in striano 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.450
 will be the desire to make me a wine of 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.630
 quality 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.180
 all two Abruzzese here 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.160
 a very strong in everything he does to 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.060
 a manic cure I said if he tells me 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.210
 of serious 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.980
 we talk 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.910
 but this is one of despair 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.070
 all-Italian passion could your 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.989
 no it's all line wife because it's all 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.330
 this idea comes from the discourse 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.909
 the para Restaurants and notes that 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.130
 I'm helping because it would be nice 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.710
 my fans ranging local snow 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.400
 nails I never know product and you of 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.820
 this experience 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.260
 what kind of pressure you had to go and the 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.520
 the first time I come to vinitaly is the 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.560
 first time I do something 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.220
 similar and very funny I like it 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.500
 space also open two more 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.130
 next year I am 30 years old 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.020
 porn movies 30 so I said to myself 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.450
 many years I just did that then 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.430
 I said open a little open for me 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.230
 ask the world but will have between 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.930
 perspective this wine is not bad 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.560
 then who knows feelings of this 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.800
 this is passion and sweat that 6 30 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.980
 years of study and fun 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.140
 then the slogan I really like the slogan 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.630
 not just magno because it means boys 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.630
 can entertain with any size 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.520
 we went to look for the producer 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.260
 we found another character 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.860
 this propensity is this trulli 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.620
 to the production of quality is part 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.310
 of a family or family heritage 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.400
 something that calmly cultivated her 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.830
 I would say that we have upset a 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.840
 assimilate the concepts that were related a 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.620
 bit of Abruzzo wine 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.959
 regarding perception 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.530
 general of Abruzzo wine in the world 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.550
 in the sense that I proposed myself in 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.200
 panorama 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.270
 world food and wine 12 years ago with 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.430
 many difficulties because I came 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.830
 from the abruzzo a land if not ever 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.960
 great level of wines because 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.600
 we have a montepulciano a product 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.060
 extraordinary but that has not been in 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.170
 past treated pretty well ie 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.970
 linked to the territory 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.190
 yes today instead things have changed 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.950
 this is not thanks to me but thanks to 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.060
 fact that however the producers 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.310
 Abruzzese have increasingly understood that 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.560
 having a subject available 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.500
 first of great quality could be done 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.030
 a great wine and that's how it is today 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.400
 same power castro years that it always has 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.240
 aimed at quality, it finds itself again 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.630
 leader 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:26.680
 along with many others in the field of 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:29.140
 reno in the food and wine sector a 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.240
 worldwide level with regard to the 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.750
 choosing the choice to say that it was 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:38.410
 also a little due since I always have 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.830
 represented Abruzzo and Italy in the 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.989
 world with not only my image 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.230
 as pilots formula 1 but for many others 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.000
 activity and therefore this choice was 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.800
 managed by the fact that I didn't want to 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.050
 alight 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.810
 with wines dimas take the field with 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.450
 mass wines but I wanted to bring the 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.070
 Italian and Abruzzo quality than this 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.800
 experience the vinitaly as you are 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.450
 revealing but like every positive year it is 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.850
 I have been coming here for many years now 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.010
 we have always taken home then months 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.350
 now I'm at home right here at the fair 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.090
 however, I do not go beyond why among other things 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.299
 the fair is a very long day e 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.330
 demanding are three or four days 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.980
 we have an international panorama that 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
 so he comes to visit us in Italy 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.060
 therefore also the trade fair institution that makes a 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.240
 great job should be proud of 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.490
 this great event 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.199
 I had ten minutes ago they left 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.610
 of Japanese distributors but in hand 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.130
 the whole world to come and see us 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.990
 because why we are probably in 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.210
 one of the best but I don't say us 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.910
 Italy is among the best among the best 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.569
 as producers as a system in the 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.569
 enogastronomes
