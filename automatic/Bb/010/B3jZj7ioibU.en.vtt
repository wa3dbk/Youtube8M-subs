00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.060 

recently<00:00:01.020> I<00:00:01.079> picked<00:00:01.319> up<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.530> digital<00:00:01.890> timer

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
recently I picked up a digital timer

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.830 
recently I picked up a digital timer
remote<00:00:02.370> for<00:00:02.700> some<00:00:02.820> macro<00:00:03.090> photography<00:00:03.240> and

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
remote for some macro photography and

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.150 
remote for some macro photography and
while<00:00:03.959> I've<00:00:04.049> been<00:00:04.230> very<00:00:04.380> happy<00:00:04.500> with<00:00:04.799> you<00:00:04.950> know

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
while I've been very happy with you know

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.920 
while I've been very happy with you know
I<00:00:05.310> think<00:00:05.490> it's<00:00:05.580> very<00:00:05.819> strange<00:00:06.330> that<00:00:06.629> it

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
I think it's very strange that it

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.960 
I think it's very strange that it
doesn't<00:00:07.230> come<00:00:07.350> with<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.560> power<00:00:07.830> off<00:00:08.010> button<00:00:08.040> now

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
doesn't come with a power off button now

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.150 
doesn't come with a power off button now
the<00:00:09.660> back<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.990> this<00:00:10.050> device<00:00:10.410> says<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.950> has<00:00:11.130> a

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
the back of this device says that has a

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.339 
the back of this device says that has a
current<00:00:11.429> draw<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.759> 20<00:00:12.030> milliamps<00:00:12.599> but<00:00:13.049> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
current draw of 20 milliamps but the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.200 
current draw of 20 milliamps but the
device<00:00:13.620> line<00:00:13.860> takes<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.250> triple-a<00:00:14.759> batteries

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
device line takes to triple-a batteries

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.910 
device line takes to triple-a batteries
so<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.049> just<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.440> matter<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.680> poor

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
so is this just a matter of poor

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.710 
so is this just a matter of poor
engineering<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.490> did<00:00:17.760> only<00:00:17.910> buy<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.510> five

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
541 my cramps this device really doesn't

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.120 
541 my cramps this device really doesn't
need<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.909> power<00:01:36.240> switch<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:37.170> I'm<00:01:37.619> sure<00:01:37.950> at<00:01:38.070> some

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
need a power switch but I'm sure at some

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.410 
need a power switch but I'm sure at some
point<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.520> time<00:01:38.549> I'm<00:01:38.759> going<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.970> accidentally

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
point in time I'm going to accidentally

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.330 
point in time I'm going to accidentally
leave<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.049> some<00:01:40.350> type<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.590> actress<00:01:41.100> state

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
leave it in some type of actress state

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.700 
leave it in some type of actress state
and<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.210> rating<00:01:42.540> here<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.110> truly<00:01:43.560> accurate

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
and if the rating here is truly accurate

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.319 
and if the rating here is truly accurate
that<00:01:44.130> means<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.579> device<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.060> going<00:01:45.240> to

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
that means that this device is going to

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.139 
that means that this device is going to
be<00:01:45.420> dead<00:01:45.689> within<00:01:45.960> two<00:01:46.380> days<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.310> let's<00:01:47.880> take

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
be dead within two days so let's take

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.670 
be dead within two days so let's take
this<00:01:48.299> apart<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.840> see<00:01:49.110> how<00:01:49.259> hard<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.619> is

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
this apart and see how hard this is

00:01:49.680 --> 00:02:00.990 
this apart and see how hard this is
going<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.250> add<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> switch

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.700 

so<00:02:02.000> after<00:02:02.120> opening<00:02:02.540> this<00:02:02.720> up<00:02:02.870> I<00:02:03.050> can<00:02:03.230> see<00:02:03.410> that

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
so after opening this up I can see that

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.080 
so after opening this up I can see that
the<00:02:03.950> positive<00:02:04.610> terminal<00:02:04.760> of<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.030> battery

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
the positive terminal of the battery

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.240 
the positive terminal of the battery
connects<00:02:05.810> through<00:02:06.020> this<00:02:06.260> trace<00:02:06.620> and<00:02:06.890> then<00:02:07.010> out

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
connects through this trace and then out

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.070 
connects through this trace and then out
for<00:02:07.310> your<00:02:07.670> rest<00:02:07.850> of<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.060> circuit<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.600> think

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
for your rest of the circuit I think

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.450 
for your rest of the circuit I think
that<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:09.350> should<00:02:09.530> be<00:02:09.650> a<00:02:09.680> prime<00:02:09.979> spot<00:02:10.160> to

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
that this should be a prime spot to

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.520 
that this should be a prime spot to
actually<00:02:10.790> has<00:02:10.880> a<00:02:10.910> switch<00:02:11.270> from<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.140> previous

project<00:02:12.710> I<00:02:12.980> had<00:02:13.130> one<00:02:13.280> of<00:02:13.370> these<00:02:13.460> tiny<00:02:13.760> switches

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
project I had one of these tiny switches
