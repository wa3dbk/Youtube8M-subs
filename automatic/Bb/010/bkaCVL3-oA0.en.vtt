00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
saying that Pocky is the same thing as

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.640

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
video to clarify that they are in fact

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.580 
video to clarify that they are in fact
two<00:00:19.980> quite<00:00:20.490> different<00:00:20.760> things<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:22.260> am

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
two quite different things and I am

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.429 
two quite different things and I am
going<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:23.160> show<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.640> guys<00:00:23.880> why<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.630> then<00:00:25.199> I'm

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
going to show you guys why and then I'm

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.929 
going to show you guys why and then I'm
gonna<00:00:25.710> tell<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.010> guys<00:00:26.039> which<00:00:26.369> one<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.519> think<00:00:26.640> is

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
gonna tell you guys which one I think is

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.029 
gonna tell you guys which one I think is
the<00:00:27.090> best<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.900> first<00:00:28.170> off<00:00:28.380> there's<00:00:28.650> how<00:00:28.980> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
the best so first off there's how the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.580 
the best so first off there's how the
boxes<00:00:29.670> look<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.019> obviously<00:00:31.320> Pocky

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
boxes look and this is obviously Pocky

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.709 
boxes look and this is obviously Pocky
and<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.309> Mikado<00:00:32.730> when<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.300> opened<00:00:33.660> them

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
and this is Mikado when you opened them

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.690 
and this is Mikado when you opened them
up<00:00:33.899> they<00:00:34.110> are<00:00:34.140> fairly<00:00:34.500> similar<00:00:34.890> if<00:00:35.280> they<00:00:35.460> both

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
up they are fairly similar if they both

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.580 
up they are fairly similar if they both
open<00:00:35.940> at<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> top<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.870> then<00:00:37.050> there<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.350> a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
open at the top and then there is a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.819 
open at the top and then there is a
sealed<00:00:37.950> bag<00:00:38.250> inside<00:00:38.850> or<00:00:39.420> at<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> biscuits<00:00:40.170> but

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
sealed bag inside or at the biscuits but

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.830 
sealed bag inside or at the biscuits but
inside<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.700> where<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.059> real<00:00:42.239> difference<00:00:42.660> is

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
inside is where the real difference is

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.069 
inside is where the real difference is
as<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.440> can<00:00:43.620> hopefully<00:00:43.800> see<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.820> Pocky<00:00:45.750> which

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
as you can hopefully see the Pocky which

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.470 
as you can hopefully see the Pocky which
is<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.590> one<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.239> considerably<00:00:48.239> darker

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
is this one is considerably darker

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.750 
is this one is considerably darker
whereas<00:00:49.170> The<00:00:49.379> Mikado<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:50.010> quite<00:00:50.280> light<00:00:50.520> and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
whereas The Mikado it's quite light and

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.000 
whereas The Mikado it's quite light and
when<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.449> line<00:00:51.660> them<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.440> Pocky<00:00:52.710> is

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
when you line them up the Pocky is

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.610 
when you line them up the Pocky is
actually<00:00:53.489> slightly<00:00:54.090> longer<00:00:54.510> now<00:00:55.170> apart<00:00:55.500> from

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
actually slightly longer now apart from

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.590 
actually slightly longer now apart from
just<00:00:55.770> looking<00:00:56.010> different<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.969> biscuits

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
just looking different the biscuits

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.090 
just looking different the biscuits
actually<00:00:57.930> contain<00:00:58.260> different<00:00:58.410> ingredients

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
actually contain different ingredients

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.369 
actually contain different ingredients
as<00:00:59.219> well<00:00:59.250> Pocky<00:01:00.210> actually<00:01:00.899> contains

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
as well Pocky actually contains

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.139 
as well Pocky actually contains
shortening<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.250> they<00:01:02.640> use<00:01:02.789> whole<00:01:03.120> milk

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
shortening and they use whole milk

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.299 
shortening and they use whole milk
instead<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.660> skim<00:01:03.960> milk<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.589> well<00:01:04.650> as<00:01:05.070> adding

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
instead of skim milk as well as adding

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.250 
instead of skim milk as well as adding
sweetened<00:01:05.850> condensed<00:01:06.270> milk<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.810> coffee

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
sweetened condensed milk and coffee

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.880 
sweetened condensed milk and coffee
powder

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
powder

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.950 
powder
this<00:01:08.280> means<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.670> Pocky<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.180> slightly<00:01:09.630> more

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
this means that Pocky is slightly more

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.260 
this means that Pocky is slightly more
unhealthy<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.950> contains<00:01:11.340> more<00:01:11.700> fat<00:01:12.060> and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
unhealthy as it contains more fat and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.960 
unhealthy as it contains more fat and
roughly<00:01:13.170> 25<00:01:13.680> calories<00:01:13.979> more<00:01:14.400> per<00:01:14.610> hundred

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
roughly 25 calories more per hundred

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.960 
roughly 25 calories more per hundred
grams<00:01:15.439> frankly<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.680> don't<00:01:17.159> really<00:01:17.400> care<00:01:17.820> about

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
grams frankly I don't really care about

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.149 
grams frankly I don't really care about
that<00:01:18.270> kind<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.600> stuff<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:19.140> maybe<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.680> guys<00:01:19.860> do

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
that kind of stuff but maybe you guys do

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.920 
that kind of stuff but maybe you guys do
so<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.369> thought<00:01:20.610> I'd<00:01:20.790> let<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.000> know<00:01:21.150> since<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
so I thought I'd let you know since the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.179 
so I thought I'd let you know since the
ingredients<00:01:22.439> are<00:01:22.560> different<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:23.040> also

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
ingredients are different that also

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.280 
ingredients are different that also
means<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.700> taste<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.210> different<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.990> I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
means that the taste is different and I

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.410 
means that the taste is different and I
am<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.920> dedicated<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.640> my<00:01:26.939> work<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.390> didn't<00:01:27.810> very

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
am so dedicated to my work I didn't very

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.680 
am so dedicated to my work I didn't very
sense<00:01:28.659> of<00:01:28.900> taste<00:01:29.110> test<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.850> Pocky<00:01:31.270> has<00:01:31.420> much

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
sense of taste test the Pocky has much

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.060 
sense of taste test the Pocky has much
darker<00:01:32.080> chocolate<00:01:32.110> true<00:01:32.620> and<00:01:32.830> a<00:01:32.860> slight

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
darker chocolate true and a slight

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.860 
darker chocolate true and a slight
bitter<00:01:33.370> taste<00:01:33.700> and<00:01:33.970> I<00:01:34.090> can<00:01:34.300> definitely<00:01:34.450> tell

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
bitter taste and I can definitely tell

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.050 
bitter taste and I can definitely tell
that<00:01:34.930> it's<00:01:35.290> made<00:01:35.590> with<00:01:35.830> coffee<00:01:36.190> powder<00:01:36.490> the

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
that it's made with coffee powder the

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.270 
that it's made with coffee powder the
biscuit<00:01:37.510> itself<00:01:37.869> has<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:38.170> lot<00:01:38.470> less<00:01:38.710> taste<00:01:39.040> than

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
biscuit itself has a lot less taste than

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.010 
biscuit itself has a lot less taste than
the<00:01:39.369> one<00:01:39.520> from<00:01:39.760> The<00:01:39.940> Mikado<00:01:40.240> of<00:01:40.479> stick<00:01:40.810> and

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
the one from The Mikado of stick and

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.719 
the one from The Mikado of stick and
overall<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.770> chocolate<00:01:42.159> has<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.430> slightly

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
overall the chocolate has a slightly

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.719 
overall the chocolate has a slightly
more<00:01:42.970> synthetic<00:01:43.210> taster<00:01:44.369> now<00:01:45.369> when<00:01:45.520> it<00:01:45.610> comes

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
more synthetic taster now when it comes

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.940 
more synthetic taster now when it comes

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
a lot sweeter and in my opinion in case

from UK also anything milk chocolate
which<00:02:00.520> would<00:02:00.670> explain<00:02:00.940> why<00:02:01.210> it<00:02:01.360> tastes<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.899> lot

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
which would explain why it tastes a lot

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.070 
which would explain why it tastes a lot
sweeter<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.700> big<00:02:03.880> question<00:02:04.300> is<00:02:04.420> which<00:02:04.899> one

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
sweeter so the big question is which one

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.520 
sweeter so the big question is which one
is<00:02:05.110> better

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
is better

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.520

few of my friends and they chose The
Mikado<00:02:16.080> thinking<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.350> was<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.650> Pocky<00:02:17.890> so

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
Mikado thinking that it was the Pocky so

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.449 
Mikado thinking that it was the Pocky so
it<00:02:19.269> really<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:19.930> just<00:02:20.470> up<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.800> personal<00:02:21.280> taste

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459
