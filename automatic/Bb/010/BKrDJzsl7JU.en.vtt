with of course plants and zombies and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.119 
with of course plants and zombies and
there<00:00:49.050> are<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> variety<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.590> different<00:00:49.680> plants

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
in a variety of different zombies and

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.990 
in a variety of different zombies and
it's<00:00:52.230> kind<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.710> strategy<00:00:53.399> type<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.820> thing

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
it's kind of a strategy type of thing

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.819 
it's kind of a strategy type of thing
the<00:00:54.329> plants<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.780> different<00:00:55.110> abilities<00:00:55.289> and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
the plants have different abilities and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.549 
the plants have different abilities and
the<00:00:56.460> zombies<00:00:56.640> do<00:00:57.059> as<00:00:57.239> well<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.899> i<00:00:58.530> think

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
the zombies do as well and i think

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.619 
the zombies do as well and i think
putting<00:00:59.039> them<00:00:59.190> together<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> shooter<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.059> a

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
putting them together in a shooter is a

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.529 
putting them together in a shooter is a
great<00:01:01.109> combination<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.129> i'm<00:01:03.059> glad<00:01:03.420> they

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539

but i'm hoping the dlc they introduced

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.110 
but i'm hoping the dlc they introduced
to<00:04:24.650> this<00:04:24.770> game<00:04:25.010> it<00:04:25.190> gives<00:04:25.370> it<00:04:25.490> some<00:04:25.670> more<00:04:25.700> depth

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
to this game it gives it some more depth

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.520 
to this game it gives it some more depth
because<00:04:26.300> there<00:04:26.570> is<00:04:26.690> only<00:04:26.810> three<00:04:26.900> moles<00:04:27.290> like<00:04:27.500> i

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530
