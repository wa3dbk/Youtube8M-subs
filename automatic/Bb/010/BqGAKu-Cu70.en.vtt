00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.889
 i 

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.769
 let's start with a stuffed banana 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.930
 of picadillo that is they know what it is that 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:11.510
 would be eaten in Cuban in how you eat the 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.790
 picadillo then they are made in croquettes 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.710
 they make little balls this time we're going to 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.910
 make it easier because the roll to 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.619
 make these banana croquettes there 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.480
 to drive a little bit banana 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.579
 I want to give them a little more option 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.769
 easy to make they can follow 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.539
 having the potassium that the banana has 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.009
 and it will give us a side as to 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.390
 incorporate it but that was facilitated 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.270
 then we give you ingredients of this 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.860
 Cuban recipe 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.860
 for this recipe we will use 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.090
 two spoonfuls of olive oil 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.820

 without seeds and chopped salt and pepper 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.120
 taste 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.470
 oil to fry the amount needed 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.560
 and 4 male bananas without skin and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.110
 slightly open halfway we're going to 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.700
 put a little oil in this pan 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.310
 where are we going to fry here are we going to fry 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.070
 the meat and on that side we're going to do the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.080
 fried banana then let's put a 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.450
 little more oil unfortunately today 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.250
 it hits me but what am I going to do good 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.250
 we unite good 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.050
 today it's our turn today to touch this sin of 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.990
 Once in a while it's good we're going to love 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.180
 here the onion 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.680
 I'm going to be putting I'm going to get this out 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.060
 of the fire because with that of the 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.380
 hurt already after the last plan b 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.380
 what I did buy 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.170
 is going to put the banana here 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.479
 start frying too 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.159
 and we return it to the light slowly 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.820
 well here they are and golden onion 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.250
 I love this really this 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.760
 pans as they are good caray is 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.470
 today and so fast 12 dora good now 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.430
 let's add 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.430
 garlic 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.810
 and from here it is already chopped 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.510
 and now let's add the beef 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.890
 they want to see a guy happens to them 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.220
 when you ask for your beef 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.640
 milled three times 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.060
 they taste meat richer 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.430
 the banana in 23 accounts I go to 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.160
 remove from fire this here meat and 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.260
 is releasing its juice at that time 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.209
 we will collect everything that is stuck 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.400
 in the pan taking advantage of the same juice 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.709
 of the meat and now we are going to 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.480
 incorporate a bit of tomato puree 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.350
 now in house as it is a puree of 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.620
 tomato 4 tomatoes 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.580
 a quarter of onion two tablespoons of 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.860
 this senator the dust 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.790
 and if they want quantity of coriander to 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.170
 Taste it kuan reads and so it will be 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.790
 that's how fast you make a put has not 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.250
 case have them bought and it's cheaper 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.270
 do it at home and so easy to do 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.130
 let's also add the raisins 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.400
 that because it is a food that is 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.720
 dehydrated because it has more calories 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.890
 but it does not have effect has 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.690
 sorry has this beta carotene 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.590
 and we're going to add a little bit of 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.590
 olive 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.880
 and here we leave 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.780
 to take a tree with the banana and 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.330
 I'm here I already have some facts that 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.690
 my guys helped me do here is 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.690
 the banana 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.460
 good pimp of pretty beautiful yes or no 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.569
 this is how it has to be 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.999
 let's make one 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.460
 it seems to them we are going to put a little 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:56.370
 meat 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:00.530
 but how fast is this done? 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:04.110
 and this we are going to garnish with a banana 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.200
 and we mix it in agreement 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.070
 and so we're a little bit more 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.070
 meat that this really 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.989
 a little more meat and that's how 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.139
 stay with this they think we're going a cut 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.139
 do not leave because we come back more
