and the system were using to compare

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.780 
and the system were using to compare
them<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.680> second<00:01:26.040> will<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.160> some<00:01:26.460> finger

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
their pickups they seem to think that

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.630 
their pickups they seem to think that
everyone<00:01:53.790> wants<00:01:54.210> them<00:01:54.360> which<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.020> pretty<00:01:55.259> true

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
everyone wants them which is pretty true

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.520 
everyone wants them which is pretty true
the<00:01:56.640> pickup<00:01:57.330> isn't<00:01:57.600> really<00:01:58.080> available

outside<00:01:58.770> Cole<00:01:59.490> Clark<00:01:59.790> guitars<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.420> don't

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
outside Cole Clark guitars and I don't

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.360 
outside Cole Clark guitars and I don't
think<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.930> can<00:02:01.080> buy<00:02:01.260> it<00:02:01.320> separately<00:02:01.830> so<00:02:02.310> you

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
think you can buy it separately so you

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.130 
think you can buy it separately so you
might<00:02:02.580> wonder<00:02:02.790> why<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.150> compared<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.720> pick<00:02:03.960> up

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
might wonder why I compared this pick up

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.380 
might wonder why I compared this pick up
with<00:02:04.650> what's<00:02:04.920> quite<00:02:05.280> clearly<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.700> retrofit

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
with what's quite clearly a retrofit

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.050 
with what's quite clearly a retrofit
sound<00:02:06.750> Hapuku<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.620> the<00:02:08.070> reason<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
sound Hapuku and the reason is that the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.150 
sound Hapuku and the reason is that the
Cole<00:02:09.420> Clark<00:02:09.780> face<00:02:10.050> blend<00:02:10.380> is<00:02:10.590> considered<00:02:11.040> by

really good players that use their

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.790 
really good players that use their

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
system so the system costs around $400 I

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.590 
system so the system costs around $400 I
figured<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.489> out<00:02:26.519> by<00:02:26.820> looking<00:02:26.850> at<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.269> lower

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
figured that out by looking at the lower

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.180 
figured that out by looking at the lower
end<00:02:27.810> Cole<00:02:28.019> Clark's<00:02:28.410> which<00:02:28.590> comes<00:02:28.920> standard

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
end Cole Clark's which comes standard

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.979 
end Cole Clark's which comes standard
with<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.730> without<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.120> pickup<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.630> same

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
with and without the pickup so same

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.290 
with and without the pickup so same
guitar<00:02:31.170> same<00:02:31.620> woods<00:02:31.890> same<00:02:32.550> everything<00:02:32.820> except

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
guitar same woods same everything except

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.330 
guitar same woods same everything except
the<00:02:33.360> pickup<00:02:33.660> there's<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.870> $400<00:02:34.410> difference<00:02:34.769> so

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
the pickup there's a $400 difference so

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.680 
the pickup there's a $400 difference so
that's<00:02:35.459> what<00:02:35.640> you'll<00:02:35.790> pay<00:02:36.000> for<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.269> one<00:02:36.450> and

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
that's what you'll pay for this one and

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.380 
that's what you'll pay for this one and
it's<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.470> blending<00:02:37.830> style<00:02:38.130> pickup<00:02:38.489> which<00:02:39.150> means

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
it's a blending style pickup which means

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.420 
it's a blending style pickup which means
it's<00:02:39.540> got<00:02:39.690> two<00:02:40.049> sound<00:02:40.350> sources<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:41.070> first<00:02:41.280> of

it's got two sound sources the first of

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.789

Clark<00:03:28.689> angel<00:03:29.170> in<00:03:29.829> my<00:03:29.890> opinion<00:03:30.459> is<00:03:30.579> probably

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
Clark angel in my opinion is probably

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.270 
Clark angel in my opinion is probably
their<00:03:31.239> best<00:03:31.540> sounding<00:03:32.170> acoustic<00:03:32.709> guitar<00:03:32.980> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
their best sounding acoustic guitar the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.059 
their best sounding acoustic guitar the
other<00:03:33.730> two<00:03:34.090> or<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.230> other<00:03:35.349> models<00:03:35.680> rather<00:03:35.829> the

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
other two or the other models rather the

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.580 
other two or the other models rather the
fat<00:03:36.250> ladies<00:03:36.609> one<00:03:36.909> two<00:03:37.090> and<00:03:37.180> three<00:03:37.390> I<00:03:37.420> think

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
fat ladies one two and three I think

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.670 
fat ladies one two and three I think
sound<00:03:38.590> pretty<00:03:38.980> good<00:03:39.069> plugged<00:03:39.819> in<00:03:40.030> but<00:03:40.420> just

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
sound pretty good plugged in but just

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.990 
sound pretty good plugged in but just
acoustically<00:03:41.680> they're<00:03:41.859> quite<00:03:42.099> thin<00:03:42.370> I'll

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
acoustically they're quite thin I'll

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.349 
acoustically they're quite thin I'll
just<00:03:43.150> play<00:03:43.269> this<00:03:43.299> one<00:03:43.569> quite<00:03:43.750> quickly<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:46.209> can

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
just play this one quite quickly you can

00:03:46.359 --> 00:04:02.370 
just play this one quite quickly you can
hear<00:03:46.510> it's<00:03:46.629> got<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.810> feathered<00:03:47.170> bass

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.960 

so<00:04:02.980> in<00:04:03.100> my<00:04:03.250> opinion<00:04:03.550> that's<00:04:03.640> a<00:04:03.760> fairly

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
so in my opinion that's a fairly

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.640 
so in my opinion that's a fairly
balanced<00:04:04.390> time<00:04:04.630> particularly<00:04:04.990> for<00:04:05.170> an<00:04:05.320> OEM

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
balanced time particularly for an OEM

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.500 
balanced time particularly for an OEM
size<00:04:05.890> guitarist<00:04:06.400> not<00:04:06.550> a<00:04:06.580> dreadnought<00:04:06.850> so<00:04:07.270> it's

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
size guitarist not a dreadnought so it's

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.950 
size guitarist not a dreadnought so it's
got<00:04:07.660> a<00:04:07.690> fair<00:04:07.990> bit<00:04:08.080> of<00:04:08.140> bass<00:04:08.320> for<00:04:09.220> its<00:04:09.430> size<00:04:09.960> so

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
got a fair bit of bass for its size so

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.440 
got a fair bit of bass for its size so
that's<00:04:11.140> this<00:04:11.380> guitar<00:04:11.800> the<00:04:12.550> other<00:04:12.580> pickup<00:04:13.090> that

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
that's this guitar the other pickup that
