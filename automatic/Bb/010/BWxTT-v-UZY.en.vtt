you capture a specific flag and we

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.660 
you capture a specific flag and we
already<00:02:19.200> knew<00:02:19.319> this<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:20.099> know<00:02:20.220> would<00:02:20.370> be<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
already knew this you know would be the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.309 
already knew this you know would be the
case<00:02:20.790> with<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.060> gunship<00:02:21.450> but<00:02:21.930> now<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.200> looks

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
case with the gunship but now it looks

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.559 
case with the gunship but now it looks
like<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.769> tank<00:02:23.129> destroyers<00:02:23.730> will<00:02:24.239> also

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
like the tank destroyers will also

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.449 
like the tank destroyers will also
become<00:02:24.750> available<00:02:25.140> after<00:02:25.920> capturing<00:02:26.310> a

certain<00:02:26.760> flag<00:02:26.970> as<00:02:27.120> well<00:02:28.519> so<00:02:29.519> i'll<00:02:29.640> describe

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
certain flag as well so i'll describe

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.860 
certain flag as well so i'll describe
what<00:02:30.569> tank<00:02:30.810> destroyers<00:02:31.140> are<00:02:31.290> after<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:33.660> quad

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
what tank destroyers are after the quad

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.809 
what tank destroyers are after the quad
bikes<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.470> regular<00:02:34.920> tanks<00:02:35.310> are<00:02:35.430> going<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.700> be

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
bikes and regular tanks are going to be

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.910 
bikes and regular tanks are going to be
available<00:02:36.090> in<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.510> home<00:02:36.690> base<00:02:36.900> as<00:02:37.200> though<00:02:37.410> so

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
available in the home base as though so

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.920 
available in the home base as though so
it<00:02:38.040> looks<00:02:38.250> like<00:02:38.370> those<00:02:38.819> quad<00:02:39.239> bikes<00:02:39.540> are<00:02:39.780> going

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
it looks like those quad bikes are going

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.960 
it looks like those quad bikes are going
to<00:02:40.049> come<00:02:40.230> very<00:02:40.470> useful<00:02:40.980> as<00:02:41.130> players<00:02:41.459> race<00:02:41.700> to

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
to come very useful as players race to

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.000 
to come very useful as players race to
jump<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.720> get<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.410> other<00:02:43.500> vehicles

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
jump in to get to the other vehicles

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.059 
jump in to get to the other vehicles
before<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.790> other<00:02:44.910> team<00:02:45.150> takes<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.540> flag

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
before the other team takes the flag

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.620 
before the other team takes the flag
such<00:02:47.069> a<00:02:47.099> break<00:02:47.370> away<00:02:47.519> from<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:47.849> again<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.269> you

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
such a break away from it again that you

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.559 
such a break away from it again that you
can<00:02:48.780> basically<00:02:48.959> just<00:02:49.290> imagine<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.769> know<00:02:50.569> quad

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
biking it and apparently you can jump on

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.039 
biking it and apparently you can jump on
a<00:02:53.130> quad<00:02:53.519> bike<00:02:53.549> with<00:02:54.150> your<00:02:54.329> mate<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.870> know
