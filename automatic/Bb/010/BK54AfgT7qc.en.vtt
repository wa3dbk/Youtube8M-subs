this is a sprint power blaster and it

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.400 
this is a sprint power blaster and it

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
was made in 1994 I believe that's why it

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.240 
was made in 1994 I believe that's why it
says<00:00:19.680> 0<00:00:19.830> over<00:00:20.250> here<00:00:20.810> 1994<00:00:21.810> kena<00:00:22.109> made<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:22.980> China

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
says 0 over here 1994 kena made in China

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.640 
says 0 over here 1994 kena made in China
I'll<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:24.150> go<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.689> blaster<00:00:25.080> first<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.439> got

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
I'll just go to the blaster first I got

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.970 
I'll just go to the blaster first I got
this<00:00:25.920> about<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.119> month<00:00:27.300> ago<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.810> actually<00:00:28.439> came

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
this about a month ago and actually came

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.740 
this about a month ago and actually came
chipped<00:00:29.400> over<00:00:29.730> here<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.449> was<00:00:30.570> quite

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
chipped over here so that was quite

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.120 
chipped over here so that was quite
unfortunate<00:00:31.640> however<00:00:32.640> still<00:00:33.149> performs

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
unfortunate however still performs

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.280 
unfortunate however still performs
perfectly<00:00:35.130> fine<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.030> there's<00:00:36.540> no<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.079> does

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
perfectly fine and there's no it does

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.440 
perfectly fine and there's no it does
not<00:00:37.440> affect<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.860> performance<00:00:38.460> at<00:00:38.640> all<00:00:38.760> this

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
not affect this performance at all this

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.970 
not affect this performance at all this
plaster<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.050> actually<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> spring<00:00:40.800> power

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
plaster is actually a spring power

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.240 
plaster is actually a spring power
blaster<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.050> before<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.079> receive<00:00:44.010> this

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
blaster and before I receive this

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.000 
blaster and before I receive this
blaster<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.940> was<00:00:45.690> not<00:00:45.960> too<00:00:46.140> sure<00:00:46.350> how<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.739> worked

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
blaster I was not too sure how it worked

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.430 
blaster I was not too sure how it worked
actually<00:00:47.450> but<00:00:48.450> after<00:00:48.600> playing<00:00:48.899> around<00:00:49.230> with

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
actually but after playing around with

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.080 
actually but after playing around with
it<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.829> found<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.190> quite<00:00:50.250> fun<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.820> interesting

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
it I found it quite fun and interesting

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.779 
it I found it quite fun and interesting
I<00:00:52.079> would<00:00:52.469> say<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.829> blaster<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.430> actually<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
I would say this blaster is actually a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.700 
I would say this blaster is actually a
combination<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.870> nerve<00:00:55.050> wretched<00:00:55.469> blast

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
combination of the nerve wretched blast

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.060 
combination of the nerve wretched blast
and<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:57.239> North<00:00:57.449> arrow<00:00:57.750> stop<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.039> will

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
and the North arrow stop and I will

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.700 
and the North arrow stop and I will
explain<00:00:59.609> why<00:01:00.000> later<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:01.020> I'll<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.170> go<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
explain why later so I'll just go to the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.380 
explain why later so I'll just go to the
blaster<00:01:02.100> very<00:01:02.340> quickly<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.789> front<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.210> has<00:01:03.329> a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
blaster very quickly the front it has a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.320 
blaster very quickly the front it has a
turret<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.960> four-barrel<00:01:04.650> turret<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.330> just

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
turret a four-barrel turret and just

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.320 
turret a four-barrel turret and just
like<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> no<00:01:06.780> French<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.140> blast<00:01:07.409> um<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:09.060> is

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
like the no French a blast um it is

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.289 
like the no French a blast um it is
fixed<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.990> does<00:01:10.920> not<00:01:10.950> rotate<00:01:11.250> unlike<00:01:11.880> your

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
fixed so it does not rotate unlike your

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.670 
fixed so it does not rotate unlike your
air<00:01:13.170> taxi<00:01:13.650> resource<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.400> max<00:01:14.580> no<00:01:15.450> series<00:01:15.900> over

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
air taxi resource for max no series over

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.080 
air taxi resource for max no series over
here<00:01:16.890> i<00:01:16.920> guess<00:01:17.189> i<00:01:17.340> will<00:01:17.400> call<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
here i guess i will call this the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.140 
here i guess i will call this the
priming<00:01:18.509> bar<00:01:18.750> priming<00:01:19.409> grip<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.939> its

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
priming bar priming grip this is in its

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.950 
priming bar priming grip this is in its
collapsed<00:01:21.960> state<00:01:22.740> actually<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.960> rotate

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
collapsed state actually you can rotate

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.679 
collapsed state actually you can rotate
this<00:01:25.350> backwards<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.240> limit<00:01:27.570> is

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
this backwards and it and the limit is

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.190 
this backwards and it and the limit is
around<00:01:28.080> here<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:30.299> way<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.720> blaster

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
around here so the way this blaster

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.630 
around here so the way this blaster
works<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.860> does<00:01:31.950> not<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> trigger

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
works is that it does not have a trigger

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.630 
works is that it does not have a trigger
so<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.450> sort<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.720> slam<00:01:33.960> fire<00:01:34.340> similar<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
so it's sort of slam fire similar to the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.670 
so it's sort of slam fire similar to the
arrow<00:01:35.820> storm<00:01:36.210> once<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.630> hits<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.049> lever<00:01:37.320> right

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
arrow storm once it hits a lever right

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.460 
arrow storm once it hits a lever right
at<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.009> back<00:01:38.310> position<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.810> will<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.170> slam

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
at the back position it will just slam

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.050 
at the back position it will just slam
forward<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.040> fire<00:01:41.250> off<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.820> these

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
forward and fire off one of these

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.139 
forward and fire off one of these
barrels<00:01:42.649> so<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:44.070> reason<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.520> call<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.970> a

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
barrels so the reason I call it a

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.969 
barrels so the reason I call it a
combination<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.229> wretched<00:01:46.530> blast<00:01:46.740> and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
combination of the wretched blast and

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.370 
combination of the wretched blast and
the<00:01:47.009> arrow<00:01:47.250> storm<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.759> because<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.299> similar<00:01:49.290> to

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the arrow storm is because of similar to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.920 
the arrow storm is because of similar to
the<00:01:49.649> wretched<00:01:49.979> blast<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.180> turret<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
the wretched blast of the turret and the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.710 
the wretched blast of the turret and the
front<00:01:52.229> looks<00:01:52.530> very<00:01:52.829> similar<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.600> just<00:01:54.600> like

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
front looks very similar and just like

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.469 
front looks very similar and just like
the<00:01:54.840> Roger<00:01:54.990> blast<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.530> does<00:01:55.710> not<00:01:55.979> rotate<00:01:56.479> why

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
the Roger blast it does not rotate why

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.270 
the Roger blast it does not rotate why
see<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:57.869> like<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.170> arrow<00:01:58.320> storm<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.890> because

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
see it's like the arrow storm is because

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.580 
see it's like the arrow storm is because
of<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.759> firing<00:02:00.090> mechanism<00:02:00.200> such<00:02:01.200> there<00:02:01.439> when

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
of the firing mechanism such there when

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.780 
of the firing mechanism such there when
you're<00:02:01.710> pregnant<00:02:01.860> all<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.130> way<00:02:02.310> back<00:02:02.520> your

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
you're pregnant all the way back your

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.819 
you're pregnant all the way back your
slam<00:02:03.060> forward<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.479> fire<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:04.560> like<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
slam forward and fire just like the

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.590 
slam forward and fire just like the
arrow<00:02:04.950> stop<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.909> be<00:02:06.060> honest<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.540> actually

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
arrow stop and to be honest I actually

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.669 
arrow stop and to be honest I actually
think<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.229> plus<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.890> very<00:02:08.550> very

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
think this plus the very very

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.250 
think this plus the very very
okay<00:02:10.129> I<00:02:10.340> had<00:02:10.849> no<00:02:11.030> intention<00:02:11.540> of<00:02:11.629> getting<00:02:11.840> it<00:02:12.140> at

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
okay I had no intention of getting it at

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.869 
okay I had no intention of getting it at
all<00:02:12.439> however<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:13.069> did<00:02:13.250> come<00:02:13.370> as<00:02:13.519> one<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:13.700> the

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
all however it did come as one of the

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.420 
all however it did come as one of the
blasters<00:02:14.359> in<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.629> loaf<00:02:14.930> lot<00:02:15.319> i<00:02:15.560> purchased<00:02:16.189> so<00:02:16.400> I

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
blasters in a loaf lot i purchased so I

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.459 
blasters in a loaf lot i purchased so I
thought<00:02:16.730> what<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.000> hell<00:02:17.180> I'll<00:02:17.359> just<00:02:17.569> play

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:18.469 
thought what the hell I'll just play

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:20.800 
thought what the hell I'll just play
around<00:02:18.590> with<00:02:18.859> it<00:02:18.950> I<00:02:19.299> still<00:02:20.299> think<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:20.629> ugly

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
around with it I still think it's ugly

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.750 
around with it I still think it's ugly
as<00:02:21.170> hell<00:02:21.409> but<00:02:21.680> it's<00:02:21.890> quite<00:02:22.040> fun<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.280> play<00:02:22.579> with

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
as hell but it's quite fun to play with

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.449 
as hell but it's quite fun to play with
and<00:02:22.939> I<00:02:23.599> guess<00:02:23.659> it<00:02:24.019> could<00:02:24.230> be<00:02:24.409> a<00:02:24.439> very<00:02:25.370> good

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
and I guess it could be a very good

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.420 
and I guess it could be a very good
blaster<00:02:26.180> in<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.569> stock<00:02:26.840> plaster<00:02:27.290> wall<00:02:27.469> I'm<00:02:27.650> not

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
blaster in a stock plaster wall I'm not

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.920 
blaster in a stock plaster wall I'm not
too<00:02:28.609> sure<00:02:28.819> what<00:02:28.969> kind<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.180> modifications<00:02:29.389> can

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
too sure what kind of modifications can

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.899 
too sure what kind of modifications can
be<00:02:29.989> done<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.469> this<00:02:30.620> blaster<00:02:31.189> but<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.430> do<00:02:31.609> not

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
be done to this blaster but I do not

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.780 
be done to this blaster but I do not
really<00:02:32.120> see<00:02:32.389> much<00:02:32.599> potential<00:02:32.989> so<00:02:33.920> anyway<00:02:34.549> on

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
really see much potential so anyway on

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.449 
really see much potential so anyway on
to<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:35.359> firing<00:02:35.659> test<00:02:35.959> I'll<00:02:36.620> be<00:02:36.859> loading<00:02:37.219> this

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
to the firing test I'll be loading this

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.879 
to the firing test I'll be loading this
blaster<00:02:38.090> with<00:02:38.329> 4<00:02:38.780> mega<00:02:39.019> dots<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.859> a

suction cup and to our sonic Whistler
dance<00:02:43.159> I<00:02:43.430> guess<00:02:43.609> that's<00:02:44.150> what<00:02:44.299> you<00:02:44.450> call<00:02:44.480> it

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
dance I guess that's what you call it

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
just going to be firing at the wall and

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.569 
just going to be firing at the wall and
you'll<00:03:06.290> see<00:03:06.530> their<00:03:06.739> time<00:03:07.040> priming<00:03:07.430> back

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
you'll see their time priming back

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:20.500 
you'll see their time priming back
you're<00:03:07.760> just<00:03:07.939> fire<00:03:08.290> alright<00:03:18.729> as<00:03:19.729> you<00:03:20.060> can<00:03:20.359> see

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
you're just fire alright as you can see

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.969 
you're just fire alright as you can see
from<00:03:20.629> the<00:03:20.780> firing<00:03:21.049> test<00:03:21.229> it<00:03:21.379> does<00:03:21.560> not<00:03:21.739> have<00:03:21.949> a

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:21.979 
from the firing test it does not have a

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:23.770 
from the firing test it does not have a
lot<00:03:22.129> of<00:03:22.190> power<00:03:22.519> however<00:03:23.120> do<00:03:23.329> take<00:03:23.540> into

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
lot of power however do take into

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.689 
lot of power however do take into
consideration<00:03:24.470> that<00:03:24.500> i<00:03:24.680> was<00:03:24.979> using<00:03:25.010> mega<00:03:25.459> dots

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:25.699 
consideration that i was using mega dots

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:28.929 
consideration that i was using mega dots
and<00:03:26.560> yeah<00:03:27.560> mega<00:03:27.799> does<00:03:28.010> tend<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.340> be<00:03:28.489> heavier

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
and yeah mega does tend to be heavier

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.339 
and yeah mega does tend to be heavier
and<00:03:29.269> therefore<00:03:29.720> will<00:03:30.349> not<00:03:30.379> fly<00:03:31.189> as<00:03:31.519> far<00:03:31.849> as

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
and therefore will not fly as far as

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.679 
and therefore will not fly as far as
microdots<00:03:33.349> am<00:03:33.949> probably<00:03:34.479> estimating<00:03:35.479> about

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:35.689 
microdots am probably estimating about

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:40.240 
microdots am probably estimating about
15<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.979> 20<00:03:37.220> feet<00:03:37.669> max<00:03:38.000> up<00:03:38.470> for<00:03:39.470> its<00:03:39.620> top<00:03:39.829> ranges

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
15 to 20 feet max up for its top ranges

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.030 
15 to 20 feet max up for its top ranges
not<00:03:40.699> too<00:03:40.819> sure<00:03:41.060> how<00:03:41.359> how<00:03:42.139> this<00:03:42.379> performs<00:03:42.859> in

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
not too sure how how this performs in

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.909 
not too sure how how this performs in

that<00:03:48.500> it<00:03:48.859> has<00:03:49.009> a<00:03:49.040> high<00:03:49.370> rate<00:03:49.609> of<00:03:49.639> fire<00:03:49.989> firstly

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
that it has a high rate of fire firstly

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.569 
that it has a high rate of fire firstly
its<00:03:51.139> muzzle<00:03:51.349> loaded<00:03:51.859> so<00:03:52.129> I<00:03:52.159> wouldn't<00:03:52.370> really

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
its muzzle loaded so I wouldn't really

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.749 
its muzzle loaded so I wouldn't really
consider<00:03:52.819> that<00:03:53.299> a<00:03:53.359> very<00:03:53.750> time<00:03:54.079> consuming<00:03:54.759> next

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:55.759 
consider that a very time consuming next

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:57.849 
consider that a very time consuming next
thing<00:03:55.939> is<00:03:55.970> that<00:03:56.449> you<00:03:56.720> do<00:03:56.870> not<00:03:57.019> need<00:03:57.259> to<00:03:57.470> prime

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
thing is that you do not need to prime

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.800 
thing is that you do not need to prime
and<00:03:58.129> shoot<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.549> blaster<00:03:58.970> simply<00:03:59.359> just<00:03:59.540> prime

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
and shoot the blaster simply just prime

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.800 
and shoot the blaster simply just prime
prime<00:04:00.079> prime<00:04:00.379> and<00:04:00.889> you<00:04:01.639> can<00:04:01.879> get<00:04:02.150> four<00:04:02.540> shots

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
prime prime and you can get four shots

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.949 
prime prime and you can get four shots
off<00:04:02.989> very<00:04:03.680> quickly<00:04:03.739> so<00:04:04.579> that's<00:04:04.849> I<00:04:05.120> guess<00:04:05.449> that

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
off very quickly so that's I guess that

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.740 
off very quickly so that's I guess that
would<00:04:06.109> be<00:04:06.139> the<00:04:06.259> process<00:04:06.709> that<00:04:06.739> it<00:04:06.949> has<00:04:07.069> a<00:04:07.099> very

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
would be the process that it has a very

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.110 
would be the process that it has a very
high<00:04:08.750> rate<00:04:08.930> of<00:04:08.989> fire<00:04:09.310> cons<00:04:10.310> of<00:04:10.489> this<00:04:10.549> blaster

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
high rate of fire cons of this blaster

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.270 
high rate of fire cons of this blaster
first<00:04:11.419> thing<00:04:11.599> I<00:04:11.780> mentioned<00:04:12.290> just<00:04:12.470> now<00:04:12.560> it

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
first thing I mentioned just now it

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.060 
first thing I mentioned just now it
looks<00:04:13.519> like<00:04:14.319> it's<00:04:15.319> one<00:04:15.560> of<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:15.769> ugliest

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
looks like it's one of the ugliest

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.879 
looks like it's one of the ugliest
bastards<00:04:16.549> I've<00:04:16.669> ever<00:04:16.849> seen<00:04:17.180> I<00:04:17.779> think<00:04:18.380> it<00:04:18.560> can

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
bastards I've ever seen I think it can

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.640 
bastards I've ever seen I think it can
fight<00:04:19.639> with<00:04:20.029> enough<00:04:20.510> triple<00:04:20.900> strike<00:04:21.169> I<00:04:21.380> did<00:04:21.620> a

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
fight with enough triple strike I did a

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.570 
fight with enough triple strike I did a
review<00:04:22.010> on<00:04:22.070> that<00:04:22.370> last<00:04:22.639> year

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
review on that last year

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.689 
review on that last year
because<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.599> was<00:04:24.870> this<00:04:25.349> sort<00:04:25.949> of<00:04:26.039> slam<00:04:26.400> fire

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
because it was this sort of slam fire

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.749 
because it was this sort of slam fire
mode<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.449> can<00:04:27.780> be<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.020> bit<00:04:28.319> difficult<00:04:29.129> for<00:04:29.610> you

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
mode it can be a bit difficult for you

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:34.969 
mode it can be a bit difficult for you
to<00:04:29.789> aim<00:04:31.129> and<00:04:32.629> I<00:04:33.629> guess<00:04:33.900> that<00:04:34.349> it<00:04:34.530> does<00:04:34.740> not

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
to aim and I guess that it does not

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.129 
to aim and I guess that it does not
really<00:04:35.129> have<00:04:35.400> much<00:04:35.639> modification<00:04:36.419> potential

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
really have much modification potential

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.619 
really have much modification potential
so<00:04:37.409> in<00:04:37.590> my<00:04:37.800> opinion<00:04:37.949> I<00:04:38.430> would<00:04:38.460> not<00:04:38.849> really<00:04:39.270> get

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:39.629 
so in my opinion I would not really get

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:42.080 
so in my opinion I would not really get
this<00:04:39.810> plaster<00:04:40.259> however<00:04:41.189> if<00:04:41.370> you<00:04:41.639> do<00:04:41.789> get<00:04:41.939> it

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
this plaster however if you do get it

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.490 
this plaster however if you do get it
for<00:04:42.240> cheap<00:04:42.419> I<00:04:42.539> guess<00:04:42.750> you<00:04:42.900> can<00:04:43.080> just<00:04:43.110> play

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
for cheap I guess you can just play

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.999 
for cheap I guess you can just play
around<00:04:43.620> with<00:04:43.949> it<00:04:44.069> and<00:04:45.199> like<00:04:46.199> I<00:04:46.379> said<00:04:46.439> just<00:04:46.919> now

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
around with it and like I said just now

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.369 
around with it and like I said just now
may<00:04:47.250> be<00:04:47.280> used<00:04:47.550> at<00:04:47.789> a<00:04:47.819> star<00:04:48.120> war<00:04:48.300> okay<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:48.990> that

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:49.379 
may be used at a star war okay so that

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:51.529 
may be used at a star war okay so that
was<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:49.830> enough<00:04:50.400> rattler<00:04:50.789> review<00:04:51.120> your<00:04:51.360> clip

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
was it enough rattler review your clip

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.300

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.339 
you can actually see his eyes over here
and<00:04:53.669> its<00:04:54.210> fangs<00:04:54.509> so<00:04:54.780> they<00:04:54.870> are<00:04:54.990> supposed<00:04:55.289> to

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
and its fangs so they are supposed to

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.070 
and its fangs so they are supposed to
resemble<00:04:55.710> a<00:04:55.949> rattler<00:04:56.849> snake<00:04:56.909> if<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:57.930> guys
