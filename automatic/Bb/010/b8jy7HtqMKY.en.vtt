00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
one's pretty much brand new and this one

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.160 
one's pretty much brand new and this one
I've<00:01:20.549> used<00:01:20.700> twice<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.600> figured<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.140> know

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
I've used twice so I figured you know

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.399 
I've used twice so I figured you know
this<00:01:22.710> was<00:01:22.890> practically<00:01:23.790> new<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.330> as<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.200> can

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
this was practically new and as you can

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.800 
this was practically new and as you can
see<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:26.280> red<00:01:26.430> one<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.880> not<00:01:27.030> only<00:01:27.210> thicker<00:01:27.659> but

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
see the red one is not only thicker but

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.740 
see the red one is not only thicker but
also<00:01:28.020> taller<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:29.490> I'm<00:01:29.759> resting<00:01:30.420> them<00:01:30.540> at<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
also taller if I'm resting them at the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.710 
also taller if I'm resting them at the
same<00:01:30.900> height<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.250> would<00:01:32.579> say<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.479> one

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
same height so I would say that this one

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.240 
same height so I would say that this one
might<00:01:33.960> live<00:01:34.170> longer<00:01:34.439> I'm<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> talk

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
moisturizing a con about these ones is

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.060 
moisturizing a con about these ones is
that<00:01:57.390> they<00:01:57.509> melt<00:01:57.840> quite<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> bit<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.770> don't<00:01:58.979> know

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
that they melt quite a bit I don't know

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.139 
that they melt quite a bit I don't know
if<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.250> camera<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.579> going<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.820> pick<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.000> up

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
if the camera is going to pick this up

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.580 
if the camera is going to pick this up
because<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.420> have<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.570> shitty<00:02:00.840> quality<00:02:00.960> camera

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
because I have a shitty quality camera

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.490 
because I have a shitty quality camera
but<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.759> melt

the edges and it's kind of looking
sweaty<00:02:05.390> I'm<00:02:06.320> hoping<00:02:06.830> it<00:02:07.130> will<00:02:07.190> pick<00:02:07.430> it<00:02:07.460> up

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250
