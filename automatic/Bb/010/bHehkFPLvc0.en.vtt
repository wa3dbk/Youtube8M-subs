00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.470
 glass is made from widely 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.410
 common natural 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.639
 ingredients in its production 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.280
 less energy is consumed than with 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.660
 making metal or plastic except 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.599
 addition it can be recycled 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.449
 unlimited number of times no matter 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.490
 they are painted or cleaned initially 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:26.220
 glass bottles and cans always 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.720
 green colored glass composition are included 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.929
 several natural raw materials 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.660
 quartz sand or dioxide components 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.020
 silicon is usually around 45 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.710
 percent of content 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.290
 calcined salt contributes 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.379
 uniform silica board and 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.690
 is about 15 percent 10 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.960
 percent of the limestone make ready 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.399
 glass more durable these ingredients 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:01:02.010
 mixed with recycled glass 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:01:03.719
 glass fight then a certain 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.739
 the amount of mixture is sent to 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.739
 special oven 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.290
 after 24 hours in an oven at a temperature 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:18.640
 1000 500 degrees Celsius is formed 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:22.420
 a mixture of about the same 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.700
 consistency as honey melted 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.900
 the glass is poured into the mold and sent 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.020
 into the oven the cutting machine breaks the stream into 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.470
 parts resulting in 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.470
 cylindrical drops 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:43.930
 one such drop is enough for 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:48.790
 making one bottle or can they 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:51.070
 go to the so-called scoop he 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:56.860
 sends mixture from which the washtub 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:58.810
 molding machine remains 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.979
 molten glass go off into 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.979
 original form 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.060
 for a few seconds we get 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.789
 miniature bottle blank 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.500
 known as betting sen each 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.510
 when sen is then sent to the form for 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.160
 casting a hole which is shaped 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.510
 bottles 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.400
 equipment blows into a bet 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.230
 air and glass are adjacent to the walls 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.110
 taking so final 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.360
 the hollow shape inside the bottle is beer 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.130
 bottles of amber color gets 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.769
 by adding to the molten mixture 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.380
 a small amount of sulfur iron and 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.030
 carbon 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.160
 about also look production 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.019
 the process of creating other types of bottles and 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.860
 cans in this case the company 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.170
 produces 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.329
 three hundred and seventy five millimeter 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.329
 clean glass wine bottles 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.040
 this conveyor also produces bottles 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.040
 from pure glass 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.370
 however, this form has a specific 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.709
 hell 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.930
 deepening the shape of the emblem on one of 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:10.769
 walls creating a convex sign on 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:14.040
 bottle after that 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.260
 bottles give flames otherwise 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.640
 they would cool down too quickly and and 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.640
 would have cracked from the temperature difference 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.940
 now the loader is neat 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.730
 puts the bottles in the so-called 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.820
 lira moving on lira bottle 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:45.900
 cooled at a certain temperature 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:48.150
 it slowly lowers the pressure after 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.950
 this bottle is sprayed with lubricant 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.620
 materials it allows them to move 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:59.190
 smoothly on inspection and packaging 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:01.320
 the lines now the bottles are lined up 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.050
 for processing automatic test 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.480
 stations while scrolling each bottle 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.940
 cameras and probes check them for availability 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.940
 defects such as cracks and bubbles 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.550
 then the equipment checks the neck 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.460
 bottles to compare it with the standard 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.200
 and make sure that the thread is screwed on 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.200
 cap melted correctly 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.880
 each bottle before loading 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.030
 exposed final visual 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.030
 inspection 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.640
 cullet ratio in glass can 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.260
 reach 90 percent cullet 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.150
 melts at a lower temperature 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.160
 that means for every 10 percent 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:56.350
 cullet consumed by 2 and a half 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:59.820
 percent energy today is important 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.820
 stimulus for recycling
