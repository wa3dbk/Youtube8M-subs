00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.520
 the home pc point net server and me 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.140
 have only one topic so animals 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.220
 they just missed walking around 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.080
 and the blocks on the sea ​​were the ones 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.640
 will disappear soon as you can 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.340
 real now if you have really seen 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.440
 very fast shit that does not work 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.680
 Well go on the land and you 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.460
 looks so behind us you can see straight 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.809
 are bad so maybe better 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.829
 world of clover or sand, so to speak 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.000
 live down snow and you can stop 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.829
 Do not fall down that we do not 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.430
 grant heavy if you fall down 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.450
 So you're out of the bottom 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.480
 the world, so to speak 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.430
 Today, we want a new one, so to speak 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.360
 announce project i may he as 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.130
 betrayed a lot 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.469
 I do not know if that will say then 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.120
 say if I'm really sorry 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.750
 I will not betray on the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.649
 Monday 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.640
 I really do not know the date I can 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.219
 do not look because I'm not here 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.189
 floor may stay lower and lower 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:13.350
 Almost it's clear that it's real 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.090
 worse actually white live nevertheless 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.799
 all people that you see right at this 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.759
 scoreboard and yes, everything works 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.499
 I had a project going on 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.389
 I had planned the project myself 

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:29.789
 So something like that but that does not project 

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:31.950
 nivose i knew i have to say what it is 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.380
 was is hall was about a murder 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.219
 and pack another group of 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.829
 youtube 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.899
 you can now so individual projects 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.709
 but do not think so if you do not 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.289
 come on it 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:45.029
 the project will start on monday for 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.279
 I'm starting 

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:49.279
 but I go to learn so and so 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.510
 also works and I will be from Monday 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.370
 that I like to contribute 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.530
 often that comes and so on I can 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.390
 Do not say that depends on me 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.860
 and of you as it arrives with us 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.869
 you want to see how confused then 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.970
 long-term project would be it , so to speak 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.320
 could also sign as an endless project 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.630
 even when it comes to an end 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.240
 It will have been determined but it is now 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.190
 important thing like pvp what once only 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.500
 always plays with a network takeover 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.400
 Often the week is not in any case 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.100
 what I mean 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.510
 I hope that will be really fun 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.140
 otherwise I'm outside 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.030
 which place are six of them 24 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.350
 Right here, easily get into the next one 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.360
 round join so there will be no 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.630
 regions worst off 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.020
 There can not be that much in general 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.430
 so and I had to do quite cleverly 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.340
 have fortunately here the ip 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.360
 you get the one you get with 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.610
 25,000 subscribers and from 75,000 will be there 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.769
 I get a child then if 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.010
 youtuber still travel quite far for me 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.010
 away 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:08.200
 And yes, as I said Monday, it starts 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.200
 Now I can watch Monday the 24th 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.200
 I hope you will co the project 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.519
 then you are also interested in it 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.450
 accordingly, and more, I can too 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.310
 actually we do not say that 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.400
 Just play a round now 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.540
 It's the same life and I have to 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.100
 Really careful that I will be back so much 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.600
 fall down there I was the first 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.430
 extending from the first floor 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.190
 but has passed that all 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.590
 above so there is really fast away 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.400
 as you can see but fall 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.010
 exhibitor down 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.510
 so just take a look at yourself 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.100
 on a halfway server and then d 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.880
 Games are many real events 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:54.680
 different tnt games as is the name 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:57.180
 already says and the case already fun 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.120
 Of course it's hard to record 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.349
 I'm not supposed to say sometimes 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.480
 I think so synonymous shit 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:16.590
 just stay over the and the 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:18.720
 hourglass what a game says monday 24 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.430
 March, the project is there eighth 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.560
 double jump filled that works too 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:28.860
 but you can only do that once 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.370
 You see, you see, that was okay 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.349
 really fat now 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:40.009
 that was really bad I'm just three 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:40.009
 floors trace down so 12 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.050
 38 bad mega bad of me age 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.840
 ok all good things are three examples 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:53.180
 third round no comments 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:58.230
 why I only ever wrote 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:01.410
 follow plaza where i do not win so 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.730
 ideally I came to win which is 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.960
 not always so I have already 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.550
 planned where I win 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.540
 but if I ask only the following 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.490
 where I only win then it is like that 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.080
 boring because everyone is watching the video 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.850
 vista he will win which one 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.510
 exciting place from intro gripping 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:22.890
 fight until yoga the winning pot 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:25.530
 So I load full enough if I already 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:28.200
 generally tear something in itself 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.680
 even if I'm only 15 o'clock right now 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.080
 are missing and then I die yes 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.270
 probably bad automatically 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.560
 We now necessarily jumped off 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.420
 Just get the red and I'll be fine 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.340
 find or if I just think so 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.800
 I had a really good talk or 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.190
 Cambodia as a newcomer so good 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.080
 explains then it is not 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.070
 only for the money money 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:56.490
 important, of course, but it's yet 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:59.710
 micrometer style I style the comments 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.480
 to that and that 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.850
 wanted to say it happens and me 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.430
 Win where I do not win videos 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.930
 Of course, the profits that made was 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:13.710
 maybe just subscribe or new 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.710
 I do not know and the badger the trio 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:21.160
 for example, one floor down , yes 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.210
 yes two now runs so ascom take care 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.500
 the consequences will be yes again 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.980
 catch year why me so 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.240
 bad things yes do not remember 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.360
 then maybe fits the rest of my 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.110
 videos to tear something when first 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:42.780
 which is a sixth of 24 that is 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:46.150
 ever something okay yet come out 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.530
 I think so, yes, yes 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.470
 you owe a good place for 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.200
 central one i can my happening here 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:57.790
 what exciting that I can change something 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:07:00.420
 I jump on sand and loam and ask 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:04.660
 me that I do not live 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:08.290
 this is keys gravel now i'm a trainer 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.520
 I jumped out of the world 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.250
 actually said so what to say 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.440
 monday it starts 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.800
 the new project you will then everything 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.990
 see 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:22.030
 it can be a part of you 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:24.760
 maybe think or know and then 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.590
 say goodbye to the video 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.830
 again not so good round but me 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.910
 could talk well and that is for me 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.680
 for me it's important to say so 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.080
 so if you like it will make you one 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:38.700
 thumb up or thumb down if it is 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.700
 you did not like and
