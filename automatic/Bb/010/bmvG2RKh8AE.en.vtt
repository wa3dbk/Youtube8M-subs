00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
line on that one okay so then if we kind

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.010 
line on that one okay so then if we kind
of<00:00:50.350> switch<00:00:50.620> over<00:00:51.070> I<00:00:51.340> did<00:00:52.300> a<00:00:52.329> little<00:00:52.540> study<00:00:52.780> of

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
of switch over I did a little study of

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.080 
of switch over I did a little study of
Annie<00:00:53.320> which<00:00:53.860> I<00:00:54.040> wish<00:00:54.219> had<00:00:54.340> more<00:00:54.399> time<00:00:54.790> on<00:00:55.030> I

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
Annie which I wish had more time on I

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.090 
Annie which I wish had more time on I
think<00:00:55.270> maybe<00:00:55.570> it<00:00:55.780> was<00:00:55.930> like<00:00:56.110> a<00:00:56.380> 10-minute

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
think maybe it was like a 10-minute

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.330 
think maybe it was like a 10-minute
study<00:00:57.730> of<00:00:57.940> her<00:00:58.120> knee<00:00:58.329> and<00:00:58.600> leg<00:00:58.960> area<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.890> then

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
study of her knee and leg area and then

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.790 
study of her knee and leg area and then
