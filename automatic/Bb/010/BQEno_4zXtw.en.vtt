00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.309
 I'm Anna Lena I'm 19 years old 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.480
 and are in the third year 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.950
 to the deep the requirements for one 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.160
 Hotelfachfrau are in my opinion 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:26.779
 just team ability because you just without 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.349
 team ability not reached a 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.559
 hotel 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.680
 the agreements must be good 

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:33.620
 function 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.110
 Be sure to go to the people 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.660
 go and should good english 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.110
 Ammann speaks international guests 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.140
 of course you receive and you should 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.150
 might also be natural that when 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.680
 Tinker 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.990
 I decided for the hotel 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.770
 that a small family run hotel 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.430
 is 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.220
 and because it is very close to home 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.130
 The most fun is hotel life 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.890
 to work at the reception and service 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.560
 because one is there most people to do 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.479
 at the very beginning of my apprenticeship 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.470
 first year i was in breakfast service 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.330
 talent then to the first deal with 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.550
 then you get a normal service 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.909
 evening service so that at first 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.770
 Teacher that you can usually 16 17 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.560
 not so long work astrology 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.780
 the front desk is just going through the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.920
 check in check out 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.900
 phone numbers accept currencies and 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.750
 Just there the kitchen was there, I was one 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.420
 month in the patisserie and in the garden 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.710
 mosque then I was one more 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.140
 month on the bag 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.240
 because you live just like you 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.300
 as soon as possible a room is located 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.240
 and that you know him if you are 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.400
 Guests like to stay in the room with a view of the MÃ¼nster 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.190
 as we want to have here there 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:01.260
 I know this is room 114 for example 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.700
 and you just know that 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.790
 the difficulties live a hotel woman 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.370
 the working hours are partly at that time 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.270
 not quite as conny coordinate came with 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.880
 the working hours of family friends 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.980
 but it is all feasible so you learn 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.310
 to be able to do that 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:28.959
 especially important is my education 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.799
 the fun factor and the team because if it is 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.890
 I do not know what to do then 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.599
 unmotivated in the work and then asks 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.609
 it is also in the inn immediately 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.010
 but you have no good 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.079
 I'm the team now 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.200
 of course very important must 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.159
 well, you have to get along well with each other 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.459
 can communicate that is that 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.459
 leading 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.000
 actually interesting is actually 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.549
 that every day does not compare though 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.829
 you start in the morning then it can be quite 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:03.549
 different ends that you thought everything 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.480
 the team of the hotel angel is real 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.359
 really great 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.549
 we have special ones, for example 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.519
 Christmas parties last year we were 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:15.730
 together open hut for one and 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.760
 half days and alone recognizes it 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.549
 you already have the system that's good 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.730
 get along with each other after mine 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.250
 training I want before september 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.169
 radiate and there just a work in 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.740
 make jabalija by calling him 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:35.130
 mainly instruments 8 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.460
 because then you learn to be English too 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.830
 perfect and there is quite 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.720
 other guests than she gives and that 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.280
 I just want to get out if any 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.280
 an Amazon completely through
