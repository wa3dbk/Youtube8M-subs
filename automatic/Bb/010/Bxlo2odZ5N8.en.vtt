00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.259 

you

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.990 

i<00:00:30.560> reinserted<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.679> pump<00:00:31.949> blade<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.610> i'm

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
i reinserted the pump blade and i'm

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.939 
i reinserted the pump blade and i'm
going<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.239> let<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.510> sit<00:00:34.050> for<00:00:34.079> about<00:00:34.379> ten

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
going to let it sit for about ten

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.080 
going to let it sit for about ten
minutes<00:00:35.190> or<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:37.160> to<00:00:38.160> firm<00:00:38.430> up<00:00:38.699> before

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
minutes or so just to firm up before

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.869 
minutes or so just to firm up before
I've<00:00:39.210> replaced<00:00:39.720> the<00:00:39.930> cover<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> pump<00:00:41.610> and

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
I've replaced the cover to the pump and

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.090 
I've replaced the cover to the pump and
torque<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.899> down

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.040 

so<00:00:47.430> as<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.060> I've<00:00:49.460> reinstall<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
so as you can see I've reinstall the

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.220 
so as you can see I've reinstall the
screws<00:00:52.610> as<00:00:53.610> well<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.240> new<00:00:54.420> screw<00:00:54.750> at<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
screws as well as the new screw at the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.820 
screws as well as the new screw at the
top<00:00:55.680> which<00:00:56.370> has<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.580> large<00:00:57.060> Phillips<00:00:57.630> head<00:00:57.870> but

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
top which has a large Phillips head but

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.800 
top which has a large Phillips head but
I<00:00:58.860> use<00:00:59.130> the<00:00:59.280> Flathead<00:00:59.610> a<00:00:59.880> large<00:01:00.390> flat-head

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
I use the Flathead a large flat-head

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.130 
I use the Flathead a large flat-head
screwdriver<00:01:01.490> so<00:01:02.490> that<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.700> could<00:01:02.880> get<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.300> pretty

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
screwdriver so that I could get a pretty

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.750 
screwdriver so that I could get a pretty
good<00:01:04.350> torque<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.160> don't<00:01:05.309> want<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.520> over

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
good torque on it you don't want to over

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.580 
good torque on it you don't want to over
torque<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.180> because<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.660> gasket<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.350> really

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
torque it because the gasket is really

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.910 
torque it because the gasket is really
what<00:01:07.800> seals<00:01:08.160> it<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:09.020> BMWs<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.290> general<00:01:10.680> don't

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
what seals it and BMWs in general don't

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.730 
what seals it and BMWs in general don't
require<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.340> lot<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.670> torque<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.740> their

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
require a lot of torque in their

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.890 
require a lot of torque in their
individual<00:01:14.550> components<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.570> know<00:01:15.750> what

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
individual components so you know what

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.440 
individual components so you know what
over<00:01:16.229> torque<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.190> aluminum<00:01:17.550> material

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
over torque it this is aluminum material

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.570 
over torque it this is aluminum material
so<00:01:19.050> you<00:01:19.410> don't<00:01:19.560> want<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.800> strip<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.100> out<00:01:20.369> or

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
so you don't want to strip it out or

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.030 
so you don't want to strip it out or
break<00:01:20.790> off<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> screw<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.380> be<00:01:22.560> careful<00:01:22.979> about

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
break off a screw so be careful about

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.270 
break off a screw so be careful about
over<00:01:23.550> torquing<00:01:24.290> next<00:01:25.290> I'm<00:01:25.440> going<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.830> go<00:01:26.160> ahead

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
over torquing next I'm going to go ahead

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.050 
over torquing next I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:26.790> replace<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> seal<00:01:28.490> that's<00:01:29.490> closest<00:01:30.030> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
and replace the seal that's closest to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.639 
and replace the seal that's closest to
the<00:01:30.509> engine<00:01:30.990> side

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.450 

now<00:01:36.219> the<00:01:36.280> smaller<00:01:36.700> seal<00:01:37.149> can<00:01:37.539> be<00:01:37.780> replaced

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
now the smaller seal can be replaced

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.200 
now the smaller seal can be replaced
just<00:01:39.460> by<00:01:39.700> using<00:01:40.689> a<00:01:41.020> small<00:01:41.439> blade<00:01:42.429> screwdriver

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
and lodging it in there and popping it

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.419 
and lodging it in there and popping it
out<00:01:48.299> okay<00:01:49.299> from<00:01:49.509> there<00:01:49.719> you<00:01:49.929> can<00:01:50.140> just<00:01:50.770> place

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
out okay from there you can just place

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.510 
out okay from there you can just place
the<00:01:51.759> new<00:01:52.000> seal<00:01:52.329> in<00:01:52.600> prior<00:01:53.319> to<00:01:53.619> reinstalling

the new seal in prior to reinstalling
the<00:01:55.319> vacuum<00:01:56.319> pump

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:02.289 

great<00:02:00.590> time<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:01.130> replace<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.700> oil<00:02:01.880> pressure

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
great time to replace the oil pressure

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.740 
great time to replace the oil pressure
switch<00:02:02.810> it's<00:02:03.500> located<00:02:04.009> directly<00:02:04.399> beneath<00:02:05.179> the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
switch it's located directly beneath the

switch it's located directly beneath the
vacuum<00:02:06.409> pump<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:06.950> it's<00:02:07.399> very<00:02:07.609> difficult<00:02:07.909> to

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
vacuum pump and it's very difficult to

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.809 
vacuum pump and it's very difficult to
get<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:08.780> in<00:02:08.989> order<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.289> change<00:02:09.709> it<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.160> have<00:02:10.640> to

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
get to in order to change it you have to

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.570 
get to in order to change it you have to
either<00:02:10.970> remove<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.660> vacuum<00:02:11.900> pump<00:02:12.349> or<00:02:12.709> remove

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
either remove the vacuum pump or remove

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.500 
either remove the vacuum pump or remove

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
the radiator coolant tank expansion tank

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.720 
the radiator coolant tank expansion tank
rather<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:19.640> uses<00:02:19.879> a<00:02:20.090> 22<00:02:20.840> inch<00:02:21.170> or<00:02:21.560> rather<00:02:22.040> 22

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
rather it uses a 22 inch or rather 22

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.820 
rather it uses a 22 inch or rather 22
millimeter<00:02:23.330> deep<00:02:23.660> well<00:02:23.900> socket<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.680> it's

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
millimeter deep well socket and it's

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.479 
millimeter deep well socket and it's
located<00:02:25.400> right<00:02:25.610> here<00:02:26.739> and<00:02:27.739> I<00:02:28.220> highly

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
located right here and I highly

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.440 
located right here and I highly
recommend<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:29.989> change<00:02:30.319> it<00:02:30.680> it's<00:02:31.610> more

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
recommend that you change it it's more

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.020 
recommend that you change it it's more
prone<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.440> leaking<00:02:33.890> than<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.340> vacuum<00:02:34.790> pump

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
prone to leaking than the vacuum pump

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.380 
prone to leaking than the vacuum pump
and<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:36.170> now's<00:02:36.769> a<00:02:36.799> great<00:02:37.099> time<00:02:37.220> just<00:02:37.940> take<00:02:38.120> care

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
and so now's a great time just take care

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.430 
and so now's a great time just take care
of<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.599> if<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:38.959> haven't<00:02:39.290> already<00:02:39.410> done<00:02:39.829> so

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.820 

okay<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.730> best<00:02:44.940> way<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.320> reinstall<00:02:46.320> the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
okay so the best way to reinstall the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.560 
okay so the best way to reinstall the
pump<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:48.440> you're<00:02:49.440> going<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.650> need<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:50.570> 27

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
pump is to you're going to need a 27

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.010 
pump is to you're going to need a 27
millimeter<00:02:52.310> socket<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:54.390> long<00:02:55.130> breaker<00:02:56.130> bar

you're<00:02:58.020> going<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.440> place<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.730> vacuum<00:03:00.210> pump

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
you're going to place the vacuum pump

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.520 
you're going to place the vacuum pump
into<00:03:00.840> position<00:03:01.440> as<00:03:01.590> best<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.130> can

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
into position as best you can

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.070 
into position as best you can
paying<00:03:04.530> attention<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:05.250> where<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.660> groove<00:03:06.660> is

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
paying attention to where the groove is

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.170 
paying attention to where the groove is
that<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:08.190> vacuum<00:03:08.550> pump<00:03:08.970> slots<00:03:09.510> fit<00:03:09.870> into<00:03:10.080> and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
that the vacuum pump slots fit into and

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.040 
that the vacuum pump slots fit into and
so<00:03:12.180> you're<00:03:12.360> going<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.510> get<00:03:12.660> as<00:03:12.810> close<00:03:12.960> as

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
so you're going to get as close as

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.780 
so you're going to get as close as
possible<00:03:13.320> and<00:03:14.040> then<00:03:14.190> you're<00:03:14.340> going<00:03:14.460> to<00:03:14.550> use

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
possible and then you're going to use

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.040 
possible and then you're going to use
the<00:03:15.450> breaker<00:03:15.780> bar<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.410> rotate<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.040> engine

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
the breaker bar to rotate the engine

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.460 
the breaker bar to rotate the engine
clockwise<00:03:19.050> from<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:20.010> crankshaft<00:03:21.290> it's<00:03:22.290> going

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
clockwise from the crankshaft it's going

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.860 
clockwise from the crankshaft it's going
to<00:03:22.560> take<00:03:22.710> some<00:03:22.950> patience<00:03:23.520> but<00:03:23.580> if<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.660> take

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
to take some patience but if you take

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.240 
to take some patience but if you take
your<00:03:25.050> time<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.740> push<00:03:27.350> maybe<00:03:28.350> need<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.830> people

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
your time and push maybe need to people

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.420 
your time and push maybe need to people
I<00:03:29.490> did<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.120> myself<00:03:30.300> but<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.290> may<00:03:31.500> be<00:03:32.100> able<00:03:32.190> to

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
I did it myself but you may be able to

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.360 
I did it myself but you may be able to
push<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.330> vacuum<00:03:33.540> pump<00:03:33.960> into<00:03:34.320> position<00:03:34.950> and

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
push the vacuum pump into position and

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.180 
push the vacuum pump into position and
it<00:03:36.000> should<00:03:36.540> lodge<00:03:36.840> into<00:03:37.200> position<00:03:37.890> with

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
it should lodge into position with

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.760 
it should lodge into position with
relative<00:03:39.060> ease<00:03:39.390> but<00:03:40.020> it<00:03:40.170> may<00:03:40.320> take<00:03:40.350> some

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
relative ease but it may take some

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.860 
relative ease but it may take some
patience

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.320 

so<00:03:47.200> after<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:48.010> have<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.610> pump<00:03:48.849> tighten<00:03:49.300> down

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
so after you have the pump tighten down

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.170 
so after you have the pump tighten down
in<00:03:49.780> position<00:03:50.010> you're<00:03:51.010> going<00:03:51.190> to<00:03:51.280> reconnect

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
in position you're going to reconnect

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.750 
in position you're going to reconnect
the<00:03:52.599> hoses<00:03:52.780> just<00:03:53.380> going<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.040> press<00:03:54.280> this<00:03:54.520> O's

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
the hoses just going to press this O's

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.130 
the hoses just going to press this O's
back<00:03:55.120> down<00:03:55.390> I<00:03:56.459> yanked<00:03:57.459> it<00:03:57.550> out<00:03:57.810> pulled<00:03:58.810> it<00:03:59.020> out

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
back down I yanked it out pulled it out

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.290 
back down I yanked it out pulled it out
and<00:03:59.950> so<00:04:00.310> now<00:04:00.489> I'm<00:04:00.640> pushing<00:04:00.849> it<00:04:01.090> back<00:04:01.270> down

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
and so now I'm pushing it back down

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.130 
and so now I'm pushing it back down
firmly<00:04:02.069> as<00:04:03.069> well<00:04:03.400> as<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:03.700> vacuum<00:04:04.180> tube<00:04:04.750> to<00:04:05.019> the

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
firmly as well as the vacuum tube to the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:16.050 
firmly as well as the vacuum tube to the
front<00:04:05.410> of<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.650> pump

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.120
