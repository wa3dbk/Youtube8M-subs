what you can see right here this is

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.490 
what you can see right here this is
known<00:03:18.379> as<00:03:18.500> ladder<00:03:18.890> line<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.959> comes<00:03:21.230> off<00:03:21.470> of

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
known as ladder line and it comes off of

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.610 
known as ladder line and it comes off of
the<00:03:21.769> antenna<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.400> then<00:03:22.640> we've<00:03:22.819> got<00:03:23.090> it

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
the antenna and then we've got it

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.270 
the antenna and then we've got it
basically<00:03:24.640> hanging<00:03:25.640> up<00:03:25.910> here<00:03:26.150> on<00:03:26.329> this<00:03:26.540> pole

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
basically hanging up here on this pole

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.150 
basically hanging up here on this pole
I've<00:03:28.280> got<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.459> steak<00:03:29.410> little<00:03:30.410> nail<00:03:30.590> in<00:03:30.860> here

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
I've got a steak little nail in here

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.699 
I've got a steak little nail in here
holding<00:03:31.819> it<00:03:31.910> on<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.239> top<00:03:32.510> of<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.720> pole<00:03:32.930> and

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
holding it on the top of the pole and

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.839 
holding it on the top of the pole and
then<00:03:33.890> eventually<00:03:34.160> it's<00:03:34.579> coming<00:03:35.569> down<00:03:35.750> to

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
then eventually it's coming down to

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.009 
then eventually it's coming down to
terminate<00:03:37.849> over<00:03:38.360> onto<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.930> piece<00:03:39.290> of<00:03:40.299> LM<00:03:41.299> r400

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.289 
terminate over onto a piece of LM r400
coax<00:03:42.500> here<00:03:42.860> we<00:03:43.069> just<00:03:43.220> have<00:03:43.430> these<00:03:43.610> Marez

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
coax here we just have these Marez

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.289 
coax here we just have these Marez
together<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:45.110> here<00:03:45.799> you<00:03:45.890> can<00:03:46.069> see<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.519> the

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
together and here you can see the the

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.140 
together and here you can see the the
coax<00:03:47.920> basically<00:03:48.920> well<00:03:49.160> it's<00:03:49.310> got<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:49.489> short

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
coax basically well it's got a short

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.440 
coax basically well it's got a short
piece<00:03:50.329> of<00:03:50.569> rg8<00:03:51.379> here<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:52.870> then<00:03:53.870> it<00:03:54.019> eventually

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
piece of rg8 here and then it eventually

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.259 
piece of rg8 here and then it eventually
terminates<00:03:56.450> down<00:03:56.690> to<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.079> LMR<00:03:57.470> 400<00:03:58.160> here<00:03:58.400> and

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
terminates down to the LMR 400 here and

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.580 
terminates down to the LMR 400 here and
from<00:03:59.989> there<00:04:00.200> it's<00:04:00.350> running<00:04:00.709> back<00:04:00.889> over<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.459> the

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
from there it's running back over to the

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.050 
from there it's running back over to the

feed<00:05:42.270> the<00:05:42.509> co<00:05:43.080> axis<00:05:43.500> up<00:05:43.710> into<00:05:44.669> the<00:05:44.759> unit<00:05:45.000> itself

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
feed the co axis up into the unit itself

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.149 
feed the co axis up into the unit itself
and<00:05:45.479> I've<00:05:45.569> got<00:05:45.720> another<00:05:45.930> station<00:05:46.740> there<00:05:46.949> with

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
and I've got another station there with

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:49.969 
and I've got another station there with
a<00:05:47.190> VHF<00:05:47.819> UHF<00:05:47.849> and<00:05:48.599> shortwave<00:05:49.289> on<00:05:49.500> the<00:05:49.620> inside

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
a VHF UHF and shortwave on the inside

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.200 
a VHF UHF and shortwave on the inside
that<00:05:50.849> we<00:05:51.060> can<00:05:51.270> just<00:05:51.919> feed<00:05:52.919> the<00:05:53.039> coax<00:05:53.460> from<00:05:53.759> down

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
that we can just feed the coax from down

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.610 
that we can just feed the coax from down
below<00:05:54.509> here<00:05:54.810> to<00:05:55.020> the<00:05:55.110> inside<00:05:55.500> and<00:05:56.630> then<00:05:57.630> we<00:05:58.469> can

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
below here to the inside and then we can

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.189 
below here to the inside and then we can
operate<00:05:58.889> the<00:05:59.099> station<00:05:59.490> from<00:05:59.669> inside<00:06:01.039> from<00:06:02.039> it

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
operate the station from inside from it

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:06.830 
operate the station from inside from it
from<00:06:04.199> inside<00:06:04.530> the<00:06:04.650> motor<00:06:04.830> home<00:06:05.039> so<00:06:05.630> we've<00:06:06.630> kind

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
from inside the motor home so we've kind

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.510 
from inside the motor home so we've kind
of<00:06:06.900> got<00:06:07.020> our<00:06:07.110> decked<00:06:07.380> out<00:06:07.530> here<00:06:07.800> right<00:06:08.039> now<00:06:08.219> if

I'm able to talk to some of my buddies
on<00:07:02.699> 80<00:07:02.940> meters<00:07:03.300> as<00:07:03.479> well<00:07:03.659> so<00:07:04.320> the<00:07:04.589> antenna<00:07:04.919> that

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 
on 80 meters as well so the antenna that

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:05.839 
on 80 meters as well so the antenna that
I've<00:07:05.219> got<00:07:05.400> here

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:05.849 
I've got here

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:10.850 
I've got here
g5r<00:07:06.300> be<00:07:06.539> it<00:07:06.839> basically<00:07:07.319> works<00:07:07.679> on<00:07:07.919> 10<00:07:09.409> 15<00:07:10.409> 18

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 
g5r be it basically works on 10 15 18

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.609 
g5r be it basically works on 10 15 18
meters<00:07:11.219> 20<00:07:11.550> meters<00:07:11.580> 40<00:07:12.209> meters<00:07:12.539> at<00:07:13.169> 80<00:07:13.409> meters

00:07:13.609 --> 00:07:13.619 
meters 20 meters 40 meters at 80 meters

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:16.760 
meters 20 meters 40 meters at 80 meters
so<00:07:14.039> it's<00:07:14.759> kind<00:07:15.119> of<00:07:15.179> a<00:07:15.330> lot<00:07:16.199> of<00:07:16.319> people<00:07:16.559> don't

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:16.770 
so it's kind of a lot of people don't

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.309 
so it's kind of a lot of people don't
like<00:07:17.069> the<00:07:17.490> g5<00:07:17.879> RV<00:07:18.209> they<00:07:18.389> say<00:07:18.569> yeah<00:07:18.749> it<00:07:18.869> operates

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 
like the g5 RV they say yeah it operates

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:26.899 
like the g5 RV they say yeah it operates
effectively<00:07:20.719> just<00:07:21.719> as<00:07:21.869> poorly<00:07:22.259> on<00:07:25.639> every<00:07:26.639> band

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:26.909 
effectively just as poorly on every band

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:32.029 
effectively just as poorly on every band
equally<00:07:28.309> the<00:07:29.309> negative<00:07:29.779> RV<00:07:30.779> but<00:07:31.379> on<00:07:31.860> the<00:07:31.949> other

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 
equally the negative RV but on the other

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:33.469 
equally the negative RV but on the other
hand<00:07:32.129> it<00:07:32.459> does<00:07:32.639> give<00:07:32.849> you<00:07:32.939> the<00:07:32.999> ability<00:07:33.089> to

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 
hand it does give you the ability to

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:37.339 
hand it does give you the ability to
operate<00:07:33.719> on<00:07:34.050> pretty<00:07:34.649> much<00:07:34.860> every<00:07:35.309> band<00:07:36.349> you

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:37.349 
operate on pretty much every band you

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:39.350 
operate on pretty much every band you
know<00:07:37.499> and<00:07:37.709> if<00:07:37.800> you're<00:07:37.979> in<00:07:38.669> a<00:07:38.729> good<00:07:38.939> location

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 
know and if you're in a good location

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.999 
know and if you're in a good location
and<00:07:39.839> if<00:07:40.019> the<00:07:40.139> bands<00:07:40.379> are<00:07:40.589> in<00:07:40.679> pretty<00:07:40.889> good

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:41.009 
and if the bands are in pretty good

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:42.320 
and if the bands are in pretty good
shape<00:07:41.069> you're<00:07:41.490> able<00:07:41.699> to<00:07:41.729> get<00:07:41.909> out<00:07:42.029> there<00:07:42.240> and

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.330 
shape you're able to get out there and

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.019 
shape you're able to get out there and
talk<00:07:42.569> to<00:07:42.599> people<00:07:43.110> all<00:07:43.589> over<00:07:43.619> the<00:07:43.919> world<00:07:44.029> so

00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:45.029 
talk to people all over the world so

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:48.800 
talk to people all over the world so
that's<00:07:45.689> it<00:07:45.899> for<00:07:46.050> the<00:07:46.139> station
