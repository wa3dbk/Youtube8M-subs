like<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.799> environments<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.460> you're

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
like the environments that you're

like the environments that you're
shooting<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.540> much<00:01:12.810> end<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.260> controlling

shooting in so much end up controlling

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.260 
shooting in so much end up controlling
the<00:01:14.040> way<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.369> shoot<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.670> film<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.150> then

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the way that you shoot a film and then

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.550 
the way that you shoot a film and then
because<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.869> such<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> harsh<00:01:16.500> environment

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
because it is such a harsh environment

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.330 
because it is such a harsh environment
and<00:01:17.220> such<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:19.200> know<00:01:19.229> tiring<00:01:19.740> experience<00:01:20.220> to

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
and such a you know tiring experience to

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.340 
and such a you know tiring experience to
sort<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.580> being<00:01:20.820> out<00:01:21.030> there<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:22.110> know<00:01:22.229> you

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
sort of being out there you know you

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.620 
sort of being out there you know you
have<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.530> trim<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.950> fat<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.400> any<00:01:23.670> way<00:01:24.360> possible

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
have to trim the fat in any way possible

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.160 
have to trim the fat in any way possible
so<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.890> becomes<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.310> very<00:01:26.460> natural<00:01:27.170> experience

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
so it becomes a very natural experience

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.080 
so it becomes a very natural experience
or<00:01:28.350> organic<00:01:28.680> experience<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.670> also<00:01:29.820> enjoyed

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
or organic experience and I also enjoyed

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.789 
or organic experience and I also enjoyed
the<00:01:30.180> fact<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.540> does<00:01:30.689> transcend<00:01:31.350> time<00:01:31.590> in

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
the fact that it does transcend time in

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.980 
the fact that it does transcend time in
the<00:01:31.920> sense<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.640> was<00:01:32.909> done<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.420> 70s

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the sense that it was done in the 70s

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.840 
the sense that it was done in the 70s
but<00:01:34.290> if<00:01:34.409> anyone<00:01:34.860> wanted<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.189> do<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> now<00:01:35.640> it

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
but if anyone wanted to do it now it

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.310 
but if anyone wanted to do it now it
would<00:01:35.970> be<00:01:36.000> exactly<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.600> same<00:01:36.780> experience

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
would be exactly the same experience

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.200 
would be exactly the same experience
yeah<00:01:37.680> those<00:01:37.860> areas<00:01:38.310> feel<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:38.850> they<00:01:39.030> haven't

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
yeah those areas feel like they haven't

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
and pretty but because that was the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.899 
and pretty but because that was the
nature<00:02:57.659> of<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.989> film<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.159> the<00:02:59.220> story<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.790> was

know feel comfortable within it were you
able<00:03:08.129> to<00:03:08.340> gauge<00:03:08.849> why<00:03:09.120> at<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:09.540> time<00:03:09.569> you<00:03:10.319> know

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
able to gauge why at the time you know

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.199 
able to gauge why at the time you know
it<00:03:10.530> was<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.680> very<00:03:10.859> Australian<00:03:11.609> story<00:03:11.940> but<00:03:12.180> that

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
it was a very Australian story but that

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.180 
it was a very Australian story but that
resonated<00:03:12.900> with<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.379> rest<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.829> world<00:03:14.010> the

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
resonated with the rest of the world the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.470 
resonated with the rest of the world the
same<00:03:14.340> way<00:03:14.489> it<00:03:14.609> would<00:03:14.730> resonate<00:03:15.030> here<00:03:15.180> at<00:03:15.419> a

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
same way it would resonate here at a

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.420 
same way it would resonate here at a
film<00:03:15.690> festival<00:03:15.750> yes<00:03:16.440> was<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.829> I<00:03:17.040> mean<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.370> think

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
film festival yes was it I mean I think

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.879 
film festival yes was it I mean I think
although<00:03:17.910> it's<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.510> is<00:03:18.690> times<00:03:19.019> specific<00:03:19.769> in

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
although it's it is times specific in

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.720 
although it's it is times specific in
certain<00:03:20.310> ways<00:03:20.519> in<00:03:21.470> maybe<00:03:22.470> more<00:03:22.769> in<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.040> way

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
certain ways in maybe more in the way

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.039 
certain ways in maybe more in the way
that<00:03:23.940> it<00:03:24.060> comments<00:03:24.419> on<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.599> Australian

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
that it comments on the Australian

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.599 
that it comments on the Australian
culture<00:03:25.230> at<00:03:25.470> that<00:03:25.590> time<00:03:25.829> being<00:03:26.160> slightly

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
misogynistic and racist also the the

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.990 
misogynistic and racist also the the
central<00:03:31.049> theme<00:03:31.319> of<00:03:31.560> her<00:03:32.129> I<00:03:32.160> can<00:03:32.430> understand

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
central theme of her I can understand

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.520 
central theme of her I can understand
completely<00:03:33.510> why<00:03:33.780> someone<00:03:34.139> would<00:03:34.290> want<00:03:34.440> to

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
completely why someone would want to

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.439 
completely why someone would want to
take<00:03:34.680> themselves<00:03:34.949> out<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.760> modern<00:03:36.329> day

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
take themselves out of of modern day

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.869 
take themselves out of of modern day
life<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.410> I<00:03:37.769> think<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.069> applies<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.430> now

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
life and and I think that applies to now

life and and I think that applies to now
and<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.239> anybody<00:03:39.660> anywhere<00:03:40.079> in<00:03:40.139> the<00:03:40.260> world
