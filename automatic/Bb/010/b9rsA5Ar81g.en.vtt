00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.600
 already from all the boys here we are always 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:35.460
 su dentro players punto it with ours 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:39.360
 first unboxing that deals precisely with 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.250
 assassin's creed 3 join or die edition 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.410
 let's say this is the collector 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.809
 most common edition is not the one 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.640
 they give in stop is not the one that binds 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.070
 they give you gifts also make you pay 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.239
 money is not the one you find from gamestop 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.160
 from opengames evidences and so on is the 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.460
 collector edition just more common and 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.320
 easier to find 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.120
 unfortunately this year I left myself 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.009
 to escape precisely the version with 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.259
 statuette is so let's decide to opt 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.330
 for this also because it cost a 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.979
 little less than the others 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.660
 collector edition and in the end it is more 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.119
 serialized in the sense is easier to 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.830
 then to sell because common of all the 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:27.330
 world we go from now to April with 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:32.880
 they seek with the utmost delicacy of 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.830
 don't ruin the game box when 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.280
 It needs to be opened at once is not 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.280
 hands 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.610
 if I ca n't wait to play then 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.320
 obviously who they want booked by 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.350
 opengames we have pendants not 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.520
 this year they did not give a statuette but 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.950
 they gave this little thing best healy here 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.130
 which in theory should be the buckle 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.819
 of a belt with the logo of 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.580
 murderers and precisely with the logo of 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.230
 assensi write 3 is a Chinese 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.880
 scary levels 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.069
 but I must say that it is done enough 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:27.940
 well I don't know if you can see from 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:31.329
 camera but very spartan yes 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:37.500
 known in the material that seems fake 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:40.660
 only heavy metal but here yes 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.790
 together they would then give a gift 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.620
 gift not by now two tubes and this one 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:50.019
 we want to go back to boxing here 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:56.920
 double layer box then with one 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:03:00.700
 we cover each other too 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.720
 note that to note that means 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:09.370
 therefore the utility is found only on the back 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.690
 that the jacket over gods 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.340
 features explains the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.170
 features from collector edition e 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:21.150
 enough though this is actually good 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.150
 we move latin trino vc papers 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:31.360
 we will open a package looks like a 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.430
 of those games boc been years since 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:38.170
 we always talk about retrogaming we find 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.810
 the connor locket in one 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.989
 I wasn't expecting a really nice envelope 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:48.209
 in faux leather imitation leather I don't know how 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.209
 define it we try to extract it without 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.510
 program this a lot and did a lot 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.980
 well i like it 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:01.299
 we could talk hours of utility time 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.940
 of the thing but in reality it must put 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.870
 which did fairly well what in 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:11.200
 other collector edition for example not 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:15.630
 however there are no let's say that it is 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:20.200
 no use it for a purpose collezionistici 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:23.440
 it smells a little bit like plasticone 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.870
 as usual you can even tighten the minus 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.930
 maybe I'll throw away the medallion ri 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.500
 I will use this as a purse 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.840
 no I do not think it held up 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:40.990
 like shit miles away maybe 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:42.639
 the object only here we find the there is the 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.229
 manual 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:51.310
 indeed I think it is the diary of connor 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:53.620
 a first look wants to make it look like the 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.310
 leatherette cover is actually one 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:02.500
 very vulgar print is as if like it 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:08.260
 you can see that surely you look at it 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:11.889
 are uncut pages that a 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:16.229
 apparently I don't know if it was done on purpose 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.229
 there is obviously also a bookmark 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:24.699
 because you never know that you won't have 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.830
 time to read it all at once you have 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:29.800
 written in Italian 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:34.479
 obviously illustrations done a lot 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:37.900
 well very pretty very colorful everything 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:39.669
 how beautiful here is a nice accessory for 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.770
 a collector edition were made 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:47.620
 always so sorry if sometimes it goes 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:50.710
 out of focus the camera ok the 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.780
 beautiful beautiful a beautiful book 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.690
 here some pages also open in 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:06:00.610
 this way he saw hide one 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:02.260
 double page china which is a good a good one 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.570
 result here maybe maybe those 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:08.010
 Double pages serve perceived as one 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.010
 check that we didn't notice 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:15.370
 but no it's just double pages but 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.250
 inside there seems to be a bang site 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.900
 to the very same first theses are alone 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:24.810
 forget to cut them if a mark 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:28.600
 of ubisoft with his usual fail 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.700
 sensational something else dinners and enough 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:35.919
 the day or die edition includes then 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:39.700
 obviously the game obviously not 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:43.419
 resell for who specify not for di 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:48.460
 sail so I think I'll wear it 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:50.560
 in the grave and that's it 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:54.010
 this is a let's say with the collector 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.010
 edition quite poor for my parents 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.450
 tastes 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:01.830
 I came into possession of 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:04.410
 says a lot more greedy a lot more 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.160
 interesting to have we say this 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.289
 it's a must have 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.020
 if you are in quotation marks of the 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:13.389
 collectors of the series but for the 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:18.200
 rest could also be quietly 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:21.320
 buy the normal version 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.870
 that with the same ica 10 euro less oh well 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:27.800
 at the discretion of how much money you want 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:29.510
 spend without missing anything here 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:34.430
 because there is a medallion a little book 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:38.990
 printed well but with pensioner then 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:41.480
 for today it's all we'll see each other 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:44.800
 boxing and I meanwhile I'm going to play 

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:48.220
 we hope this is a masterpiece of the game 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.220
 from the boys
