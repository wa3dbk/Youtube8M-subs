00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
this because they have a very low

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.350 
this because they have a very low
diameter<00:00:43.440> almost<00:00:43.860> no<00:00:44.340> stretch<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.329> can

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
Berkeley big-game it's one of our

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.250 
Berkeley big-game it's one of our
favorites<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.820> might<00:01:02.969> use<00:01:03.149> 30<00:01:03.449> pound<00:01:03.750> or<00:01:03.960> 20

pound<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.040> length<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.430> kind<00:01:05.640> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
pound and the length is kind of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.580 
pound and the length is kind of
important<00:01:06.210> we<00:01:06.570> choose<00:01:06.840> about<00:01:07.110> three<00:01:07.409> feet

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
important we choose about three feet

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.899 
important we choose about three feet
because<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:07.950> don't<00:01:08.100> want<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> join

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
because we don't want to have the join

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.940 
because we don't want to have the join

but<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.939> enough<00:01:12.270> length<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.900> we<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.140> wrap

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
but we like enough length so we can wrap

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.350 
but we like enough length so we can wrap
