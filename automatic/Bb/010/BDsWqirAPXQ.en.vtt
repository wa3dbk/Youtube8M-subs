funniest human beings alive he is the
king<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.350> roasting<00:01:43.799> people<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.250> an<00:01:44.340> absolute

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
king of it and I think this is a

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.289 
king of it and I think this is a
significant<00:01:47.430> announcement<00:01:47.610> because<00:01:47.909> look<00:01:48.149> we

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
significant announcement because look we

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.270 
significant announcement because look we
knew<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:49.170> you're<00:01:49.320> gonna<00:01:49.439> get<00:01:49.590> Tim<00:01:49.799> Allen<00:01:50.130> and

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
knew that you're gonna get Tim Allen and

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.639 
knew that you're gonna get Tim Allen and
Tom<00:01:50.430> Hanks<00:01:50.640> back<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.270> knew<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:52.350> Don

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
Tom Hanks back and we knew that but Don

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.350 
Tom Hanks back and we knew that but Don
Rickles<00:01:53.009> coming<00:01:53.460> back<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.640> think<00:01:54.030> kind<00:01:54.240> of

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
Rickles coming back I think kind of

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.330 
Rickles coming back I think kind of
sends<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.689> signal<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.200> we<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.409> expect<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
sends a signal that we can expect the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.030 
sends a signal that we can expect the
crew<00:01:56.640> back<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.360> we<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.630> expect<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.049> see<00:01:58.229> John

as well so I'm really encouraged by this

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.190 
as well so I'm really encouraged by this
number<00:02:21.120> one<00:02:21.270> because<00:02:21.540> it's<00:02:21.690> rickles<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.170> I

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
number one because it's rickles and I

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.780 
number one because it's rickles and I
love<00:02:22.440> hearing<00:02:22.590> Rickles<00:02:23.010> but<00:02:23.310> number<00:02:23.520> two<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.670> do

believe<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.420> sends<00:02:24.780> up<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.960> signal<00:02:25.260> flare

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
believe it it sends up a signal flare

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.650 
believe it it sends up a signal flare
that<00:02:25.740> we<00:02:26.100> can<00:02:26.310> expect<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.090> full<00:02:27.270> crew<00:02:27.570> to

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
that we can expect the full crew to

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
return and I think that's really

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
reaction I would have had if he didn't

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.040 
reaction I would have had if he didn't
come<00:02:46.230> back<00:02:46.380> because<00:02:46.590> he<00:02:46.740> does<00:02:47.010> add<00:02:47.220> such<00:02:47.610> a

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050
