00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.509
 as good so much that I am the day of 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:11.670
 Today I 'm going to talk about dragon ball z 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:14.490
 the battle of the gods 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.430
 must confess that dragon ball is one of 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.099
 my favorite animated series as well as 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.279
 many others of those times also 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:26.070
 I enjoy manga anime and even 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.830
 of the dramas but I think that with the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.220
 time we can talk more about these 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.400
 topics and without more I go directly to the 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.930
 score since in my opinion dragon 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.949
 ball z the battle of the gods deserves 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:48.470
 four girls and this is due to four 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.470
 Particular points to go detailing 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.010
 the first remarkable point of the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.180
 dragonball movie z is to acquire 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.030
 toriyama was totally immersed in the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.810
 production of this film from beginning to 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.869
 order even he has stated that due 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.229
 while he let some 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.619
 characters had forgotten as well as 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.140
 the history of each one of them but it 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.530
 mocks a bit by saying that being the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:27.289
 Creator has the luxury of giving you a review 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.289
 and remember everything at the moment 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.260
 the second favorable point for 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.490
 movie is that we can enjoy the 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:42.690
 original voices in Latin Spanish and 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.310
 that mario castañeda and rené garcía dan 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.430
 voice to the characters of goku and vegeta 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.110
 respectively so I should 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.680
 thank everyone completely 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.500
 those fans as well as the networks 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.920
 social because if it had not been for 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.560
 us that we like and we are fans 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.930
 de mario castañeda would not have been 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.930
 possible to hear him as a boku 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.750
 and the third important point to be able 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.650
 decide to watch the movie is that the 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.500
 animation is impeccable you will have seen 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.190
 already in the trailer as well as in others 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.370
 posters of it where we can 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.510
 appreciate the quality at its maximum 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:38.020
 splendor the graphics are of a 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.360
 colorful that I think there would never be 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.290
 imagined being able to watch a movie of 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.500
 dragon ball with that high quality of 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.500
 image 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.650
 the fourth remarkable point of the dragon 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.180
 ball z the battle of the gods is 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.450
 related to the three points 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.590
 previous and is that by saying that akira 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.330
 Toriyama was immersed in the production 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.110
 from the beginning to the end of 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.410
 this movie already tells us a lot 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:15.350
 because we are going to find in dragon ball 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.530
 z the battle of the gods the essence 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.320
 same as toriyama which we had not 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.260
 seen in the saga of dragon ball gt by 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.300
 example is why it is very important 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.990
 that as spectators 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.710
 let's go to the cinema thinking about who 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.440
 akira toriyama I go despite the fact that 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.880
 Most of us will see this movie 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.490
 we are currently adults 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.610
 I think it's worthy to value the fact 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.240
 that we have a unique opportunity 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:51.230
 to watch a movie Dragonball 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:54.390
 written by Akira Toriyama himself 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.420
 I really hope your comments are 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.660
 favorable or not really I hope 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:05.750
 constructive criticism so if you 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.750
 liked this video imitates digital cat 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.790
 do not sit up and comment 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.159
 remember that if I get enough 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.120
 comments 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:17.120
 later I can do cosplay
