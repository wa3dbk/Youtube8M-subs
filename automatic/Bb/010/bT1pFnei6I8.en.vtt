00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
and it's very well built from the onset

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.899 
and it's very well built from the onset
it<00:00:51.170> looks<00:00:51.559> like<00:00:51.680> it's<00:00:51.890> plastic<00:00:52.400> I<00:00:52.550> saw<00:00:52.729> this

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
it looks like it's plastic I saw this

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:54.340 
it looks like it's plastic I saw this
about<00:00:53.180> two<00:00:53.360> years<00:00:53.540> ago<00:00:53.659> when<00:00:53.930> I<00:00:53.989> first<00:00:54.019> came

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
about two years ago when I first came

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.950 
about two years ago when I first came
out<00:00:54.559> it<00:00:54.769> was<00:00:54.830> $200<00:00:55.460> at<00:00:55.670> that<00:00:56.210> time<00:00:56.449> now<00:00:56.750> it's

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
out it was $200 at that time now it's

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.710 
out it was $200 at that time now it's
only<00:00:57.140> $100<00:00:57.830> so<00:00:58.220> it's<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.640> really<00:00:59.030> good<00:00:59.330> value

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
only $100 so it's a really good value

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.460 
only $100 so it's a really good value
for<00:00:59.750> your<00:01:00.049> money

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470

you<00:01:47.480> have<00:01:47.690> your<00:01:47.990> velocity<00:01:48.680> sensitive<00:01:49.610> 12<00:01:50.030> pads

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
you have your velocity sensitive 12 pads

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.970 
you have your velocity sensitive 12 pads
here<00:01:50.720> they<00:01:50.960> have<00:01:51.110> two<00:01:51.350> different<00:01:51.770> color

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
here they have two different color

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.010 
here they have two different color
backlit<00:01:52.790> so<00:01:52.970> you<00:01:53.060> know<00:01:53.240> when<00:01:53.390> they're<00:01:53.510> on<00:01:53.690> or

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
backlit so you know when they're on or

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.560 
backlit so you know when they're on or
off<00:01:54.620> and<00:01:55.040> they're<00:01:55.490> really<00:01:55.820> really<00:01:56.030> nice<00:01:56.300> to

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
off and they're really really nice to

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.720 
off and they're really really nice to
drum<00:01:56.840> with<00:01:57.080> they<00:01:57.290> feel<00:01:57.500> really<00:01:57.860> good<00:01:58.040> again

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
drum with they feel really good again

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.030 
drum with they feel really good again
their<00:01:58.880> velocity<00:01:59.480> sensitive<00:01:59.930> so<00:02:00.170> that<00:02:00.350> way<00:02:00.530> you

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
their velocity sensitive so that way you

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.360 
their velocity sensitive so that way you
can<00:02:01.310> press<00:02:01.970> it<00:02:02.350> according<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.650> power<00:02:04.100> you

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
can press it according to the power you

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.160 
can press it according to the power you
hit<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:04.640> with<00:02:04.760> will<00:02:05.090> correspond<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:05.930> the

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
hit it with will correspond to the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.020 
hit it with will correspond to the
volume<00:02:06.560> that<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:06.800> plays<00:02:07.010> out<00:02:07.220> as<00:02:07.460> as<00:02:07.729> long<00:02:07.909> as

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
volume that it plays out as as long as

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.570 
volume that it plays out as as long as
it's<00:02:08.209> mapped<00:02:08.569> that<00:02:09.019> way<00:02:09.229> but<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.800> capability

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
it's mapped that way but that capability

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.610 
it's mapped that way but that capability
is<00:02:10.729> here<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.180> have<00:02:11.209> your<00:02:11.510> 12<00:02:11.810> pads<00:02:12.200> instead<00:02:12.440> of

options<00:03:32.370> within<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.910> d8w<00:03:33.360> software<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.320> also

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
options within a d8w software and also

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.340 
options within a d8w software and also
could<00:03:35.250> probably<00:03:35.459> be<00:03:35.820> used<00:03:35.850> if<00:03:36.360> you<00:03:36.720> map<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:37.320> to

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
could probably be used if you map it to

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.650 
could probably be used if you map it to
a<00:03:37.769> looping<00:03:38.280> function<00:03:38.730> saying<00:03:38.970> in<00:03:39.180> DJ<00:03:39.480> software

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
a looping function saying in DJ software

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.300 
a looping function saying in DJ software
so<00:03:40.019> that<00:03:40.140> way<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:40.320> can<00:03:40.440> half<00:03:40.680> your<00:03:40.890> loop<00:03:41.130> you

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
so that way you can half your loop you

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.280 
so that way you can half your loop you
can<00:03:41.459> double<00:03:41.820> your<00:03:41.880> loop<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.329> things<00:03:43.019> of<00:03:43.170> that

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
can double your loop and things of that

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.759 
can double your loop and things of that
nature

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
nature

next<00:03:44.459> up<00:03:44.610> your<00:03:44.910> 12<00:03:45.420> pads<00:03:45.780> do<00:03:46.140> have<00:03:46.410> Bank<00:03:47.090> ABCD

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
next up your 12 pads do have Bank ABCD

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.300 
next up your 12 pads do have Bank ABCD
so<00:03:48.329> they<00:03:48.570> have<00:03:48.720> four<00:03:49.079> banks<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.620> 12<00:03:49.920> four<00:03:50.280> times

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
so they have four banks of 12 four times

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
hold button that is somewhat like a

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.970 
hold button that is somewhat like a
toggle<00:03:57.000> so<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.540> can<00:03:57.750> have<00:03:57.989> your<00:03:58.260> button<00:03:58.739> be

instead of when you have D hold
unselected<00:04:03.989> it's<00:04:04.320> just<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.590> quick<00:04:05.190> on/off<00:04:05.700> like

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
unselected it's just a quick on/off like

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.449 
unselected it's just a quick on/off like
a<00:04:06.359> quick<00:04:06.720> drum<00:04:07.079> so<00:04:07.650> you<00:04:07.709> have<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.070> ability<00:04:08.430> to

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
a quick drum so you have the ability to

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.699 
a quick drum so you have the ability to
change<00:04:08.850> that<00:04:09.060> right<00:04:09.239> here<00:04:09.570> on<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:10.019> fly<00:04:10.260> with

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
your readout which shows you your note

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.710 
your readout which shows you your note
value<00:04:16.289> or<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:17.220> can<00:04:17.340> show<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.609> your<00:04:18.060> velocity

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
value or it can show you your velocity

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.800 
value or it can show you your velocity
sensitivity<00:04:19.590> so<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.700> harder<00:04:21.209> you<00:04:21.299> hit<00:04:21.479> it<00:04:21.630> the

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
sensitivity so the harder you hit it the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.440 
sensitivity so the harder you hit it the
more<00:04:22.190> you'll<00:04:23.190> see<00:04:23.400> that<00:04:23.430> number<00:04:23.729> jump<00:04:24.090> up<00:04:24.240> to

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
and the softer you hit it the less

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.490 
and the softer you hit it the less
you'll<00:04:26.460> see<00:04:26.729> it<00:04:26.849> there<00:04:27.060> next<00:04:27.900> up<00:04:28.169> you<00:04:28.320> have
