00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.170 
of the game I'm gonna show you how to
make<00:00:33.149> grid-based<00:00:33.989> movement<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.430> it

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
make grid-based movement just like it

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.840 
make grid-based movement just like it
was<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.660> mystery<00:00:37.200> legends<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> first

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
was in mystery legends so the first

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.380 
was in mystery legends so the first
thing<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.090> want<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.329> do<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.719> create<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.260> sprite

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
thing we want to do is create a sprite

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.910 
thing we want to do is create a sprite
and<00:00:42.390> I'm<00:00:42.600> going<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.780> use<00:00:42.899> thirty-two<00:00:43.350> about<00:00:43.500> 32

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
and I'm going to use thirty-two about 32

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.100 
and I'm going to use thirty-two about 32
it's<00:00:44.219> important<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:45.000> remember<00:00:45.360> what

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
it's important to remember what

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.069 
it's important to remember what
dimensions<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.920> use<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.840> I'm<00:00:48.960> just

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
dimensions you use for this and I'm just

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.500 
dimensions you use for this and I'm just
going<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.260> use<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> simple<00:00:50.370> ball<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:50.820> usual<00:00:51.180> as

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
going to use a simple ball as usual as

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.240 
going to use a simple ball as usual as
usual<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:53.480> name<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:58.079> I'm<00:00:58.800> also<00:00:59.070> gonna

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250

create a background and I'm also gonna

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.679 
create a background and I'm also gonna
use<00:01:02.699> thirty-two<00:01:03.420> about<00:01:03.780> 32<00:01:04.909> this<00:01:05.909> part<00:01:06.180> isn't

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
use thirty-two about 32 this part isn't

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.140 
use thirty-two about 32 this part isn't
necessary<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:07.680> it'll<00:01:08.460> help<00:01:08.610> show<00:01:09.000> off

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
necessary but it'll help show off

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.899 
necessary but it'll help show off
exactly<00:01:09.390> what's<00:01:09.900> going<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.549> I'm<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:11.610> gonna

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
exactly what's going on I'm just gonna

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.550 
exactly what's going on I'm just gonna
create<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.299> straight<00:01:12.630> line<00:01:12.840> down<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> right

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
create a straight line down the right

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.230 
create a straight line down the right
side<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.520> bottom<00:01:19.729> okay<00:01:20.729> now<00:01:21.030> let's

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
side and the bottom okay now let's

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.810 
side and the bottom okay now let's
create<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.570> object

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.850 

and<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.270> first<00:01:27.480> thing<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.720> want<00:01:27.870> to<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.350> add

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
and the first thing we want to do is add

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.590 
and the first thing we want to do is add
in<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.820> create<00:01:30.300> event<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:32.030> create<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.120> variable

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
in a create event and create a variable

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.120 
in a create event and create a variable
called<00:01:33.770> no<00:01:34.770> key<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.340> set<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.600> true<00:01:38.900> okay

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
called no key and set it to true okay

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.780 
called no key and set it to true okay
now<00:01:41.130> we'll<00:01:41.550> add<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:42.290> keyboard<00:01:43.290> events<00:01:43.790> we'll

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
now we'll add in keyboard events we'll

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.290 
now we'll add in keyboard events we'll
use<00:01:45.740> just<00:01:46.740> regular<00:01:46.770> keyboard<00:01:47.550> not<00:01:47.700> key<00:01:48.000> press

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
use just regular keyboard not key press

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.570 
use just regular keyboard not key press
or<00:01:48.510> anything<00:01:48.660> like<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.900> and<00:01:49.350> start<00:01:50.250> off<00:01:50.340> with

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
or anything like that and start off with

00:01:50.580 --> 00:02:09.710 
or anything like that and start off with
rot

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.330 

okay<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:12.330> first<00:02:13.330> we<00:02:13.660> set<00:02:14.170> no<00:02:14.440> key<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:15.040> false

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
okay so first we set no key to false

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.520 
okay so first we set no key to false
you'll<00:02:16.180> see<00:02:16.360> while<00:02:16.600> we're<00:02:16.810> using<00:02:17.200> this

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
you'll see while we're using this

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.330 
you'll see while we're using this
variable<00:02:17.890> later<00:02:18.490> on<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.000> we<00:02:19.930> check<00:02:20.260> if<00:02:20.560> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
variable later on and we check if the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.780 
variable later on and we check if the
object<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.940> snapped<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.380> 32<00:02:23.800> by<00:02:23.950> 32<00:02:24.250> grid

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
object is snapped to the 32 by 32 grid

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:33.240 
object is snapped to the 32 by 32 grid
then<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:28.120> use<00:02:28.390> motion<00:02:29.020> set<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:31.470> tell<00:02:32.470> how<00:02:32.890> fast

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
then we use motion set to tell how fast

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.670 
then we use motion set to tell how fast
the<00:02:34.000> object<00:02:34.570> is<00:02:34.750> going<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.960> be<00:02:35.050> moving<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.500> in

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
the object is going to be moving and in

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.640 
the object is going to be moving and in
what<00:02:35.980> direction<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.960> right<00:02:37.960> here<00:02:38.200> we<00:02:38.440> tell

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
what direction and right here we tell

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.470 
what direction and right here we tell
what<00:02:38.950> direction<00:02:39.040> that's<00:02:39.430> in<00:02:39.640> degrees<00:02:40.060> so

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
what direction that's in degrees so

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.900 
what direction that's in degrees so
we're<00:02:40.720> moving<00:02:40.840> right<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:41.530> it'll<00:02:42.220> be<00:02:42.310> zero<00:02:42.580> and

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
we're moving right so it'll be zero and

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.580 
we're moving right so it'll be zero and
we're<00:02:43.450> going<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.630> be<00:02:43.720> going<00:02:43.870> at<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.170> speed<00:02:44.440> of

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
we're going to be going at a speed of

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.410 
we're going to be going at a speed of
two<00:02:46.560> okay<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.590> we<00:02:47.980> can<00:02:48.190> just<00:02:48.580> duplicate<00:02:49.150> this

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
two okay and we can just duplicate this

00:02:49.420 --> 00:03:09.399 
two okay and we can just duplicate this
and<00:02:50.459> create<00:02:51.459> all<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.790> other<00:02:51.940> ones

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.190 

okay<00:03:10.409> now<00:03:11.069> we<00:03:11.129> need<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:11.640> create<00:03:11.879> a<00:03:12.269> release

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
okay now we need to create a release

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.130 
okay now we need to create a release
event<00:03:13.680> for<00:03:13.890> all<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.129> those<00:03:14.750> so<00:03:15.750> we'll<00:03:15.930> start

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
event for all of those so we'll start

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.130 
event for all of those so we'll start
off<00:03:16.319> with<00:03:16.500> rod<00:03:16.709> again<00:03:18.379> and<00:03:20.569> that's<00:03:21.569> all<00:03:21.900> we're

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
off with rod again and that's all we're

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.229 
off with rod again and that's all we're
gonna<00:03:22.230> be<00:03:22.439> topping<00:03:22.819> and<00:03:23.819> we<00:03:23.939> can<00:03:24.090> just

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
gonna be topping and we can just

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.970 
gonna be topping and we can just
duplicate<00:03:24.689> this<00:03:24.930> again<00:03:25.260> for<00:03:25.500> all<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:25.859> the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
duplicate this again for all of the

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:36.830 
duplicate this again for all of the
other<00:03:26.159> key<00:03:26.430> press<00:03:26.700> events<00:03:34.489> okay<00:03:35.489> now<00:03:36.329> we<00:03:36.390> need

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
other key press events okay now we need

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:57.759 
other key press events okay now we need
to<00:03:37.079> add<00:03:37.260> in<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.650> step<00:03:37.920> event

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.550 

okay<00:03:58.849> so<00:03:59.849> this<00:04:00.480> is<00:04:00.659> your<00:04:00.810> gonna<00:04:00.900> just<00:04:01.140> gonna

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
okay so this is your gonna just gonna

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.369 
okay so this is your gonna just gonna
check<00:04:01.890> if<00:04:02.129> no<00:04:02.310> key<00:04:02.549> is<00:04:02.670> set<00:04:02.819> to<00:04:02.939> true<00:04:03.120> if<00:04:03.599> it<00:04:04.230> is

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
check if no key is set to true if it is

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.009 
check if no key is set to true if it is
then<00:04:04.860> it<00:04:05.040> checks<00:04:05.310> if<00:04:05.519> your<00:04:05.849> snapped<00:04:06.269> in<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.510> 32

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
then it checks if your snapped in the 32

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.300 
then it checks if your snapped in the 32
by<00:04:07.170> 32<00:04:07.470> grid<00:04:07.909> then<00:04:08.909> motion<00:04:09.540> is<00:04:09.720> set<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.140> 0<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.890> 0

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
by 32 grid then motion is set to 0 and 0

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.869 
by 32 grid then motion is set to 0 and 0
it<00:04:12.260> doesn't<00:04:13.260> really<00:04:13.349> matter<00:04:13.620> what<00:04:14.159> direction

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
it doesn't really matter what direction

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.020 
it doesn't really matter what direction
you<00:04:15.359> use<00:04:15.629> but<00:04:16.109> I'll<00:04:16.889> just<00:04:17.100> leave<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:17.370> at<00:04:17.459> 0<00:04:17.699> and

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
you use but I'll just leave it at 0 and

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.790 
you use but I'll just leave it at 0 and
set<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.449> speed<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.690> 0<00:04:20.180> okay<00:04:21.199> now<00:04:22.199> we'll<00:04:22.470> add<00:04:22.620> in

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
set the speed to 0 okay now we'll add in

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.330 
set the speed to 0 okay now we'll add in
the<00:04:22.830> room<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:25.370> set<00:04:26.370> this<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.550> 32<00:04:27.090> by<00:04:27.210> 32<00:04:28.340> place

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
the room and set this to 32 by 32 place

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.450 
the room and set this to 32 by 32 place
the<00:04:30.030> ball<00:04:30.210> anywhere<00:04:30.660> and<00:04:31.110> add<00:04:32.100> in<00:04:32.280> the

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
the ball anywhere and add in the

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.990 
the ball anywhere and add in the
background

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:46.420 

okay<00:04:36.000> now<00:04:36.180> let's<00:04:36.389> test<00:04:36.570> it<00:04:36.750> out

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.640 

and<00:04:46.520> I'm<00:04:47.330> not<00:04:47.480> really<00:04:47.630> sure<00:04:47.750> how<00:04:48.170> much<00:04:48.320> you<00:04:48.470> can

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
and I'm not really sure how much you can

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.640 
and I'm not really sure how much you can
tell<00:04:48.860> in<00:04:49.210> just<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.360> video<00:04:50.690> but<00:04:51.110> you<00:04:51.290> can<00:04:51.440> try

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
tell in just the video but you can try

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.920 
tell in just the video but you can try
this<00:04:51.710> out<00:04:52.010> for<00:04:52.040> yourself<00:04:52.220> and<00:04:52.930> it's

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
this out for yourself and it's

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.500 
this out for yourself and it's
grid-based<00:04:54.410> movement<00:04:54.740> no<00:04:55.580> matter<00:04:55.790> when<00:04:56.480> you

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
grid-based movement no matter when you

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.230 
grid-based movement no matter when you
let<00:04:56.870> off<00:04:56.990> the<00:04:57.170> key<00:04:57.380> then<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.580> ball<00:04:58.790> will<00:04:59.000> keep

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
let off the key then the ball will keep

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.120 
let off the key then the ball will keep
moving<00:04:59.630> until<00:04:59.960> it<00:05:00.140> snapped<00:05:00.500> into<00:05:00.800> the<00:05:00.920> grid

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
moving until it snapped into the grid

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.500 
moving until it snapped into the grid
again<00:05:01.550> and<00:05:02.890> it's<00:05:03.890> just<00:05:04.100> a<00:05:04.420> simple<00:05:05.420> little

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
again and it's just a simple little

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.230 
again and it's just a simple little
movement<00:05:06.160> good<00:05:07.160> based<00:05:07.340> movement<00:05:07.610> example<00:05:08.380> and

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
movement good based movement example and

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.740 
movement good based movement example and
that<00:05:11.240> is<00:05:11.480> all<00:05:11.720> for<00:05:11.750> this<00:05:12.170> one

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
that is all for this one

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.890 
that is all for this one
maybe<00:05:14.750> you<00:05:14.900> learnt<00:05:15.110> something<00:05:15.770> like<00:05:16.900> snapping

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
maybe you learnt something like snapping

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.890 
maybe you learnt something like snapping
to<00:05:18.200> grids<00:05:18.470> and<00:05:18.710> things<00:05:18.860> like<00:05:19.070> that<00:05:19.130> you<00:05:19.460> know

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
to grids and things like that you know

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.960 
to grids and things like that you know
but<00:05:20.900> that's<00:05:21.770> all<00:05:22.070> I<00:05:22.130> really<00:05:22.370> want<00:05:22.520> to<00:05:22.580> do<00:05:22.730> this

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
but that's all I really want to do this

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.710 
but that's all I really want to do this
do<00:05:23.450> win<00:05:23.600> this<00:05:23.780> one<00:05:23.990> and<00:05:24.230> see<00:05:24.530> you<00:05:24.590> next
