00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
wrist are not in perfect alignment

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.490 
wrist are not in perfect alignment
that's<00:02:08.170> an<00:02:08.350> injury<00:02:08.649> waiting<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.039> happen<00:02:09.190> so

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
that's an injury waiting to happen so

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.930 
that's an injury waiting to happen so
most<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.769> time<00:02:11.980> it's<00:02:12.160> in<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.400> wrist<00:02:12.610> here

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
most of the time it's in the wrist here

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.330 
most of the time it's in the wrist here
for<00:02:13.420> at<00:02:13.630> least<00:02:13.660> this<00:02:13.989> move<00:02:14.230> which<00:02:14.920> means<00:02:14.950> that

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
for at least this move which means that

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.220 
for at least this move which means that
your<00:02:15.489> wrist<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:15.910> deviating<00:02:16.569> one<00:02:16.720> pressure<00:02:16.989> on

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
your wrist is deviating one pressure on

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.080 
your wrist is deviating one pressure on
the<00:02:17.350> other<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:18.100> when<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.489> grip<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.730> pole

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
the other so when you grip the pole

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.910 
the other so when you grip the pole
you'll<00:02:19.959> notice<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.319> in<00:02:20.440> order<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.739> maintain

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
you'll notice that in order to maintain

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.400 
you'll notice that in order to maintain
a<00:02:21.220> straight<00:02:21.730> position<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.810> need<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.110> release

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
a straight position you need to release

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.220 
a straight position you need to release
that<00:02:23.739> first<00:02:24.010> finger<00:02:24.250> just<00:02:24.910> like<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.300> at<00:02:26.080> the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
that first finger just like that at the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.720 
that first finger just like that at the
very<00:02:26.410> least<00:02:26.560> okay

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
very least okay

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.970 
very least okay
otherwise<00:02:28.660> if<00:02:29.049> I'm<00:02:29.230> gripping<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.680> this<00:02:29.799> way

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
otherwise if I'm gripping it this way

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.199 
otherwise if I'm gripping it this way
you'll<00:02:30.160> notice<00:02:30.430> what's<00:02:30.640> happening<00:02:30.910> to<00:02:31.060> my

wrist this is coming up to the side and

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.710 
wrist this is coming up to the side and
that<00:02:33.400> creates<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.850> lot<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:34.030> damage<00:02:34.570> right

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
and of course we always recommend that

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.990 
and of course we always recommend that
you<00:03:08.530> practice<00:03:08.709> both<00:03:09.160> sides<00:03:09.459> for<00:03:09.850> good

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
you practice both sides for good
