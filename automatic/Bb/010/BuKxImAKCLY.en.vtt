flossers<00:03:36.180> i<00:03:36.600> think<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:37.170> these<00:03:37.290> would<00:03:37.410> be

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
flossers i think it these would be

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.960 
flossers i think it these would be
easier<00:03:37.769> for<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.010> kids<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.459> try<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.730> do<00:03:38.850> on

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
easier for the kids to try and do on

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.390 
easier for the kids to try and do on
their<00:03:39.060> own<00:03:39.350> right<00:03:40.350> now<00:03:40.470> i<00:03:40.500> floss<00:03:41.010> them<00:03:41.250> with

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
their own right now i floss them with

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.040 
their own right now i floss them with
regular<00:03:41.820> floss<00:03:42.120> but<00:03:42.420> thought<00:03:42.600> these<00:03:42.750> would<00:03:42.900> be

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
regular floss but thought these would be

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.270 
regular floss but thought these would be
easier<00:03:43.500> they<00:03:43.620> could<00:03:43.739> just<00:03:43.769> hold<00:03:43.950> them<00:03:44.100> and

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
easier they could just hold them and

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.560 
easier they could just hold them and
group<00:03:44.820> them<00:03:44.850> they<00:03:45.030> had<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.209> bunch<00:03:45.330> of<00:03:45.450> different
