00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.840
 but no 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.960
 in terms of youtube tutorial 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.850
 minecraft xbox 360 or playstation 3 for 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.349
 make a junkie cannon like that is a 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.760
 Anvil cannon is if you do not know what 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.369
 they are the anvil after in our things 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.310
 like iron that what it does is 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.200
 repair your tool rename or put 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.029
 enchantments not because it is very useful 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.590
 it's survival what we 're going to do is 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.239
 jong cannon that is it can be 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.310
 deadly if you hit someone from 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.140
 your friends and then at the same time to 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.430
 impress them or something like that myself 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.160
 here I made a scale of how far 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.110
 the anvil would arrive because it is a scale 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.580
 something 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.710
 says something true to say it right now 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.420
 that the more you've gotten me the more 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.380
 something has come to me and although it is up to 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.820
 this point 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.500
 after this point I have not reached more 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.050
 away for more tests I've done 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.239
 he regularly arrives as here or 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.860
 regularly it arrives as over there no longer 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.390
 is basically a question of luck and 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.830
 tricks we have and although they do know that 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.960
 there are times that it works sometimes there are not 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.490
 so good let's start as they will 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.680
 mind here is my cannon my pipes and 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.780
 all good, well, I'll give it to the 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.810
 button I hope you have the tnt 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.479
 explode works the anvil and like him 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.100
 it shoots out the but as it was left 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.690
 in this area which is not so far 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.850
 but as I had told you before the most 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.430
 that has arrived is not there as well as 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.890
 now let's try but putting the the 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.720
 anvil and looking over there not so not 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.670
 as I had told you have these tricks 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.070
 so there are times that it goes further if 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.840
 we put it like that there are times when more 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.490
 far from the other side but as it has been 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.009
 said has those tricks yes good what 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.200
 we press the button once again let's wait 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.360
 that the lieutenant exploded then low there 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.159
 piston and point as you see there goes out 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.870
 shot of the anvil that as you see now 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.610
 we did not get that far 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.820
 as I told them it's a matter of luck 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.620
 and several attempts to get them 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.750
 a brand like mine not so good 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.900
 we go with the tutorial so good the 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.730
 materials that we need are redstone 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.550
 a reddish torch and stick several 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:10.149
 repeaters a piston several anvils 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.920
 several blocks of dynamite and the material 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.470
 with which they are going to build their cannon 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.510
 A bucket of water and a button is everything 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.250
 what do you need so now first thing 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.080
 what are we going to have to do is with 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.110
 our knowing material we are going to do 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.000
 something like a like a row of three 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.680
 blocks and from this row three 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.310
 blocks we're going to go straight eight 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.350
 blocks like that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 then 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.770
 we count two blocks and the second 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.050
 we do the same not the 28 blocks like that 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.730
 some since we have done this we are going to 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.560
 put the bucket of water in the first 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.900
 block then how will he realize 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.820
 or the water goes down but it does not go from where 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.800
 we put our blocks one has 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.530
 done and done this what not to do 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.360
 is that they are going to put a block without 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.400
 indicate that below this block there is no 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.900
 we have to put in the same time 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.430
 here we are going to put a button 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.140
 it is already a matter of you if you want 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.209
 decorate a little bit if you want to put 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.650
 some kind of ones or something like that so that 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.510
 see that the water is always 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.099
 running and current as it will be done in 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.470
 how much water is seen here and that was 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.840
 what I did then once this was done 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.090
 we are going to put remains on this side 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.439
 from here all the eight blocks of law of 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.120
 left or they can make the 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.829
 right and what's next on the other side 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.780
 then what we're going to do is we're going to 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.489
 do the same of the eight blocks but 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.319
 leaving one in between then like 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.120
 come we leave a block in half and then 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.760
 we are going to go another eight blocks not 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.489
 until here once this is done we are going to 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.129
 put redstone to the right of the button a 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.650
 repeater in four tips tics sorry or 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.389
 tips then another of the redstone and we're going to 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.540
 put this whole row full of 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.370
 repeaters in four tips tbp tips no 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.260
 fuck tics 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.700
 make sure everyone is in four 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.579
 ticks because if not it will not work and 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.439
 Well, not the pointer that will not come out 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.299
 well so to know that all all 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:53.590
 all be in four tics once done 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.590
 this what not to do is that they will go up 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.329
 a block like that with wool then they will go up 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.549
 another block but this time watching for 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.650
 this side to the left and they go to 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.629
 put 2 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.790
 what follows now we expose xonaca network 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.549
 oops network are I said no network torch 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.829
 are here and we are going to put here a 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.329
 arrest torch will have something left 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.700
 well and then last we put what 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.259
 out a piston as you will realize 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.989
 we already have our cannon done is 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:21.299
 quite simple and quite so useful the 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.310
 really good the useful because they are not so 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.259
 useful but they can cheat their friends not 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.210
 I know of trolling them though I tell them not to 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:28.620
 always going to fall in the same place 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.990
 good once they have built their 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.759
 cannon are simply going to put tnt in 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.440
 all this side do not put under that 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.600
 block because if you are not going to go the 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.440
 water and we put an anvil either watching 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.389
 for here or seeing there not for there 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.280
 for the horizon for either as 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.900
 you prefer to put it in the brand 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.410
 that I did farther anvil had put 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.850
 so I say but like that but well days 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.199
 They know they are tricks the anvil has 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.539
 so once we had already 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.400
 built we give a bach we make sure 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.530
 that options left in the options of 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.020
 I play this dynamite exploded 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.280
 we give the button and we will wait for our 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.520
 brand we do not have 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.820
 and wait and how they will find out is evo 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.010
 I see right now ugly I do not know why it looks 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.710
 so ugly but that does not usually happen 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.510
 let's try one last time you know 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.639
 that there are epic fail sometimes in the 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.830
 videos and then this is one of them 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.020
 as we wait a moment and when it has 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.760
 latent explode as they will realize the 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.440
 Anvil will fly out this time 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.340
 our brand did not get that far 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:32.300
 but it is something 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:35.570
 it's something I do not know is something distant from what 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.370
 outside the canyon and then we're going to mark there 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.110
 our marquita to see if we have 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.150
 another opportunity or another chance that 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.710
 our our juncker arrive more 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.479
 away so good we grabbed the 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.889
 dynamite we grab option that is and 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.020
 we do the same again now 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:49.790
 let's do it with the anvil watching for that 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.550
 side to see how far it goes we're going to 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.680
 put tnt 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.090
 and then let's activate the button let's 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.080
 expect the lieutenant to explode as 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:01.210
 nobody takes a little bit and it exploded wow 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.990
 as they will realize just in the same 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.700
 brand 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.230
 sometimes it is coincidence that in the same 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.060
 mark but I tell you that there are times that goes 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.340
 to get much farther there are others that 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.200
 will get much less far and then 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.880
 good as I had told you is 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.590
 question of luck and tricks of the 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.290
 ships so good let's go with the 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.540
 third released the third and last to 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:22.540
 that this video does not last as long we are going to 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.160
 activate the TNT we just wait and 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.710
 point 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.110
 wow as they realize almost in it 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:32.080
 mark this time we had a run of almost 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.660
 the same brand almost three good to 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.950
 almost three consecutive times this one 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.070
 will realize that the truth is a matter 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.630
 so that you will be lucky 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.580
 if it goes very far and it is that it arrives 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.280
 closer and the cole had been done is 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.230
 very lucky and I do not know is 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.450
 coincidence that he believes in the same place 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.760
 we will go as they realize this 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.140
 It went much further than good 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.390
 we did this last test because if not 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.370
 it solves us proved this I say about 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.750
 ten blocks or maybe further 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.000
 of the other brand as they will realize 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.500
 went much farther than the other brand 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.900
 and as I said and I'll go back to 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.120
 repeat a thousand and one times is a matter of 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.770
 luck and then I do not know it's not like 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.930
 put the anvil because the anvil like 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.919
 put it going to always be the same but 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.900
 Well , you know it's a matter of 

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:16.030
 coincidence coincidence is the word 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.520

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.540
