you're<00:01:38.490> looking<00:01:38.579> for<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.299> line<00:01:39.600> of

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
you're looking for is this line of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.359 
you're looking for is this line of
whiskey<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.229> appears<00:01:40.650> across<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> top<00:01:41.220> of

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
whiskey that appears across the top of

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.399 
whiskey that appears across the top of
the<00:01:41.430> glass<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.880> after<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> couple<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.990> seconds

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
the glass and after a couple of seconds

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.620 
the glass and after a couple of seconds
you<00:01:43.770> get<00:01:43.860> little<00:01:44.130> beads<00:01:44.430> or<00:01:44.729> little<00:01:45.060> tears<00:01:45.450> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
you get little beads or little tears and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.120 
you get little beads or little tears and
legs<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.110> begin<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.470> come<00:01:46.710> down<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.040> those

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
legs that begin to come down and those

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.130 
legs that begin to come down and those
tears<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.460> legs<00:01:47.640> tell<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.909> two<00:01:48.210> things<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
tears and legs tell you two things the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.870 
tears and legs tell you two things the
size<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.619> them<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:49.920> they<00:01:50.070> appear<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.640> rim

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
size of them as they appear on the rim

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.740 
size of them as they appear on the rim
it<00:01:51.479> tells<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.380> alcohol<00:01:52.950> content<00:01:53.159> if<00:01:53.750> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
it tells you the alcohol content if the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.959 
it tells you the alcohol content if the
nation<00:01:55.049> fat<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.560> that's<00:01:55.920> 40%<00:01:56.430> alcohol

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
nation fat like that that's 40% alcohol

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.120 
nation fat like that that's 40% alcohol
if<00:01:57.450> they're<00:01:57.689> very<00:01:57.899> very<00:01:58.079> small<00:01:58.500> it's<00:01:58.740> high<00:01:58.979> in

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
if they're very very small it's high in

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.920 
if they're very very small it's high in
alcohol<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.759> if<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.210> was<00:02:00.420> wine<00:02:00.630> you'd<00:02:00.810> be

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
alcohol and if this was wine you'd be

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.300 
alcohol and if this was wine you'd be
really<00:02:01.140> really<00:02:01.469> fat<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.829> go<00:02:01.920> down<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.100> side

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
really really fat and go down the side

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.999 
really really fat and go down the side
of<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.520> glass<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.990> also<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.439> time<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.860> takes

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
of the glass the also the time it takes

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.469 
of the glass the also the time it takes
those<00:02:05.250> tears<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.729> come<00:02:05.820> down<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> side<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.360> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
those tears to come down the side of the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.690 
those tears to come down the side of the
glass<00:02:06.570> tells<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.409> viscosity<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.160> thick

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
glass tells you the viscosity the thick

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.999 
glass tells you the viscosity the thick
of<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> spirit<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:10.200> longer<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> takes<00:02:10.800> to

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
of the spirit the longer it takes to

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.920 
of the spirit the longer it takes to
calm<00:02:11.220> down<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:12.000> thicker<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.360> spirit<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
calm down the thicker the spirit and the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.930 
calm down the thicker the spirit and the
viscosity<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.620> made<00:02:13.800> up<00:02:13.920> basically<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.489> oils

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
viscosity is made up basically of oils

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.199 
viscosity is made up basically of oils
fats<00:02:15.270> esters<00:02:16.080> alcohol<00:02:16.560> that's<00:02:17.400> flavor<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.120> the

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
fats esters alcohol that's flavor so the

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.370 
fats esters alcohol that's flavor so the
longer<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.540> takes<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.780> come<00:02:18.930> down<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.200> glass

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
longer it takes to come down the glass

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.589 
longer it takes to come down the glass
the<00:02:19.650> more<00:02:19.680> flavor<00:02:20.099> is<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.550> glass<00:02:20.819> it

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
the more flavor is in the glass it

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.420 
the more flavor is in the glass it
doesn't<00:02:21.660> tell<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.319> whether<00:02:22.440> it's<00:02:22.620> good<00:02:22.830> and

help<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.090> evaporate<00:03:06.569> at<00:03:06.720> all<00:03:06.900> that's<00:03:07.200> why<00:03:07.350> I

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
help to evaporate at all that's why I

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.039 
help to evaporate at all that's why I
can<00:03:07.650> smell<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.040> from<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.640> way<00:03:08.760> down<00:03:09.000> here<00:03:09.269> if<00:03:09.450> you

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
can smell it from a way down here if you

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.449 
can smell it from a way down here if you
