00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
with a 2013 edition here's the 2013

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.720 
with a 2013 edition here's the 2013
edition<00:01:00.920> I<00:01:01.280> know<00:01:01.340> both<00:01:01.730> this<00:01:02.510> one<00:01:03.100> SI<00:01:04.100> dhab

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
edition I know both this one SI dhab

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.790 
edition I know both this one SI dhab
particularly<00:01:05.180> optical<00:01:05.900> cable<00:01:06.230> jack<00:01:06.440> is<00:01:06.620> not

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
particularly optical cable jack is not

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.560 
particularly optical cable jack is not
the<00:01:06.890> same<00:01:07.070> so<00:01:07.340> right<00:01:07.430> there<00:01:07.670> it's<00:01:08.300> just<00:01:08.480> a

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
the same so right there it's just a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.200 
the same so right there it's just a
circle<00:01:08.960> it's<00:01:09.800> actually<00:01:09.890> a<00:01:10.130> pointed<00:01:10.730> optical

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
circle it's actually a pointed optical

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.610 
circle it's actually a pointed optical
cable<00:01:11.480> goes<00:01:11.660> right<00:01:11.840> into<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.080> end<00:01:12.230> here<00:01:12.440> so

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
cable goes right into the end here so

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.290 
cable goes right into the end here so
it's<00:01:12.770> different<00:01:13.130> than<00:01:13.220> any<00:01:13.370> of<00:01:13.520> any<00:01:13.910> of<00:01:14.180> the

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
it's different than any of any of the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.050 
it's different than any of any of the
other<00:01:14.420> ones<00:01:14.660> on<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:15.620> front<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:16.640> have<00:01:16.790> to<00:01:16.880> set

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
other ones on the front you have to set

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.940 
other ones on the front you have to set
up<00:01:17.210> to<00:01:17.690> where<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.020> daisy<00:01:18.200> chain<00:01:18.350> can<00:01:18.650> go<00:01:18.770> in

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
up to where the daisy chain can go in

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.980 
up to where the daisy chain can go in
well<00:01:19.160> doesn't<00:01:19.940> actually<00:01:20.240> have<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.570> daisy<00:01:20.840> chain

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
well doesn't actually have a daisy chain

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.130 
well doesn't actually have a daisy chain
it<00:01:21.290> actually<00:01:21.560> just<00:01:21.680> has<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:22.540> cord<00:01:23.540> that's

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
it actually just has a cord that's

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.350 
it actually just has a cord that's
designed<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:24.710> chain<00:01:25.190> make<00:01:26.000> dance<00:01:26.180> together

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
designed to chain make dance together

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.220 
designed to chain make dance together
the<00:01:27.350> same<00:01:27.590> look<00:01:27.890> almost<00:01:28.220> on<00:01:28.880> top<00:01:29.090> look<00:01:29.420> there's

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
the same look almost on top look there's

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.980 
the same look almost on top look there's
not<00:01:30.380> too<00:01:30.530> much<00:01:30.680> of<00:01:30.800> a<00:01:30.830> difference<00:01:31.750> now<00:01:32.750> here

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
not too much of a difference now here

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
it's a couple different features like

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.070 
it's a couple different features like
right<00:02:09.020> here<00:02:09.319> this<00:02:09.470> has<00:02:09.649> an<00:02:09.860> equalizer<00:02:10.340> makes

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
right here this has an equalizer makes

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.240 
right here this has an equalizer makes
right<00:02:11.290> here<00:02:11.560> this<00:02:11.770> button<00:02:12.130> this<00:02:12.940> one<00:02:13.180> does<00:02:13.330> not

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
right here this button this one does not

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.890 
right here this button this one does not
other<00:02:15.250> than<00:02:15.370> that<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.210> really<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:16.630> only

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
other than that that is really the only

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.020 
other than that that is really the only
difference<00:02:17.380> between<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.800> two<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.010> them<00:02:18.190> now

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
difference between the two of them now

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.970 
difference between the two of them now
here<00:02:19.360> goes<00:02:19.480> my<00:02:19.540> personal<00:02:20.080> opinion<00:02:20.440> I've<00:02:20.710> used

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
here goes my personal opinion I've used

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.310 
here goes my personal opinion I've used
both<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.460> them<00:02:21.610> have<00:02:22.450> put<00:02:22.660> my<00:02:22.780> head<00:02:22.960> said<00:02:23.170> in

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
both of them have put my head said in

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.290 
both of them have put my head said in
both<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.590> them<00:02:23.740> I<00:02:23.890> put<00:02:24.490> my<00:02:24.610> steelseries<00:02:25.180> in

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
both of them I put my steelseries in

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.450 
both of them I put my steelseries in
both<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.540> them<00:02:25.750> i<00:02:25.810> put<00:02:25.990> my<00:02:26.140> Astros<00:02:27.010> in<00:02:27.130> both<00:02:27.280> of

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
both of them i put my Astros in both of

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.640 
both of them i put my Astros in both of
them<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.760> set<00:02:28.300> them<00:02:28.360> both<00:02:28.570> up<00:02:28.870> correctly<00:02:29.350> I

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
them I set them both up correctly I

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.260 
them I set them both up correctly I
turned<00:02:30.160> them<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.430> same<00:02:30.670> knobs<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.210> the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
turned them to the same knobs and the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.980 
turned them to the same knobs and the
only<00:02:31.750> difference<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.830> have<00:02:33.070> found<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:33.990> the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
only difference that I have found is the

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.770 
only difference that I have found is the
2012<00:02:35.770> gets<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.250> little<00:02:36.490> bit<00:02:36.700> louder<00:02:36.880> at<00:02:37.300> the

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
2012 gets a little bit louder at the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.210 
2012 gets a little bit louder at the
same<00:02:37.990> area<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:38.470> like<00:02:38.590> if<00:02:38.710> I<00:02:38.770> knocked<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.160> right

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
same area so like if I knocked it right

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.300 
same area so like if I knocked it right
here<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:40.510> says<00:02:40.600> right<00:02:40.720> there<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.830> knock<00:02:42.130> this

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
here it says right there and knock this

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.520 
here it says right there and knock this
one<00:02:42.490> right<00:02:42.670> there<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:42.940> same<00:02:43.270> spot<00:02:43.420> this<00:02:44.320> will

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
one right there the same spot this will

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.050 
one right there the same spot this will
be<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.710> little<00:02:44.950> bit<00:02:45.130> louder<00:02:45.370> it's<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.030> only

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
be a little bit louder it's the only

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.020 
be a little bit louder it's the only
difference<00:02:47.400> some<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.460> those<00:02:48.550> other<00:02:48.670> people

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
difference some of those other people

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.220 
difference some of those other people
think<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.390> there's<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.660> huge<00:02:49.959> huge

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
think that there's a huge huge

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.410 
think that there's a huge huge
difference<00:02:50.770> I<00:02:51.010> have<00:02:51.760> not<00:02:51.970> found<00:02:52.180> any

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
difference I have not found any

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.830 
difference I have not found any
difference<00:02:52.870> really<00:02:53.080> an<00:02:53.920> adjusted<00:02:54.550> stuff<00:02:54.840> it

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
difference really an adjusted stuff it

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.870 
difference really an adjusted stuff it
sounds<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.230> same<00:02:56.440> but<00:02:56.770> that's<00:02:57.370> been<00:02:57.640> again

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
sounds the same but that's been again

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.630 
sounds the same but that's been again
like<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.120> said<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.360> got<00:02:58.690> lucky<00:02:58.959> I<00:02:59.140> got<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.640> 2013

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
is messed up it probably won't say it

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.780 
is messed up it probably won't say it
sound<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.630> same<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.560> lot<00:03:08.740> of<00:03:08.770> 2013's<00:03:09.580> have

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
sound the same and a lot of 2013's have

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.949 
sound the same and a lot of 2013's have
been<00:03:09.970> messed<00:03:10.150> up<00:03:10.270> because<00:03:10.360> remember<00:03:10.660> this<00:03:10.870> is

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
been messed up because remember this is

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.930 
been messed up because remember this is
a<00:03:10.990> new<00:03:11.110> product<00:03:11.380> being<00:03:12.280> sent<00:03:12.520> out<00:03:12.670> it's<00:03:12.880> a

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
a new product being sent out it's a

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.330 
a new product being sent out it's a
little<00:03:13.180> different<00:03:13.330> setup<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:14.560> it's<00:03:14.860> remade<00:03:15.310> a

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
little different setup so it's remade a

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.979 
little different setup so it's remade a
different<00:03:15.760> way<00:03:15.850> so<00:03:16.300> of<00:03:16.390> course<00:03:16.630> they're<00:03:16.840> going

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
different way so of course they're going

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.050 
different way so of course they're going
to<00:03:17.080> have<00:03:17.260> some<00:03:17.560> problems<00:03:18.040> eventually<00:03:18.910> they'll

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
to have some problems eventually they'll

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.780 
to have some problems eventually they'll
get<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.300> figured<00:03:19.450> out<00:03:19.690> till<00:03:20.260> then<00:03:20.500> if<00:03:20.890> you're

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
get it figured out till then if you're

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.610 
get it figured out till then if you're
going<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:21.970> be<00:03:22.120> competing<00:03:22.209> i<00:03:22.810> recommend<00:03:23.470> get

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
going to be competing i recommend get

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.150 
going to be competing i recommend get
this<00:03:24.300> because<00:03:25.300> you<00:03:25.660> will<00:03:25.870> it'll<00:03:26.680> last<00:03:26.950> a

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
this because you will it'll last a

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.670 
this because you will it'll last a
little<00:03:27.310> longer<00:03:27.450> but<00:03:28.450> if<00:03:28.570> you<00:03:28.660> do<00:03:28.780> get<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:28.989> 2013

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
little longer but if you do get it 2013

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.650 
little longer but if you do get it 2013
