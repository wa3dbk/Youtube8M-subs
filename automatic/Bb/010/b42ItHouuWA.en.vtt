00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.400 
round but on a lighter side how are your
madden<00:01:26.780> skills<00:01:27.080> I<00:01:27.800> was<00:01:28.340> winning<00:01:28.550> 10-7<00:01:29.260> in<00:01:30.260> the

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
madden skills I was winning 10-7 in the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.690 
madden skills I was winning 10-7 in the
second<00:01:30.740> quarter<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.190> I<00:01:31.250> think<00:01:31.310> they're<00:01:31.580> all

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
second quarter so I think they're all

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.750 
second quarter so I think they're all
right<00:01:32.830> you<00:01:33.830> know<00:01:33.920> i'm<00:01:33.980> not<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.160> best<00:01:34.400> of<00:01:34.610> man<00:01:34.730> i

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
right you know i'm not the best of man i

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.040 
right you know i'm not the best of man i
probably<00:01:35.090> would<00:01:35.300> have<00:01:35.360> lost<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:35.750> tournament

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
probably would have lost the tournament

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.680 
probably would have lost the tournament
so<00:01:36.980> it's<00:01:37.280> almost<00:01:37.400> better<00:01:37.730> than<00:01:37.820> hanging<00:01:38.450> out

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
so it's almost better than hanging out

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.560 
so it's almost better than hanging out
now<00:01:38.930> rather<00:01:39.530> than<00:01:39.730> playing<00:01:40.730> and<00:01:41.030> losing<00:01:41.360> next

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
now rather than playing and losing next

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.190 
now rather than playing and losing next
game<00:01:41.750> so<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.970> was<00:01:44.090> tough<00:01:44.330> what's<00:01:44.870> going<00:01:45.080> on

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200
