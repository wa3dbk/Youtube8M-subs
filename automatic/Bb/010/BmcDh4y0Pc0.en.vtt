00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.410
 Sebastien loeb three points are really very simple from the flour of 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.919
 the water 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.379
 yeast and a little salt for seasoning 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.339
 I start by mixing the salt with the flour 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.449
 so that it is not in direct contact with the yeast then I 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.009
 say it often lasts with a little bit 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.689
 in the sky 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.279
 especially not hot or hot even less to avoid killing yeasts 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.949
 I come now to make a well in the center of the flour 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.100
 I pour in the yeast 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.500
 the rest of the water 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.300
 henjak corpore gently by hand flour with water 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.220
 I continue to agree for flour until I get a paste 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.030
 very soft 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.270
 like these 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.270
 I then pour this paste on a work plan 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.820
 and I'm going to start kneading now the principle being by the way 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.190
 paw of their avatar 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.790
 on herself 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.050
 regularly 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.170
 I continue to work the dough 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.170
 for the suez bringing in slightly attacking 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.720
 5 to 7 minutes the principle being to give him blindness and develop 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.060
 the gluten of the dough 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.620
 so for the insured the contents 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.750
 after cooking 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.190
 dough 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.890
 About us products corp would be amalgam I'm going to be able to now 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.380
 discard in a bowl the covered with a cloth and let it rest at 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.000
 room temperature to grow the yeast for at least one 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 half-hour 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.710
 after the bread dough and shoving it doubled to about volume I 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.710
 flour slightly my point I just hunt the air 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.200
 in order to lift all this carbon dioxide I go now for the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.210
 work to give him a shape on a floured worktop 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.610
 very slightly 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.339
 the hands flour the oci 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.339
 I will be able to take some of my paw 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:21.119
 I pass then but not for example to make balls I come etienne 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:24.319
 with legs slowly while putting the fingers inside 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.399
 I recognize the dough inward 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:29.119
 what is called the point key 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:30.939
 so as to give it a beautiful shape 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.939
 and I come next rolled with the palm of my hand 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:36.899
 we imprison the ball of bread 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:40.549
 with the fingers a little like a cage and we will turn by doing 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.829
 take the point doing it we know that the palm of the hand 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.759
 on a very lightly floured work surface 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:49.989
 so as to give it a beautiful shape and have that desire that starts from 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:50.929
 below 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:53.189
 I now pose at the point on a plate 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.469
 he is ready to cook 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.649
 the point is shaped before the leather must be allowed to push back half an hour 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:59.879
 about 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.259
 for mac is not a leather 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:05.339
 of rules in a very hot oven with humility to bring the 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.889
 military you can or go through a fair before you put them in the oven at no 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.739
 with a brush or add a small container of water during the 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.499
 cooking or when the last choice halfway through cooking you throw a self 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:18.339
 in the spirit of the oven
