00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:54.159
 Hello people, welcome, welcome. 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.019
 It's another video on the channel and I'm 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.449
 bringing you to have become one of the 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.210
 laender craft that he is not a mold 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.610
 for minecraft and yes slater that is 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.369
 based minecraft's right what 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.290
 thank him the goal and sent color 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.250
 For me the game is very frigid because this 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.280
 game is very cool see let's go 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.900
 good as all laender 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.890
 this one is not different from you 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.759
 eight pages and through them and 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.770
 It's bigger craft, you're going to ride it. 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.220
 some items are not only you do not use 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.380
 those months in particular to do 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.340
 but the same principle is not that I have 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:40.690
 I found the iron and gall gives you to do 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.130
 the lighter or you can make the flashlight 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:49.979
 anyway we have to do 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:53.409
 the two items do that already left 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.200
 problem that the lighter 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.890
 You only use it at the end if I do not use it here. 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.890
 during the game 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:13.070
 yesterday page here goes 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:15.410
 not has not run a bitch who 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.910
 also has no page that time but 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.910
 boss boss by boy 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.350
 here there is another iron will give to us 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.180
 do and is flashlight 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.970
 Just to make a flashlight, you need to 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:36.569
 plus a redstone glass I think only 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.569
 comes only that 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:54.260
 I do not think there's going to be a page here 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.390
 the order was that which is the version of which 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.300
 more current having game has other versions 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.400
 that she came from her surplus was 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.900
 an internet clip is running away from it 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.959
 came close to you 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:18.860
 but as the game if based on law is not 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:22.400
 correct and should boring is what I do 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:26.720
 I 'll always be good when I play. 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:35.739
 on the ends I'm always going on the sides 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:35.739
 besides the map afterwards I go pro 6 4 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.040
 every appliance here wall 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.520
 This game is random, it's never going 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.200
 happen the same thing is the 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.200
 reference straws never go back to the same 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.989
 place may be that one time or another 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.130
 repeat the same map you already have 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.920
 played right 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.890
 sometimes happens already happened to me 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.760
 but three times the map I did not want 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.540
 log in 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:17.350
 training three times then one is what I 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.350
 I can tell from the game here another 5 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:35.680
 there is nothing here but nothing nothing nothing has 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.680
 sure you do not have anything here 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:54.580
 I think she's having something okay. 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:56.200
 has tree has nothing herein al 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.230
 I think that this game 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:07.450
 If I'm five pages already I've looked 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:09.900
 Sing and you do not have anything else, it's not a guy. 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:14.010
 You have to have so it is not possible there 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.010
 I'll have to play again, hood. 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:25.249
 were in the center, let's see what 

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:27.849
 here is another tree or tuned 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:27.849
 enough 

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:38.959
 okay it goes wrong fucking hell ii the 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:49.249
 center of an act so that they do not have 

00:05:38.959 --> 00:06:00.439
 good the engine if it proved that it is here it is 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:06:15.519
 a 6 is missing more pike k 7 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:15.519
 then the ex-pm is flashlight and do not dial the devil 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:25.569
 but it was hiding like that 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.569
 Your chen geek 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:35.220
 here was going back there to the beginning of 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.220
 game 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.160
 I think here to here 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:07:09.820
 there once having left is flashlight 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:07:12.220
 you can penalize someone fucking much 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.900
 but if you play really cool 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.960
 I'll leave it to you for download. 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.670
 download for you to play in I hope 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.270
 You enjoyed staying and until the 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.270
 next 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:27.880
 the money 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.070
 the group is not right 

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.940
 and get lost and I'll turn right 

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.400
 the bid
