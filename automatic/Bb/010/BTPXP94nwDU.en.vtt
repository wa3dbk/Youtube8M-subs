accuracy<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:19.900> even<00:02:20.140> worse<00:02:21.450> so<00:02:22.450> when<00:02:22.900> you're

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
accuracy is even worse so when you're

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
to see how effective a bipod can be go

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.900 
to see how effective a bipod can be go
check<00:03:53.530> out<00:03:53.709> go<00:03:54.489> check<00:03:54.700> out<00:03:54.790> his<00:03:54.850> channel
