00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:07.109

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.769
hi I'm Dave Thomas at cars.com you
may have heard the BMW 3 Series before

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.760
one most popular models for a long time
for the first time BMW is bringing the

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.170
one series to the US

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.349
you might think the one Series is a
small car but it's really not that tiny

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.890
if you think it's like a mini coopers
actually two feet longer than that

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.949
and it's just a bit bigger than a howdy
83 which is their entry level now there

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.199
are two types of one serious for two
different types and drivers

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.750
this right here is a 135 high which is a
high-performance version

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.190
to 300 horsepower 20 remote charge
engine faster than the 335 it's a sports

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.640
car

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.829
has really rough handling really tight
Syrian all that other stuff the base one

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.389
serious as a 120 I

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:52.210
which has a smaller six-cylinder non
turbo charge and with 230 horsepower

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.359
that's when most people probably gonna
get but it's all sites run twenty nine

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:56.280
thousand dollars

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.679
they think with the one serious as
opposed to a three serious advanced air

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:00.829
quality would kinda be

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.330
a lesser version other BMW and in fact
13 this

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.610
very nice as I dislike the 3-series BMW
there are some slight differences on the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.790
dashboard design

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.610
but its relief flight so if you get into
what it is you really won't notice a

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.140
difference

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.920
so you're lucky you have a few friends
and you have a BMW 1-series anyone to

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.900
get them in the back

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.940
actually pretty easy to get in and out
because BMW's

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.550
added a handle at the top in the sea
every kind afford

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.890
and then a couple power button that
slide it to enforce 0

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.890
when they get the back they can actually
move back themselves BMW isn't the first

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.780
automakers get on the iPod express

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.270
and that actually iPod adapters and
glove compartment now the one theory is

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.030
that but the

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.200
you a USB port not just for iPod anymore

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.040
down here in the center console they
even have a stylus little holder for

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.180
whatever you know you have

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.640
if you get the 135 you're really gay
performance machine

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.710
it is not and I repeat NOT a car for
commuting

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.440
the ride is Rob mysterious heavy the man
it can perform

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.979
corners like a beast and get the sixty
miles an hour and 5.2 seconds and that's

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.900
when an automatic

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.250
my 11 the one last set up the thing
about this one serious is

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.160
thinking that it might be a lot less
money and anything else in a BMW lineup

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.830
it's not between a one and a three
series are only looking at about four to

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.630
five thousand dollars different

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.910
so it's not a big money saver is going
to cost you at least thirty thousand

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.480
dollars a year

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.150
any kind about running so be wary be
ready and measurement spend some cash

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.320
and drive away 39 bat

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.080
for additional information on this car
or any other

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.860
got a car start com our blog kicking
tires
