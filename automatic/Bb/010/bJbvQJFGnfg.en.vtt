up here to his ear and work work around
nice<00:05:05.100> and<00:05:05.130> detail<00:05:05.669> so<00:05:05.880> you're<00:05:06.030> going<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.240> get<00:05:06.450> a

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
nice and detail so you're going to get a

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.760

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.100 
around and we can make that brush bigger
maybe<00:05:14.040> I<00:05:14.130> should<00:05:14.310> make<00:05:14.460> a<00:05:14.520> bit<00:05:14.729> softer<00:05:15.300> and

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
maybe I should make a bit softer and

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.629 
maybe I should make a bit softer and
it's<00:05:16.290> coming<00:05:16.650> here<00:05:16.919> and<00:05:17.070> let's<00:05:17.190> get<00:05:17.370> rid<00:05:17.550> of
