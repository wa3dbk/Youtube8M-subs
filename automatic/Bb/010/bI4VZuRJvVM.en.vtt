00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
is we're actually going to draw the

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.749 
is we're actually going to draw the
outer<00:00:10.200> portion<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.250> car<00:00:11.429> we're<00:00:11.580> going<00:00:11.700> to

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
outer portion of the car we're going to

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.879 
outer portion of the car we're going to

kind of make an outline the thing that
drawing<00:00:14.370> car<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.089> really<00:00:15.360> going<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.599> be

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
drawing car is really going to be

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
drawing car is really going to be
helpful<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.550> learning<00:00:17.550> how<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.730> draw

helpful in is learning how to draw

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.019 
helpful in is learning how to draw
three-dimensional<00:00:19.710> objects<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.730> case<00:00:20.789> a

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
three-dimensional objects in this case a

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.640 
three-dimensional objects in this case a
lot<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.449> times<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:22.020> three-dimensional

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
lot of times the three-dimensional

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.769 
lot of times the three-dimensional
objects<00:00:22.980> would<00:00:23.100> even<00:00:23.279> be<00:00:23.400> moving<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.630> what

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
objects would even be moving so what

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.660 
objects would even be moving so what
we'll<00:00:24.900> do<00:00:25.109> I'm<00:00:26.099> not<00:00:26.220> going<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.430> worry<00:00:26.550> about

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
we'll do I'm not going to worry about

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.400 
we'll do I'm not going to worry about
creating<00:00:26.849> motion<00:00:27.210> necessarily<00:00:28.019> but<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.170> are

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
creating motion necessarily but we are

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.070 
creating motion necessarily but we are
going<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.710> just<00:00:28.830> concentrate<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.429> drawing

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
going to just concentrate on drawing

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.290 
going to just concentrate on drawing
outer<00:00:31.080> shell<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.890> what<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.759> car<00:00:32.969> would<00:00:33.000> look

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
outer shell of what a car would look

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.160 
outer shell of what a car would look
like<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.719> you're<00:00:33.809> going<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.079> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
like and you're going to have to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.410 
like and you're going to have to
remember<00:00:34.440> sort<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.489> where<00:00:35.610> invisible<00:00:36.149> lines

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
remember sort of where invisible lines

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.319 
remember sort of where invisible lines
are<00:00:36.840> where<00:00:37.260> they<00:00:37.469> go<00:00:37.820> where<00:00:38.820> they<00:00:38.940> connect

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
are where they go where they connect

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.990 
are where they go where they connect
with<00:00:39.450> other<00:00:39.809> lines<00:00:40.230> as<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:41.579> make<00:00:41.790> our<00:00:41.969> way

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
with other lines as we make our way

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.750 
with other lines as we make our way
around<00:00:42.660> what<00:00:42.840> will<00:00:42.960> be<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:44.070> final<00:00:44.370> car<00:00:44.550> so

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
around what will be the final car so

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.270 
around what will be the final car so
this<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.300> roof<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.649> hood

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
this is the roof and this is the hood

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.010 
this is the roof and this is the hood
and<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:48.149> will<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.539> we'll<00:00:48.780> come<00:00:48.809> in

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
and that will do now is we'll come in

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.330 
and that will do now is we'll come in
here<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.230> we'll<00:00:49.500> create<00:00:49.680> sort<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.160> first

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
here and we'll create sort of the first

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.880 
here and we'll create sort of the first
wheel<00:00:50.640> well<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.149> now<00:00:51.840> keeping<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.320> mind<00:00:52.559> what

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
wheel well and now keeping in mind what

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.590 
wheel well and now keeping in mind what
the<00:00:53.219> perspective<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> do<00:00:54.300> later

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the perspective is going to do later

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.209 
the perspective is going to do later
we're<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.350> going<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.530> do<00:00:55.590> something<00:00:55.800> simple

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
we're just going to do something simple

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.709 
we're just going to do something simple
just<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.059> little<00:00:57.149> swoop<00:00:57.510> up

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
just like that just a little swoop up

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.529 
just like that just a little swoop up
now<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.440> know<00:00:58.559> that's<00:00:58.980> kind<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.309> vague<00:01:00.149> at<00:01:00.420> this

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
now I know that's kind of vague at this

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.420 
now I know that's kind of vague at this
point<00:01:00.840> you're<00:01:00.960> not<00:01:01.050> exactly<00:01:01.350> sure<00:01:01.739> how<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
point you're not exactly sure how this

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.570 
point you're not exactly sure how this
will<00:01:02.789> work<00:01:03.149> into<00:01:03.359> each<00:01:03.480> other<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.110> got<00:01:04.260> a

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
will work into each other but you got a

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.280 
will work into each other but you got a
good<00:01:05.580> take<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.820> one<00:01:06.210> tiny<00:01:06.570> step<00:01:06.689> at<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.080> time

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
good take it one tiny step at a time

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.480 
good take it one tiny step at a time
and<00:01:07.560> we're<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> come<00:01:08.010> back<00:01:08.159> here<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and we're going to come back here and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.250 
and we're going to come back here and
draw<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.700> other<00:01:09.150> wheel<00:01:09.479> well<00:01:09.720> slightly

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
draw the other wheel well slightly

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.350 
draw the other wheel well slightly
smaller<00:01:10.530> because<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.040> further<00:01:11.220> away<00:01:11.670> where

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
smaller because it's further away where

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.109 
smaller because it's further away where
this<00:01:12.570> car<00:01:12.780> will<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:12.930> heading<00:01:13.200> towards<00:01:13.560> us<00:01:14.119> so

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
this car will be heading towards us so

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.999 
this car will be heading towards us so
now<00:01:15.360> we'll<00:01:15.930> kind<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.170> come<00:01:16.350> down<00:01:16.380> here<00:01:16.920> and

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
now we'll kind of come down here and

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.090 
now we'll kind of come down here and
we'll<00:01:17.130> connect<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> back<00:01:18.590> like<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:20.040> so

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
we'll connect the back like that so

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.920 
we'll connect the back like that so
that's<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.880> shape<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> car<00:01:21.659> heading

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that's the shape of the car heading

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.929 
that's the shape of the car heading
towards<00:01:22.200> us<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:23.070> now<00:01:23.220> we'll<00:01:23.369> start<00:01:23.460> kind<00:01:23.850> of

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
towards us so now we'll start kind of

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.149 
towards us so now we'll start kind of
drawing<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.390> two<00:01:24.509> other<00:01:24.659> dimensions<00:01:24.869> now<00:01:25.380> draw

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
drawing in two other dimensions now draw

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.530 
drawing in two other dimensions now draw
a<00:01:26.189> line<00:01:26.460> sort<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.880> runs<00:01:28.100> parallel<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.329> line

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
a line sort of runs parallel to the line

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.600 
a line sort of runs parallel to the line
that<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.810> made<00:01:30.840> down<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.470> way<00:01:31.710> we're

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that you made down this way we're

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.039 
that you made down this way we're
basically<00:01:33.030> going<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.360> be<00:01:33.450> drawing<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
basically going to be drawing in the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.560 
basically going to be drawing in the
windshield<00:01:34.670> at<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.820> point<00:01:36.119> come<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
windshield at this point come up and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.080

it'll<00:02:18.370> take<00:02:18.579> a<00:02:18.610> couple<00:02:18.730> times<00:02:19.150> where<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.450> get

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
it'll take a couple times where you get

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:20.970 
it'll take a couple times where you get
it<00:02:19.659> exactly<00:02:20.200> looking<00:02:20.409> the<00:02:20.530> way<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:20.709> want<00:02:20.950> it

we're going to draw some of the details

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.380 
we're going to draw some of the details
of<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.579> we'll<00:02:27.819> start<00:02:28.000> with<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.180> wheels

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
of the we'll start with the wheels

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.380 
of the we'll start with the wheels
specifically<00:02:29.430> now<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.489> wheels<00:02:30.940> are<00:02:31.239> also

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
specifically now the wheels are also

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.030 
specifically now the wheels are also
themselves<00:02:32.170> going<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.379> be<00:02:32.500> three-dimensional

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
themselves going to be three-dimensional

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.740 
themselves going to be three-dimensional
objects<00:02:33.970> so<00:02:34.090> you're<00:02:34.180> going<00:02:34.299> to<00:02:34.329> want<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.569> kind

of come in here we're going to draw the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.949 
of come in here we're going to draw the
outer<00:02:37.709> portion<00:02:38.709> of<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.069> wheel<00:02:39.900> like<00:02:40.900> that

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
outer portion of the wheel like that

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.509 
outer portion of the wheel like that
this<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.709> part<00:02:41.890> where<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.069> rubber<00:02:42.250> meets

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
this is the part where the rubber meets

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.830 
this is the part where the rubber meets
the<00:02:42.609> road<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.799> same<00:02:44.799> over<00:02:45.340> here<00:02:45.659> and<00:02:46.659> if<00:02:46.750> you

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
the road and same over here and if you

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.479 
the road and same over here and if you
want<00:02:47.019> so<00:02:47.109> you<00:02:47.230> can<00:02:47.349> come<00:02:47.500> in<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:47.799> draw<00:02:48.010> sort<00:02:48.430> of

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
want so you can come in and draw sort of

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.729 
want so you can come in and draw sort of
a<00:02:49.109> the<00:02:50.670> spoke<00:02:51.670> situation<00:02:52.480> but<00:02:53.290> this<00:02:53.530> is

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
a the spoke situation but this is

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.930 
a the spoke situation but this is
basically<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.950> black<00:02:56.950> rubber<00:02:57.250> portion<00:02:57.579> just

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
basically the black rubber portion just

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.979 
basically the black rubber portion just
like<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.209> you'll<00:02:58.420> come<00:02:58.569> in<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:58.780> you'll<00:02:58.840> do

like that you'll come in and you'll do

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.520 
like that you'll come in and you'll do
the<00:02:59.109> exact<00:02:59.379> same<00:02:59.409> thing<00:02:59.920> over<00:03:00.040> here

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
the exact same thing over here

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.110 
the exact same thing over here
black<00:03:02.530> rubber<00:03:02.799> portion<00:03:03.299> spokes<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:07.000> is

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
black rubber portion spokes and that is

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.780 
black rubber portion spokes and that is
how<00:03:07.239> that<00:03:07.450> would<00:03:07.599> look<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:09.310> we're<00:03:09.609> going<00:03:09.760> to

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
how that would look and we're going to

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.430 
how that would look and we're going to
have<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.150> doors<00:03:10.420> do<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:10.959> not<00:03:11.109> to<00:03:11.200> clearly

those will be important so you want to
draw<00:03:32.199> those<00:03:32.410> in<00:03:32.440> clearly<00:03:35.190> if<00:03:36.190> you<00:03:36.250> draw<00:03:36.489> a

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
draw those in clearly if you draw a

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:43.220 
draw those in clearly if you draw a
little<00:03:36.730> detail<00:03:37.150> there<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:40.410> finally

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
little detail there and finally

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.300 
little detail there and finally
something<00:03:44.230> that<00:03:44.440> would<00:03:44.530> be<00:03:44.620> most<00:03:44.859> likely<00:03:44.949> the

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
something that would be most likely the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.309 
something that would be most likely the
grille<00:03:46.620> just<00:03:47.620> like<00:03:48.010> that

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.599 

so<00:03:52.890> this<00:03:53.129> point<00:03:54.650> we're<00:03:55.650> doing<00:03:55.860> pretty<00:03:56.189> good

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
so this point we're doing pretty good

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.520 
so this point we're doing pretty good
I'd<00:03:56.969> say<00:03:57.150> maybe<00:03:57.629> just<00:03:57.719> add<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:57.989> few<00:03:58.319> little

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
I'd say maybe just add a few little

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.039 
I'd say maybe just add a few little
details<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.519> whatever<00:04:00.450> portion<00:04:00.750> of<00:04:00.959> the

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
details to the whatever portion of the

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.630 
details to the whatever portion of the
car<00:04:01.230> you'd<00:04:01.409> like<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.680> add<00:04:01.769> details<00:04:02.129> to<00:04:02.250> maybe

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
car you'd like to add details to maybe

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.089 
car you'd like to add details to maybe
draw<00:04:03.019> you<00:04:04.019> know<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.170> few<00:04:04.500> other<00:04:04.560> additional

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
draw you know a few other additional

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.240 
draw you know a few other additional
vents<00:04:05.459> down<00:04:05.670> below<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:06.719> the<00:04:06.810> car<00:04:07.159> looks<00:04:08.159> a

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
vents down below so that the car looks a

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.270 
vents down below so that the car looks a
little<00:04:08.459> bit<00:04:08.549> more<00:04:08.700> believable<00:04:10.280> something

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
little bit more believable something

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.690 
little bit more believable something
like<00:04:11.430> that<00:04:12.439> add<00:04:13.439> a<00:04:13.500> few<00:04:13.829> other<00:04:13.859> lines<00:04:14.250> in<00:04:14.489> where

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
like that add a few other lines in where

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.840 
like that add a few other lines in where
you<00:04:14.790> think<00:04:14.819> lines<00:04:15.239> should<00:04:15.569> be<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:16.729> would<00:04:17.729> come

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
you think lines should be I would come

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.370 
you think lines should be I would come
up<00:04:17.880> here<00:04:18.000> actually<00:04:18.539> maybe<00:04:18.690> add<00:04:18.900> like<00:04:19.079> a<00:04:19.109> nice

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
up here actually maybe add like a nice

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.659 
up here actually maybe add like a nice
little<00:04:19.560> tint<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.570> windshield<00:04:22.400> maybe<00:04:23.400> draw

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
little tint to the windshield maybe draw

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.839 
little tint to the windshield maybe draw
I<00:04:24.060> don't<00:04:24.509> know<00:04:24.599> an<00:04:24.750> antenna<00:04:25.110> coming<00:04:26.070> up<00:04:26.220> it's

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
I don't know an antenna coming up it's

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:28.279 
I don't know an antenna coming up it's
really<00:04:27.060> up<00:04:27.150> to<00:04:27.180> you<00:04:27.389> at<00:04:27.479> this<00:04:27.570> point<00:04:27.810> little

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
really up to you at this point little

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.249 
really up to you at this point little
fog<00:04:29.810> rolling<00:04:30.810> out<00:04:30.960> of<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.110> back<00:04:32.240> basically

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
fog rolling out of the back basically

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.550 
fog rolling out of the back basically
that<00:04:34.259> is<00:04:34.590> all<00:04:34.830> you<00:04:35.009> need<00:04:35.190> to<00:04:35.460> draw<00:04:36.139> your<00:04:37.139> basic

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560
