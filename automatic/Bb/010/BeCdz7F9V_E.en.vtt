00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.730
 activist is an Australian team and is 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.740
 together since 2013 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.039
 they have some players that have enough 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.760
 atc reid international experience 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.330
 go midlej nerso be the year 2014 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.260
 of them was very weak in 2015 they 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.969
 they returned with everything and dominated the region 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.030
 finished the season with 13 wins and 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.219
 only one defeat in the final was not 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.870
 different and despite having faced the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.960
 his main rival 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.350
 atif ran over them with certain 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.969
 facility ending with a 3 to 0 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.030
 and here is what goes the main tip for the 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.340
 staff mtv does not use that clogs lener 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.649
 need time to grow because in the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.070
 end, what they did most was 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.379
 destroy the life of the enemy leno top and a 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.020
 The main responsibility for this is the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.619
 andrÃ© ex pucs and the interesting thing is that 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.810
 his favorite pike is champion elise 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.689
 with which he destroyed the first 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.880
 has a very large map presence 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.430
 strong I'm not going to even mention much of the adec 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.009
 theirs will come because he did not call me 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.900
 much attention despite being one of the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.840
 team stars and finished 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.420
 all matches with the score really 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.180
 very good of those who do not want to talk and 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.150
 twitter millennium he does deserve a 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.640
 mention because he played the snowy day in 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.430
 two of the final three games 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.770
 they strive to become the champion and when 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.729
 she was banished they chose the tourist 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.009
 is different 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.799
 with this champion he made plays of 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.000
 positioning and band absurd type is 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.000
 to know that a plate you 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.380
 Look how absurd he used fate. 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.140
 pro side of sae heard that he used useful 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.450
 to run to see in the mind of a flash 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.130
 canceling the title leaves but not yet 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.620
 It ended and he used bush to 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.780
 reposition and ended up dodging two 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.540
 loads kick from scratch but the cherry on 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.970
 up the cake is this zone and blessed 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.010
 wladmir making him 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.900
 come near and give it to her 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.550
 distance she needs to finish 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.730
 the service 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.310
 to finish it is good to know that it is tics 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.470
 never lost a game while having the 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.120
 their side on the map then it is 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.960
 important to keep one eye open and 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.610
 champion 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.770
 an interesting thing is that all 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.020
 players only the ground two champions 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.540

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.720
 less hyper is too small 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.630
 so this is it people this is tif the team 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.730
 is composed of five Trojans and is a 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.920
