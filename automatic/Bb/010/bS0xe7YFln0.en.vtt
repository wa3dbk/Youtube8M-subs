00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.630
 you can take me the tower and all that 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.250
 neither enter the server is worth 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.170
 we already have the faction there are very well 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.700
 mounted but good that 's apart I'm not going 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.379
 to upload the server video this end 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.930
 of week nor any video of commandos 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.030
 during all this week is worth only notice 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.400
 so you do not ask us and this 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.960
 I will not answer either, I suppose 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.550
 will not have access to the internet because it is 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.800
 there on the mountain so I will not be able to 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.300
 Well guys, I'm going to show you here 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.040
 that is prepared today is a very tutorial 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.899
 simple but at the same time already time 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.550
 what I wanted to do because I think 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.979
 really interesting if you want to do 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.380
 a good adventure map 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:17.130
 It would be interesting if he had what he 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.870
 I prepare joaquin also to say that no no 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.300
 I have prepared what was said currado 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.360
 to see I already know that this amulets go 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.270
 so here we have the amulets 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.539
 I'm going to catch 2 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.420
 good are the same this in fact one 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.039
 of speed and another of life is worth so 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.600
 so much could have done more currado 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.429
 For example, having done a test and 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.439
 if the test passed me, give me an amulet 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.140
 only if I pass it to him if he does not give it to me or 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.640
 make a boss drop me the amulet that 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.740
 I no longer prepared it because I'm good 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.119
 more or less you will understand a bit already 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.640
 prepare yourselves if not good 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.079
 you ask and I usually answer 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.729
 I'm a little busy these days and I have not 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.319
 could answer many comments but 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.649
 well let's see how our 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.270
 amulets in this yes you made a map 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.659
 currao currado you will have to make a 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.950
 area here where I put amulets and 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.450
 draw it well I do not know how it would be done 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.239
 I do not know how I would do it because I do not know 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.069
 a lot of skins and this but well I've 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.930
 chosen we can put it where 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.940
 We want it only if we put it on 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.730
 the slot 17 that is this one is worth the 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.290
 side will not give us speed in this 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.660
 case you see, I have speed now 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.489
 same and if I take it off you have here the 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.519
 speed if I take it off because I will not have 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.019
 speed the same with life is worth 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:32.140
 well here I'll have to put your rival 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.270
 also moderated beige voucher that gives me 4 of 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.030
 lifetime 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.760
 well this is pretty simple do not have 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.200
 No trick but good I saw it 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.810
 besides I have always said good I'm going to 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.090
 try to improve this a little bit and well what 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.610
 What I was trying to do is how to make books 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.320
 of enchantment you know that of yes 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.060
 together two books of sharpness gives you a 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.100
 sweet two as well have done the same 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.830
 but with the book with the amulet of life 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.580
 ok let's get on one's path and 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.200
 let's take a life amulet that 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.560
 supposed to happen to see us when 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.390
 let's throw 12 life amulets ah well what 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.280
 that would be an improved tickets this is 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.110
 can do against the amulets I with 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.330
 whatever you want, so you give 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.290
 Widder a charm such as 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.969
 it could also be created 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.140
 well I done only with the life at 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.549
 speed I have not done it because it's 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.349
 absolutely the same and I will not do 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:25.340
 waste time so well let's go to 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:28.010
 see how I would be lame shot 1 vale 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.569
 good the plate is not pure 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.670
 I'm going to remove the decoration so that 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.250
 you think you have something trick 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.400
 has an amulet is valid and only the 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.599
 another will be cleaned and will give me the amulet 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.120
 with life 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.659
 two 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.500
 what do you mean I'm going to take away the 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:49.989
 amulet of life 2 good your rival and we 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.060
 we are going to place it, it is going to give us 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.950
 instead of 4 hearts as before we will 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.769
 give 6 see that if I now place myself 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.099
 this here gives us 4 hearts and if it's the 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.540
 of life 2 because it gives us 6 good this already 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.640
 would give a little more play to what 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.890
 would the amulets be pretty handsome 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.750
 to be able to improve them and make them alive 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.920
 two speeds that I have not done it but 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.390
 I say it again, what can you do? 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.410
 you with the same mechanism with 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.790
 point now it's worth I say it again as 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.169
 spoilage and as it appears the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.500
 amulets on our map this already 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.940
 you choose from onu I do not know what you are 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.620
 to do it and therefore your choose 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.780
 If you want to make it European a boss to 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.220
 pass a boat do not know anything the 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.820
 I'm going to show you the mechanism 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.250
 which would be the next one 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.840
 this is life 2 but I'm going to 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.080
 teach one because it's absolutely everything 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.080
 the same 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.250
 this here will detect in the player 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.550
 closest if in it is the 17 that 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.490
 would be equivalent to this one this here 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.530
 has the tag with a display name or 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.160
 any item with an amulet name 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.660
 life if afterwards if you are a parrot to 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.460
 that it was all safer and that it did not 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.169
 change the name with an anvil better 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.110
 put a parrot on it that would be more 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.370
 simple would still put with good flowers 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.050
 I'm not going to put it because as I have not 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.720
 would not work for me but if you put him 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.190
 Lords would be everything safer for the map 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.350
 here is absolutely the same with 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.230
 speed and here equal with speed with 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.420
 life 2 forgiveness is worth when you detect this 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.510
 Well, he's going to come here and he's going to 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.520
 effect of 21 which is the effect of 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.840
 hearts that puts us more hearts not 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.890
 is the absorption is the most 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.960
 hearts that I think not any 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.340
 You can make good portion us 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.830
 will place for an infinite time 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.510
 once between so they do not see the 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.160
 very important particles so that for 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.570
 that is a little more currado and this of 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.520
 here good when it detects that it no longer 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.090
 has exposed of bleeding to the torch 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.020
 to teach here and we will zero it 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.570
 well here what I have done has been to put 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.180
 at times being life 2 I have put the 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.730
 effect in two you see that here was in 1 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.140
 it's worth it here 2 manuel de 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.900
 speed would be the same but placing 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.430
 speed of effect and here totally what 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.470
 same good then you will ask and 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.290
 how have you done this that good to 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.240
 throw two to see that what launched it 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.490
 ok do not let me throw the week of at 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.080
 good main craft I have what is already going to 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.870
 watch 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.120
 if that evil has left as it does not usually happen 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.310
 usually happens to see that he should now 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.990
 appear good I'll pass because I do not know 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.870
 see that I'm not going to be able to do anything 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.759
 It's good how I've done this 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.460
 basically it's the same thing is to test if 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:22.069
 there is an item in the coordinates in the 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.979
 coordinates are here worth 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:28.909
 I break it very well if there is an item in those 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:31.009
 coordinates in a radius of 1 going to 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:32.930
 detect in the item fire words charge 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:35.509
 with the life amulet with the name of 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.159
 life amulet evil if you detect it if 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:39.440
 it detects one first it's going to give a tick of 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:41.270
 signal when it detects two will give two tics 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.949
 of signal or so far therefore 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.930
 understand this repeater that kill 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:47.569
 the items that are there are worth the items that 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.789
 there are here will kill them to see is that there is no 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:52.039
 many did not break the items and do not look 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:53.569
 I describe it and not and it does not put anything is that 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:55.279
 I do not know why this happens, well bless 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:56.330
 please already happens to me lately but it's 

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:58.240
 what has changed me computer and yes what 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.699
 happens when I do not know 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.020
 and then going to add an item goes to 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:04.999
 suppose a and it is also the same 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.900
 coordinates and are of fire words charge 

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:11.360
 with display name amulet life 2 and with the 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.400
 enchantment 36 that you already told me that 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.499
 is and few and placed that enchantment 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.300
 36 was not going to get any kind of 

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:19.129
 only enchantment that shines is worth 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.689
 I have already used it did not occur to me in the 

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:24.409
 personalized enchantment something so 

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:25.669
 he says but hey this is all guys not
