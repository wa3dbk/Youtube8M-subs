the<00:03:22.410> saints<00:03:22.830> in<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:24.320> well<00:03:25.320> is<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.890> get

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
the saints in the well is that to get

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.550 
the saints in the well is that to get
the<00:03:26.220> elite<00:03:26.550> collectibles<00:03:27.239> for<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.260> new

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
division things for the playoff games so

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.600 
division things for the playoff games so
I<00:03:30.930> figured<00:03:31.260> this<00:03:31.530> would<00:03:31.709> be<00:03:31.769> fine<00:03:32.160> because<00:03:32.400> I

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
I figured this would be fine because I

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.330 
I figured this would be fine because I
thought<00:03:32.820> it<00:03:32.970> was<00:03:33.030> on<00:03:33.209> all<00:03:33.390> madden<00:03:33.630> or

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
thought it was on all madden or

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.520 
thought it was on all madden or
something<00:03:35.340> this<00:03:36.300> wasn't<00:03:36.510> as<00:03:36.780> bad<00:03:36.959> as<00:03:37.019> some

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
something this wasn't as bad as some

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.550 
something this wasn't as bad as some
games<00:03:37.800> over<00:03:38.700> as<00:03:38.820> good<00:03:39.180> as<00:03:39.360> some<00:03:39.540> games<00:03:39.840> some

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
games over as good as some games some

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.740 
games over as good as some games some
games<00:03:40.799> healing<00:03:41.220> gets<00:03:41.370> off<00:03:41.580> every<00:03:42.390> once<00:03:42.570> in<00:03:42.690> a

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
games healing gets off every once in a

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.020 
games healing gets off every once in a
while<00:03:42.900> some<00:03:43.620> games<00:03:43.890> he<00:03:44.070> gets<00:03:44.280> off<00:03:44.489> every<00:03:45.000> time

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
while some games he gets off every time

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.759 
while some games he gets off every time
it<00:03:45.450> really<00:03:45.630> depends<00:03:46.080> on<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.290> right<00:03:46.470> tackle

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
it really depends on the right tackle

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.030 
it really depends on the right tackle
and<00:03:47.190> their<00:03:47.670> left<00:03:47.880> tackle<00:03:48.269> although<00:03:49.200> pretty

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
and their left tackle although pretty

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.380 
and their left tackle although pretty
much<00:03:50.220> if<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.430> got<00:03:50.580> one<00:03:50.730> on<00:03:50.820> each<00:03:50.970> end<00:03:51.150> it's

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
much if you got one on each end it's

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.060 
much if you got one on each end it's
pretty<00:03:51.810> rare<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.140> don't<00:03:52.380> get<00:03:52.650> at<00:03:52.739> least<00:03:52.769> a

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
pretty rare you don't get at least a

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.759 
pretty rare you don't get at least a
sack<00:03:53.310> in<00:03:53.549> that<00:03:54.390> game<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:58.260> this<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.500> just<00:03:58.620> a

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
sack in that game so this is just a

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.030 
sack in that game so this is just a
little<00:03:58.980> Drive<00:03:59.340> and<00:04:00.350> they<00:04:01.350> do<00:04:01.410> run<00:04:01.709> a<00:04:01.769> little

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
little Drive and they do run a little

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.490 
little Drive and they do run a little
bit<00:04:02.220> I<00:04:02.250> think<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.910> when<00:04:03.239> they<00:04:03.360> pass<00:04:03.600> you<00:04:04.350> can

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
bit I think and when they pass you can

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.150 
bit I think and when they pass you can
see<00:04:04.739> that<00:04:04.850> occasionally<00:04:05.850> he<00:04:06.810> gets<00:04:06.840> off<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.650> we

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
see that occasionally he gets off and we

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.720 
see that occasionally he gets off and we
really<00:04:08.459> forced<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.180> passes

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
really forced the passes

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.710 
really forced the passes
that<00:04:11.730> one<00:04:11.940> I<00:04:11.970> don't<00:04:12.090> really<00:04:12.299> know<00:04:12.510> how<00:04:12.629> it

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
that one I don't really know how it

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.890 
that one I don't really know how it
happened<00:04:13.140> with<00:04:13.319> my<00:04:13.530> corner<00:04:14.340> but<00:04:15.120> I'm<00:04:15.540> using

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
happened with my corner but I'm using

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.539 
happened with my corner but I'm using
them<00:04:16.199> I'm<00:04:16.380> not<00:04:16.560> gonna<00:04:16.739> lie<00:04:16.829> guys<00:04:17.190> I've<00:04:17.370> never

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
them I'm not gonna lie guys I've never

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.180 
them I'm not gonna lie guys I've never
used<00:04:17.850> it<00:04:18.090> my<00:04:18.959> defensive<00:04:19.560> ends<00:04:19.859> I<00:04:19.949> don't<00:04:20.100> really

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
used it my defensive ends I don't really

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.480 
used it my defensive ends I don't really
know<00:04:20.430> what<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.729> do<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:21.180> just<00:04:21.780> kinda<00:04:22.530> screwing

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
know what to do I just kinda screwing

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.670 
know what to do I just kinda screwing
around<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:24.120> just<00:04:24.750> like<00:04:24.900> flick<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:25.500> right

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.890 
around and just like flick the right
stick<00:04:26.010> and<00:04:26.250> hopefully<00:04:26.520> something<00:04:26.729> happens<00:04:27.270> so

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
stick and hopefully something happens so

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.590 
stick and hopefully something happens so
it<00:04:28.199> may<00:04:28.350> be<00:04:28.380> kind<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:28.889> productive<00:04:29.270> either<00:04:30.270> way

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
it may be kind of productive either way

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.800 
it may be kind of productive either way
we're<00:04:30.930> looking<00:04:31.229> at<00:04:31.380> this<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:32.330> as<00:04:33.330> you<00:04:33.600> can<00:04:33.780> see

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
we're looking at this and as you can see

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.780
