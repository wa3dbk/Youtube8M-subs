00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.070
 his name is daniel risotto of he is 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.410
 originally from Brazil where in a way 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.570
 It is very common to eat pasta and 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.430
 wholesale pizzas since he came to 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.140
 mexico thought of doing something different than 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.450
 will like his countrymen but also to 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.790
 the demanding Mexican paladares created 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.680
 more than 15 different flavors of pizzas 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.250
 but with ingredients that have 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.190
 surprised what has been for example the 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.559
 more pizzas of now yes that 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.420
 pieces of pizza that have been eaten here 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:58.649

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:01.260
 28 30 they fit each with hungry 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.420
 see download the sweet pizzas though 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.040
 they seem strange they are an explosion of 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.830
 flavors that simply please the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.330
 commensal we put to work and I wanted 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.920
 see how they come alive to 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.289
 creations that unlike the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.439
 salted only 8 minutes in the 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:19.320
 traditional oven so they are ready 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.460
 well there is an adaptation made to 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.399
 market 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.700
 There are two flavors of Brazil not used 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.979
 in brazil that is the concept no and 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.490
 also adapt what we have here in 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.190
 mexico no and for example right now we're going to 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.369
 prepare a big pizza of two 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.220
 flavors are going to prepare with all 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.560
 and all the pizzas and the same mass and in 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.560
 the same and the same mozzarella cheese 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.650
 and a lot 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.230
 I put on gloves prepare the ingredients 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.720
 and we began to combine each of the 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.390
 flavors the strawberry chocolate cinnamon flat 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.430
 and it's not for nothing but we were left 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.430
 literal to suck our fingers 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.470
 and chocolates today we're going to do the other 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.470
 part 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.470
 bananas 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:27.360
 and I think so and chocolates that make up the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.160
 bonbon the oven so it is delicious the 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.570
 have summarized a lot so we have it 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.730
 to prove and the latter that the 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.730
 white chocolate with black chocolate a 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.970
 is what we say the Dalmatian this and the 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.400
 last that is with some cinnamon banana 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.870
 wait is who your banana cinnamon and already 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.420
 sugar goes along with cinnamon 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.220
 to be able to be addressed in the oven 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.110
 we wait only a few minutes and what 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.480
 next clear was the most part 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.550
 complicated to have to try each of 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.709
 the flavors to check that brazil 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.959
 italy and mexico conjugate a 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.490
 exquisite way how about we eat one 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.690
