00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.340
 I'm here today with another video 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.830
 tutorial for the computer to make you 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.970
 see how to download too 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.820
 many items for minecraft then the 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.680
 procedure is slightly different from 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:44.620
 from the skins and texture packs though 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:48.379
 however I will show you that is not 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:54.260
 it is not very difficult however we start 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:55.550
 immediately we always go on google in a 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
 another in a next video I will make you 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.910

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.790
 ie practically the fashion for fashion 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.770
 always used for minecraft let's say for 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.420
 reducing the minecraft lag is a lot 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.740
 useful as ways or I was using and 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.710
 next video I will show you how 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.229

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.450
 it's the mode that almost all of you 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.910
 they will know of minecraft where 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:31.000
 we practically have to the right of the 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.050
 our character when we click e 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.509
 we find all the tools of 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.340
 unlimited minecraft and a mod 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.780
 useful we can also change to 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.140
 example night settings 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.289
 exports of the difficulty of the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.910
 game we can restore health and 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.690
 we can have all the resources 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.390
 unlimited 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.849

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:58.750

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:58.750
 in description of minecraft forum 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:12.110

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.069
 minecraft and we click on it 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.480
 will lead to the usual fly app page or 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.750
 we must wait where the 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.750
 loading 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.810
 here it is ok apple already unloaded now 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.040
 we always reduce the smaller window 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.209
 and we deliver the package to the desktop 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.549
 perfect 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.680
 here we close this we can 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.750
 minimize ok 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.940
 once downloaded new from downloaded 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.909
 the package will have to do the same 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.940
 procedure you did for the skins 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:59.920
 ie type percentage 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:03.849
 ap date percentage go to the 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:11.609
 roaming folder and go to the folder 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:15.310
 minecraft is and let's go to the bim folder 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:18.220
 now if we have to go to paper on 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.670
 minecraft file right- click the 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.879
 mouse and do the same winrar aprico 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.840
 proceeding regarding skins 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:29.889
 now on this page 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.370
 as for the skins e 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:36.099
 remember we had to go to mob e 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.400
 delete char files put the file there 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:42.250
 downloaded instead the mod 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.709
 we have to take the package e 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.620
 we have to open it 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.889
 so you always opened with winrar 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.139
 by right-clicking and 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:57.340
 this window will open all these 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:58.959
 file now it minimizes it a moment e 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.359
 I close this window for a while 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:09.220
 we need to leave this window open 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:12.159
 and tomorrow's items we all take 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:16.630
 the files in the li folder 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:19.989
 select in this way and here they are 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:26.610
 we carry all of them in 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.610
 minecraft here it is ok 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.190
 fine this folder now 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.370
 we can close is practically here 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.320
 you will have as you can see we have 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.570
 added all the files of the mod 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.230
 in fort we now have correctly 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.230
 installed the mod 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.660
 if it does not work for you 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.730
 it means that you will practically have to 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.230
 delete the half info folder 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.630
 now you see I do n't have the card 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.550
 iv the Mint because I've deleted 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:03.020
 if by chance you are there you had it 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:07.340
 you have to delete it because otherwise you don't 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:09.740
 it makes you a life activate the mode and 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.020
 it works a bit like an antivirus does not 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:17.540
 it practically activates the mode then 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:21.410
