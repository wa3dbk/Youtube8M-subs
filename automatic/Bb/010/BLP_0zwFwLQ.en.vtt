hey guys ook here and today we're going
to<00:00:02.460> be<00:00:02.520> talking<00:00:02.730> about<00:00:03.030> chemistry<00:00:03.600> stars<00:00:03.990> I'm

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
to be talking about chemistry stars I'm

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.019 
to be talking about chemistry stars I'm
going<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.770> try<00:00:05.009> and<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.220> explain<00:00:05.549> them<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.790> you

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
going to try and to explain them to you

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.240 
going to try and to explain them to you
in<00:00:06.330> depth<00:00:06.810> as<00:00:07.200> he<00:00:07.379> gets<00:00:07.560> full<00:00:07.710> understanding

that over the next couple of weeks
before<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.490> game<00:00:17.609> comes<00:00:17.850> out<00:00:18.090> I'm<00:00:18.180> going<00:00:18.359> to

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
before the game comes out I'm going to

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.760 
before the game comes out I'm going to
be<00:00:18.480> trying<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.900> cover<00:00:19.140> all<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.470> chemistry

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
be trying to cover all of the chemistry

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.380 
be trying to cover all of the chemistry
styles<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.369> give<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.850> examples<00:00:21.270> what

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
styles and give you examples what

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.460 
styles and give you examples what
players<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.689> want<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.900> use<00:00:22.050> them<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.320> and

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
players you want to use them on and

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.019 
players you want to use them on and
stuff<00:00:22.590> like<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:23.010> but<00:00:23.609> you'll<00:00:23.730> see<00:00:23.880> those

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
stuff like that but you'll see those

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.130 
stuff like that but you'll see those
videos<00:00:24.210> soon<00:00:24.830> let's<00:00:25.830> start<00:00:26.039> off<00:00:26.130> occasionally

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
videos soon let's start off occasionally

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.419 
videos soon let's start off occasionally
chemistry<00:00:28.140> affects<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.800> stats<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.250> your

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
chemistry affects the stats of your

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.790 
chemistry affects the stats of your
players<00:00:29.910> if<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.570> 13<00:00:30.900> currently<00:00:31.320> has<00:00:31.500> done<00:00:31.650> so

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
players if you 13 currently has done so

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.610 
players if you 13 currently has done so
P<00:00:31.920> 412<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.309> P<00:00:32.430> 411<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.850> believe<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.380> does

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
P 412 and P 411 I believe so what does

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.740 
P 412 and P 411 I believe so what does
your<00:00:35.010> chemistry<00:00:35.460> actually<00:00:35.640> affects<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
your chemistry actually affects the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.690 
your chemistry actually affects the
players<00:00:37.079> stats<00:00:37.290> directly<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.160> all<00:00:38.370> hidden

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
players stats directly but is all hidden

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.000 
players stats directly but is all hidden
behind<00:00:38.879> closed<00:00:39.390> doors<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.559> reason<00:00:40.829> why

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
behind closed doors so the reason why

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.369 
behind closed doors so the reason why
your<00:00:41.160> players<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.670> team<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.090> improve<00:00:42.450> along

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
your players in team to improve along

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.959 
your players in team to improve along
with<00:00:43.500> your<00:00:43.590> chemistry<00:00:43.890> improving<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.520> because

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
with your chemistry improving is because

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.299 
with your chemistry improving is because
as<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.780> chemistry<00:00:46.079> improves<00:00:46.500> your<00:00:47.010> player

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
as your chemistry improves your player

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.639 
as your chemistry improves your player
stats<00:00:47.670> will<00:00:47.850> also<00:00:48.149> improve<00:00:48.600> what<00:00:49.350> chemistry

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
stats will also improve what chemistry

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.590 
stats will also improve what chemistry
style<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.070> now<00:00:50.280> allows<00:00:50.579> us<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.940> do<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.449> have

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
style is now allows us to do is to have

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.720 
style is now allows us to do is to have
some<00:00:51.629> form<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.110> control<00:00:52.379> over<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.309> stats<00:00:53.550> that

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
some form of control over the stats that

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.369 
some form of control over the stats that
are<00:00:53.820> improved<00:00:54.300> obviously<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> chemistry

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
are improved obviously the chemistry

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.840 
are improved obviously the chemistry
style<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.800> add<00:00:55.980> every<00:00:56.280> chemistry<00:00:56.579> style

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
style that you add every chemistry style

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.139 
style that you add every chemistry style
improves<00:00:57.329> different<00:00:57.899> stats<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.680> player

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
improves different stats of in a player

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.610 
improves different stats of in a player
this<00:01:00.149> gives<00:01:00.359> us<00:01:00.449> control<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.109> kind<00:01:01.590> of

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
this gives us control to kind of

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.349 
this gives us control to kind of
manipulate<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.160> game<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.969> allow<00:01:03.149> us<00:01:03.329> to

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
manipulate the game to allow us to

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.000 
manipulate the game to allow us to
improve<00:01:03.690> certain<00:01:04.170> stats<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> right

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
improve certain stats for the right

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.800 
improve certain stats for the right
players<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.430> our<00:01:05.489> positions<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.510> if<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.659> want

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
players in our positions so if we want

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.630 
players in our positions so if we want
certain<00:01:07.140> things<00:01:07.350> improved<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.830> our<00:01:07.950> team<00:01:08.189> then

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
certain things improved in our team then

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.370 
certain things improved in our team then
we<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:08.880> improve<00:01:09.180> them<00:01:09.390> by<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.659> use<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
we can improve them by the use of the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.820 
we can improve them by the use of the
chemistry<00:01:10.770> styles<00:01:12.229> chemistry<00:01:13.229> style<00:01:13.500> was<00:01:13.710> for

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
chemistry styles chemistry style was for

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.830 
chemistry styles chemistry style was for
one<00:01:14.010> if<00:01:14.280> anyone<00:01:14.490> gets<00:01:14.670> confused<00:01:15.150> they

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
one if anyone gets confused they

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.719 
one if anyone gets confused they
overwrite<00:01:16.350> each<00:01:16.500> other<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.250> was<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.580> have

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
overwrite each other so if I was to have

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.880 
overwrite each other so if I was to have
a<00:01:17.970> hunter<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> player<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.650> want<00:01:19.799> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
a hunter one on a player and I want to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.770 
a hunter one on a player and I want to
foreshadow<00:01:20.040> one<00:01:20.549> eye<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.390> hunter<00:01:21.689> on

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
foreshadow one eye on it the hunter on

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.179 
foreshadow one eye on it the hunter on
will<00:01:21.900> disappear<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.560> shadow<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:22.979> when<00:01:23.100> I

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
will disappear and the shadow on when I

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.530 
will disappear and the shadow on when I
will<00:01:23.310> take<00:01:23.490> place<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:24.000> almost<00:01:24.090> worth<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.479> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
will take place it's almost worth like a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.539 
will take place it's almost worth like a
position<00:01:24.810> card<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.860> they<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.220> cuz<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> lot<00:01:26.520> of

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
position card and they so cuz a lot of

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.039 
position card and they so cuz a lot of
people<00:01:26.759> was<00:01:26.880> confused<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.540> seemed<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.810> think

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
people was confused and seemed to think

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.600 
people was confused and seemed to think
that<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.320> stack<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.890> could<00:01:29.100> carry<00:01:29.250> like

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that they stack so you could carry like

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.980 
that they stack so you could carry like
carry<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:30.000> adding<00:01:30.360> more<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.630> more<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.900> your

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
carry on adding more and more to your

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.390 
carry on adding more and more to your
player<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.650> they<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.860> be<00:01:31.920> improved<00:01:32.159> further

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
player so they can be improved further

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.190 
player so they can be improved further
in<00:01:32.520> vogue<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:32.939> not<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.329> case<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:34.079> as<00:01:34.170> I

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
in vogue that is not the case so as I

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.260 
in vogue that is not the case so as I
just<00:01:34.259> said<00:01:34.530> they<00:01:34.740> work<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> same<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.610> position

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
just said they work the same as position

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.819 
just said they work the same as position
cards<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.110> means<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.500> they<00:01:37.619> are

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
cards so that means that they are

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.730 
cards so that means that they are
permanent<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.850> add<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.600> hot<00:01:40.200> light<00:01:40.380> again

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
permanent so if I add a hot light again

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.460 
permanent so if I add a hot light again
I<00:01:40.770> know<00:01:40.890> users<00:01:41.220> check<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> shadow<00:01:41.850> 1<00:01:42.259> if<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.350> had

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
I know users check the shadow 1 if I had

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.010 
I know users check the shadow 1 if I had
a<00:01:43.530> shadow<00:01:43.770> chemistry<00:01:44.490> style<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> player<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
a shadow chemistry style to a player it

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.929 
a shadow chemistry style to a player it

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
will remain with that player for good

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.910

I was one people who was confused this I

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.550 
I was one people who was confused this I
was<00:02:03.420> under<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.659> impression<00:02:03.750> from<00:02:04.200> seeing

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
the time Lucy plus 1 is one arrow one

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.250 
the time Lucy plus 1 is one arrow one
hour<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.180> improvement<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.780> I'll<00:02:40.019> explain

that again a bit later

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.130 
that again a bit later
there<00:02:41.459> are<00:02:41.519> 23<00:02:42.030> chemistry<00:02:42.510> styles<00:02:42.810> currently

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
there are 23 chemistry styles currently

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.070 
there are 23 chemistry styles currently
available<00:02:43.910> four<00:02:44.910> of<00:02:45.030> those<00:02:45.269> Kimmage<00:02:45.840> dollars

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
available four of those Kimmage dollars

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.630 
available four of those Kimmage dollars
are<00:02:46.230> specifically<00:02:46.739> for<00:02:46.920> goalkeepers<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.550> the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
are specifically for goalkeepers and the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.309 
are specifically for goalkeepers and the
rest<00:02:47.819> are<00:02:47.970> for<00:02:48.120> outfield<00:02:48.480> players<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.900> think

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
rest are for outfield players I think

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.600 
rest are for outfield players I think
they<00:02:49.380> are<00:02:49.500> split<00:02:49.709> into<00:02:49.830> categories<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.489> we're

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
they are split into categories and we're

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.740 
they are split into categories and we're
on<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:50.910> can<00:02:51.060> use<00:02:51.239> them<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.600> all

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
on that you can use them on the all

hover my head right now I can't think of

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.199 
hover my head right now I can't think of
one<00:03:33.870> ok<00:03:34.440> let's<00:03:34.470> add<00:03:34.739> o<00:03:34.950> shadow<00:03:35.489> improves<00:03:36.060> your

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
improve things less to get like a medium

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.030 
improve things less to get like a medium
improvements<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:49.170> some<00:03:49.650> of<00:03:49.769> them<00:03:49.859> only

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040

improve<00:03:50.430> with<00:03:50.700> minor<00:03:50.940> improvements<00:03:51.650> it's<00:03:52.650> one

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
improve with minor improvements it's one

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:53.750 
improve with minor improvements it's one
thing<00:03:52.890> you'll<00:03:53.010> say<00:03:53.190> that's<00:03:53.370> one<00:03:53.489> thing<00:03:53.609> F<00:03:53.700> to

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
thing you'll say that's one thing F to

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.130 
thing you'll say that's one thing F to
look<00:03:53.850> at<00:03:53.970> them<00:03:54.120> for<00:03:54.239> on<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.420> cards<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.019> I'll

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
look at them for on the cards and I'll

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.539 
look at them for on the cards and I'll
explain<00:03:55.440> all<00:03:55.650> of<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.160> different<00:03:56.220> imagery

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
explain all of the different imagery

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.970 
explain all of the different imagery
styles<00:03:56.880> in<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.090> future<00:03:57.480> but<00:03:58.019> is<00:03:58.140> not<00:03:58.350> plus<00:03:58.709> one

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
styles in the future but is not plus one

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.740 
styles in the future but is not plus one
attribute<00:03:59.220> is<00:03:59.700> not<00:03:59.730> plus<00:04:00.090> 2x<00:04:00.420> buttes<00:04:00.600> honest

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
attribute is not plus 2x buttes honest

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.809 
attribute is not plus 2x buttes honest
it's<00:04:00.930> not<00:04:00.959> plus<00:04:01.200> 2<00:04:01.350> stats<00:04:01.620> is<00:04:01.859> actually<00:04:02.760> just

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
it's not plus 2 stats is actually just

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.490 
it's not plus 2 stats is actually just
an<00:04:02.970> arrow<00:04:03.209> so<00:04:03.540> obviously<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.959> value<00:04:04.260> of<00:04:04.380> the

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
an arrow so obviously the value of the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.710 
an arrow so obviously the value of the
arrows<00:04:04.739> for<00:04:05.010> all<00:04:05.100> we<00:04:05.220> know<00:04:05.370> could<00:04:06.030> be<00:04:06.120> plus<00:04:06.390> 5

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
arrows for all we know could be plus 5

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.270 
arrows for all we know could be plus 5
on<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.079> stats<00:04:07.350> obviously<00:04:07.980> that's<00:04:08.100> gonna<00:04:08.160> be

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
on the stats obviously that's gonna be

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.090 
on the stats obviously that's gonna be
very<00:04:08.340> unrealistic<00:04:08.989> but<00:04:09.989> as<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.230> said<00:04:10.380> we<00:04:10.980> don't

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
very unrealistic but as I said we don't

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.259 
very unrealistic but as I said we don't
actually<00:04:11.280> know<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.489> value<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.060> arrows

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
actually know the value of the arrows

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.430 
actually know the value of the arrows
yet<00:04:12.510> so<00:04:12.660> we're<00:04:12.780> just<00:04:12.810> gonna<00:04:12.989> have<00:04:13.079> to<00:04:13.170> go<00:04:13.350> into

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
yet so we're just gonna have to go into

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.559 
yet so we're just gonna have to go into
the<00:04:13.530> assumption<00:04:14.069> that<00:04:14.220> roughly<00:04:14.700> speaking<00:04:14.940> it

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
the assumption that roughly speaking it

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.080 
the assumption that roughly speaking it
will<00:04:15.690> improve<00:04:16.250> we<00:04:17.250> improve<00:04:17.519> them<00:04:17.700> even<00:04:17.880> minor

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
will improve we improve them even minor

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.670 
will improve we improve them even minor
major<00:04:18.389> or<00:04:18.750> medium<00:04:19.079> that's<00:04:19.200> why<00:04:19.350> we<00:04:19.440> can<00:04:19.560> look

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
major or medium that's why we can look

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.130 
major or medium that's why we can look
at<00:04:19.769> them<00:04:20.000> anyway<00:04:21.000> so<00:04:21.150> as<00:04:21.419> to<00:04:21.660> reiterate<00:04:21.870> the

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140

the higher your chemistry the heart the

the higher your chemistry the heart the

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.740 
at me links this player they're not see
this<00:04:33.430> can<00:04:33.520> be<00:04:33.580> a<00:04:33.640> very<00:04:33.790> small<00:04:34.180> improvement<00:04:34.660> in

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
this can be a very small improvement in

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.230 
this can be a very small improvement in
the<00:04:34.840> stats<00:04:35.080> that<00:04:35.350> I've<00:04:35.530> got<00:04:35.910> if<00:04:36.910> it's<00:04:37.120> like

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
the stats that I've got if it's like

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.450 
the stats that I've got if it's like
five<00:04:37.690> or<00:04:37.930> six<00:04:37.960> chemistry<00:04:38.500> on<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.620> player<00:04:38.860> then

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
five or six chemistry on the player then

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.830 
five or six chemistry on the player then
it's<00:04:39.640> gonna<00:04:39.730> be<00:04:39.820> a<00:04:39.850> medium<00:04:40.240> improvement<00:04:40.690> on

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
it's gonna be a medium improvement on

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.230 
it's gonna be a medium improvement on
that<00:04:40.870> player<00:04:41.470> and<00:04:41.740> if<00:04:42.250> I<00:04:42.370> can<00:04:42.550> get<00:04:42.670> a<00:04:42.700> nine<00:04:42.970> or<00:04:43.000> a

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
that player and if I can get a nine or a

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.760 
that player and if I can get a nine or a
ten<00:04:43.480> there's<00:04:43.780> me<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:43.930> major<00:04:44.140> improvement<00:04:44.560> on

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
ten there's me a major improvement on

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.740 
ten there's me a major improvement on
that<00:04:44.830> player<00:04:45.100> but<00:04:45.550> again<00:04:45.820> obviously<00:04:46.450> you<00:04:46.660> have

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
that player but again obviously you have

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.330 
that player but again obviously you have
to<00:04:46.840> remember<00:04:46.960> that<00:04:47.470> they<00:04:48.070> make<00:04:48.220> those

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
to remember that they make those

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.820 
to remember that they make those
improvements<00:04:48.640> are<00:04:49.120> dependent<00:04:49.840> on<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.650> killer

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
improvements are dependent on the killer

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.410 
improvements are dependent on the killer
cell<00:04:51.070> that<00:04:51.130> you<00:04:51.220> add<00:04:51.400> to<00:04:51.430> them<00:04:51.730> so<00:04:51.970> let's<00:04:52.210> say

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
cell that you add to them so let's say

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.450 
cell that you add to them so let's say
for<00:04:52.600> example<00:04:52.800> again<00:04:53.800> we<00:04:53.950> can<00:04:54.040> use<00:04:54.070> the<00:04:54.160> shadow

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
for example again we can use the shadow

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.730 
for example again we can use the shadow
it<00:04:55.090> has<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.480> plus<00:04:55.750> free<00:04:55.990> pace<00:04:56.200> and<00:04:56.410> the<00:04:56.500> plus

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
it has the plus free pace and the plus

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.370 
it has the plus free pace and the plus
free<00:04:56.950> defending<00:04:57.490> if<00:04:57.760> I<00:04:58.480> only<00:04:58.780> had<00:04:59.140> two

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
free defending if I only had two

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.100 
free defending if I only had two
chemistry<00:04:59.890> on<00:05:00.010> the<00:05:00.070> player<00:05:00.540> then<00:05:01.540> it's<00:05:02.020> pretty

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
chemistry on the player then it's pretty

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.480 
chemistry on the player then it's pretty
going<00:05:02.290> to<00:05:02.350> be<00:05:02.410> twenty<00:05:02.740> percent<00:05:03.040> of<00:05:03.160> that<00:05:03.280> plus

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
going to be twenty percent of that plus

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.370 
going to be twenty percent of that plus
free<00:05:03.760> and<00:05:04.150> then<00:05:04.450> if<00:05:04.600> it's<00:05:04.750> only<00:05:04.930> five<00:05:05.200> or<00:05:05.350> six

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
free and then if it's only five or six

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.450 
free and then if it's only five or six
and<00:05:05.650> we<00:05:05.740> like<00:05:05.860> something<00:05:06.070> like<00:05:06.160> fifty<00:05:06.430> percent

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
and we like something like fifty percent

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.750 
and we like something like fifty percent
and<00:05:06.970> again<00:05:07.420> obviously<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:09.430> has<00:05:09.520> a<00:05:09.550> higher

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
and again obviously it has a higher

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.160 
and again obviously it has a higher
chemistry<00:05:10.270> then<00:05:10.510> it's<00:05:10.630> gonna<00:05:10.750> be<00:05:10.870> a<00:05:10.930> higher

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
chemistry then it's gonna be a higher

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.930 
chemistry then it's gonna be a higher
percentage<00:05:11.830> therefore<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:12.460> effect<00:05:12.730> will<00:05:12.850> be

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
percentage therefore the effect will be

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.730 
percentage therefore the effect will be
greater<00:05:13.210> and<00:05:13.720> those<00:05:13.930> very<00:05:14.140> very<00:05:14.200> confusing

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
greater and those very very confusing

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.840 
greater and those very very confusing
things<00:05:14.950> kind<00:05:15.130> of<00:05:15.160> get<00:05:15.250> your<00:05:15.370> head<00:05:15.520> round<00:05:15.640> and

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
things kind of get your head round and

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.250 
things kind of get your head round and
I'll<00:05:15.910> see<00:05:16.000> once<00:05:16.150> we<00:05:16.210> get<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.480> game<00:05:16.660> then<00:05:17.140> it'd

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
I'll see once we get the game then it'd

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.780 
I'll see once we get the game then it'd
be<00:05:17.320> very<00:05:17.500> easy<00:05:17.710> for<00:05:17.830> us<00:05:18.010> to<00:05:18.100> understand<00:05:18.460> so<00:05:18.640> for

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
be very easy for us to understand so for

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:19.830 
be very easy for us to understand so for
right<00:05:18.880> now<00:05:18.940> for<00:05:19.090> me<00:05:19.240> to<00:05:19.270> explain<00:05:19.540> it<00:05:19.690> to<00:05:19.720> you<00:05:19.810> on

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
right now for me to explain it to you on

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.390 
right now for me to explain it to you on
the<00:05:19.930> screen<00:05:20.050> without<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.830> actual<00:05:21.190> gameplay

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
the screen without the actual gameplay

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.160 
the screen without the actual gameplay
footage<00:05:21.850> it's<00:05:22.300> quite<00:05:22.540> difficult<00:05:22.720> but

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
footage it's quite difficult but

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.530 
footage it's quite difficult but
hopefully<00:05:23.650> you<00:05:24.100> get<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.520> better<00:05:24.820> grasp<00:05:25.120> of<00:05:25.390> how

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
hopefully you get a better grasp of how

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.360 
hopefully you get a better grasp of how
they<00:05:25.660> work<00:05:25.930> you<00:05:26.440> have<00:05:26.560> any<00:05:26.710> questions<00:05:27.160> and

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
they work you have any questions and

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.980 
they work you have any questions and
please<00:05:27.580> leave<00:05:27.850> a<00:05:27.910> comment<00:05:28.210> and<00:05:28.450> I<00:05:28.540> shall<00:05:28.750> try

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
please leave a comment and I shall try

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.350 
please leave a comment and I shall try
and<00:05:29.110> answer<00:05:29.320> it<00:05:29.560> as<00:05:30.550> I<00:05:30.580> said<00:05:30.940> I've<00:05:31.090> annexed

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
and answer it as I said I've annexed

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.790 
and answer it as I said I've annexed
coming<00:05:31.600> weeks<00:05:31.840> I'll<00:05:32.110> be<00:05:32.140> explaining<00:05:32.440> all<00:05:32.680> the

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
coming weeks I'll be explaining all the

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.080 
coming weeks I'll be explaining all the
chemistry<00:05:33.040> styles<00:05:33.430> to<00:05:33.550> you<00:05:33.640> and<00:05:33.760> how<00:05:33.910> they

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
chemistry styles to you and how they

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.210 
chemistry styles to you and how they
work<00:05:34.330> what<00:05:35.080> stats<00:05:35.350> are<00:05:35.530> improving<00:05:35.950> and<00:05:36.070> what

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
work what stats are improving and what

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.740 
work what stats are improving and what
players<00:05:36.550> to<00:05:36.700> use<00:05:36.850> them<00:05:37.090> on<00:05:37.180> as<00:05:37.300> well<00:05:37.450> even

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
players to use them on as well even

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.700 
players to use them on as well even
