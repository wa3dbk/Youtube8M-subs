you<00:02:20.709> won't<00:02:20.920> hear<00:02:21.130> any<00:02:21.519> whistles<00:02:22.030> um<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:23.640> that

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
you won't hear any whistles um so that

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.759 
you won't hear any whistles um so that
might<00:02:24.849> be<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:25.030> little<00:02:25.209> too<00:02:25.540> spicy<00:02:25.840> for<00:02:26.110> Howard

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
might be a little too spicy for Howard

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.870 
might be a little too spicy for Howard
but<00:02:27.840> Howard<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:29.050> polish<00:02:30.269> so<00:02:31.269> I<00:02:31.300> thought<00:02:31.810> um

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
but Howard is polish so I thought um

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.940 
but Howard is polish so I thought um
maybe<00:02:33.880> polish<00:02:34.569> folk<00:02:35.319> dancing<00:02:36.040> would<00:02:36.970> be<00:02:37.150> fun

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
maybe polish folk dancing would be fun

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.130 
maybe polish folk dancing would be fun
so<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:38.980> asked<00:02:39.640> him<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.319> he's<00:02:41.319> not<00:02:41.790> interested

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
so I asked him and he's not interested

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.960 
so I asked him and he's not interested
but<00:02:44.140> he<00:02:45.030> said<00:02:46.030> well<00:02:46.239> why<00:02:46.660> don't<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:47.049> just<00:02:47.319> go
