00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.550
 and the Muscat 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.060
 with the coinqui I do the passito south-east exposure 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.910
 I think the best exposure to do it 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.880
 to make a 20 pass in plan 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.230
 we use a little bit of detail which is the branch cut 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.150
 I have privileged this system because I think it is what it is 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.090
 natural 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.480
 luana withers 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.400
 where was born with the conditions 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.870
 weather 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.620
 console and with the wind with the night 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.080
 with the thermal excursion with the averages with the rain we hope little 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.560
 to give a product that you respect exactly 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.120
 the land from which it comes 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.030
 to 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.860
 a normal vintage around the beginning of September 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.860
 step ep 8 the branch 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.350
 lua stays here until tenderly until the end of October nice November 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.030
 this year a very special year 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.080
 the branch was cut immediately after mid-August and is mid-September 2 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.280
 already absolutely ready to be harvested 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.280
 because if I left again but would be fine to calibrate 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.840
 mutta or trunks to make panettone 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.720
 keep in mind that it made them 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.120
 of Muscat to regulate 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.600
 uahahah fresh wine what is used to make the fortune-telling fortune-teller 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.270
 75% therefore 122 75 liters of wine 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.939
 in this case in my case 100 kilos 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.329
 I have to make shoes 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:15.500
 I think they don't give more than 15% I would say 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.769
 some christmas 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:18.759
 so 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:22.229
 sometimes I'm a little demoralized when nothing comes out under the press
