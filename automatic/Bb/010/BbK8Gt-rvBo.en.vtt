okay<00:00:01.260> we<00:00:01.410> got<00:00:01.530> this<00:00:01.740> I<00:00:02.190> think<00:00:02.790> it's<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:03.000> no<00:00:03.120> three

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
okay we got this I think it's a no three

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.809 
okay we got this I think it's a no three
Chevy<00:00:03.780> set<00:00:04.230> up<00:00:04.380> here<00:00:04.620> for<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:04.920> fuel<00:00:05.250> pump<00:00:05.460> test

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
Chevy set up here for a fuel pump test

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.500 
Chevy set up here for a fuel pump test
we<00:00:06.509> got<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.720> end<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.859> fuel<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.309> fuse<00:00:08.940> box<00:00:09.210> here

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
we got a end of fuel and fuse box here

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.180 
we got a end of fuel and fuse box here
right<00:00:09.719> next<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.170> fuel<00:00:10.380> pump<00:00:10.440> relay<00:00:10.860> you'll

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
right next to the fuel pump relay you'll

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.640 
right next to the fuel pump relay you'll
see<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.580> there's<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:12.110> prime<00:00:13.110> spot<00:00:13.440> right

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
see that there's a prime spot right

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.430 
see that there's a prime spot right
there<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.040> if<00:00:14.160> we<00:00:14.870> first<00:00:15.870> we<00:00:16.020> got<00:00:16.139> our<00:00:16.260> rule

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
there and if we first we got our rule

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.490 
there and if we first we got our rule
amp<00:00:16.680> probe<00:00:16.920> we<00:00:17.070> gotta<00:00:17.250> set<00:00:17.490> up<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.730> 20<00:00:18.060> amps<00:00:18.500> on

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
amp probe we gotta set up to 20 amps on

amp probe we gotta set up to 20 amps on
a<00:00:19.590> 20<00:00:19.890> amp<00:00:20.010> scale<00:00:20.369> we<00:00:21.060> go<00:00:21.180> down<00:00:21.359> here<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.630> our

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
a 20 amp scale we go down here to our

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.769 
a 20 amp scale we go down here to our
lab<00:00:22.080> scope<00:00:22.439> we're<00:00:22.769> on<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.359> twenty<00:00:24.359> second

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779

twenty milliseconds sweep time on a 20
amp<00:00:27.990> scale<00:00:28.640> so<00:00:29.640> we'll<00:00:29.880> go<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.449> plug<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:30.840> end

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
amp scale so we'll go and plug this end

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.430 
amp scale so we'll go and plug this end
this<00:00:31.199> has<00:00:31.410> been<00:00:32.090> drilled<00:00:33.090> out<00:00:33.270> here<00:00:33.660> we're<00:00:34.350> on

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
this has been drilled out here we're on

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.040 
this has been drilled out here we're on
an<00:00:34.590> even<00:00:34.860> scale<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:36.390> we'll<00:00:36.480> put<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.719> in

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
an even scale and we'll put that in

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.639 
an even scale and we'll put that in
there<00:00:37.399> now<00:00:38.399> we<00:00:38.460> can<00:00:38.670> see<00:00:38.850> our<00:00:38.879> amp<00:00:39.840> our<00:00:40.290> fuel

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
there now we can see our amp our fuel

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.299 
there now we can see our amp our fuel
pump<00:00:40.879> this<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.149> newer<00:00:42.329> pump<00:00:42.860> she's<00:00:43.860> pulling

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
pump this is a newer pump she's pulling

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.350 
pump this is a newer pump she's pulling
about<00:00:44.730> between<00:00:45.629> eight<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:45.870> ten<00:00:46.200> amps<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.360> we

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
about between eight and ten amps and we

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.970 
about between eight and ten amps and we
can<00:00:48.450> see<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.690> got<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.840> nice<00:00:48.960> even<00:00:49.170> waveform<00:00:49.770> but

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
can see we got a nice even waveform but

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.900 
can see we got a nice even waveform but
if<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.160> want<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.430> get<00:00:50.550> an<00:00:50.640> even<00:00:50.789> better

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
if you want to get an even better

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.209 
if you want to get an even better
waveform<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:52.860> here<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.370> go<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> set<00:00:54.480> up

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
waveform to do here is it go to set up

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.180 
waveform to do here is it go to set up
how<00:00:56.219> much<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.360> traces<00:00:58.190> or

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
how much for this you can see traces or

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.750 
how much for this you can see traces or
trace<00:00:59.520> one<00:01:00.199> will<00:01:01.199> change<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.829> will<00:01:02.370> go<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
trace one will change this will go to a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.780 
trace one will change this will go to a
5<00:01:03.210> amp<00:01:03.420> scale<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:05.400> will<00:01:05.640> change<00:01:06.290> ok<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.439> that

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
5 amp scale and will change ok on that

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.410 
5 amp scale and will change ok on that
change<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.939> will<00:01:09.119> go<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.360> AC<00:01:09.510> couple<00:01:10.970> mm<00:01:11.970> you

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
change this will go to AC couple mm you

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.289 
change this will go to AC couple mm you
can<00:01:12.600> see<00:01:12.780> now<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:12.990> our<00:01:14.750> back<00:01:15.750> here<00:01:17.299> back

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
can see now that our back here back

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.850 
can see now that our back here back
again

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.070 

that<00:01:23.430> while<00:01:23.700> we're<00:01:23.940> not<00:01:24.090> measuring<00:01:24.660> amperage

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
that while we're not measuring amperage

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.930 
that while we're not measuring amperage
per<00:01:25.290> se<00:01:25.500> we're<00:01:25.680> look<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.250> get<00:01:26.760> a<00:01:26.790> lot

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
per se we're look we can get a lot

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.960 
per se we're look we can get a lot
better<00:01:27.180> look<00:01:27.570> at<00:01:27.780> what<00:01:28.050> our<00:01:28.170> actual<00:01:28.850> what<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
better look at what our actual what the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.060 
better look at what our actual what the
brush<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.450> armature<00:01:30.930> contact<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.710> looking

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
brush to armature contact is looking

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.980 
brush to armature contact is looking
like<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.490> our<00:01:32.550> fuel<00:01:33.150> pump<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.690> can<00:01:33.840> see

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
like on our fuel pump and you can see

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.310 
like on our fuel pump and you can see
we're<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> nice<00:01:35.100> steady<00:01:35.930> steady<00:01:36.930> scale

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
we're we have a nice steady steady scale

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.530 
we're we have a nice steady steady scale
here<00:01:37.650> okay<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.430> also<00:01:38.640> got<00:01:38.850> hooked<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.210> over

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
here okay and I also got hooked up over

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.130 
here okay and I also got hooked up over
here<00:01:39.690> I<00:01:39.750> got<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:41.030> got<00:01:42.030> fresh<00:01:42.360> transducer<00:01:43.110> on

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
here I got a I got fresh transducer on

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.120 
here I got a I got fresh transducer on
the<00:01:43.290> fuel<00:01:43.530> line<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.780> got<00:01:46.410> that<00:01:46.560> set<00:01:46.860> up<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
the fuel line so I got that set up the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.850 
the fuel line so I got that set up the
channel<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.790> will<00:01:48.690> disconnect<00:01:49.260> this<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.800> a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
channel to will disconnect this for a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.910 
channel to will disconnect this for a
minute<00:01:50.750> our<00:01:51.750> pressure<00:01:52.020> will<00:01:52.229> bleed<00:01:52.440> down<00:01:52.680> I

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
minute our pressure will bleed down I

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.620 
minute our pressure will bleed down I
found<00:01:53.250> out<00:01:53.460> when<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.640> was<00:01:53.820> doing<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.479> we

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
found out when I was doing this that we

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.150 
found out when I was doing this that we
actually<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> bit<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.710> problem<00:01:55.950> here

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
actually have a bit of a problem here

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.670 
actually have a bit of a problem here
you<00:01:56.520> could<00:01:56.940> probably<00:01:57.090> hear<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.570> all<00:01:58.500> that

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
you could probably hear the all that

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.020 
you could probably hear the all that
fuel<00:01:58.890> running<00:01:59.310> through<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> fuel<00:01:59.850> pressure

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
fuel running through the fuel pressure

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.990 
fuel running through the fuel pressure
regulator<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.990> we'll<00:02:01.250> go<00:02:02.250> back<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.640> set<00:02:02.850> up

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
regulator so we'll go back to set up

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.630 
regulator so we'll go back to set up
here<00:02:04.250> traces<00:02:05.250> or<00:02:05.759> trace<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:07.190> we'll<00:02:08.190> set<00:02:08.610> that

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
here traces or trace to we'll set that

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.040 
here traces or trace to we'll set that
to<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> 100<00:02:09.989> psi<00:02:10.940> or<00:02:11.940> changes<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.739> 100<00:02:13.739> psi<00:02:13.950> also

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
to a 100 psi or changes to 100 psi also

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.610 
to a 100 psi or changes to 100 psi also
and<00:02:16.670> hit<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.880> displayed<00:02:18.360> on<00:02:18.570> that<00:02:19.850> should<00:02:20.850> be

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
and hit the displayed on that should be

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.940 
and hit the displayed on that should be
good<00:02:22.620> over<00:02:22.920> here

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.080 

so<00:02:26.490> we<00:02:26.610> got<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:26.970> on<00:02:27.000> though<00:02:27.360> we<00:02:28.170> connect<00:02:28.560> this

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.760 

so<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> fuel<00:02:33.420> pump<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:33.810> running<00:02:34.110> here<00:02:34.290> again

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
so a fuel pump is running here again

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.630 
so a fuel pump is running here again
and<00:02:35.099> we<00:02:35.250> can<00:02:35.430> see<00:02:35.700> on<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:37.230> green<00:02:37.440> line<00:02:37.739> on<00:02:38.040> the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
and we can see on the green line on the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.030 
and we can see on the green line on the
scope<00:02:38.910> here<00:02:39.260> we<00:02:40.260> got<00:02:40.880> 50<00:02:42.590> just<00:02:43.590> run<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:43.830> little

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
scope here we got 50 just run a little

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.420 
scope here we got 50 just run a little
over<00:02:44.280> 50<00:02:44.640> psi<00:02:45.180> which<00:02:46.050> for<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.350> fuel<00:02:46.560> pump<00:02:46.860> for<00:02:47.100> a

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
over 50 psi which for a fuel pump for a

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.190 
over 50 psi which for a fuel pump for a
new<00:02:47.550> fuel<00:02:47.819> pump<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.239> is<00:02:48.420> not<00:02:48.600> very<00:02:48.840> good<00:02:49.020> we

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
new fuel pump this is not very good we

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.979 
new fuel pump this is not very good we
should<00:02:49.380> be<00:02:49.500> up<00:02:49.709> over<00:02:50.130> 60<00:02:50.580> here<00:02:50.880> just<00:02:51.630> running

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
should be up over 60 here just running

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.800 
should be up over 60 here just running
it<00:02:52.310> without<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.730> engine<00:02:54.090> running<00:02:54.420> with<00:02:54.690> the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
it without the engine running with the

it without the engine running with the
fuel<00:02:55.019> pump<00:02:55.230> right<00:02:55.440> we<00:02:55.620> should<00:02:55.800> be<00:02:55.920> over<00:02:56.040> 60<00:02:56.550> so

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
fuel pump right we should be over 60 so

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.400 
fuel pump right we should be over 60 so
we<00:02:57.269> got<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.450> problem<00:02:57.720> here<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.080> I'll<00:02:58.170> show<00:02:58.200> you

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
we got a problem here and I'll show you

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.870 
we got a problem here and I'll show you
what<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.650> problem<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.130> here<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.610> minute

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
what the problem is here in a minute

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.780 
what the problem is here in a minute
I'll<00:03:00.120> disconnect<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.720> fuel<00:03:00.870> pump<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.790> we

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
I'll disconnect the fuel pump and we

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.050 
I'll disconnect the fuel pump and we
could<00:03:03.000> see<00:03:03.180> how<00:03:03.330> faster<00:03:04.220> our<00:03:05.220> pressure<00:03:05.850> is

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
could see how faster our pressure is

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.630 
could see how faster our pressure is
running<00:03:07.019> down<00:03:07.230> here<00:03:07.730> I'll<00:03:08.730> back<00:03:08.940> this<00:03:09.180> up<00:03:10.640> go

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
running down here I'll back this up go

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.500 
running down here I'll back this up go
to<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:14.060> little<00:03:15.060> different<00:03:15.420> screen<00:03:15.780> here<00:03:17.510> record

to a little different screen here record
that<00:03:18.720> there<00:03:19.260> we<00:03:19.440> can<00:03:19.590> see<00:03:19.769> our<00:03:20.030> chill<00:03:21.030> pressure

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
that there we can see our chill pressure

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.140 
that there we can see our chill pressure

how<00:03:34.709> faster<00:03:37.730> somehow<00:03:38.730> we<00:03:38.790> lost<00:03:38.910> it<00:03:39.920> maximum

you can see how fast this is just over
about<00:03:45.290> 4<00:03:46.290> seconds<00:03:46.799> here<00:03:46.980> I'll<00:03:47.130> faster<00:03:47.660> our

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.979

because<00:03:53.549> we<00:03:53.640> only<00:03:53.790> had<00:03:53.970> on<00:03:54.090> 26<00:03:54.690> 20

button<00:04:42.419> on<00:04:42.690> here<00:04:42.960> which<00:04:43.139> we<00:04:43.410> didn't<00:04:44.040> have

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
button on here which we didn't have

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.490 
button on here which we didn't have

before

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.520

so<00:04:46.910> let's<00:04:47.910> recalibrate<00:04:48.600> this<00:04:48.840> in<00:04:49.020> a<00:04:49.110> second

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
so let's recalibrate this in a second

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.150 
so let's recalibrate this in a second
and<00:04:50.280> there<00:04:50.460> and<00:04:50.639> we<00:04:51.030> should<00:04:51.060> be<00:04:51.300> back<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:51.690> zero

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
and there and we should be back to zero

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.430 
and there and we should be back to zero
you<00:04:53.160> never<00:04:53.310> had<00:04:53.490> that<00:04:53.700> it<00:04:53.820> would<00:04:53.910> always

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
you never had that it would always

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.330 
you never had that it would always

someone's going to stick this thing up

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.909 
someone's going to stick this thing up
here<00:05:05.370> once<00:05:05.610> and<00:05:05.820> see<00:05:06.169> the<00:05:07.169> pressure<00:05:07.590> we<00:05:07.800> got

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
here once and see the pressure we got

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:14.150 
here once and see the pressure we got
when<00:05:08.160> we're<00:05:08.340> actually<00:05:08.729> running<00:05:13.010> it's<00:05:14.010> got

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
when we're actually running it's got

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:43.920 
when we're actually running it's got
enough<00:05:14.460> to<00:05:14.639> run

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.779 

we<00:05:44.930> can<00:05:45.110> see<00:05:45.229> some<00:05:45.439> fluctuations<00:05:46.189> in<00:05:46.340> our<00:05:46.490> fuel

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789 
we can see some fluctuations in our fuel

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:48.749 
we can see some fluctuations in our fuel
pressure<00:05:47.090> here<00:05:47.360> and<00:05:47.449> it<00:05:47.539> doesn't<00:05:47.930> seem<00:05:48.050> to<00:05:48.199> be

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
pressure here and it doesn't seem to be

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.450 
pressure here and it doesn't seem to be
seems<00:05:49.759> to<00:05:49.909> be<00:05:50.030> following<00:05:50.419> a<00:05:50.569> pattern<00:05:51.219> I'm<00:05:52.219> not

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
seems to be following a pattern I'm not

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.830 
seems to be following a pattern I'm not
really<00:05:52.669> that<00:05:53.150> good<00:05:53.360> on<00:05:53.539> this<00:05:55.449> to<00:05:56.449> see<00:05:56.719> if

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
really that good on this to see if

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.869 
really that good on this to see if
that's<00:05:57.110> actually<00:05:57.349> an<00:05:57.620> injector<00:05:58.129> flow<00:05:58.400> pattern

00:05:58.869 --> 00:05:58.879 
that's actually an injector flow pattern

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:01.270 
that's actually an injector flow pattern
or<00:05:59.060> not<00:05:59.210> it<00:05:59.419> certainly<00:06:00.229> isn't<00:06:00.469> it<00:06:00.710> even<00:06:00.830> as<00:06:01.129> you

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
or not it certainly isn't it even as you

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.279 
or not it certainly isn't it even as you
think<00:06:02.060> it<00:06:02.150> would<00:06:02.240> be<00:06:02.419> and<00:06:02.539> it<00:06:02.629> is<00:06:02.780> definitely<00:06:02.990> a

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
think it would be and it is definitely a

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:05.649 
think it would be and it is definitely a
pattern<00:06:03.560> you<00:06:04.280> can<00:06:04.430> see<00:06:04.490> it<00:06:04.789> repeating<00:06:05.330> itself

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:05.659 
pattern you can see it repeating itself

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.670 
pattern you can see it repeating itself
so<00:06:06.139> I<00:06:07.389> guess<00:06:08.389> if<00:06:08.810> you<00:06:09.020> want<00:06:09.259> to<00:06:09.319> do<00:06:09.439> some<00:06:09.650> more

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
so I guess if you want to do some more

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.110 
so I guess if you want to do some more
study<00:06:10.069> on<00:06:10.159> whether<00:06:10.699> or<00:06:10.819> not<00:06:10.909> you<00:06:11.029> could

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
study on whether or not you could

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.850 
study on whether or not you could
actually<00:06:11.330> see<00:06:11.779> if<00:06:11.900> there<00:06:12.050> was<00:06:12.169> injector<00:06:12.620> flow

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
actually see if there was injector flow

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.589 
actually see if there was injector flow
or<00:06:13.009> not<00:06:13.069> or<00:06:13.340> do<00:06:13.460> a<00:06:13.490> before-and-after<00:06:13.939> do<00:06:14.509> an

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
or not or do a before-and-after do an

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.439 
or not or do a before-and-after do an
injection<00:06:14.900> cleaning<00:06:15.319> and<00:06:15.909> then<00:06:16.909> check<00:06:17.240> this

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
injection cleaning and then check this

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.269 
injection cleaning and then check this
pattern<00:06:17.870> again<00:06:18.139> see<00:06:18.409> if<00:06:18.439> the<00:06:18.620> changes<00:06:19.099> that

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:19.279 
pattern again see if the changes that

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:24.909 
pattern again see if the changes that
changes<00:06:20.240> at<00:06:20.360> all<00:06:20.539> but<00:06:22.930> it<00:06:23.930> stays<00:06:24.680> pretty

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
changes at all but it stays pretty

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.659 
changes at all but it stays pretty
consistent<00:06:26.439> so<00:06:27.439> I<00:06:27.469> don't<00:06:27.770> know<00:06:27.860> if<00:06:27.949> that's<00:06:28.129> if

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 
consistent so I don't know if that's if

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:31.179 
consistent so I don't know if that's if
that's<00:06:28.729> a<00:06:29.090> pattern<00:06:29.680> related<00:06:30.680> to<00:06:30.830> the<00:06:30.919> pump

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:31.189 
that's a pattern related to the pump

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:33.159 
that's a pattern related to the pump
because<00:06:31.430> our<00:06:31.699> fuel<00:06:31.939> pressure<00:06:32.180> regulator<00:06:32.509> is<00:06:33.110> a

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169 
because our fuel pressure regulator is a

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:35.409 
because our fuel pressure regulator is a
obviously<00:06:33.979> isn't<00:06:34.250> working<00:06:34.610> right<00:06:34.639> or<00:06:35.330> if

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
obviously isn't working right or if

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.909 
obviously isn't working right or if
that's<00:06:35.599> actually<00:06:36.460> a<00:06:37.460> flow<00:06:37.879> pattern<00:06:38.150> from<00:06:38.599> the

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 
that's actually a flow pattern from the

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.649 
that's actually a flow pattern from the
injectors<00:06:39.919> themselves<00:06:40.550> so<00:06:40.819> I<00:06:41.029> guess<00:06:41.479> that's

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:41.659 
injectors themselves so I guess that's

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:45.309 
injectors themselves so I guess that's
about<00:06:41.719> it<00:06:41.870> so<00:06:42.199> if<00:06:42.319> you<00:06:42.440> wanted<00:06:42.710> to<00:06:44.139> again<00:06:45.139> if

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 
about it so if you wanted to again if

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:50.189 
about it so if you wanted to again if
you<00:06:45.409> want<00:06:45.560> to<00:06:45.650> get<00:06:45.770> a<00:06:45.800> better<00:06:45.979> definition<00:06:46.279> of

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:53.110 

what<00:06:51.199> your<00:06:51.379> waveform<00:06:51.770> looks<00:06:52.310> like<00:06:52.520> from<00:06:52.909> the

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
what your waveform looks like from the

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.149 
what your waveform looks like from the
fuel<00:06:53.509> pump<00:06:53.810> I<00:06:54.020> got<00:06:54.229> in<00:06:54.379> here<00:06:54.529> in<00:06:54.650> the<00:06:54.740> preset

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:55.159 
fuel pump I got in here in the preset

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:58.180 
fuel pump I got in here in the preset
took<00:06:55.430> that<00:06:55.789> one<00:06:55.969> up<00:06:56.199> 20<00:06:57.199> amps<00:06:57.529> by<00:06:57.889> 20

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
took that one up 20 amps by 20

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.790 
took that one up 20 amps by 20
milliseconds<00:06:58.909> and<00:06:59.089> then<00:06:59.479> the<00:06:59.839> other<00:06:59.990> preset<00:07:00.589> I

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
milliseconds and then the other preset I

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.290 
milliseconds and then the other preset I
got<00:07:02.409> set<00:07:03.409> it<00:07:03.589> for<00:07:04.069> this<00:07:04.219> pump<00:07:04.460> I<00:07:04.610> set<00:07:04.849> it<00:07:04.969> like

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
got set it for this pump I set it like

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.459 
got set it for this pump I set it like
about<00:07:05.479> 5<00:07:05.870> amp<00:07:06.169> total<00:07:06.860> total<00:07:08.199> amplitude<00:07:09.199> and

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:09.469 
about 5 amp total total amplitude and

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:11.920 
about 5 amp total total amplitude and
then<00:07:09.800> again<00:07:10.099> at<00:07:10.279> about<00:07:10.400> 20<00:07:10.879> millisecond<00:07:11.539> times

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
then again at about 20 millisecond times

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.879 
then again at about 20 millisecond times
sweet<00:07:12.229> so<00:07:12.979> I<00:07:13.129> guess<00:07:13.430> that's<00:07:13.580> about<00:07:13.759> it
