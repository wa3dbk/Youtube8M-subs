chopper today we're going to do
spider-man<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.850> use<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:05.879> toothpick<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.359> mark<00:00:06.660> out

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
spider-man I use a toothpick to mark out

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.750 
spider-man I use a toothpick to mark out
the<00:00:07.140> shape<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.620> face<00:00:07.830> that<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.130> want<00:00:08.460> and

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
the shape of the face that I want and

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.070 
the shape of the face that I want and
then<00:00:09.290> carefully<00:00:10.290> cutting<00:00:10.740> around<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.219> edge<00:00:11.340> I

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
then carefully cutting around the edge I

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.140 
then carefully cutting around the edge I
will<00:00:13.080> just<00:00:13.679> separate<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.250> cake<00:00:14.490> from<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
will just separate the cake from the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.910 
will just separate the cake from the
side<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:16.049> there's<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> little<00:00:16.379> technique<00:00:16.650> here

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
side and there's a little technique here

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.429 
side and there's a little technique here
slicing<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.789> into<00:00:18.060> four<00:00:18.270> sections<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.990> then

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
slicing it into four sections and then

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.650 
slicing it into four sections and then
you<00:00:19.529> pull<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> corners<00:00:20.279> out<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:21.119> helps<00:00:21.420> to

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
you pull the corners out that helps to

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.189 
you pull the corners out that helps to
not<00:00:21.810> destroy<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.890> shape<00:00:23.130> just<00:00:23.609> cut<00:00:24.199> then

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
not destroy the shape just cut then

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.500 
not destroy the shape just cut then
we'll<00:00:25.439> flip<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.830> cake<00:00:26.010> over<00:00:26.220> onto<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.240> cake

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
we'll flip the cake over onto the cake

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.370 
we'll flip the cake over onto the cake
board<00:00:28.820> this<00:00:29.820> reveals<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.720> top<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.080> banana

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
board this reveals the top of the banana

board this reveals the top of the banana
berry<00:00:31.560> where<00:00:31.920> I've<00:00:32.070> cut<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.880> base<00:00:33.239> part<00:00:33.809> off

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
berry where I've cut the base part off

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.240 
berry where I've cut the base part off
so<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.160> doesn't<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.640> crust<00:00:36.420> up<00:00:36.860> now<00:00:37.860> I'm<00:00:38.040> just

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
so it doesn't have crust up now I'm just

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.950 
so it doesn't have crust up now I'm just
trimming<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> edges<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:39.059> make<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.390> base<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
trimming the edges to make the base a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.319 
trimming the edges to make the base a
little<00:00:40.590> more<00:00:41.010> rounded<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.640> corners<00:00:42.120> this

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
little more rounded on the corners this

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.700 
little more rounded on the corners this
helps<00:00:42.690> create<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.680> smooth<00:00:44.100> base<00:00:44.460> around<00:00:48.710> by

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
helps create the smooth base around by

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.350 
helps create the smooth base around by
using<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.129> bread<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.489> butter<00:00:50.610> knife<00:00:50.820> you're

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
using this bread and butter knife you're

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.020 
using this bread and butter knife you're
sort<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.690> pushing<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.500> icing<00:00:53.100> into<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.820> cake

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
sort of pushing the icing into the cake

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.389 
sort of pushing the icing into the cake
this<00:00:54.750> creates<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.289> barrier<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.949> when<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.219> add

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
this creates a barrier for when you add

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.760 
this creates a barrier for when you add
the<00:00:56.850> rest<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> icing<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.780> crumbs<00:00:58.530> they

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
the rest of the icing and crumbs they

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.290 
the rest of the icing and crumbs they
get<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.070> stuff<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.489> shine<00:00:59.699> through<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.059> I

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
get this stuff and shine through it I

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.369 
get this stuff and shine through it I
find<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> lot<00:01:01.410> easier<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:02.989> when<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.019> put

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
find this a lot easier and when I put

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.080 
find this a lot easier and when I put
the<00:01:04.500> smoothing<00:01:04.860> all<00:01:05.040> over<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.309> top<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.970> get

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the smoothing all over the top you get

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:22.520 
the smoothing all over the top you get
this<00:01:06.240> nice<00:01:06.540> even<00:01:07.170> layer

this<00:01:23.530> extra<00:01:24.010> dollop<00:01:24.370> of<00:01:24.550> icing<00:01:24.790> is<00:01:25.060> going<00:01:25.270> to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
this extra dollop of icing is going to

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.000 
this extra dollop of icing is going to
become<00:01:25.570> spider-man's<00:01:26.110> nose<00:01:26.380> because<00:01:26.890> I'm

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
become spider-man's nose because I'm

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.370 
become spider-man's nose because I'm
going<00:01:27.160> for<00:01:27.430> a<00:01:27.460> more<00:01:27.640> realistic<00:01:27.910> ask<00:01:28.750> rather

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
going for a more realistic ask rather

going for a more realistic ask rather
than<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.800> flat<00:01:30.070> one<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:31.750> put<00:01:31.960> it<00:01:32.080> in<00:01:32.200> the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
than to the flat one just put it in the

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260 
than to the flat one just put it in the
middle<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:32.530> then<00:01:32.830> work<00:01:33.010> it<00:01:33.220> out<00:01:33.340> drawing<00:01:34.060> the

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
middle and then work it out drawing the

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.420 
middle and then work it out drawing the
eyes<00:01:34.420> like<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:34.750> have<00:01:34.900> here<00:01:35.140> and<00:01:35.350> that<00:01:35.380> helps<00:01:36.310> you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
eyes like I have here and that helps you

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.300 
eyes like I have here and that helps you

the right dimensions free space and it's

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.560 
the right dimensions free space and it's
just<00:01:39.550> a<00:01:39.610> matter<00:01:39.729> of<00:01:39.850> smoothing<00:01:40.300> it<00:01:40.390> till

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
just a matter of smoothing it till

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.180 
just a matter of smoothing it till
you're<00:01:40.720> happy<00:01:40.900> with<00:01:41.080> it<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:41.260> then<00:01:41.740> we're

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
you're happy with it and then we're

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.260 
you're happy with it and then we're
rolling<00:01:43.060> now<00:01:43.270> white<00:01:44.080> icing<00:01:44.500> just<00:01:45.000> royal<00:01:46.000> icing

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
the eyes you don't wanna go too far in

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.380 
the eyes you don't wanna go too far in
just<00:02:30.070> you're<00:02:30.220> using<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.580> white<00:02:30.790> icing<00:02:31.000> for

just you're using the white icing for
the<00:02:31.480> white<00:02:31.690> I<00:02:41.400> recently<00:02:42.400> received<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:43.330> private

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
the white I recently received a private

the white I recently received a private
message<00:02:44.320> on<00:02:44.500> YouTube<00:02:44.560> about<00:02:45.570> why<00:02:46.570> I<00:02:46.600> use<00:02:47.110> the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
message on YouTube about why I use the

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.410 
message on YouTube about why I use the
food<00:02:47.650> coloring<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.520> paint<00:02:48.910> it<00:02:49.030> onto<00:02:49.150> the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
food coloring and paint it onto the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.000 
food coloring and paint it onto the
icing<00:02:49.780> rather<00:02:50.140> than<00:02:50.380> just<00:02:50.560> coloring<00:02:50.830> the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
icing rather than just coloring the

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.490 
icing rather than just coloring the
icing<00:02:51.370> because<00:02:52.330> I<00:02:52.600> just<00:02:52.780> play<00:02:53.020> this<00:02:53.170> from<00:02:53.410> the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
icing because I just play this from the

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.850 
icing because I just play this from the
supermarket<00:02:54.210> to<00:02:55.210> add<00:02:55.360> red<00:02:55.780> dye<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.110> white

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
supermarket to add red dye to white

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.720 
supermarket to add red dye to white
icing<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.520> turns<00:02:57.820> it<00:02:57.940> a<00:02:58.000> very<00:02:58.180> pink<00:02:58.540> color<00:02:58.840> and

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
icing it turns it a very pink color and

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.640 
icing it turns it a very pink color and
it's<00:03:00.730> really<00:03:01.120> hard<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.540> get<00:03:01.780> close<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.290> red

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
it's really hard to get close to red

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.750 
it's really hard to get close to red
unless<00:03:02.920> you're<00:03:03.070> buying<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:03.520> already

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
unless you're buying it already

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.050 
unless you're buying it already
professionally<00:03:04.480> made<00:03:04.770> so<00:03:05.770> I<00:03:06.130> find<00:03:06.670> it's<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:06.880> lot

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
professionally made so I find it's a lot

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.730 
professionally made so I find it's a lot
easier<00:03:07.420> just<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.630> paint<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:08.050> on<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.410> doesn't

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
easier just to paint it on it doesn't

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.910 
easier just to paint it on it doesn't
affect<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.100> taste<00:03:09.280> or<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.700> flavor<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:10.920> that's

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
affect the taste or the flavor so that's

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:20.580 
affect the taste or the flavor so that's
the<00:03:12.100> reason<00:03:12.280> why<00:03:12.550> I<00:03:12.580> use<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:13.060> food<00:03:13.240> court<00:03:19.590> when

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
the reason why I use the food court when

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.229 
the reason why I use the food court when
painting<00:03:20.830> on<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.100> details<00:03:21.459> of<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.700> mask<00:03:21.910> I've

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
painting on the details of the mask I've

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.060 
painting on the details of the mask I've
just<00:03:22.510> used<00:03:22.780> a<00:03:22.989> cheap<00:03:23.200> set<00:03:23.410> of<00:03:23.530> paintbrushes

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
just used a cheap set of paintbrushes

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.449 
just used a cheap set of paintbrushes
that<00:03:24.400> you<00:03:25.120> can<00:03:25.270> get<00:03:25.510> from<00:03:25.630> any<00:03:25.780> craft<00:03:26.110> store

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
that you can get from any craft store

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.690 
that you can get from any craft store
I'm<00:03:27.700> News<00:03:27.970> Agency<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:29.769> I<00:03:29.920> use<00:03:30.099> scissors<00:03:30.430> to

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
I'm News Agency and I use scissors to

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.670 
I'm News Agency and I use scissors to
angle<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.420> brushes<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:31.840> trim<00:03:32.319> them<00:03:32.439> down<00:03:32.650> a

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
angle the brushes and trim them down a

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.039 
angle the brushes and trim them down a
bit<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:33.310> get<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.549> finer<00:03:33.819> detail<00:03:34.360> I<00:03:34.599> find<00:03:34.959> this

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
bit to get the finer detail I find this

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.039 
bit to get the finer detail I find this
is<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:35.739> much<00:03:36.069> easier<00:03:36.310> than<00:03:36.810> cutting<00:03:37.810> our

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
is so much easier than cutting our

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.100 
is so much easier than cutting our
lysine<00:03:38.530> or<00:03:38.860> any<00:03:39.280> other<00:03:39.400> technique<00:03:39.849> and<00:03:40.120> if

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
lysine or any other technique and if

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.170 
lysine or any other technique and if
you're<00:03:41.260> not<00:03:41.379> a<00:03:41.409> good<00:03:41.680> paint<00:03:41.980> them<00:03:42.159> you<00:03:43.000> can

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
you're not a good paint them you can

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:52.800 
you're not a good paint them you can
always<00:03:43.299> do<00:03:43.569> the<00:03:43.659> transfer
