00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
today today has been yet I'd like to

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.869 
today today has been yet I'd like to
discuss<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:03.629> Train<00:00:03.990> of<00:00:04.020> four<00:00:04.580> monitor<00:00:05.580> and

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
discuss the Train of four monitor and

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.129 
discuss the Train of four monitor and
the<00:00:06.000> trainer<00:00:06.270> for<00:00:06.509> stimulation<00:00:09.139> typically

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
the trainer for stimulation typically

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.009 
the trainer for stimulation typically
will<00:00:10.410> use<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.650> neuromuscular<00:00:11.450> stimulator<00:00:12.450> to

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
will use a neuromuscular stimulator to

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.220 
will use a neuromuscular stimulator to
assess<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.559> degree<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.950> our<00:00:14.340> nondepolarizing

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
assess the degree of our nondepolarizing

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.390 
assess the degree of our nondepolarizing
neuromuscular<00:00:16.230> blockade<00:00:16.529> whether<00:00:17.039> within

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
neuromuscular blockade whether within

the ICU or most frequently in the
operating<00:00:21.060> room<00:00:21.359> now<00:00:22.170> many<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.470> my<00:00:22.560> students

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
operating room now many of my students

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.730 
operating room now many of my students
are<00:00:23.480> tested<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.750> concept<00:00:25.230> but<00:00:25.500> they

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
are tested on this concept but they

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.070 
are tested on this concept but they
truly<00:00:26.400> never<00:00:26.730> appreciate<00:00:27.390> what<00:00:27.689> it's<00:00:27.840> trying

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
truly never appreciate what it's trying

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.980 
truly never appreciate what it's trying
to<00:00:28.199> tell<00:00:28.500> them<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.939> video<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.570> will

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
to tell them and so this video I will

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.840 
to tell them and so this video I will
attempt<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.679> clarify<00:00:32.120> what<00:00:33.120> exactly<00:00:33.149> this

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
attempt to clarify what exactly this

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.350 
attempt to clarify what exactly this
concept<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.270> what<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.480> means<00:00:37.309> so<00:00:38.309> what<00:00:39.239> do

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
concept is and what it means so what do

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.990 
concept is and what it means so what do
you<00:00:39.480> do<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:40.649> take<00:00:40.680> your<00:00:41.280> train<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.670> four

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
you do you take your train of four

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.369 
you do you take your train of four
monitor<00:00:42.710> your<00:00:43.710> little<00:00:44.100> nerve<00:00:44.460> stimulator<00:00:45.030> and

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
monitor your little nerve stimulator and

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.470 
monitor your little nerve stimulator and
typically<00:00:46.379> you'll<00:00:46.800> connect<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.789> two

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
typically you'll connect it to two

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.270 
typically you'll connect it to two
electrodes<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.289> are<00:00:49.350> along<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.980> ulnar

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
electrodes that are along the ulnar

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.790 
electrodes that are along the ulnar
nerve<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.789> you'll<00:00:51.539> monitor<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.260> twitch<00:00:52.559> of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
nerve and you'll monitor the twitch of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.959 
nerve and you'll monitor the twitch of
the<00:00:52.890> abductor<00:00:53.820> pollicis<00:00:54.420> brevis<00:00:54.629> muscle<00:00:54.860> and

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
the abductor pollicis brevis muscle and

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.240

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
you give the patient rocuronium so you

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.889 
you give the patient rocuronium so you
hit<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.950> trainer<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.579> stimulus<00:01:54.240> prior<00:01:54.659> to

so<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:14.880> known<00:02:15.270> as<00:02:15.300> fade<00:02:15.900> right<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.520> fade

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
so this is known as fade right the fade

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.160 
so this is known as fade right the fade
from<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.540> nonde<00:02:19.470> polarizer<00:02:20.900> now<00:02:21.900> there's

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
from the nonde polarizer now there's

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.920 
from the nonde polarizer now there's
still<00:02:22.440> four<00:02:22.740> twitches<00:02:23.220> one<00:02:23.940> two<00:02:24.210> three<00:02:24.600> four

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
still four twitches one two three four

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.800 
still four twitches one two three four
but<00:02:26.990> what<00:02:27.990> does<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.350> mean<00:02:29.330> we<00:02:30.330> have<00:02:30.360> four

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
but what does this mean we have four

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:42.730 
but what does this mean we have four
twitches<00:02:31.320> yes<00:02:35.810> but<00:02:36.810> our<00:02:36.990> train<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.680> four<00:02:38.430> ratio

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.070 

is<00:02:43.740> going<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.520> be<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.180> magnitude<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.959> our

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
is going to be the magnitude of our

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.520 
is going to be the magnitude of our
fourth<00:02:46.440> twitch<00:02:47.630> divided<00:02:48.630> by<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.840> magnitude

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
fourth twitch divided by the magnitude

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.350 
fourth twitch divided by the magnitude
of<00:02:49.590> our<00:02:49.980> first<00:02:50.310> twitch<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:53.150> in<00:02:54.150> this

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
of our first twitch and in this

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.750 
of our first twitch and in this
particular<00:02:54.570> example<00:02:55.320> we<00:02:56.070> can<00:02:56.220> see<00:02:56.340> our<00:02:56.459> fourth

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
particular example we can see our fourth

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
particular example we can see our fourth
which<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.120> 30%<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:58.260> its<00:02:58.440> magnitude<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.780> our

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
which is 30% of its magnitude and our

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.810 
which is 30% of its magnitude and our
first<00:03:01.050> which<00:03:01.290> was<00:03:01.500> 100%<00:03:01.920> still<00:03:02.550> of<00:03:02.700> its

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
first which was 100% still of its

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.380 
first which was 100% still of its
magnitude

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
magnitude

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.370 
magnitude
so<00:03:03.720> our<00:03:03.989> ratio<00:03:04.560> here<00:03:04.830> is<00:03:04.890> 30%<00:03:06.500> over<00:03:07.500> 100%<00:03:09.380> or

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
so our ratio here is 30% over 100% or

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.720 
so our ratio here is 30% over 100% or
our<00:03:10.890> ratio<00:03:11.610> here<00:03:11.850> is<00:03:12.320> 0.3<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:14.070> is<00:03:14.280> our<00:03:14.430> train

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
our ratio here is 0.3 that is our train

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.660 
our ratio here is 0.3 that is our train
of<00:03:14.850> four<00:03:15.030> ratio<00:03:15.270> I<00:03:15.980> hope<00:03:16.980> you're<00:03:17.190> all<00:03:17.220> seeing

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
of four ratio I hope you're all seeing

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.300 
of four ratio I hope you're all seeing
this<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.510> let's<00:03:18.690> do<00:03:18.840> another<00:03:18.959> example<00:03:20.989> okay<00:03:22.310> so

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
this so let's do another example okay so

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.900 
this so let's do another example okay so
again<00:03:23.640> we<00:03:23.700> had<00:03:23.940> four<00:03:24.239> twitches<00:03:25.549> but<00:03:26.549> our<00:03:26.640> train

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
again we had four twitches but our train

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.620 
again we had four twitches but our train
of<00:03:27.030> four<00:03:27.209> ratio<00:03:28.130> was<00:03:29.130> only<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.970> magnitude<00:03:30.510> of

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
of four ratio was only the magnitude of

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.509 
of four ratio was only the magnitude of
our<00:03:30.780> fourth<00:03:31.019> which<00:03:31.320> divided<00:03:31.980> by<00:03:32.130> the

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
our fourth which divided by the

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.530 
our fourth which divided by the
magnitude<00:03:33.030> of<00:03:33.209> our<00:03:33.390> first<00:03:33.720> which<00:03:35.420> so<00:03:36.420> now

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
magnitude of our first which so now

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.660 
magnitude of our first which so now
let's<00:03:36.720> look<00:03:36.810> after<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.290> minute<00:03:37.650> of<00:03:37.890> your<00:03:38.400> rock

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
let's look after a minute of your rock

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.039 
let's look after a minute of your rock
you'll<00:03:38.850> own<00:03:38.940> iam<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.330> now<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.510> might<00:03:39.810> see

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
you'll own iam and now you might see

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:48.380 
you'll own iam and now you might see
this<00:03:45.230> in<00:03:46.230> this<00:03:46.470> case<00:03:46.790> fourth<00:03:47.790> which<00:03:48.030> is<00:03:48.060> gone

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
this in this case fourth which is gone

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.800 
this in this case fourth which is gone
our<00:03:49.260> first<00:03:49.560> which<00:03:49.829> is<00:03:50.100> only<00:03:50.600> 70%<00:03:51.600> of<00:03:51.630> its

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
our first which is only 70% of its

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.819 
our first which is only 70% of its
initial<00:03:51.989> magnitude<00:03:52.730> we<00:03:53.730> have<00:03:53.880> three<00:03:54.150> twitches

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
initial magnitude we have three twitches

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:02.350 
initial magnitude we have three twitches
okay<00:03:57.530> but<00:03:58.530> a<00:03:58.709> train<00:03:58.980> of<00:03:59.070> four<00:03:59.220> ratio<00:03:59.400> here

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.890 

being<00:04:03.360> T<00:04:03.780> 4<00:04:04.049> divided<00:04:04.920> by<00:04:04.950> T<00:04:05.100> one<00:04:05.549> is<00:04:05.940> equal<00:04:06.630> to

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
being T 4 divided by T one is equal to

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:14.449 
being T 4 divided by T one is equal to
zero<00:04:07.110> percent<00:04:08.540> divided<00:04:09.540> by<00:04:10.220> 70%<00:04:12.079> or<00:04:13.079> zero<00:04:14.070> so

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
zero percent divided by 70% or zero so

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.449 
zero percent divided by 70% or zero so
in<00:04:14.640> this<00:04:14.760> instance<00:04:15.060> or<00:04:15.540> trying<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.840> four<00:04:16.049> ratio

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
in this instance or trying to four ratio

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.469 
in this instance or trying to four ratio
is<00:04:17.459> zero<00:04:19.519> hope<00:04:20.519> this<00:04:20.790> makes<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.269> little<00:04:21.359> bit

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
is zero hope this makes a little bit

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.820 
is zero hope this makes a little bit
more<00:04:21.780> sense

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
more sense

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.500 
more sense
so<00:04:24.830> again<00:04:25.160> there's<00:04:25.370> a<00:04:25.460> train<00:04:25.790> of<00:04:25.910> four<00:04:26.150> count

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
so again there's a train of four count

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.050 
so again there's a train of four count
and<00:04:26.949> then<00:04:27.949> there's<00:04:28.160> a<00:04:28.310> train<00:04:28.610> of<00:04:28.760> four<00:04:28.970> ratio

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
and then there's a train of four ratio

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.530 
and then there's a train of four ratio
now<00:04:32.060> our<00:04:32.540> last<00:04:32.930> example<00:04:33.820> will<00:04:34.820> be<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:35.360> one

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
now our last example will be the one

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.320 
now our last example will be the one
dealing<00:04:35.840> with<00:04:36.229> succinylcholine

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
dealing with succinylcholine

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.360 
dealing with succinylcholine
succinylcholine<00:04:38.330> is<00:04:38.900> a<00:04:39.080> nun<00:04:39.320> or<00:04:39.710> I'm<00:04:39.979> sorry<00:04:40.220> is

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
succinylcholine is a nun or I'm sorry is

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.560 
succinylcholine is a nun or I'm sorry is
a<00:04:40.490> depolarizing<00:04:41.590> neuromuscular<00:04:42.590> blocker<00:04:42.860> a

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker a

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.700 
a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker a
depolarizing<00:04:44.570> neuromuscular<00:04:44.870> blocker<00:04:45.410> it

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
depolarizing neuromuscular blocker it

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.469 
depolarizing neuromuscular blocker it
acts<00:04:45.919> differently<00:04:46.490> than<00:04:46.910> vecuronium

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
acts differently than vecuronium

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.830 
acts differently than vecuronium
rocuronium<00:04:48.320> or<00:04:48.830> says<00:04:49.070> that<00:04:49.100> to<00:04:49.400> curiam<00:04:49.840> so

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
rocuronium or says that to curiam so

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.480 
rocuronium or says that to curiam so
they<00:04:50.990> always<00:04:51.290> say<00:04:51.500> that<00:04:51.800> the<00:04:51.919> twitches<00:04:52.310> will

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
they always say that the twitches will

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.400 
they always say that the twitches will
always<00:04:52.760> be<00:04:52.880> equal<00:04:52.910> in<00:04:53.270> magnitude<00:04:53.419> this<00:04:54.169> is

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
always be equal in magnitude this is

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.800 
always be equal in magnitude this is
what<00:04:54.590> they<00:04:54.770> mean<00:04:55.010> so<00:04:55.280> prior<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.419> giving<00:04:56.540> your

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
what they mean so prior to giving your

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.840 
what they mean so prior to giving your
succinylcholine<00:04:57.290> you<00:04:57.950> test<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:58.370> patient

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
succinylcholine you test the patient

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.550 
succinylcholine you test the patient
they<00:04:59.090> have<00:04:59.120> no<00:04:59.450> no<00:04:59.690> muscular<00:04:59.990> blocker<00:05:00.410> on

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
they have no no muscular blocker on

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.070 
they have no no muscular blocker on
board<00:05:00.950> and<00:05:01.220> you<00:05:01.250> see<00:05:02.240> all<00:05:02.419> of<00:05:02.450> your<00:05:02.630> twitches

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
board and you see all of your twitches

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.730 
board and you see all of your twitches
are<00:05:03.260> 100%<00:05:04.040> of<00:05:04.580> their<00:05:05.200> magnitude<00:05:06.200> that<00:05:06.440> is<00:05:06.590> the

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
are 100% of their magnitude that is the

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.560 
are 100% of their magnitude that is the
normal<00:05:07.130> response<00:05:07.550> when<00:05:08.360> you<00:05:08.419> get

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
normal response when you get

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.930 
normal response when you get
succinylcholine<00:05:08.960> and<00:05:09.560> maybe<00:05:10.190> thirty<00:05:10.520> seconds

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
succinylcholine and maybe thirty seconds

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.020 
succinylcholine and maybe thirty seconds
later<00:05:11.150> you<00:05:11.389> assess<00:05:11.720> the<00:05:11.900> twitches<00:05:12.850> this<00:05:13.850> is

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
later you assess the twitches this is

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.870 
later you assess the twitches this is
what<00:05:14.210> you<00:05:14.330> see<00:05:14.600> with<00:05:14.900> succinylcholine<00:05:18.880> okay

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
what you see with succinylcholine okay

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.390 
what you see with succinylcholine okay
what<00:05:20.660> did<00:05:20.750> I<00:05:20.840> what<00:05:21.139> is<00:05:21.260> this<00:05:21.410> saying<00:05:22.070> I<00:05:22.280> have

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
what did I what is this saying I have

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.760 
what did I what is this saying I have
four<00:05:22.669> twitches<00:05:25.900> and<00:05:26.900> my<00:05:27.080> train<00:05:27.320> of<00:05:27.350> four<00:05:27.560> ratio

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
four twitches and my train of four ratio

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.420 
four twitches and my train of four ratio
is<00:05:28.310> one<00:05:28.729> what<00:05:29.389> yes<00:05:29.960> it<00:05:30.229> is<00:05:30.350> one<00:05:30.620> it's<00:05:30.950> fifty

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
is one what yes it is one it's fifty

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.260 
is one what yes it is one it's fifty
percent<00:05:32.020> divided<00:05:33.020> by<00:05:33.260> 50<00:05:33.680> percent<00:05:34.130> to<00:05:34.760> fifty

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
percent divided by 50 percent to fifty

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.700 
percent divided by 50 percent to fifty
four<00:05:35.510> divided<00:05:36.320> by<00:05:36.440> t1<00:05:39.070> so<00:05:40.070> that<00:05:40.580> is<00:05:40.940> how<00:05:41.180> a

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
four divided by t1 so that is how a

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.409 
four divided by t1 so that is how a
succinylcholine<00:05:42.710> block<00:05:43.430> will<00:05:43.639> appear<00:05:43.789> this

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
succinylcholine block will appear this

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.940 
succinylcholine block will appear this
is<00:05:44.599> known<00:05:44.780> as<00:05:44.810> a<00:05:45.080> phase<00:05:46.360> one<00:05:47.360> blockade<00:05:48.050> okay

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
is known as a phase one blockade okay

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.909 
is known as a phase one blockade okay
so<00:05:49.490> we<00:05:49.639> had<00:05:49.849> fade<00:05:50.240> with<00:05:50.780> the<00:05:50.900> nonda<00:05:51.260> polarisers

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
so we had fade with the nonda polarisers

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.730 
so we had fade with the nonda polarisers
and<00:05:52.160> i<00:05:53.060> Phase<00:05:53.360> one<00:05:53.389> block<00:05:54.050> with<00:05:54.560> our

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
and i Phase one block with our

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.390 
and i Phase one block with our
succinylcholine<00:05:56.800> well<00:05:57.800> usually<00:05:58.070> if

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
succinylcholine well usually if

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.490 
succinylcholine well usually if
something<00:05:58.760> has<00:05:58.940> a<00:05:59.240> term<00:05:59.780> known<00:06:00.080> as<00:06:00.229> phase<00:06:00.470> one

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
something has a term known as phase one

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.860 
something has a term known as phase one
there's<00:06:01.099> probably<00:06:01.490> a<00:06:01.580> Phase<00:06:01.910> two<00:06:01.940> with<00:06:02.419> it<00:06:02.630> and

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
there's probably a Phase two with it and

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.800 
there's probably a Phase two with it and
succinylcholine<00:06:03.260> is<00:06:03.860> no<00:06:04.010> exception

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
succinylcholine is no exception

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.290 
succinylcholine is no exception
so<00:06:05.810> if<00:06:05.960> you<00:06:06.139> give<00:06:06.410> too<00:06:06.979> much<00:06:07.520> succinylcholine

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
so if you give too much succinylcholine

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.480 
so if you give too much succinylcholine
or<00:06:08.840> you<00:06:08.960> have<00:06:09.139> an<00:06:09.260> extended<00:06:09.710> infusion<00:06:10.370> of

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
or you have an extended infusion of

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.950 
or you have an extended infusion of
succinylcholine<00:06:10.820> you<00:06:11.510> might<00:06:11.720> run<00:06:11.900> into

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
succinylcholine you might run into

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.980 
succinylcholine you might run into
what's<00:06:12.410> called<00:06:12.620> a<00:06:12.800> phase<00:06:13.190> two<00:06:13.580> block<00:06:13.910> and<00:06:14.240> a

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
what's called a phase two block and a

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.830 
what's called a phase two block and a
Phase<00:06:15.260> two<00:06:15.289> block<00:06:15.889> could<00:06:16.610> appear<00:06:17.000> just<00:06:17.210> like<00:06:17.720> a

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
Phase two block could appear just like a

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.270 
Phase two block could appear just like a
nondepolarizing<00:06:20.840> block<00:06:21.710> with<00:06:22.280> that<00:06:22.669> fade

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
nondepolarizing block with that fade

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.659 
nondepolarizing block with that fade
right<00:06:25.280> so<00:06:25.610> with<00:06:25.820> sucks<00:06:26.180> this<00:06:26.750> is<00:06:26.810> a<00:06:27.380> phase<00:06:27.950> two

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 
right so with sucks this is a phase two

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:32.000 
right so with sucks this is a phase two
block<00:06:29.150> succinylcholine

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.780 

so<00:06:33.000> I<00:06:33.360> hope<00:06:33.720> that<00:06:33.780> this<00:06:34.230> video<00:06:34.440> is<00:06:34.950> helpful<00:06:35.100> I

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
so I hope that this video is helpful I

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.140 
so I hope that this video is helpful I
hope<00:06:36.510> you<00:06:36.960> can<00:06:37.140> use<00:06:37.170> this<00:06:37.740> pictorial<00:06:38.520> to<00:06:38.910> kind
