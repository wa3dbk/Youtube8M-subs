standard<00:02:31.350> icon<00:02:31.860> for<00:02:32.220> camera<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.790> we'll<00:02:33.660> set

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
standard icon for camera and we'll set

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.930 
standard icon for camera and we'll set
the<00:02:34.050> section<00:02:34.530> for<00:02:34.770> global<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.459> appears<00:02:35.760> on

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
the section for global so it appears on

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.440

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
take a look at what capture photo does

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.979 
take a look at what capture photo does
just<00:03:14.520> like<00:03:14.670> working<00:03:14.880> with<00:03:15.030> any<00:03:15.330> device<00:03:15.660> we're

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
just like working with any device we're

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.990 
just like working with any device we're
going<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.170> put<00:03:16.410> this<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.770> a<00:03:16.920> try-catch<00:03:17.580> loop

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
going to put this in a try-catch loop

going to put this in a try-catch loop
for<00:03:18.930> demo<00:03:19.170> purposes<00:03:19.650> I'm<00:03:19.890> not<00:03:20.130> handling<00:03:20.640> the

for demo purposes I'm not handling the
error<00:03:20.970> at<00:03:21.209> all<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.350> just<00:03:22.530> falls<00:03:22.830> away<00:03:23.010> down

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
error at all so it just falls away down

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.400 
error at all so it just falls away down
here<00:03:23.700> if<00:03:23.820> you'd<00:03:24.600> like<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.930> catch<00:03:25.140> those<00:03:25.350> errors

yourself feel free to add variables down
here<00:03:28.110> I'm<00:03:29.000> going<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.060> set<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.510> new<00:03:30.840> variable<00:03:31.320> for

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
here I'm going to set a new variable for

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.180 
here I'm going to set a new variable for
the<00:03:31.890> camera<00:03:32.250> capture<00:03:32.670> UI<00:03:32.850> called<00:03:33.390> dialogue<00:03:34.190> we

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
the camera capture UI called dialogue we

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.740 
the camera capture UI called dialogue we
also<00:03:35.340> have<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.730> ability<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.120> set<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.570> aspect

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
also have the ability to set the aspect

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.979 
also have the ability to set the aspect
ratio<00:03:37.260> for<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:38.040> cropping<00:03:38.340> tool<00:03:38.549> I'm<00:03:39.060> going<00:03:39.780> to

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
ratio for the cropping tool I'm going to

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.729 
ratio for the cropping tool I'm going to
use<00:03:40.049> 16<00:03:40.950> by<00:03:41.190> 9<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:42.540> api's<00:03:42.959> for<00:03:43.260> camera<00:03:43.560> are

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
use 16 by 9 the api's for camera are

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.699 
use 16 by 9 the api's for camera are
asynchronous<00:03:44.510> so<00:03:45.510> what<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:45.900> are<00:03:46.079> seeing<00:03:46.320> here

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
asynchronous so what you are seeing here

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.729 
asynchronous so what you are seeing here
is<00:03:46.769> a<00:03:46.920> JavaScript<00:03:47.790> promise<00:03:48.390> that's<00:03:49.320> where<00:03:49.590> the

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
is a JavaScript promise that's where the

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.490 
is a JavaScript promise that's where the
dot<00:03:50.010> then<00:03:50.459> comes<00:03:50.820> in<00:03:51.060> so<00:03:51.989> we<00:03:52.140> are<00:03:52.320> a

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
dot then comes in so we are a

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.590 
dot then comes in so we are a
synchronously<00:03:53.160> going<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.820> capture<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.269> photo

synchronously going to capture a photo

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.890 
synchronously going to capture a photo
and<00:03:54.900> then<00:03:55.610> when<00:03:56.610> we<00:03:56.760> get<00:03:56.940> something<00:03:57.209> back<00:03:57.570> if

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
and then when we get something back if

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.100 
and then when we get something back if
we<00:03:58.620> do<00:03:58.829> have<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.070> file<00:03:59.430> we're<00:04:00.120> going<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.540> set<00:04:00.870> the
