00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.820
 H 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.630
 the Reds world 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.140
 but with 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.140
 was rejected 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.449
 and 4 chooses to be this help 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.030
 one should and with this perfect transition means of course warmly 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.800
 will welcome 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.250
 Waldkirch has asked what these three idiots are doing - we are looking at the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.090
 bright and skewered 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.360
 Unfortunately, we have no idea how this tasty Nvidia of the Halo Reach 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.149
 To find a campaign and that's where we come into play 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.019
 send us your personally written route description best as well as 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.660
 possible without saying what is with Denis Dyack exactly on itself or 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.360
 what happens when we find it 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.500
 because we want our spontaneous thought reaction and surprise in the video 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.950
 to flow with 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.540
 So call nonsense on the caught mission and tell us what we need to do 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.130
 where does AMD have to go to find the Easter Egg? 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.840
 post the description below this video or send us a personal one 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.050
 message 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.100
 So people also diligently practice keyboards and post what the stuff holds 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.480
 otherwise we can not find a solution 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.640
 we have to turn around little Pander Davis's neck instead 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.649
 their schools 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.649
 You already make the cover 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.300
 while 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.300
 we would be 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.200
 on 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.080
 2 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:17.199
 Hohenlinden Consumers and companies included in it 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.039
 it is necessary 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:29.809
 Artur blow 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:51.789
 Euro or not here Stop Stop Stop Stop 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.279
 open to you the game and want is that you have some questions Qiagen 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:59.889
 Nicole Jost Vacano and Nicole Jost Vacano get done in the LKH Marx 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:00.769
 numbers 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.609
 we are to show that he has his future for us for ours 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:04.829
 Being a guinea pig 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.819
 what we need is a mg and 100 days so the consumption back 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.679
 take back van son 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:13.540
 from the beautiful 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.219
 take the gun 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.729
 deforestation 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:21.649
 and now it's going to be hard Kieler with man that you have to work that way 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:23.059
 walking backwards 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:24.230
 that does not have to say now 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.099
 you have to go backwards 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.569
 and beat at the same time 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.269
 Going backwards under it one suffered his own weapon one by one 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.609
 Fall does not resume that's why Spring actually moved 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.139
 as, of course, 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.329
 go backwards program make 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.909
 beat and probably more active for the animals is now almost no weapon anymore 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.539
 and the sexual one became 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.949
 If you can say that to Minute Reus then you can do that 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:57.139
 So who is not a pattern that can not do so only each one 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.429
 will be able to do it in the break she is really ultimately can 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:03.429
 Euro lost 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:07.249
 and opposition over the waypoint with us 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.639
 belonged 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.489
 of course could help 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:13.569
 factory tour
