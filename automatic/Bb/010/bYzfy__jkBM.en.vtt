00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 my comics then what if you im 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.940
 want to see holiday in italy for videos 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.319
 So-called ksg and so on and thinks of 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.610
 to support the video with a like 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.830
 and sometimes this effort too 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.370
 would definitely reward me a lot 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.370
 motivate friends 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.099
 hello and is called the corporate round 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.660
 war games play me the ultimate 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.189
 team is still one in any case 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.660
 really nice gap and we play with the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.370
 courage parents the spex texture pack 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.780
 have also much asked what from 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.850
 Schiller agrees and now 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.989
 is not that bad slice with that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.370
 It's been a game since I got the new pc 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.140
 here we have my first movie right away 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.840
 the really good breast plate 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.640
 downstairs has ironstone city ​​I have 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.960
 well given 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.610
 yes okay fine I like it now 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.050
 Stop bouncing down there somewhere and 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.480
 therefore probably correct as 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.430
 tough guy someone else is coming 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.969
 itself then where we have the material 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.230
 to get 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.989
 that's a really good one 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.520
 situation and yes today again 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.840
 wanted to give classic course again 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.760
 again many simply again sg 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.470
 where I want to just bring pvp 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.750
 your last time is very much so 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.360
 commentaries did you think so the series 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.260
 and stop blogs and such and now I am 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.939
 but also cool if you have so much 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.500
 can offer variety or stop 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.180
 So I like myself if I still 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.439
 he is come shit and therefore wants 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.720
 I actually really satisfied and 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.030
 somehow yes how should I say 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.590
 adapted or so or dissatisfied the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.180
 I think in any case mega good and yes 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.759
 one thing that wanted to address for 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.470
 that is me on wednesday in the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.939
 Holiday was with the football team 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.270
 a football tournament in italy 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.079
 So on the beach and really cool 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.360
 and that's why I wanted to ask again 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.040
 if you say yes in these 45 days again 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.549
 'm gone if I should bring the video 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.220
 or not 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.509
 and if so, what one and yes that 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.979
 could therefore be here the humor 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.600
 somehow yes it goes where it is 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.310
 Finally give judgment in any case 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.479
 let it be easier for so to speak 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.950
 Just me if you like the video 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.049
 I like it then I have to stop in now 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.920
 These two days then a few 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.110
 record videos 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.430
 with course noon school and so and 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.390
 Yes, I would definitely 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.930
 very happy if it purely write 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.240
 could 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.229
 but maybe the sg course goes or 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.630
 maybe somehow such a series 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.550
 believe stones what do I know each one 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.259
 case a relatively good help I would 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.370
 let's say and of course the video with 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.380
 to support the likes if it is you 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.750
 like and has this effort 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.010
 between to reward for now but 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.780
 always getting good feedback and 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.930
 Just to be confirmed that way I say 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.520
 that was the skill 1000 last 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.740
 time so much cisco is ok and so 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.210
 gambled and I want because of that 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.940
 lose and it is already a bit 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:34.170
 but so far is going well or well 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.480
 not so much better 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.700
 you will at least look like this again 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.590
 he gave me more hits though 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.700
 I am not mistaken 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.440
 now we have two more hearts he is 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.120
 maybe even in Bonn kept trying 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.260
 a bit to escape and yes we 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.300
 also have no food which is pretty 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.620
 shitty that is we do not rain 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.700
 those two hearts 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.890
 maybe also comes from here 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.680
 get some box 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.140
 because in the deathmatch, it's very good then 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.490
 will eat real luck fast and 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.040
 maybe a few more first 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.510
 the match okay that's good 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.220
 and yes, maybe a few 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.500
 twitter noticed I was on Saturday 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.240
 when vfb stuttgart in the stadium is 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.100
 Although still accents but have on 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.720
 this year on this game day the 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.670
 most points made by the 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.040
 relegation candidates making me more 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.150
 Of course, it still pleased 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.320
 eight tenths a bit, look that way 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.570
 but last time I'm breaking 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.860
 confident and believes that the vfb 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.480
 is still packing the season 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.020
 Nuremberg last year 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.220
 I'm the vfb homberg fan 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.290
 and yes, not like a bavarian fan 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.850
 or so what am some asked for when I am 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.210
 today on twitter what the post if 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.760
 Champions league is me 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.730
 not so half heart around mine now 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.780
 God we do not have anything to eat 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.400
 bad then but the dogs come 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.180
 I think so far really cool and 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.530
 span also pack them already makes 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.830
 sacred button bath fun happens even 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.880
 Nothing 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:56.100
 come here no com comes just come 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.430
 we face, we face our 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.240
 good luck and are dead 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.350
 yes that was it with the first one 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.330
 Round then I would say 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.730
 we'll see each other easily in the second 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.020
 round so far the second 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.640
 round on the fcb gate 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.680
 and yes it starts again, too 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.300
 nodded and right off we go 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.670
 Maybe we have something good in the box 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.330
 I would already get facts and 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.459
 bad bad bad next kis ok 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.800
 with at least an armor to him 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.080
 keep beating ok 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.280
 Peter becomes very nice when we are 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.229
 Defend us if someone comes and 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.220
 there is already one 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.050
 but the better ones have the 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.130
 first hits landed good combo 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.810
 mostly directly easy ok really cool looking forward 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.880
 me that runs so well right here in 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.860
 minecraft and yes So as I said I 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.360
 Write my comics what then if 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.979
 I'm on vacation in Italy for videos 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.750
 So you want to see sg course and so on 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.919
 and think about supporting the video 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.350
 with a like and times this effort 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.390
 would reward me, so to speak 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.830
 to motivate every friend very much 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.300
 therefore always a good help as I said 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.300
 but that's what you want, of course 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.470
 also get 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.640
 okay at the times a few bow hits 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.750
 but gave us a very good 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.390
 come where given 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.830
 Okay, we should get away or not 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.419
 okay that died me 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.979
 no matter what, I would say cool 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.810
 there's still a third was all 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.350
 Good things are three to the same time 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.850
 finals 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.110
 I have a bit of the third 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.260
 Round on the kick map and assigns the 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.490
 magic old map on house black 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.380
 ops 2 comes the box we want as 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.820
 first get 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.600
 the sword did not run away fast 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.010
 not the other brings us ok good 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.330
 have value now but we have too 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.860
 better services like that should 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.990
 we get rich in the normal case 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.110
 Well, it's very good to be there too 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:37.169
 not gone but the goal was and how cool 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:41.250
 with the brother of chicago bulls 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:43.950
 so here comes the gentleman nice and cool 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.180
 nikolay hristov that's cool too though 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.200
 a wooden sword is already clear 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.729
 is quite good for the beginning or make 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.060
 come with it fully into the 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.060
 brawl 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.889
 His sword is me too mega 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.719
 like and the subscriptions actually too 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:02.659
 com com get the war if I can 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:04.460
 rather the fingers of the device comes the 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.419
 maybe still a hit representative 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.169
 maybe still and then should 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.099
 actually be gone 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:11.300
 Come on, I come here then stone 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.340
 can you survive from me too 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.979
 but I really want to have it there 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.680
 we pretty old him then the without 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:23.030
 So far, most of them are ok 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:25.310
 very nice short emmental sort and 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.409

 home time so to speak now 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.909
 Again , it's so cool on the server 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.370
 to gamble 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:41.810
 Yes, the team has also been in the wind so 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.210
 I like to play with myself and everything 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.439
 For the people I want to know, I'm gold 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.389
 number one and if you see the video 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:49.219
 maybe already gold number two and 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:51.110

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:56.539
 universal name I say 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.969
 and both died, but does not matter 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:59.539
 tied kuhlenvenn failed but let 

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:00.919
 a lighter one 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:02.750
 and he still seems like what they saw in 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:05.060
 to see the days when I'm not there 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.330
 I owe it until here 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.330
 next
