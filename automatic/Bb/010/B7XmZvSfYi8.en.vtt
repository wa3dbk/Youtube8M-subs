 Step 1: Along the edge of hair growth on the frontal-parietal zone, select the strand and divide it into three parts 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Step 2: Begin to weave a regular braid, perform one weave. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Step 3: Continue to weave the usual braid, but already with grabs. To do this, put the left strand of the braid on the middle, from the free hair on the left, separate the strand and connect it with the left strand of the braid 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Step 4: Put the right strand of the braid on the middle one, separate the strand from the free hair on the right and connect it with the right strand of the braid 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Step 5: Continue weaving a braid with hooks on both sides to the edge hairline on the back of the head. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Step 6: Loose hair ends in a regular braid 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Step 7: Secure the braid with a rubber band. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Step 8: Turn the braid into an asymmetrical low beam and secure it with studs.
