00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
got the shots the whole series i just

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.730

three-pointers<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:12.150> know<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.479> think<00:01:12.750> how

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
three-pointers you know just think how

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.570 
three-pointers you know just think how
many<00:01:13.020> points<00:01:13.380> they<00:01:13.710> would<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.130> scored<00:01:14.400> last

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
many points they would have scored last

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.460 
many points they would have scored last
game<00:01:14.880> they<00:01:15.030> had<00:01:15.150> 100<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.630> they<00:01:15.689> scored<00:01:15.930> 103

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
game they had 100 and they scored 103

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.530 
game they had 100 and they scored 103
points<00:01:16.799> last<00:01:16.950> game<00:01:17.220> they<00:01:18.060> couldn't<00:01:18.360> buy<00:01:18.509> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
points last game they couldn't buy a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.030 
points last game they couldn't buy a
three-pointer<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.320> they<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.890> you

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
three-pointer but they have this you

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.670 
three-pointer but they have this you
know<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.310> they<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> open<00:01:21.000> looks<00:01:21.680> you

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
know that they have the open looks you

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.010 
know that they have the open looks you
know<00:01:22.740> they<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.130> all<00:01:23.369> series<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.750> hopefully

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
know they have all series so hopefully

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.039 
know they have all series so hopefully
you<00:01:25.530> know<00:01:25.650> they<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:26.040> make<00:01:26.220> some<00:01:26.460> threes<00:01:27.049> if

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
you know they can make some threes if

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.140 
you know they can make some threes if
they<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.380> make<00:01:28.409> some<00:01:28.710> threes<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.369> mean<00:01:29.549> this

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
they can make some threes I mean this

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.330 
they can make some threes I mean this
series<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.869> would<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.140> over<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.799> mean

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
series it would be over I mean

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.359 
series it would be over I mean
realistically<00:01:32.700> if<00:01:33.119> Shane<00:01:33.329> Battier<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:34.079> make

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
realistically if Shane Battier can make

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.850 
realistically if Shane Battier can make
four<00:01:35.369> or<00:01:35.400> five<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> game<00:01:35.790> 3<00:01:36.540> game<00:01:36.840> he<00:01:37.500> could<00:01:37.680> beat

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
four or five a game 3 game he could beat

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.260 
four or five a game 3 game he could beat
the<00:01:37.979> heat<00:01:38.130> could<00:01:38.280> shoot<00:01:38.460> thirty<00:01:38.729> percent<00:01:39.119> on

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the heat could shoot thirty percent on

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.170 
the heat could shoot thirty percent on
3-pointers<00:01:39.900> they<00:01:40.740> could<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.070> flat-out<00:01:41.369> blow

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
3-pointers they could just flat-out blow

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.880 
3-pointers they could just flat-out blow
out<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.600> Pacers<00:01:43.020> that's<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.409> that's<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.380 
truth you know that's their Achilles
heel<00:01:46.920> right<00:01:47.340> now<00:01:47.579> they<00:01:47.759> cannot<00:01:48.119> buy<00:01:48.360> a
