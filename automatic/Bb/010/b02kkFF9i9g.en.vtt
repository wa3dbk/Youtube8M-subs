right now okay before we get to step one
it<00:01:47.579> looks<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.060> there's<00:01:48.299> two<00:01:48.600> different<00:01:48.780> ways

it looks like there's two different ways
we<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.679> this<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:50.250> can<00:01:50.280> either<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:51.649> two

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
we can do this we can either have two

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.999 
we can do this we can either have two
separate<00:01:53.369> grow<00:01:54.000> beds<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.689> one<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.530> them<00:01:55.679> have

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
you do step one two three and then skip

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.300 
you do step one two three and then skip
step<00:02:09.119> four<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.050> one<00:02:10.320> and<00:02:10.590> go<00:02:11.100> straight

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
step four for this one and go straight

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.990 
step four for this one and go straight
to<00:02:11.400> step<00:02:11.760> five<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.480> then<00:02:13.470> down<00:02:13.709> for<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.069> w21

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
to step five and then down for the w21

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.840 
to step five and then down for the w21
to<00:02:15.450> skip<00:02:16.110> step<00:02:16.440> three

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
to skip step three

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.180 
to skip step three
and<00:02:17.940> go<00:02:18.060> straight<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.450> four<00:02:18.840> than<00:02:19.200> five<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:20.070> do

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
I'm noticing here on two point one when

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.180 
I'm noticing here on two point one when
we're<00:04:21.450> putting<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.840> CW<00:04:22.350> A's<00:04:22.530> in<00:04:22.800> on<00:04:23.070> the

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
we're putting the CW A's in on the

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.560 
we're putting the CW A's in on the
instructions<00:04:23.820> it<00:04:23.970> looks<00:04:24.180> like<00:04:24.390> they're

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
instructions it looks like they're

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.080 
instructions it looks like they're
supposed<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.900> turn<00:04:25.260> in<00:04:25.440> or<00:04:25.620> twist<00:04:25.950> in<00:04:26.160> I'm

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
supposed to turn in or twist in I'm

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.580 
supposed to turn in or twist in I'm
guessing<00:04:27.479> that's<00:04:27.630> what<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:27.990> circle<00:04:28.410> means

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
guessing that's what that circle means

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.110 
guessing that's what that circle means
but<00:04:28.830> mine<00:04:29.070> just<00:04:29.310> snapped<00:04:29.520> in<00:04:29.700> there<00:04:29.850> wasn't
