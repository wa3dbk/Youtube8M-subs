00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 everybody's waiting for supper 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.549
 Christmas those more traditional dishes 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.770
 I like to surprise my guests. 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.300
 and hellmann's mayonnaise helps me 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.980
 turn that basic rice from the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.980
 day to day in something incredible 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:25.230
 Good. So, we're going to fry the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:28.189
 onion and garlic in olive oil here and let 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.189
 very golden 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.040
 now I'll add a little bit of 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.739
 rosemary that will add a special touch 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:53.699
 the cod that has already been soaked 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:57.019
 about six hours in cold water and I go 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.019
 add also the rice 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.860
 now to give a special touch 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.860
 I'm going to throw some white wine. 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.770
 and the water that is already here for boiling 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.600
 Cook 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:25.500
 now just slap it on a 15 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.290
 minutes or until the water is dry ready 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:41.460
 Our street is already very soft now. 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:43.970
 Fail to add the tomato to the olives. 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.970
 milk 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.450
 and hellmann's mayonnaise that will leave the 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.450
 our rice is very creamy 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.240
 Now I'll mix everything well, you ready.
