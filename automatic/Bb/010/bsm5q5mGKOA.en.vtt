 and mayors also kill this 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.879
 in a new video this time we are going to 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.830
 start a new series that is going to be the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.570
 series of tin mining which is the program 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.519
 in English as well in can mining is the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.740
 made to search the hidden data of the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.030
 game in this case of smile for 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.310
 find things that we're going to 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.590
 find in the next patches as 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.170
 gods wars or anything that goes to 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.490
 leave in future updates with what 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.980
 which in this series what we are going to do 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.240
 it's a patch once it's not necessary 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.060
 that comes out officially but 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.009
 simply in the pts we can go 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.050
 to be able to instantly know practically 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.880
 in a few hours which basis a new 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.770
 what are the new skins going to be? 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.540
 what new war is going to be and I'm going to 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.600
 tell everything evidently from the channel 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.550
 and from this series of agra mining no longer 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.870
 I gave you how good it seems I think it's going to 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.730
 be a pretty interesting series 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.230
 because it is that you are going to be able to enter the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.660
 the same day that it leaves for example the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.640
 pts of a lot of news from a 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.530
 lots of things that how good they are going to 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.360
 happen the next parts and you're going to 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.859
 to be able to prepare by telling 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.140
 your friends with what I tell you 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.300
 that promises to be pretty pretty good 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.989
 and tell you also that normally go up 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.549
 this next day 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.530
 the same day that the price or the 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.420
 next day on this occasion there were 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.149
 a few days later because there are here to 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.740
 uploaded videos and saw too upload 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.649
 three videos not with which is that 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.840
 then we start yes but not before saying 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.759
 what if we're going to do it thanks to 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.140

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.140
 face in the description and also its 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.729
 twitter is and well I remember it so 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.740
 I already tell you how good you can go by 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.149
 your channel is starting to upload simple 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.490
 de es maite is going up a lot of 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.350
 You can subscribe if you like 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.209

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.009
 help with all this in can tomorrow like this 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:40.840
 that from here to thank you for your 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.789
 participation and I already tell you that you can 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.140
 go through your channel you will have it in the 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.030
 description of all videos of the data 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.819
 mining and also in the channel in the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.610
 paragraph of friends then said this 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:53.709
 we started and we started probably 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.170
 the most interesting novelty that is the 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:58.030
 new god not the new god is called 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.920
 sylvanus and the truth is that the only 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.530
 image we have of him is this is not 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.840
 Well the truth is that I already tell you it seems 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.780
 a kind of old man with some 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.420
 textures silva us is the Roman god of 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.430
 the fields of the farms something like that with 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.680
 which is good so let's see no 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.540
 At the moment we do not know their skills or 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.120
 nothing like that we only have 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.799
 these images that good do not give us 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.410
 too many clues about what will happen 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.269
 with this god how is it going to be but the case 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.310
 is that good because we already know that he is going to 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.560
 be sylvanus so good we'll be 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.690
 the wait not in more little things more little things 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.250
 skin defender classic that the truth is 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.130
 who promises also pretty 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.680
 center is on the way to becoming the 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.299
 next and look now since with this 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.299
 there will be three corners that goes to 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.280
 have this god apart from the re color and 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.739
 the golden and legendary diamond and all 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.810
 fishing with what he hears it seems that 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.940
 they like air to remove skin to face 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.799
 the fans obviously defend what 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.630
 thank you and as I say is that in 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.790
 that looks pretty good enough with 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.459
 hendry of looking like a kind of 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.989
 gentleman a gentleman and well then it 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.090
 I also bring you another image in which 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.590
 you're going to see what's going to come out good 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.109
 let's say the effects of the skills 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.700
 defend where you are going to be able to see that this 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.970
 fertile mode will also draw some 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.440
 coins or that seems with which it is going to 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.180
 be something similar to your soul 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.250
 in this case with silver coins something 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.890
 like that and you grab it's a pint 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.720
 pretty pretty cool to all those who 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.920
 you like to come as I say I have you 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.990
 to love because the truth is that 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.670
 We are very well not know if this is 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.890
 who will be good as a sim 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.420
 normal if it will be part of the odyssey put 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.150
 that you know that they are now with the 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.670
 nordic gods and central nordic or if 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.110
 it already gave you if it will come out as normal 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.480
 that we will have to wait to know 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.680
 but I already tell you that it is totally 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.180
 confirmed by hired but yes 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.190
 because it is obviously already in the 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.590
 game files regarding war 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.990
 we have a lot of wars in new 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.240
 in this game in this but the one that in 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.550
 the next one to come out the first one 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.690
 that seems to be from the odyssey that is to say from 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.190
 odd and if it's Nordic that's why we believe it and 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.590
 as you are seeing is a kind of 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.390
 viking ship not that good it seems 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.520
 be pretty good do not do it much 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.050
 case the textures in lilac and gray because 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.750
 that simply because of the program in the 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.160
 that you speak open forgiveness but then for 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.560
 next mind will have its textures 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.930
 cool and their colors cool not so not 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.180
 think this to be disgusting for the 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.040
 colors then this one or tree or well it 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.570
 it can be pretty good 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.400
 we have a guard of a kind of 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.790
 Chinese temple a pagoda something for the 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.830
 style 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.080
 we have the guard in another image the 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.520
 textures and finally we have a guard 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.290
 from someone who also promises to be 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.510
 quite pretty well and the truth is 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.160
 I want to try it, you do not know 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.440
 that's good, they only buy all 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.240
 the edwards that come out because you know 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.610
 thank God I have many gems in 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.170
 it's mike and good then in no 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.240
 hesitate to buy these well teach you 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.650
 those that last need a guard 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.180
 of squid that we do not know very well 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.730
 neither what comes but I already tell you that 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.670
 is another that will come out with what then 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:57.190
 we can also wait for it and see what we 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.930
 Finally, it has a pretty little thing 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.450
 interesting and that has us or has me 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.880
 intrigued me be incognito that you are 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.190
 VIP viewing do not really know that it will 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:10.300
 to be or for what it is going to be not only 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.980
 we have seen it and then she gave you no no 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.600
 We have more information that can be 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.820
 lukas well the truth that I do not know can 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.490
 be simply an icon for example that 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.700
 get with some type promotion in 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.680
 those of jr monsters today can be a 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.480
 payment system although I do not think you already know 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.260
 that for example the minors pg is that 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.910
 they are for free 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.950
 there is a payment system in which if you 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.680
 you pay a certain amount of money per month 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.080
 you get more things than those who do not pay 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.430
 obviously they can save that in the 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.610
 month the truth is that I do not know I do not think 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.340
 because in the most famous in endow in lol 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.750
 if I'm not wrong there's no such system and 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.480
 the truth is that I think that good 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.280
 it would be quite controversial but good to 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.180
 know to know and I tell you what to do with 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.040
 what surprises us 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.500
 I already tell you that I personally am 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.720
 quite expectant and I want to know from 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.610
 what is it about not so this would be all 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.680
 for this episode of data mining 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.510
 tell me in the comments that you have 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.370
 seemed more interesting and what do you think 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.860
 of these new changes remember that 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.140
 we have silva we have the skin of 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.910
 fendrik classic and we also have a 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.280
 heaps of warzel from someone in the 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.410
 Viking boat the squid and the 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.910
 Chinese temple with which is a lot of 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.710
 news to thank wolf again
