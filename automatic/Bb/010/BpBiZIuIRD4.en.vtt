prestige<00:01:30.040> mid<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:32.140> is<00:01:32.230> one<00:01:32.410> of<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.620> most

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
prestige mid this is one of the most

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.060 
prestige mid this is one of the most
high-performance<00:01:34.090> player<00:01:34.720> rack<00:01:34.990> yet<00:01:35.230> it's

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
high-performance player rack yet it's

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.150 
high-performance player rack yet it's
got<00:01:36.190> tiny<00:01:36.520> hand<00:01:36.910> 93<00:01:37.600> inches<00:01:37.780> they're<00:01:38.710> actually

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
got tiny hand 93 inches they're actually

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.060 
got tiny hand 93 inches they're actually
probably<00:01:39.340> feels<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.910> lot<00:01:40.060> smaller<00:01:40.390> than<00:01:40.600> that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
probably feels a lot smaller than that

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.170 
probably feels a lot smaller than that
it's<00:01:42.070> a<00:01:42.160> very<00:01:42.190> very<00:01:42.460> tight<00:01:42.850> string<00:01:43.120> pattern<00:01:45.180> so

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
it's a very very tight string pattern so

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.490 
it's a very very tight string pattern so
if<00:01:46.300> you're<00:01:46.420> playing<00:01:46.660> with<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:46.960> get<00:01:47.110> a<00:01:47.140> lot<00:01:47.410> of

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
if you're playing with you get a lot of

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.430 
if you're playing with you get a lot of
control<00:01:47.830> a<00:01:48.220> lot<00:01:48.460> of<00:01:48.490> accuracy<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:50.080> would

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
control a lot of accuracy but I would

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.400 
control a lot of accuracy but I would
not<00:01:50.860> recommend<00:01:50.920> it<00:01:51.580> for<00:01:51.790> any<00:01:52.390> player<00:01:52.750> playing

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
not recommend it for any player playing

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.870 
not recommend it for any player playing
slots<00:01:53.740> will<00:01:54.010> spin<00:01:54.700> behind<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.060> baseline<00:01:55.390> or

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
slots will spin behind the baseline or

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.930 
slots will spin behind the baseline or
