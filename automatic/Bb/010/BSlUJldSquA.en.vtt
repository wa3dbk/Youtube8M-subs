on a revamped dial a longbow rod they
were<00:00:20.869> out<00:00:21.019> a<00:00:21.050> few<00:00:21.289> years<00:00:21.529> ago<00:00:21.679> and

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:22.239 
were out a few years ago and

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.659 
were out a few years ago and
discontinued<00:00:23.239> and<00:00:23.919> we<00:00:24.919> couldn't<00:00:25.159> understand

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:25.669 
discontinued and we couldn't understand

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.779 
discontinued and we couldn't understand
why<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:25.939> blanks<00:00:26.419> such<00:00:26.569> a<00:00:26.599> lovely<00:00:26.929> blank<00:00:27.789> and

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
why the blanks such a lovely blank and

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.700 
why the blanks such a lovely blank and
for<00:00:29.210> some<00:00:29.390> reason<00:00:29.779> people<00:00:29.810> didn't<00:00:30.349> take<00:00:30.529> to

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
for some reason people didn't take to

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.409 
for some reason people didn't take to
the<00:00:30.829> fixtures<00:00:31.220> and<00:00:31.339> fittings<00:00:31.519> on<00:00:31.759> the<00:00:31.880> rod<00:00:32.059> so

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
the fixtures and fittings on the rod so

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.540 
the fixtures and fittings on the rod so
I've<00:00:32.930> redesigned<00:00:33.559> them<00:00:33.949> to<00:00:34.070> look<00:00:34.190> like<00:00:34.250> an

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
I've redesigned them to look like an

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.270 
I've redesigned them to look like an
infinity<00:00:35.000> DF<00:00:35.359> so<00:00:35.840> this<00:00:36.050> is<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:36.379> longbow<00:00:36.829> DF

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
infinity DF so this is the longbow DF

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.779 
infinity DF so this is the longbow DF
matte<00:00:38.090> finish<00:00:38.449> on<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:38.719> blank<00:00:39.460> 50<00:00:40.460> meal<00:00:40.609> but

matte finish on the blank 50 meal but

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:42.759 
matte finish on the blank 50 meal but
rings<00:00:41.059> through<00:00:41.329> the<00:00:41.480> whole<00:00:41.629> range<00:00:41.899> there's<00:00:42.710> a

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
rings through the whole range there's a

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.000 
rings through the whole range there's a
turn<00:00:42.980> 3/4<00:00:43.760> a<00:00:43.969> three<00:00:44.780> pound<00:00:45.109> and<00:00:45.440> this<00:00:45.710> is<00:00:45.890> the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
turn 3/4 a three pound and this is the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.380 
turn 3/4 a three pound and this is the
three<00:00:46.219> and<00:00:46.339> a<00:00:46.370> half<00:00:46.579> and<00:00:46.820> you<00:00:46.879> can<00:00:47.030> see<00:00:47.239> this

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
three and a half and you can see this

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.200 
three and a half and you can see this
has<00:00:47.570> still<00:00:47.780> got<00:00:48.019> a<00:00:48.199> lovely<00:00:48.530> battle<00:00:49.039> curve<00:00:49.280> this

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
has still got a lovely battle curve this

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.400 
has still got a lovely battle curve this
is<00:00:50.269> a<00:00:50.390> very<00:00:50.750> hard<00:00:51.050> fight<00:00:51.170> in<00:00:51.620> full<00:00:52.339> play<00:00:52.609> mirror

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
is a very hard fight in full play mirror

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.840 
is a very hard fight in full play mirror
probably<00:00:54.410> something<00:00:54.649> around<00:00:55.010> fifteen<00:00:55.550> pound

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
probably something around fifteen pound

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.579 
probably something around fifteen pound
I<00:00:56.030> would<00:00:56.149> guess<00:00:56.390> that's<00:00:56.929> the<00:00:57.079> average<00:00:57.379> size

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
I would guess that's the average size

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.829 
I would guess that's the average size
for<00:00:57.890> in<00:00:58.010> here<00:00:58.399> and<00:00:58.489> you<00:00:58.999> can<00:00:59.179> see<00:00:59.390> it's<00:00:59.629> still

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
for in here and you can see it's still

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.240 
for in here and you can see it's still
giving<00:01:00.019> a<00:01:00.260> very<00:01:00.530> healthy<00:01:01.010> bend<00:01:01.249> in<00:01:01.429> that<00:01:01.460> rod

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
giving a very healthy bend in that rod

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.880 
giving a very healthy bend in that rod
been<00:01:04.250> using<00:01:04.489> this<00:01:04.760> one<00:01:04.970> it's<00:01:05.930> linear

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
been using this one it's linear

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.340 
been using this one it's linear

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
clip every time as you can probably see

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.200 
clip every time as you can probably see
there's<00:01:18.470> a<00:01:18.560> lovely<00:01:18.800> slim<00:01:19.370> handle<00:01:19.940> just<00:01:20.090> like

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
there's a lovely slim handle just like

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.810 
there's a lovely slim handle just like
the<00:01:20.450> Infinity<00:01:20.930> DF<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:22.160> I<00:01:22.190> sort<00:01:22.520> of<00:01:22.580> shrink

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
the Infinity DF and I sort of shrink

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.640 
the Infinity DF and I sort of shrink
tube<00:01:23.060> style<00:01:23.360> handle<00:01:23.930> very<00:01:24.830> understated<00:01:25.430> rod

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
tube style handle very understated rod

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.380 
tube style handle very understated rod
no<00:01:27.650> flashy<00:01:27.980> writing<00:01:28.520> on<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:28.730> or<00:01:28.850> anything<00:01:29.030> else

no flashy writing on it or anything else

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.090 
no flashy writing on it or anything else
so<00:01:29.540> it<00:01:29.600> looks<00:01:29.750> as<00:01:29.900> much<00:01:29.930> like<00:01:30.170> a<00:01:30.440> custom<00:01:30.890> built

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
so it looks as much like a custom built

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.790 
so it looks as much like a custom built
rod<00:01:31.310> as<00:01:31.910> possible<00:01:32.510> and<00:01:32.960> quite<00:01:33.320> a<00:01:33.410> few<00:01:33.500> of<00:01:33.710> the
