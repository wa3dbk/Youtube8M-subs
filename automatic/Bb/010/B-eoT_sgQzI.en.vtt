00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello hello girls welcome one more day 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:08.490
 to my channel and today we are going to 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.120
 talk about a fairly common topic the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.009
 today video games and mobile 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.330
 in replica of the channel we say cell phones 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:22.080
 with children how can we 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:27.109
 rationalize or rather say give the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:30.269
 child the necessary and adequate amount of 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:33.720
 the appliances that the child then 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.120
 entertain yourself is very common today 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.770
 in our current society as a mother 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.150
 one of our big problems is that 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.670
 our son wants to watch a lot of television 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.410
 or wants to be only stuck with the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.030
 tele of your mobile or want to be 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.730
 only playing on their consoles 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.300
 video games then this is extremely 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.370
 counterproductive in terms of its 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.950
 cognitive development in terms of its 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.050
 educational development in school and 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.110
 also in its development with the medium 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.240
 environment many times we do not think or not 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.290
 he knows a lot of mother and they do not even know that 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.970
 this is really harmful for children 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.800
 here in germany where I live so 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.090
 regular we are told by parents since 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.910
 we got the children to kindergarten sir 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.470
 begins to educate parents that 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.350
 children should not watch television 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.810
 constantly between 2 and 3 hours a day 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.840
 that a child watches television is more than 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.310
 enough so that this is not 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.560
 counterproductive in terms of its 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.150
 development I know that for those who 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.190
 are looking at what are the most maybe 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.800
 latin moms this is going to sound 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.080
 quite strange and quite exaggerated 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.410
 only three hours because it is known 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.410
 which is very common among the community 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.630
 latina children usually watch television 6 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.310
 7 or 8 hours a day 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.630
 in fact today they are called the 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.060
 television the nanny free for your 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.500
 translation in Spanish more or less because 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.810
 because many mothers have to go to 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.780
 work other mothers maybe they are very 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.640
 busy there is also mother for example 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.700
 Not everyone who gives birth is 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.070
 prepared mentally as to their 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.250
 nerves to raise a child children are 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.580
 well cute but they are also pretty 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.410
 stress 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.730
 and there are many mothers who to have their 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.380
 mental tranquility simply because 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.730
 sit the child in front of the television 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.100
 they leave him watching television the day 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.050
 complete and the child feels calm 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.240
 in a certain sense but this is 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.190
 hurting the development in the long run 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.690
 of that child in the future both in the 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.430
 school as well as its environment 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.500
 environment then what can we do 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.690
 because we know that this is really 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.210
 a problem the first thing we can do 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.710
 it's like parents start to set limits 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.140
 okay 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.210
 have children want to love them is not 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.240
 let them do everything they 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.010
 they want is difficult it is very difficult for me 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.770
 as mother of four I know perfectly 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.470
 which is very very complicated to put a limit 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.840
 in this sense the children but something 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.010
 I do and maybe I can serve you 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:01.160
 to any person is that I give him what 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.480
 are therefore games or permission to 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.550
 watch television for games and so on 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.650
 etcetera when they have earned it as 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.330
 if for example my child my eldest daughter by 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.740
 example that is already 18 then it does not have 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.990
 time to watch television that never 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.880
 be at home work and study at the same time 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.050
 all day if the poor thing does not 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.530
 have time when night comes 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.780
 scene and then review for your message in 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.190
 your mobile and you lie down again or is 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.590
 with him I do not have this problem because 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.020
 does not have time then that's one of 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.700
 the good tips that I can give you 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.130
 occupy their children 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.030
 ok occupy your children either in classes 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.070
 extras either in extra activities for 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.630
 that the child does not have so much time to live 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.810
 to simply lose it 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.210
 playing in video games or sticking the 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.740
 mobile another of the things also that I 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.650
 I do is that for example if my son 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.180
 medium for example is the one that I have more 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.560
 or less the biggest problem currently 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.310
 because you become milestones as yet no 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.810
 he knows a lot about that 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.250
 when he arrives from school 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.320
 when he has already done he has to 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.450
 get from school to change to 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.610
 fix your things or order it what 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.150
 that your school supplies and then 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.860
 he has to eat and do his homework 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.810
 He knows perfectly well that he does not have 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.150
 allowed to get from the box to throw everything 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.910
 and just get to play not what 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.350
 He knew that can not for 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.000
 what because first you have to teach 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.770
 children who have responsibilities 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.420
 to fulfill and when it is already fulfilled 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.820
 with your responsibilities then you 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.460
 does the others that is in his free time 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.860
 ok you do not use the time that you 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.200
 need to do important things 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.750
 as free time to play and get 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.120
 in networks or whatever it is not that is 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.020
 completely wrong and that you can 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.190
 hurt a child 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.260
 when she was my girl for example she has done 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.660
 his tasks has done his activities he 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.340
 he also has chores in the house for 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.800
 example he has for example what to do 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.190
 X thing he has here everything has a 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.330
 responsibility at home children 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.880
 because they are children not simple and 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.040
 they were plainly wanted sitting 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.080
 on a sofa or lying on a bed and the 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.390
 mother or father do everything for it 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.750
 they do not do anything not that completely 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:12.270
 bad bad really bad you have to put the 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.100
 children activities and obligations for 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.110
 that they in the future understand and 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.970
 understand what it is to have a 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.289
 responsibility and having to comply with 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.330
 she 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.970
 then another tip also that I can 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.460
 give is that when their children behave 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.180
 wrong do anything that you have 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.590
 said do not do anything then 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.389
 punish them by taking away just that 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.970
 what they like most is what I 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.710
 I usually do when my child 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.569
 example has not done something like I know what 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.310
 I said or has behaved badly or has 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:43.630
 answered more in the band from the 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.370
 is 12 at the age of adolescence 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.229
 begins as to have this brightness like this 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.240
 how to want to answer you, well, wrong 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.710
 to mom and these questions well then 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.130
 I do that when he does any 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.380
 thing that should not have done the punishment 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.940
 depending on what it was and the degree of 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.210
 what he did punished him is already with one or 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:05.710
 two hours without egg one or two days this 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.389
 week then depends on what more than 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.940
 More I can share with you that I also do 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.160
 I 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.740
 on weekends for example my child 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.420
 have more free time to play 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.910
 and also use their games and so on 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.400
 etcetera because those weekends 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.930
 well clear more freedom again after 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.980
 that has already fulfilled its things that has 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.110
 what to do 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.000
 another little thing my loves to close with 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.620
 the video that I do not want to enter many and 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.120
 full on that subject but I want to give a 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.190
 brushstroke and if you are interested I can 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.210
 make another issue about it is about 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:39.310
 free internet for children gentlemen is 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.680
 incredible but true and very common that 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.140
 more and more children have accounts of 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.300
 facebook have direct access to 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:50.020
 free internet etc. and so on 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.670
 etcetera not that very bad very bad not 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.650
 only because the children are not 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.270
 trained to deal with the 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.400
 situations that can occur in 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.290
 this kind of social networks but also 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.810
 for the dangers that can arise 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.790
 when those children know adults who 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.010
 they pass as children in those services 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.630
 social there you I'll leave if you 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.160
 interest the problems of the subject and what 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.380
 that I have done about it to avoid 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.210
 that kind of thing they leave me under in 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.910
 the comments ok then I wore a 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.860
 topic about this nothing my loves I hope 

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.900
 that you have liked and that you are interested 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.360
 and also that this one helps you 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.099
 other tips that I have given 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.229
 Now I would be interested to know about the 

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:28.509
 comments that you make for 

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:30.849
 avoid or control that your children do not 

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:32.289
 they spend all their time in networks 

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:34.180
 social networks or with telephones or 

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:36.639
 consoles or television 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.080
 ok nothing my loves tell you also that 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:39.430
 You can visit my other channels 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.659
