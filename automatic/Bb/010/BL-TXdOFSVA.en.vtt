pull<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:50.739> tab<00:00:51.399> on<00:00:51.610> the<00:00:51.640> top<00:00:51.730> then<00:00:52.570> you<00:00:52.750> lift

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
pull the tab on the top then you lift

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.530 
pull the tab on the top then you lift
the<00:00:53.110> two<00:00:53.290> inserts<00:00:53.800> on<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.040> side<00:00:54.310> and<00:00:54.700> then<00:00:55.360> you

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
the two inserts on the side and then you

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.290 
the two inserts on the side and then you
just<00:00:55.720> pull<00:00:55.960> this<00:00:56.140> part<00:00:56.410> and<00:00:56.920> then<00:00:57.550> you<00:00:57.610> just

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
just pull this part and then you just

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.090 
just pull this part and then you just
push<00:00:58.570> it<00:00:58.600> out<00:00:58.840> which<00:00:59.110> is<00:00:59.380> kind<00:00:59.770> of<00:00:59.860> difficult

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
push it out which is kind of difficult

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.280 
push it out which is kind of difficult
so<00:01:00.579> instead<00:01:01.300> of<00:01:01.390> pushing<00:01:01.630> it<00:01:01.870> out<00:01:01.989> what<00:01:02.260> I

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
so instead of pushing it out what I

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.109 
so instead of pushing it out what I
suggest<00:01:02.770> doing<00:01:02.920> is<00:01:03.190> just<00:01:03.219> breaking<00:01:03.640> it<00:01:03.969> like

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
suggest doing is just breaking it like

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.190 
suggest doing is just breaking it like
this<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:04.750> then<00:01:06.270> pulling<00:01:07.270> it<00:01:07.420> out<00:01:07.540> that<00:01:07.780> way<00:01:07.930> it

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
this and then pulling it out that way it

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.639 
this and then pulling it out that way it
works<00:01:08.439> way<00:01:08.770> better<00:01:09.600> alright<00:01:10.600> so<00:01:10.780> this<00:01:11.259> is<00:01:11.439> what

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
works way better alright so this is what

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.410 
works way better alright so this is what
it<00:01:11.740> looks<00:01:11.920> like<00:01:12.040> it's<00:01:12.250> just<00:01:12.460> a<00:01:12.640> basic<00:01:12.969> black

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420

ahead and i put two layers on and i did

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.510 
ahead and i put two layers on and i did
not<00:02:07.149> apply<00:02:07.389> an<00:02:07.689> eye<00:02:07.869> primer<00:02:08.140> for<00:02:08.920> this<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.399> don't

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
not apply an eye primer for this I don't

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.640 
not apply an eye primer for this I don't
necessarily<00:02:09.880> think<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.780> need<00:02:11.080> an<00:02:11.260> eye<00:02:11.349> primer

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
necessarily think you need an eye primer

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.949 
necessarily think you need an eye primer
unless<00:02:12.099> you<00:02:12.310> do<00:02:12.489> have<00:02:12.700> very<00:02:12.849> oily<00:02:13.209> lids<00:02:13.660> I

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
unless you do have very oily lids I

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.260 
unless you do have very oily lids I
think<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.160> just<00:02:15.190> absolutely<00:02:15.910> beautiful

soiree
that's<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.640> think<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.910> purpose<00:02:22.270> behind<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
that's I think the purpose behind the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.180 
that's I think the purpose behind the
collection<00:02:23.200> because<00:02:23.800> they<00:02:23.950> are<00:02:24.160> very

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
collection because they are very

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.940 
collection because they are very
glittery<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.120> just<00:02:25.480> very<00:02:25.870> fun<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.500> wear<00:02:26.650> on

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
side comparison this is one layer of

side comparison this is one layer of
product<00:02:35.950> this<00:02:36.100> is<00:02:36.160> two<00:02:36.610> layers<00:02:36.880> of<00:02:37.150> product

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.570 
would apply a second layer and I just
applied<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.530> little<00:03:26.890> bit<00:03:27.010> more<00:03:27.190> onto<00:03:27.400> my<00:03:27.520> finger

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
applied a little bit more onto my finger

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.260 
applied a little bit more onto my finger
so<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.570> second<00:03:29.290> layer<00:03:29.700> maybe<00:03:30.700> even<00:03:30.910> a<00:03:31.060> third

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
so a second layer maybe even a third

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.740 
so a second layer maybe even a third
layer<00:03:31.540> you<00:03:32.050> really<00:03:32.290> don't<00:03:32.500> need<00:03:32.680> a<00:03:32.740> lot<00:03:33.010> but<00:03:33.750> if

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
layer you really don't need a lot but if

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.660 
layer you really don't need a lot but if
you<00:03:34.930> want<00:03:35.200> to<00:03:35.320> get<00:03:35.410> a<00:03:35.470> really<00:03:35.830> intense<00:03:36.190> look<00:03:36.490> I

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
you want to get a really intense look I

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.510 
you want to get a really intense look I
definitely<00:03:37.060> would<00:03:37.300> apply<00:03:37.830> another<00:03:38.830> layer<00:03:38.950> one

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
definitely would apply another layer one

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.220 
definitely would apply another layer one
or<00:03:39.610> two<00:03:39.760> more<00:03:39.940> layers<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:40.840> works<00:03:41.020> out<00:03:41.170> a

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
or two more layers and it works out a

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.590 
or two more layers and it works out a
lot<00:03:41.320> better<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:42.550> here<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:42.850> is<00:03:42.880> on<00:03:43.090> my<00:03:43.180> hand<00:03:43.420> and
