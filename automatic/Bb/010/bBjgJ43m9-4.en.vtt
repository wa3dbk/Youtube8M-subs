00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.920
 the first thing you should do nothing to look 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.930
 in the closet and see what I have first 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.480
 good shoes because what 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.680
 you have to think is that is the foot the 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.390
 that will be in contact with the ground 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.800
 therefore something must have between 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.619
 medium and the shoes are 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.930
 essential is to say that they are for 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.960
 you according to your type of tread that is 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.210
 important and that are adapted from the 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.789
 best way possible so you're going to 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.520
 the store you are looking for good advice 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.440
 let her advise that is the first and 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.539
 buy good shoes and the 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.059
 rest is already technical material above all 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:40.550
 I advise you to look for a material that 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.769
 let sweat perspire 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.329
 accumulate how many runners there are out there 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.629
 that go with the cotton shirts 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.269
 sweaty that also weigh much more and that 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.059
 as more technical is the material more 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.209
 easy is that you eliminate sweat and also 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.429
 it's going to be much more comfortable to run 

00:00:55.209 --> 00:01:00.639
 thinks are the focus legs 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:03.709
 so much and I would tell you that gm the 

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:06.170
 hamstrings and quadriceps would be the 

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:07.300
 basic point of Achilles tendon has 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.310
 what to be 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.230
 essential but there is a part that a 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.230
 sometimes we forget that it is the area of â€‹â€‹the 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.320
 back which I would not stop doing 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.210
 obviously focus on the legs 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.160
 that depends a lot on each person there 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.110
 who is impossible to get up by the 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.640
 tomorrow to go running there the one 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.160
 he prefers when he comes home from work 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.440
 go for a run and there are those who are runners 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.180
 nocturnal people who love to go out 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.250
 night maybe because they are calmer 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.690
 there are fewer people or because they really 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.330
 like to go out at night 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.790
 you must choose it, especially the move that 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.160
 I told you to accompany you that is not 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.660
 have a rhythm if they are slow at times 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.330
 the gases that you take a much more rhythm 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.160
 slow while they have a little rhythm and 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.630
 you can follow that safe rhythm that you 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.750
 will go well on the internet there are a lot 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.940
 of lists I would say that I do not advise you 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.130
 I do not advise you to go out without drinking 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.009
 I do not advise you to go out without eating 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.250
 neither has the great one to stride in 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.840
 the granata with or without having drunk three 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.880
 liters of water two cups are 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.709
 enough and above all the equipment 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.580
 keep in mind that the material is 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.580
 indispensable
