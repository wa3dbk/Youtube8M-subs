seven hundred bucks which is probably

the biggest black mark against this

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.299 
the biggest black mark against this
thing<00:00:40.410> especially<00:00:40.620> when<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:40.950> compare<00:00:41.100> it

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
thing especially when you compare it

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.639 
thing especially when you compare it
against<00:00:41.489> something<00:00:41.730> like<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> iPad<00:00:42.649> now

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649

Tegra 2 processor one gigahertz we have

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.510 
Tegra 2 processor one gigahertz we have

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
memory so what what's perhaps most

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.709 
memory so what what's perhaps most
interesting<00:00:53.309> about<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.760> device<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:54.629> we

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
interesting about this device is if we

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.510 
interesting about this device is if we
take<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> quick<00:00:55.020> look<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.379> back<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.860> can

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
take a quick look on the back you can

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.430 
take a quick look on the back you can
see<00:00:56.670> we<00:00:56.789> have<00:00:56.969> stereo<00:00:57.660> cameras<00:00:58.079> here<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.379> you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
see we have stereo cameras here so you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.130 
see we have stereo cameras here so you
can<00:00:58.649> actually<00:00:58.800> shoot<00:00:59.160> 3d<00:00:59.910> video<00:01:00.210> at<00:01:00.449> 1280<00:01:00.899> by

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
can actually shoot 3d video at 1280 by

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.060 
can actually shoot 3d video at 1280 by
720<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:02.039> 720p<00:01:02.670> video<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.809> 3d<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.920> also

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
720 so 720p video in 3d you can also

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.240 
720 so 720p video in 3d you can also
shoot<00:01:05.400> full<00:01:07.490> 1920<00:01:08.490> by<00:01:08.580> 1080p<00:01:09.860> video<00:01:10.860> at<00:01:11.070> 30

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
shoot full 1920 by 1080p video at 30

over here we have an LED flash beside

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.910 
over here we have an LED flash beside
this<00:01:18.090> one<00:01:18.270> now<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.170> build<00:01:19.409> quality<00:01:19.560> is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
this one now the build quality is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.160 
this one now the build quality is
reminiscent<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.759> Nexus<00:01:21.570> 1<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.990> looks

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
reminiscent of the Nexus 1 it looks

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.960 
reminiscent of the Nexus 1 it looks
actually<00:01:22.380> very<00:01:22.680> much<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.159> Nexus<00:01:23.430> 1<00:01:23.610> so

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
actually very much like the Nexus 1 so

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.340 
actually very much like the Nexus 1 so
it<00:01:24.060> looks<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.240> something<00:01:24.600> HTC<00:01:25.080> might<00:01:25.259> have

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
it looks like something HTC might have

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.920 
it looks like something HTC might have
designed<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:26.400> my<00:01:26.549> opinion<00:01:26.970> that's<00:01:27.150> very<00:01:27.570> very

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
designed in my opinion that's very very

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.840 
designed in my opinion that's very very
much<00:01:28.049> not<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.290> bad<00:01:28.470> thing<00:01:28.710> if<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.369> take<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> quick

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
much not a bad thing if we take a quick

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.730 
much not a bad thing if we take a quick
look<00:01:29.909> behind<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.479> little<00:01:30.689> port<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.680> a

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
microphone quick look on the top you

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.530 
microphone quick look on the top you
have<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:26.100> speaker<00:03:26.310> grill<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:27.060> have<00:03:27.090> your<00:03:27.359> power

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
have a speaker grill you have your power

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.840 
have a speaker grill you have your power
and<00:03:27.780> lock<00:03:27.930> button<00:03:28.260> here<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:29.130> have<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.310> 3.5

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
and lock button here you have a 3.5

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.640 
and lock button here you have a 3.5
millimeter<00:03:30.150> headphone<00:03:30.420> jack<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.170> this<00:03:31.560> is

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
millimeter headphone jack and this is

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.840 
millimeter headphone jack and this is
actually<00:03:31.920> where<00:03:32.040> you'll<00:03:32.160> plug<00:03:32.370> in<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.609> charge

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
actually where you'll plug in to charge

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.229 
actually where you'll plug in to charge
so<00:03:33.480> much<00:03:33.750> rather<00:03:34.079> see<00:03:34.380> an<00:03:35.010> integrated<00:03:35.670> you

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
so much rather see an integrated you

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.789 
so much rather see an integrated you
know<00:03:36.329> single<00:03:36.750> port<00:03:36.989> where<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.200> plug<00:03:37.590> in<00:03:37.709> your

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
know single port where you plug in your

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.199 
know single port where you plug in your
micro<00:03:38.070> B<00:03:38.160> USB<00:03:38.549> cable<00:03:38.880> whether<00:03:39.030> you're

micro B USB cable whether you're

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.090 
micro B USB cable whether you're
charging<00:03:39.570> more<00:03:39.690> syncing<00:03:40.109> but<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:40.980> does

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
charging more syncing but it does

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.819 
charging more syncing but it does
include<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.579> little<00:03:41.850> adapter<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.680> use

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
include the little adapter that you use

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.259 
include the little adapter that you use
to<00:03:43.980> charge<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.370> but<00:03:44.430> like<00:03:44.549> I<00:03:44.579> say<00:03:44.790> much<00:03:45.090> rather

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
to charge it but like I say much rather

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.120 
to charge it but like I say much rather
see<00:03:45.540> if<00:03:45.660> you<00:03:45.750> can<00:03:45.870> just<00:03:46.019> plug<00:03:46.500> in<00:03:46.620> on<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.859> micro

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
see if you can just plug in on the micro

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.319 
see if you can just plug in on the micro
B<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.579> charge<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.180> sync<00:03:48.359> it<00:03:48.480> both<00:03:50.329> so

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
B and charge it and sync it both so

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.620 
B and charge it and sync it both so
we'll<00:03:51.390> unlock<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.840> thing<00:03:53.209> we<00:03:54.209> could<00:03:54.359> go<00:03:54.510> back

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
we'll unlock the thing we could go back

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.780 
we'll unlock the thing we could go back
home<00:03:54.930> now<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.829> as<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.190> can<00:03:56.310> see<00:03:56.430> on<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.609> front

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
home now you as you can see on the front

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.759 
home now you as you can see on the front
of<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:56.940> device<00:03:57.150> there<00:03:57.359> are<00:03:57.390> no<00:03:57.630> no<00:03:58.200> buttons<00:03:58.590> to

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
of the device there are no no buttons to

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.559 
of the device there are no no buttons to
speak<00:03:58.980> of<00:03:59.190> that's<00:03:59.670> because<00:03:59.819> all<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.269> buttons

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
speak of that's because all the buttons

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.509 
speak of that's because all the buttons
are<00:04:00.720> actually<00:04:00.959> built<00:04:01.140> into<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.620> honeycomb

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
are actually built into the honeycomb

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.800 
are actually built into the honeycomb
operating<00:04:02.910> system<00:04:03.209> so<00:04:03.329> here<00:04:03.480> we<00:04:03.569> have<00:04:03.690> our

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
operating system so here we have our

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.420 
operating system so here we have our
home<00:04:03.959> button<00:04:04.230> we<00:04:04.709> have<00:04:04.739> our<00:04:04.920> multitasking

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
home button we have our multitasking

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.099 
home button we have our multitasking
button<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:05.880> so<00:04:05.970> we<00:04:06.060> can<00:04:06.180> see<00:04:06.390> recent

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
button and so we can see recent

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.620 
button and so we can see recent
applications<00:04:07.620> have<00:04:07.769> been<00:04:07.829> using<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:09.060> we<00:04:09.510> also

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
applications have been using and we also

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.360 
applications have been using and we also
have<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.840> back<00:04:10.019> button<00:04:10.200> down<00:04:10.440> here<00:04:10.680> if<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.130> want

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
if we go just really quickly go back

into the 3d camcorder mode you can see

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.210 
into the 3d camcorder mode you can see
here<00:04:46.860> a<00:04:46.889> video<00:04:47.160> that<00:04:47.280> we<00:04:47.370> recorded<00:04:47.400> earlier<00:04:49.220> so

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
here a video that we recorded earlier so

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.620 
here a video that we recorded earlier so
you<00:04:50.250> can<00:04:50.430> see<00:04:50.550> playing<00:04:50.790> back<00:04:51.000> in<00:04:51.150> anaglyph<00:04:51.479> you

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
you can see playing back in anaglyph you

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.590 
you can see playing back in anaglyph you
can<00:04:51.780> also<00:04:51.930> play<00:04:52.290> it<00:04:52.410> in<00:04:52.560> left<00:04:53.160> by<00:04:53.280> left<00:04:53.820> then

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
can also play it in left by left then

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.990 
can also play it in left by left then
right<00:04:54.630> side<00:04:55.110> by<00:04:55.260> side<00:04:55.530> so<00:04:56.490> you<00:04:56.580> can<00:04:56.699> kind<00:04:56.970> of
