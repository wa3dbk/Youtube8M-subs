it alright so this is another look at

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.880 
it alright so this is another look at
the<00:05:24.330> clock<00:05:24.600> setup<00:05:24.930> that<00:05:24.990> is<00:05:25.050> used<00:05:25.440> now<00:05:25.650> first

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
the clock setup that is used now first

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.890 
the clock setup that is used now first
off<00:05:26.160> that<00:05:26.460> gameplay<00:05:26.940> only<00:05:27.210> last<00:05:27.390> like<00:05:27.630> four

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
off that gameplay only last like four

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.810 
off that gameplay only last like four
minutes<00:05:28.140> or<00:05:28.320> something<00:05:28.590> like<00:05:28.680> that<00:05:28.740> that<00:05:29.669> was

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
minutes or something like that that was

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.400 
minutes or something like that that was
a<00:05:29.850> really<00:05:30.120> quick<00:05:30.419> game<00:05:30.660> you<00:05:30.840> don't<00:05:31.020> see<00:05:31.230> a<00:05:31.260> lot

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
a really quick game you don't see a lot

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.340 
a really quick game you don't see a lot
of<00:05:31.470> those<00:05:31.650> in<00:05:31.890> coal<00:05:32.100> videos<00:05:32.600> but<00:05:33.600> regardless

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
of those in coal videos but regardless

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.010 
of those in coal videos but regardless
this<00:05:34.770> setup<00:05:35.040> is<00:05:35.310> just<00:05:35.340> fun<00:05:35.790> I<00:05:36.060> think<00:05:36.570> so<00:05:36.780> anyway

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
this setup is just fun I think so anyway

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.260 
this setup is just fun I think so anyway
now<00:05:37.890> I<00:05:37.919> normally<00:05:38.100> don't<00:05:38.580> really<00:05:38.850> use<00:05:38.940> the<00:05:39.030> long

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
now I normally don't really use the long

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.060 
now I normally don't really use the long
barrel<00:05:39.600> though<00:05:39.780> it<00:05:39.900> worked<00:05:40.140> just<00:05:40.440> fine<00:05:40.590> long

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
barrel though it worked just fine long

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.490 
barrel though it worked just fine long
barrel<00:05:41.370> basically<00:05:42.300> extend<00:05:42.810> your<00:05:42.900> range<00:05:43.169> but<00:05:43.440> I

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
barrel basically extend your range but I

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.890 
barrel basically extend your range but I
think<00:05:43.800> like<00:05:43.890> 20%<00:05:44.340> which<00:05:45.210> basically<00:05:45.540> means

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
think like 20% which basically means

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.350 
think like 20% which basically means
that<00:05:46.140> your<00:05:47.040> forehead<00:05:47.520> kill<00:05:47.790> range<00:05:48.000> is<00:05:48.180> also

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
that your forehead kill range is also

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.540 
that your forehead kill range is also
extend<00:05:48.870> about<00:05:49.050> 20%<00:05:49.620> so<00:05:49.740> it's<00:05:49.890> pretty<00:05:50.040> good<00:05:50.160> I

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
extend about 20% so it's pretty good I

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.909 
extend about 20% so it's pretty good I
am<00:05:51.479> NOT<00:05:51.630> a<00:05:51.660> big<00:05:51.810> fan<00:05:51.840> of<00:05:52.050> the<00:05:52.200> extended<00:05:52.590> clip

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
am NOT a big fan of the extended clip

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.340 
am NOT a big fan of the extended clip
though<00:05:53.130> yes<00:05:53.520> it<00:05:54.240> increases<00:05:54.840> your<00:05:54.870> magazine

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
though yes it increases your magazine

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.680 
though yes it increases your magazine
size<00:05:55.620> but<00:05:56.370> it<00:05:56.460> also<00:05:56.640> increases<00:05:57.240> the<00:05:57.479> amount<00:05:57.600> of

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
size but it also increases the amount of

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.090 
size but it also increases the amount of
time<00:05:57.930> that<00:05:57.960> it<00:05:58.140> takes<00:05:58.290> for<00:05:58.530> you<00:05:58.590> to<00:05:58.620> reload

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
time that it takes for you to reload

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.659 
time that it takes for you to reload
your<00:05:59.220> weapon

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
your weapon

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.620 
your weapon
so<00:06:00.540> in<00:06:01.070> 99<00:06:02.070> out<00:06:02.250> of<00:06:02.310> 100<00:06:02.490> cases<00:06:02.790> I<00:06:03.180> usually<00:06:03.479> go

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
so in 99 out of 100 cases I usually go

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.440 
so in 99 out of 100 cases I usually go
for<00:06:03.690> the<00:06:03.870> Fox<00:06:04.169> mag<00:06:04.470> over<00:06:05.370> the<00:06:05.610> extended<00:06:06.090> clip

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
for the Fox mag over the extended clip

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.810 
for the Fox mag over the extended clip
and<00:06:06.660> apart<00:06:07.050> from<00:06:07.110> that<00:06:07.370> the<00:06:08.370> setup<00:06:08.700> is<00:06:08.790> just

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
and apart from that the setup is just

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.380 
and apart from that the setup is just
fine

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
fine

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.820 
fine
actually<00:06:09.750> I<00:06:09.780> would<00:06:09.990> recommend<00:06:10.530> you<00:06:10.620> to<00:06:10.710> give

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
actually I would recommend you to give

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.920 
actually I would recommend you to give
it<00:06:10.919> a<00:06:10.950> go<00:06:11.310> you<00:06:11.700> can<00:06:11.850> of<00:06:11.940> course<00:06:12.000> walk<00:06:12.540> the

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
it a go you can of course walk the

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.810 
it a go you can of course walk the
scorestreaks<00:06:13.650> around<00:06:13.919> if<00:06:14.040> you<00:06:14.130> wants<00:06:14.400> you<00:06:14.550> I

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
scorestreaks around if you wants you I

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.600 
scorestreaks around if you wants you I
would<00:06:15.750> say<00:06:16.020> that<00:06:16.350> I<00:06:16.380> normally<00:06:16.950> use<00:06:16.979> the<00:06:17.280> UAV

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
would say that I normally use the UAV

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.860 
would say that I normally use the UAV
the<00:06:17.700> lightning<00:06:18.000> strike<00:06:18.270> and<00:06:18.450> the<00:06:18.540> stealth

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
the lightning strike and the stealth

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.320 
the lightning strike and the stealth
chopper<00:06:19.140> the<00:06:19.380> most<00:06:19.590> though<00:06:20.520> this<00:06:20.790> setup<00:06:21.030> works

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
chopper the most though this setup works

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.780 
chopper the most though this setup works
fine<00:06:21.570> too<00:06:21.840> so<00:06:21.870> give<00:06:22.350> it<00:06:22.380> a<00:06:22.470> go<00:06:22.620> and<00:06:23.160> with<00:06:23.610> that

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
fine too so give it a go and with that

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.000
