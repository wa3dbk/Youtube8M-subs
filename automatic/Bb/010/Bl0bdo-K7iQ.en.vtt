hey<00:00:04.710> what's<00:00:04.920> up<00:00:05.040> everybody<00:00:05.250> this<00:00:05.430> is<00:00:05.580> DOM<00:00:05.759> and

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
hey what's up everybody this is DOM and

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.670 
hey what's up everybody this is DOM and
today<00:00:06.359> we<00:00:06.629> are<00:00:06.720> checking<00:00:06.930> out<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.109> CD<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.440> tweak

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
today we are checking out a CD a tweak

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.280 
today we are checking out a CD a tweak
called<00:00:07.730> accelerate<00:00:08.730> this<00:00:09.210> allows<00:00:09.780> you<00:00:10.019> to

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
called accelerate this allows you to

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.110 
called accelerate this allows you to
speed<00:00:10.590> up<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.830> animations<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.580> your<00:00:11.849> iOS

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
speed up the animations of your iOS

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.970 
speed up the animations of your iOS
device<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.690> by<00:00:12.960> doing<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.650> actually

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
device and by doing that it actually

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.279 
device and by doing that it actually
gives<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.880> illusion<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.450> your<00:00:15.719> device<00:00:16.020> is

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
gives the illusion that your device is

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.230 
gives the illusion that your device is
running<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.949> lot<00:00:17.130> faster<00:00:17.580> than<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
running a lot faster than it is the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.120 
running a lot faster than it is the
animations<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.810> iOS<00:00:19.109> do<00:00:19.350> slow<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.740> down<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.890> lot

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
animations in iOS do slow it down a lot

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.830 
animations in iOS do slow it down a lot
and<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.460> way<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.670> get<00:00:21.000> rid<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.270> some<00:00:21.810> of

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
and this is a way to get rid of some of

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.140 
and this is a way to get rid of some of
those<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.199> make<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.010> seem<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> lot<00:00:23.310> faster<00:00:23.820> this

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
those and make it seem a lot faster this

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.269 
those and make it seem a lot faster this
is<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.449> rewritten<00:00:25.019> version<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.830> Cydia<00:00:26.099> tweak

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
is a rewritten version of a Cydia tweak

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.710 
is a rewritten version of a Cydia tweak
that<00:00:26.430> came<00:00:26.609> out<00:00:26.789> back<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> while<00:00:27.210> ago<00:00:27.480> called

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
that came out back a while ago called

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.570 
that came out back a while ago called
clock<00:00:28.019> wind<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.619> been<00:00:28.920> completely<00:00:29.310> rebuilt

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
clock wind it's been completely rebuilt

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.759 
clock wind it's been completely rebuilt
from<00:00:30.060> scratch<00:00:30.179> from<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.810> ground<00:00:31.050> up<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.560> does

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
from scratch from the ground up it does

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.639 
from scratch from the ground up it does
have<00:00:32.040> some<00:00:32.070> glitches<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.300> Iowa<00:00:33.660> six<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.410> I

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
have some glitches in Iowa six that I

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.010 
have some glitches in Iowa six that I
have<00:00:34.920> notice<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:35.700> keep<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.210> mind<00:00:36.329> if<00:00:36.840> we

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
have notice so keep that in mind if we

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.930 
have notice so keep that in mind if we
go<00:00:37.170> into<00:00:37.320> our<00:00:37.469> settings<00:00:37.890> app<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.399> we<00:00:38.730> scroll

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
go into our settings app and we scroll

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.580 
go into our settings app and we scroll
down<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> bottom<00:00:39.780> here<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.320> see<00:00:40.440> that

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
down to the bottom here you can see that

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.709 
down to the bottom here you can see that
we<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:40.770> accelerate<00:00:41.430> at<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.820> top<00:00:42.059> tap<00:00:42.570> on

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
we have accelerate at the top tap on

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.450 
we have accelerate at the top tap on
that<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.110> you'll<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.469> presented<00:00:44.040> with<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.250> list

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
that and you'll be presented with a list

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.310 
that and you'll be presented with a list
of<00:00:44.670> options<00:00:44.879> here<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.570> first<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.989> all<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.170> can

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
of options here so first of all we can

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.590 
of options here so first of all we can
enable<00:00:46.649> or<00:00:47.039> disable<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.610> tweak<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.420> can

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
enable or disable the tweak and we can

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.080 
enable or disable the tweak and we can
disable<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.410> tweak<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.920> different<00:00:50.640> portions

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
disable the tweak in different portions

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.180 
disable the tweak in different portions
of<00:00:51.180> iOS<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.199> let's<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.500> go<00:00:52.620> ahead<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.010> enable

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
of iOS so let's just go ahead and enable

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.040 
of iOS so let's just go ahead and enable
it<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.550> give<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.000> shot<00:00:54.270> real<00:00:54.510> quick<00:00:54.719> we<00:00:54.870> can

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
it and give it a shot real quick we can

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.110 
it and give it a shot real quick we can
set<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> acceleration<00:00:56.219> which<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.610> how<00:00:56.760> fast

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
set the acceleration which is how fast

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.150 
set the acceleration which is how fast
it<00:00:57.449> actually<00:00:57.809> operates<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.890> have<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
it actually operates and you have a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.549 
it actually operates and you have a
bunch<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.640> different<00:00:59.969> levels<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.109> speed

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
bunch of different levels for the speed

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.160 
bunch of different levels for the speed
that<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.340> decreases<00:01:02.969> or<00:01:03.300> increases<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
that it decreases or increases the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.539 
that it decreases or increases the
animation<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:04.979> all<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> way<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.339> at<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.460> top

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
animation so all the way up at the top

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.670 
animation so all the way up at the top
here<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.510> fastest<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:07.350> at<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
here we have the fastest and then at the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.800 
here we have the fastest and then at the
very<00:01:07.710> bottom<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.400> have<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.640> slowest<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.540> we'll

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
very bottom we have the slowest so we'll

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.600 
very bottom we have the slowest so we'll
leave<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.020> at<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> top<00:01:10.380> here<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.650> as<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.490> can

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
leave it at the top here and as you can

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.160 
leave it at the top here and as you can
see<00:01:11.760> when<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:11.970> tap<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.420> button<00:01:12.479> it's

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
see when I tap this button it's

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.260 
see when I tap this button it's
immediately<00:01:13.680> taking<00:01:14.340> effect<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.939> let's<00:01:14.970> go

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
immediately taking effect so let's go

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.940 
immediately taking effect so let's go
ahead<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.450> exit<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> Settings<00:01:16.530> app<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.890> I'll

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
ahead and exit the Settings app and I'll

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.039 
ahead and exit the Settings app and I'll
show<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.189> just<00:01:17.220> how<00:01:17.430> fast<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:18.060> looks<00:01:18.360> so

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
show you just how fast this looks so

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.749 
show you just how fast this looks so
just<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.680> things<00:01:20.220> open<00:01:20.640> up

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
just like that things open up

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:21.710 
just like that things open up
immediately

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
immediately

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.840 
immediately
everything<00:01:22.439> launches<00:01:22.979> pretty<00:01:23.640> much

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
everything launches pretty much

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.060 
everything launches pretty much
instantly<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.259> does<00:01:25.560> make<00:01:25.770> your<00:01:25.890> device

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
instantly so it does make your device

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.100 
instantly so it does make your device
seem<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.850> lot<00:01:27.000> faster<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.780> do

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
seem like it's a lot faster but you do

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.660 
seem like it's a lot faster but you do
still<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.619> wait<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.189> things<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.579> load

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
still have to wait for things to load

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.179 
still have to wait for things to load
like<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> App<00:01:30.479> Store<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.079> technically<00:01:31.860> it

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
like the App Store so technically it

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.190 
like the App Store so technically it
doesn't<00:01:32.640> make<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.850> faster<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.810> gets<00:01:33.990> rid

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
doesn't make it faster but it gets rid

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.380 
doesn't make it faster but it gets rid
of<00:01:34.229> all<00:01:34.500> those<00:01:34.619> laggy<00:01:34.979> animations<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.850> iOS

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
of all those laggy animations that iOS

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.510 
of all those laggy animations that iOS
sometimes<00:01:37.170> has<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.100> said<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.400> can

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
sometimes has and like I said you can

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.850 
sometimes has and like I said you can
slow<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.790> down<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.420> we<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.990> go<00:01:40.200> back<00:01:40.470> down<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
slow it down to we can go back down to

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.730 
slow it down to we can go back down to
your<00:01:41.700> history<00:01:42.570> teacher<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.110> that'll<00:01:43.380> slow<00:01:43.619> it

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
your history teacher and that'll slow it

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.100 
your history teacher and that'll slow it
down<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.920> little<00:01:44.159> bit<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.869> see

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
down a little bit and as you can see

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.050 
down a little bit and as you can see
it's<00:01:46.320> kind<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.649> dragging<00:01:47.189> along<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:47.759> and

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
it's kind of dragging along there and

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.120 
it's kind of dragging along there and
I'm<00:01:48.600> not<00:01:48.750> sure<00:01:48.960> if<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.229> would<00:01:49.350> want<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.680> kind

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
I'm not sure if you would want that kind

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.630 
I'm not sure if you would want that kind
of<00:01:50.570> slow<00:01:51.570> lag<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.380> your<00:01:52.619> device<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.159> if<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.430> do

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
of slow lag on your device but if you do

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.969 
of slow lag on your device but if you do
you<00:01:53.909> know<00:01:54.000> much<00:01:54.240> power<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.229> as<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.890> can

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
you know much power to you so as you can

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.679 
you know much power to you so as you can
see<00:01:56.189> here<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.759> said<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:57.090> do<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> bunch

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
see here like I said we do have a bunch

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.630 
see here like I said we do have a bunch
of<00:01:57.869> different<00:01:58.049> options<00:01:58.649> here<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.430> if<00:01:59.520> we

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
of different options here and so if we

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.219 
of different options here and so if we
go<00:01:59.850> ahead<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.119> set<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> fastest<00:02:01.020> here

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
go ahead and set it to the fastest here

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.480 
go ahead and set it to the fastest here
you<00:02:01.439> can<00:02:01.590> definitely<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.340> makes

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
you can definitely see that it makes

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.090 
you can definitely see that it makes
sure<00:02:02.640> device<00:02:02.939> seem<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.420> lot<00:02:03.750> snappier<00:02:04.619> than<00:02:04.979> it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
sure device seem a lot snappier than it

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.830 
sure device seem a lot snappier than it
actually<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:06.000> really<00:02:06.360> gives<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
actually is it really gives you the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.449 
actually is it really gives you the
illusion<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.259> your<00:02:07.469> device<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.740> running

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
illusion that your device is running

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.969 
illusion that your device is running
super<00:02:09.360> fast<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.989> like<00:02:10.170> overclocked<00:02:10.770> or

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
super fast and like overclocked or

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.500 
super fast and like overclocked or
something<00:02:11.310> like<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:12.060> go<00:02:12.209> ahead<00:02:12.420> and

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
something like that so go ahead and

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.970 
something like that so go ahead and
check<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.690> out<00:02:12.810> it's<00:02:13.050> called<00:02:13.230> accelerate<00:02:13.770> it

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
check it out it's called accelerate it

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.490 
check it out it's called accelerate it
