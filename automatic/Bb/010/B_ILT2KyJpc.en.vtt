and white or a color balance and I will

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.480 
and white or a color balance and I will
go<00:01:53.340> through<00:01:53.369> saturation<00:01:55.100> let's<00:01:56.100> not<00:01:56.250> change

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
go through saturation let's not change

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.819 
go through saturation let's not change
it<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.840> then<00:01:58.200> change<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.799> to

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.469 
it for you and you can then change it to
AA<00:01:58.920> percentage<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.729> saturation<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.390> you

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
AA percentage of saturation that you

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.690 
AA percentage of saturation that you
want<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:01.920> tweak<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.250> quite<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.520> bit
