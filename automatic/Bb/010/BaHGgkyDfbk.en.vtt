on<00:04:09.360> this<00:04:09.510> is<00:04:09.720> 250<00:04:10.560> which<00:04:10.890> means<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.880> can

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
on this is 250 which means you can

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.390 
on this is 250 which means you can
pretty<00:04:12.390> much<00:04:12.480> couple<00:04:12.930> this<00:04:13.110> with<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.680> fastest

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
pretty much couple this with the fastest

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.599 
pretty much couple this with the fastest
Intel<00:04:15.030> or<00:04:15.299> and<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.290> CPU<00:04:16.919> that<00:04:16.979> is<00:04:17.250> on<00:04:17.489> the

Intel or and the CPU that is on the

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.430 
Intel or and the CPU that is on the
market<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.000> it<00:04:18.120> should<00:04:18.269> have<00:04:18.359> no<00:04:18.690> problem

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
market and it should have no problem

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.830 
market and it should have no problem
keeping<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:20.070> cool<00:04:20.340> even<00:04:20.880> if<00:04:21.390> you<00:04:21.630> are

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
keeping it cool even if you are

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.029 
keeping it cool even if you are
overclocking<00:04:22.650> it

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
overclocking it

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.830 
overclocking it
now<00:04:23.340> as<00:04:23.669> for<00:04:24.120> socket

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
now as for socket

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.379 
now as for socket
compatibility<00:04:25.440> well<00:04:25.889> it<00:04:26.310> pretty<00:04:26.610> much<00:04:26.850> fits

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
compatibility well it pretty much fits

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.350

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.820 
install another fan on the other side
just<00:04:35.820> remember<00:04:36.300> that<00:04:36.419> when<00:04:36.630> you<00:04:36.870> do<00:04:37.230> to<00:04:37.590> have

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
just remember that when you do to have

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.760 
just remember that when you do to have
it<00:04:38.010> in<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.639> same<00:04:39.210> direction<00:04:39.630> of<00:04:40.110> flow<00:04:40.470> as<00:04:40.710> the

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
it in the same direction of flow as the

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.490 
it in the same direction of flow as the
other<00:04:41.370> ones<00:04:41.669> we<00:04:42.240> have<00:04:42.419> listen<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.900> fans<00:04:43.110> at

other ones we have listen to the fans at

00:04:43.500 --> 00:05:14.870 
other ones we have listen to the fans at
maximum<00:04:44.310> speed

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.690 

this<00:05:15.880> is<00:05:16.210> an<00:05:16.390> outstanding<00:05:17.070> CPU<00:05:18.070> air<00:05:18.280> cooler

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
this is an outstanding CPU air cooler

this is an outstanding CPU air cooler
one<00:05:19.090> of<00:05:19.420> the<00:05:19.600> very<00:05:20.080> best

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
one of the very best

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.940 
one of the very best
it<00:05:21.130> looks<00:05:21.490> amazing<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.900> build<00:05:23.170> quality<00:05:23.350> is

exceptional it performs really well and

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.470 
exceptional it performs really well and
it's<00:05:26.650> quiet<00:05:27.070> now<00:05:27.460> if<00:05:27.550> that<00:05:27.669> being<00:05:27.940> said<00:05:28.210> why

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
it's quiet now if that being said why

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.850 
it's quiet now if that being said why
would<00:05:28.630> you<00:05:28.660> go<00:05:28.870> with<00:05:29.020> a<00:05:29.140> relatively<00:05:29.590> expensive

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
would you go with a relatively expensive

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.460 
would you go with a relatively expensive

perform really really well well some

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.400 
perform really really well well some
people<00:05:39.190> want<00:05:39.460> to<00:05:39.580> install<00:05:40.150> it<00:05:40.330> and<00:05:40.450> forget<00:05:41.230> it

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
and that's what these cpu air coolers

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.130 
and that's what these cpu air coolers
are<00:05:44.350> all<00:05:44.950> about<00:05:45.940> provided<00:05:46.600> of<00:05:46.690> course<00:05:46.720> that

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
are all about provided of course that

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.140 
are all about provided of course that
you<00:05:47.470> have<00:05:47.500> excellent<00:05:48.040> case<00:05:48.430> ventilation<00:05:48.730> and

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
you have excellent case ventilation and

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.690 
you have excellent case ventilation and
you<00:05:49.540> have<00:05:49.720> filters<00:05:50.380> on<00:05:50.620> your<00:05:50.890> case<00:05:51.130> so<00:05:51.610> you

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
you have filters on your case so you

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.360 
you have filters on your case so you
don't<00:05:51.970> have<00:05:52.210> to<00:05:52.419> deal<00:05:52.570> with<00:05:52.780> dust<00:05:53.230> in<00:05:53.500> all<00:05:54.070> of

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
don't have to deal with dust in all of

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
the fins advanced local coolers still

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.430 
the fins advanced local coolers still
have<00:05:57.220> the<00:05:57.370> potential<00:05:57.640> of<00:05:57.940> leaking<00:05:58.660> liquid<00:05:59.229> and

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
have the potential of leaking liquid and

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.770 
have the potential of leaking liquid and
I<00:05:59.500> think<00:05:59.770> that's<00:06:00.070> what<00:06:00.610> it<00:06:00.760> hurts<00:06:00.970> some<00:06:01.450> people

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
I think that's what it hurts some people

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.620 
I think that's what it hurts some people
