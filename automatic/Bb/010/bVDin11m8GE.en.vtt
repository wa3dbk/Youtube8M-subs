00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
the outside and if anything I thought he

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.029

looks<00:00:17.369> sharper<00:00:17.760> than<00:00:17.850> he's<00:00:18.000> then<00:00:18.449> he's<00:00:18.600> uh

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
looks sharper than he's then he's uh

you think it's kind of turning into a
bit<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.340> need<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.900> their<00:01:15.900> now<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.110> get<00:01:16.350> rid<00:01:16.470> of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
bit of a need of their now to get rid of

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.789 
the ball as soon as you get it that
really<00:01:18.600> does<00:01:18.720> get<00:01:18.930> ahead<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.320> team<00:01:19.530> building

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
really does get ahead of a team building

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.359 
really does get ahead of a team building
that<00:01:19.920> play

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
that play

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.870 
that play
yeah<00:01:20.520> well<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:21.750> thing<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:22.400> teams<00:01:23.400> mostly

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
yeah well the thing is teams mostly

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.120 
yeah well the thing is teams mostly
spent<00:01:24.240> more<00:01:24.360> time<00:01:24.420> defending<00:01:24.950> if<00:01:25.950> you're

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
spent more time defending if you're

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.380 
spent more time defending if you're
defending<00:01:26.369> less<00:01:26.670> points<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.060> puts<00:01:27.240> less

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
defending less points it puts less

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.840 
defending less points it puts less
pressure<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.810> your<00:01:27.990> attack<00:01:28.430> so<00:01:29.430> it'll<00:01:29.579> be<00:01:29.670> less

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
pressure on your attack so it'll be less

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.490 
pressure on your attack so it'll be less
need<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.180> those<00:01:30.840> pressure<00:01:31.170> passes<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:33.500> you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
need for those pressure passes but you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.170 
need for those pressure passes but you
need<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.829> be<00:01:34.920> able<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.159> now<00:01:35.280> opportunities<00:01:36.000> you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
need to be able to now opportunities you

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.910 
need to be able to now opportunities you
only<00:01:36.299> get<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.630> many<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.930> game<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.470> you're

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
only get so many a game and you're

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.950 
only get so many a game and you're
finding<00:01:38.189> those<00:01:38.970> sweepers<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.630> are<00:01:39.720> coming

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
finding those sweepers that are coming

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.069

around<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.259> back<00:01:41.119> their<00:01:42.119> skill<00:01:42.479> level<00:01:42.780> has<00:01:42.930> to

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
around the back their skill level has to

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.109 
around the back their skill level has to
be<00:01:43.229> at<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> level<00:01:43.740> where<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.700> go<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.909> null

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
be at a level where you go to null

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.440 
be at a level where you go to null
situations<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.049> only<00:01:46.200> get<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> couple<00:01:46.439> so
