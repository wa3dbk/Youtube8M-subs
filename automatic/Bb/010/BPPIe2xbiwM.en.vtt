started which is called a panasonic etha

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.680 
started which is called a panasonic etha
so<00:06:47.680> i<00:06:47.889> would<00:06:48.160> say<00:06:48.310> join<00:06:50.520> here<00:06:51.520> we<00:06:51.639> go<00:06:51.790> I'm<00:06:52.090> ready

so i would say join here we go I'm ready
and<00:06:53.940> now<00:06:54.940> we'll<00:06:54.970> retrieve<00:06:55.600> data<00:06:55.990> from<00:06:56.200> the

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
and now we'll retrieve data from the

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.670 
and now we'll retrieve data from the
server<00:06:56.650> and<00:06:57.010> we<00:06:57.639> try<00:06:57.820> to<00:06:57.880> build<00:06:58.680> the

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 
server and we try to build the

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.620 
server and we try to build the
difference<00:07:00.070> the<00:07:00.490> architecture<00:07:01.120> so<00:07:01.479> that

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
difference the architecture so that

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.379 
difference the architecture so that
several<00:07:02.139> people<00:07:02.169> can<00:07:02.740> play<00:07:02.860> together<00:07:03.280> so<00:07:04.240> it's

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:04.389 
several people can play together so it's

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:09.100 
several people can play together so it's
now<00:07:04.510> loading

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.360 

to<00:07:09.650> the<00:07:09.770> game

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.550 

right<00:07:12.940> and<00:07:13.240> then<00:07:13.600> the<00:07:13.870> money<00:07:14.050> people<00:07:14.290> can

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 
right and then the money people can

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:24.230 
right and then the money people can
start<00:07:15.070> the<00:07:15.190> rice

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.800 

it's<00:07:24.750> probably<00:07:24.870> have<00:07:25.110> to<00:07:25.169> go<00:07:25.259> back<00:07:25.440> to<00:07:25.650> when<00:07:26.810> so

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:27.810 
it's probably have to go back to when so

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.920 
it's probably have to go back to when so
this<00:07:28.110> is<00:07:28.259> for<00:07:28.830> networking<00:07:29.789> and<00:07:30.090> for<00:07:30.449> gaming

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:30.930 
this is for networking and for gaming

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.469 
this is for networking and for gaming
the<00:07:31.650> Pacific<00:07:32.069> you<00:07:32.160> that<00:07:32.280> this<00:07:32.400> office<00:07:32.880> is<00:07:33.090> to

play together to second gate a different

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.620 
play together to second gate a different
places<00:07:37.130> so<00:07:38.130> what<00:07:38.639> year<00:07:38.849> are<00:07:38.910> connect<00:07:39.509> with

offering smart views of her in the
future<00:07:41.130> is<00:07:41.669> so<00:07:42.180> networking<00:07:42.389> like<00:07:43.169> that<00:07:43.380> one

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:43.590 
future is so networking like that one

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:47.719 
future is so networking like that one
but<00:07:44.400> also<00:07:45.050> social<00:07:46.050> networking<00:07:46.740> and<00:07:46.889> also<00:07:47.520> the
