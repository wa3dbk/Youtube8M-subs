00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.230
 the magnifying glass 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.240
 AndrÃ© Carvajal today will show us 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.200
 how at a given moment with a 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.080
 butterflies we can start as the 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.230
 base so that after a wasp we 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.710
 helps control worms in the 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.710
 fruits 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.790
 Andrew 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.700
 here we have this ladle cited 5 grams 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.739
 butterfly drugs appointment eggs 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.650
 butterflies and before we are going to make a voice 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.650
 butterfly on wheat on wheat ok 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:52.470
 how long are we going to do here here what 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.470
 We will leave 24 days 24 days 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.080
 we take all those granites of 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.940
 wheat and we bring them here that are already 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.670
 infected at parties already has the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.850
 animalito the entity has 24 days 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.760
 the butterfly hatches 30 days 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.880
 the 30 days then at 24 days what 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.670
 we bring and what we do we take what 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.320
 we are going to uncover not then what 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.620
 we do is 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.580
 that wheat we fill these are you 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.229
 trays if these trays with that 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.370
 already infested wheat if they are doing 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.930
 polyps and is of them are at 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.780
 butterflies and they are coming out 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.460
 Of course, there are six of us 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.690
 days for those explosions these 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.210
 we put here 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.070
 at 30 days she already starts today I want 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.650
 and butterflies and it's already full of butterfly 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.840
 this already burst then and this 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.009
 is that rivers around here this 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.229
 this is the jar where we are going to 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.220
 collect the butterflies and where they 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.220
 they will place the eggs 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.330
 we also have 5 trays with 10 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.280
 kilos of wheat infested already then to 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.140
 the 30 days already burst the 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.220
 butterflies how many we have more or less 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.250
 for each tray in each tray we 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.260
 so you can put it in each cabinet 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.930
 you have to give us an egg gram 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.239
 daily 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.700
 of production are roughly how many 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:23.349
 Butterflies are about ten thousand ten 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.799
 a thousand butterflies here will be how much 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:30.879
 good time since they have already fallen 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:34.359
 here yes they fell today today we left it 24 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:36.730
 hours if at 24 hours we come and we 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:39.780
 We take these butterflies to the place where 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.780
 we are going to separate 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:49.490
 all we are going to do is separate 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.490
 let's learn this extract 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.810
 and he goes on strategies because like the 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.170
 butterfly we jump into powder that can be 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.840
 harm to us then we learn to 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.890
 do this operation which is to sweep the 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.890
 eggs from the sides 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.280
 there are the little butterfly 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.950
 We are not going to empty here in that colander 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.950
 and we will serve it 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.200
 and we go back to the pot there we have 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.120
 the little eggs then what are we going 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.230
 to do is to clean the delicious ones 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.230
 let's throw in a bag 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.549
 Y 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.560
 we took them and we're going to forgive 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.170
 our on top and by ronald how much 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.690
 time will not be here here we will 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.520
 have four days four days yes from 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.260
 this place where we go to the 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.730
 four winds we already took them from there 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:00.459
 from the porrÃ³n if we clean them well and 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.800
 we are going to store them in the angel that 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:06.400
 what we do is have it already marcadito 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.130
 his life referenced to and deliver it 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.000
 to agriculture to the farmer to the 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.640
 how many days do you leave at 8-10 at 8 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.280
 days we already leave here a wasp 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:22.240
 a wasp once and this wasp is going to 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.370
 Search eggs butterfly butterfly 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.700
 of which she already knows because that 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:31.000
 food of her I want it the 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.700
 opportunity pedagogically that the 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.050
 biological issue begins to replace 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.070
 the chemists thank you so much andrÃ©s 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.070
 good for now 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.439
 he gives a tantrum
