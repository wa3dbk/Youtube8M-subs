usually<00:00:01.620> people<00:00:01.979> who<00:00:02.070> put<00:00:02.310> a<00:00:02.340> v8<00:00:02.730> in<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:02.970> miata

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
usually people who put a v8 in the miata

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.210 
usually people who put a v8 in the miata
aren't<00:00:03.780> too<00:00:03.899> concerned<00:00:04.049> about<00:00:04.350> gas<00:00:04.740> mileage

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
aren't too concerned about gas mileage

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.909 
aren't too concerned about gas mileage
but<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:05.910> was<00:00:06.089> curious<00:00:06.359> about<00:00:07.109> what<00:00:07.529> mine<00:00:07.740> was

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
but I was curious about what mine was

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.640 
but I was curious about what mine was
getting<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.690> maybe<00:00:09.690> what<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.019> potential<00:00:10.320> was

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
getting and maybe what the potential was

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.100 
getting and maybe what the potential was
so<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.550> happened<00:00:12.030> on<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.150> little<00:00:12.389> gizmo<00:00:12.809> called

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
so I happened on a little gizmo called

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.230 
so I happened on a little gizmo called
an<00:00:13.320> MPEG<00:00:13.710> we<00:00:14.009> know<00:00:14.070> or<00:00:14.309> at<00:00:14.400> least<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.820> guess

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
an MPEG we know or at least I guess

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.570 
an MPEG we know or at least I guess
that's<00:00:15.450> how<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.630> pronounce<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.580> since

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
that's how you pronounce it and since

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.480 
that's how you pronounce it and since
i've<00:00:17.730> been<00:00:17.760> using<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.330> i<00:00:18.420> think<00:00:18.980> my<00:00:19.980> mileage<00:00:20.369> is

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
i've been using it i think my mileage is

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.759 
i've been using it i think my mileage is
probably<00:00:20.850> improved<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.630> little<00:00:21.720> bit<00:00:21.990> over<00:00:22.260> what

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
probably improved a little bit over what

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.740 
probably improved a little bit over what
i<00:00:22.800> would<00:00:23.100> typically<00:00:23.519> get<00:00:23.789> because<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.510> thing

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
i would typically get because this thing

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.380 
i would typically get because this thing
it's<00:00:24.990> real<00:00:25.980> easy<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.310> get<00:00:26.550> into<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:27.090> at<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
it's real easy to get into it at the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.150 
it's real easy to get into it at the
stop<00:00:27.599> lights<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:28.800> now<00:00:28.949> i<00:00:28.980> got

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
stop lights and so on so now i got

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.730 
stop lights and so on so now i got
something<00:00:29.580> else<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.849> kind<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.439> kind<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.590> take

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
something else to kind of kind of take

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.139 
something else to kind of kind of take
my<00:00:31.890> attention<00:00:32.309> away<00:00:32.399> from<00:00:32.550> trying<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.000> beat

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
my attention away from trying to beat

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.610 
my attention away from trying to beat
the<00:00:33.180> other<00:00:33.390> guy<00:00:33.600> out<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.899> speed<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
the other guy out of the speed that the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.430 
the other guy out of the speed that the
stoplight<00:00:35.520> not<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.910> that's<00:00:36.000> not<00:00:36.239> fun<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.350> he

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
stoplight not that that's not fun and he

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.139 
stoplight not that that's not fun and he
had<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.620> give<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.800> an<00:00:37.860> idea<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.340> how<00:00:39.000> it's

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
had to give you an idea of how it's

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.290 
had to give you an idea of how it's
doing<00:00:39.950> this<00:00:40.950> tank<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.550> example<00:00:42.000> I've<00:00:42.120> got

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
doing this tank for example I've got

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.479 
doing this tank for example I've got
about<00:00:42.480> two<00:00:42.660> hundred<00:00:42.719> sixteen<00:00:43.379> miles<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.399> you

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
about two hundred sixteen miles and you

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.040 
about two hundred sixteen miles and you
can<00:00:44.610> see<00:00:44.820> where<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> gauge<00:00:45.660> but<00:00:45.960> an

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
can see where it is on the gauge but an

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.220 
can see where it is on the gauge but an
eighth<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.350> tank<00:00:46.530> or<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.860> left<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.399> it

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
eighth of a tank or so left in it

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.700 
eighth of a tank or so left in it
according<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.160> Guino<00:00:50.460> well<00:00:50.850> it's

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
according to the to the Guino well it's

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.540 
according to the to the Guino well it's
got<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:53.219> gotten<00:00:53.820> 22-point<00:00:54.660> 37<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:56.219> tank

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
got it's gotten 22-point 37 on this tank

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.170 
got it's gotten 22-point 37 on this tank
and<00:00:57.300> over<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> total<00:00:58.590> mileage<00:00:58.879> not<00:00:59.879> just<00:01:00.059> this

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and over a total mileage not just this

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.340 
and over a total mileage not just this
tank<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.570> against<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.809> one<00:01:00.960> before<00:01:01.109> two

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
three hundred and ninety-two miles I

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.030 
three hundred and ninety-two miles I
want<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> just<00:01:04.110> sort<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.350> go<00:01:04.500> through<00:01:04.530> some<00:01:04.949> of

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
want to just sort of go through some of

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.210 
want to just sort of go through some of
the<00:01:05.129> settings<00:01:05.339> here<00:01:06.740> this<00:01:07.740> will<00:01:07.890> give<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.130> an

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the settings here this will give you an

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.039 
the settings here this will give you an
instant<00:01:08.520> readout<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.909> what<00:01:09.180> you're<00:01:09.540> what

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
instant readout of what you're what

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.030 
instant readout of what you're what
you're<00:01:10.080> getting<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:12.110> this<00:01:13.110> gives<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.680> readout

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
you're getting and this gives a readout

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.749 
you're getting and this gives a readout
of<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.310> current<00:01:14.930> MPG<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:15.960> think<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.549> way<00:01:17.700> it

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
of the current MPG I think the way it

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.310 
of the current MPG I think the way it
appears<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.210> working<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> mileage

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
appears to be working is the mileage

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.320 
appears to be working is the mileage
since<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.280> started<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.150> go<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
since you started it so if you go to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.179 
since you started it so if you go to
start<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.380> garage<00:01:22.500> take<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.040> out<00:01:23.159> and

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
start it in the garage take it out and

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.530 
start it in the garage take it out and
make<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.400> short<00:01:23.729> trip<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:24.180> will<00:01:24.270> give<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
make a short trip it will give you the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.719 
make a short trip it will give you the
mileage<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.320> trip<00:01:25.619> mind<00:01:26.340> running

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
mileage for that trip mind running

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.200 
mileage for that trip mind running
currently<00:01:27.090> around<00:01:27.390> between<00:01:27.900> 20<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.439> 22

fuel capacity i think i put in 11.8 or
12.8<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.500> it<00:01:46.500> could<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:47.100> going

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
12.8 in it and it could just be going
