00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.290 
this is an instructional video on

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.650 
this is an instructional video on
grafting<00:00:07.290> together<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.580> garter<00:00:09.090> stitch<00:00:09.300> ends

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
grafting together to garter stitch ends

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.950 
grafting together to garter stitch ends
I<00:00:10.490> have<00:00:11.490> here<00:00:11.700> my<00:00:11.820> little<00:00:11.910> sample<00:00:12.240> piece<00:00:12.450> it's

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
I have here my little sample piece it's

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.550 
I have here my little sample piece it's
a<00:00:13.080> strap<00:00:13.500> of<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.799> little<00:00:13.980> baby<00:00:14.160> jumper<00:00:14.639> and

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:15.560 
a strap of a little baby jumper and

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.560 
a strap of a little baby jumper and
we're<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.710> graph<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:16.920> together<00:00:17.570> so

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
we're going to graph it together so

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.269 
we're going to graph it together so
first<00:00:19.410> thing<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.560> want<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.800> do<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.070> make<00:00:20.250> sure

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
first thing you want to do is make sure

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.400 
first thing you want to do is make sure
that<00:00:20.460> both<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.119> sides<00:00:21.359> are<00:00:21.720> finished<00:00:22.170> on

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
that both of the sides are finished on

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.370 
that both of the sides are finished on
the<00:00:23.039> right<00:00:23.310> side<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.600> has<00:00:24.779> been<00:00:24.990> fish<00:00:25.230> on

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the right side so this has been fish on

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.200 
the right side so this has been fish on
the<00:00:25.470> right<00:00:25.590> side<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.949> then<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.730> top<00:00:26.970> one's

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
the right side and then this top one's

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.700 
the right side and then this top one's
been<00:00:27.390> finished<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.900> right<00:00:28.019> side<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.410> I'm

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
been finished on the right side and I'm

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.040 
been finished on the right side and I'm
putting<00:00:29.310> them<00:00:29.400> essentially<00:00:29.939> wrong<00:00:30.720> sides

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
putting them essentially wrong sides

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.190 
putting them essentially wrong sides
together<00:00:31.320> when<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.189> look<00:00:32.369> at<00:00:32.489> them<00:00:32.610> like<00:00:32.759> this

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
together when you look at them like this

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.639 
together when you look at them like this
and<00:00:34.430> so<00:00:35.430> here<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:35.640> go<00:00:36.170> first<00:00:37.170> thing<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.469> do

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
and so here we go first thing you do

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.100 
and so here we go first thing you do
with<00:00:38.250> any<00:00:38.610> grafting<00:00:39.090> stitches<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:39.750> first

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
with any grafting stitches you do first

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.760 
with any grafting stitches you do first
to<00:00:40.559> set<00:00:41.250> up<00:00:41.340> stitches<00:00:41.840> with<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.170> method

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
to set up stitches with this method

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.680 
to set up stitches with this method
you're<00:00:43.950> going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.250> two<00:00:44.520> pearls<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.360> first

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
you're going to do two pearls so first

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.569 
you're going to do two pearls so first
win<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> pearl<00:00:46.579> and<00:00:47.579> leave<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.879> on<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:49.579> then

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
win a pearl and leave it on and then

win a pearl and leave it on and then
we're<00:00:50.670> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> purl<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.690> leave<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:53.660> now

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
we're going to purl and leave it on now

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.189 
we're going to purl and leave it on now
the<00:00:55.020> rest<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.719> stitches<00:00:57.719> are<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> same

the rest of the stitches are the same

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.729 
the rest of the stitches are the same
and<00:00:58.670> you'll<00:00:59.670> use<00:00:59.910> the<00:00:59.940> knitting<00:01:00.359> mantra<00:01:00.870> knit

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
and you'll use the knitting mantra knit

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.969 
and you'll use the knitting mantra knit
purl<00:01:01.949> knit<00:01:02.070> purl<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.510> simple<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.049> so
