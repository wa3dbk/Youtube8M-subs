00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.150
 this is the top 100 of video games 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.150
 Favorite spector 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.750
 number 2 100 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.920
 espn masters job and mack snow brothers 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.200
 70 I'm sorry I could not decide for one 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.480
 of these games and I did not want to stop 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.599
 mention the ones so I put them in 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.699
 forces in the number 100 speed masters and 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.770
 they carry mac games are tremendously 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.320
 simple but that in his time was 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.420
 the most remarkable thing in platform ers in the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.970
 angels are games that the design of 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.860
 levels shines more can not be 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.440
 Simple mechanics and eliminate enemies 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.989
 small all the way and face 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.330
 to a boss at the end of the road but 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.790
 full of creativity in all said 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.530
 It really makes me cruel that 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.540
 people catalog them as games 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.760
 generic since I really believe that 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.879
 can teach new generations what 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.559
 which is a good design of snow levels 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.659
 brothers is a classic that never 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.540
 age is a game terribly 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.760
 addictive with a unique gameplay 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.220
 that someone could hardly 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.409
 successfully replicate both the design 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.270
 strange of the characters the graphics 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.969
 bizarre the way you collect 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.870
 super original power I think ever 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:22.640
 will die 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.760
 my memories and how about my games 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.830
 favorites and I hope one day to make a 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.950
 pleasure you to speak as it should be 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.750
 this game and finally efe 0 is one of 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.270
 the concepts that I've always wanted to see 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.030
 more in racing video games the go to 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.250
 super speed all the time something that 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.200
 we can only see in the fantasies to 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.670
 Although I really like the super 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.250
 nintendo and it's a classic 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.860
 I prefer the Nintendo 64 since this 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.600
 game was born to be done in 3-d he did not 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.790
 is higher up on my list simply 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.100
 because I think it still does not perfect 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.590
 the formula how to make this game 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.510
 entertained for hours like a mario kart 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.580
 but when I did, believe me 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.580
 will win a position in my favorites 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.730
