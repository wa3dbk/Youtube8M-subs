 they know what they download they just spend it 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.950
 to memory and when they have passed 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.620
 They plug their phone in order to 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.330
 start with the installation we are going to 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.440
 enter fast boot mode as you know 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.670
 they should already have a tour 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.260
 personalized and therefore equal him 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.629
 phone with the bolus has unlocked 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.309
 to avoid mistakes and then we're going to 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.309
 enter what is to the recovery menu 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.050
 here I have recovery and win and it is 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.650
 a very good recommended stock and we 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.570
 let's go 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.020
 leave him under the cricket to 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.050
 that can be distinguished here we are in 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.880
 the plant what is his 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.790
 the route we are going to give to the section 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.660
 of cb white and advanced life and 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:44.060
 we select kalbit data case cache 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.060
 ih systems and we give you here in Uruguay 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.400
 and we hope that every time you will not notice much 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.280
 the process the truth 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.460
 here we talk in bar bar we give you after 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.870
 is installed and equipment as we select 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.810
 the round as you see is that the usp of 5.1 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:08.679
 in the latest version we put in who 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:12.610
 love if we select the apps and the 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.580
 file for the rut for said rom and 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.190
 we only give it in slide 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.780
 We hope to finish the installation and 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.440
 I tell you this rom is highly recommended 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.140
 It's very fast and it's very stable and the 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.800
 duration is equal to or greater than the rom 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.390
 stock leaving the boy point 0.2 or the 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.390
 4.4 point 4 but this is based on 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.390
 5.1.1 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.780
 you already want to upload this tutorial but 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.360
 I have not had a chance so that's why 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.810
 had not done it already installed the round 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.200
 is installing the apps already and going to 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.849
 install what lass the superuser that 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.390
 This is the one that does not take almost everything 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:04.450
 after this installation I will 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.790
 organize the phone normally 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.090
 she will end here as you can see 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.250
 we only give it to robots and this one does not 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.690
 we are waiting for it to come out what is the 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.690
 bod animation 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.690
 and well this is the logo of the debut of 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.030
 engine talks about the neon in this case and this one 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.950
 is the animation button I'm going to read this 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.250
 part of the video and then when there's 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.250
 started the phone could this 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.250
 we come back 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.280
 why 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:26.330
 and good as you can see here and then 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.180
 I just started what diving is 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.620
 and slow down all our means and 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.600
 we select our Spanish language 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.790
 Spanish my case I will do this that goes 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.770
 to select I'm not going to do a little 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.990
 well the screen so you can see already 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.140
 that with the brightness that 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.310
 configurations already know in the networks and 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.710
 the high 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:53.400
 start time 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:56.490
 in jumping lack in other ways 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.840
 and the name that you want to put 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.840
 in my case I put like this 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:08.639
 that's my name good as medicine 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.880
 next more and understanding how they can 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:20.580
 see is completely clean pure free 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.110
 he did not swear and then it would be all the video was 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.650
 they liked anything like 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.650
 style from which the video share it
