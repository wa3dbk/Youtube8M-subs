down<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.409> unit<00:01:55.710> 01<00:01:56.250> folder<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.939> then<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
down to the unit 01 folder and then the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.569 
down to the unit 01 folder and then the
pv<00:01:57.750> 3d<00:01:58.079> folder<00:01:58.500> you'll<00:01:59.340> see<00:01:59.399> severe<00:02:00.240> pano<00:02:00.570> is

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
pv 3d folder you'll see severe pano is

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.490 
pv 3d folder you'll see severe pano is
so<00:02:02.579> open<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.820> up<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.090> then<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.049> will<00:02:04.259> see

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
so open that up and then you will see

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.039 
so open that up and then you will see
this<00:02:04.860> embed<00:02:05.640> statement<00:02:06.240> source<00:02:06.630> equals

assets pano image Swift

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.280

so<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.189> go<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.400> assets<00:02:11.819> under<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:13.049> source

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
so just go to assets under the source

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.280 
so just go to assets under the source
folder<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:15.090> you'll<00:02:15.540> see<00:02:15.689> a<00:02:15.720> swift<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.170> that's
