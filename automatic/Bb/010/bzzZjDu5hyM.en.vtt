00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
know emulators of her systems that

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.800 
know emulators of her systems that
nobody<00:01:28.470> liked<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.340> know<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.810> that's

nobody liked but you know it's that's

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.620 
nobody liked but you know it's that's
digging<00:01:31.470> deep<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.320> good<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.560> see<00:01:35.630> Android

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
digging deep so it's good to see Android

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.280 
digging deep so it's good to see Android
getting<00:01:37.049> even<00:01:37.799> emulators<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.840> for<00:01:39.840> systems

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
getting even emulators that for systems

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.210 
getting even emulators that for systems
that<00:01:40.380> people<00:01:40.740> didn't<00:01:40.979> really<00:01:41.009> even<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:43.220> such

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
that people didn't really even like such

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.190 
that people didn't really even like such
as<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.780> I<00:01:46.670> supposed<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.790> believe<00:01:48.170> include<00:01:49.170> a

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
as that I supposed I believe include a

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.020 
as that I supposed I believe include a
lot<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.500> performance<00:01:50.070> tweaks<00:01:50.369> because<00:01:51.320> for

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
lot of performance tweaks because for

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.690 
lot of performance tweaks because for
for<00:01:54.030> more<00:01:54.270> advanced<00:01:54.780> emulators<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.619> retro<00:01:56.520> arc

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
for more advanced emulators it retro arc

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.179 
for more advanced emulators it retro arc
they<00:01:56.969> kind<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.479> perform<00:01:57.869> very<00:01:58.110> poorly<00:01:59.869> yeah<00:02:01.189> so

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
they kind of perform very poorly yeah so

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.260 
they kind of perform very poorly yeah so

on<00:03:22.270> this<00:03:22.420> controller<00:03:22.810> though<00:03:23.110> that's<00:03:23.860> a<00:03:24.160> big

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
on this controller though that's a big

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.610 
on this controller though that's a big
disappointment<00:03:24.940> because<00:03:26.040> it<00:03:27.040> requires<00:03:27.640> a

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
disappointment because it requires a

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.380 
disappointment because it requires a
back<00:03:29.620> button<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:30.460> bring<00:03:30.670> up<00:03:30.790> that<00:03:30.970> streaming

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
dialogue with the gameplay capture stuff

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.660 
dialogue with the gameplay capture stuff
also<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.410> triggers<00:03:36.040> if<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.340> were<00:03:36.430> wondering

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
also the triggers if you were wondering

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.180 
also the triggers if you were wondering
there<00:03:37.270> are<00:03:37.330> triggers<00:03:37.660> back<00:03:37.870> here<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.320> they

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
there are triggers back here and they

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.360 
there are triggers back here and they
are<00:03:39.220> not<00:03:39.700> analog<00:03:40.270> they<00:03:40.510> are<00:03:40.690> digital<00:03:41.140> so<00:03:41.770> if

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
are not analog they are digital so if

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.160 
are not analog they are digital so if
