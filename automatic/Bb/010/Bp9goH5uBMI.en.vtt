guard<00:01:49.829> especially<00:01:50.040> when<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.820> card

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
guard especially when you have this card

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.190 
guard especially when you have this card
out<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.450> they<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:51.930> exactly<00:01:52.500> enough<00:01:52.950> damage<00:01:53.369> to

to block to block and kill it then you

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.709 
to block to block and kill it then you
just<00:01:59.040> go<00:01:59.430> out<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.790> throw<00:01:59.820> my<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.299> masses

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
just go out and throw my to the masses

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.539 
just go out and throw my to the masses
and<00:02:00.990> then<00:02:01.200> they<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:01.829> get<00:02:02.009> really<00:02:02.189> screwed

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
and then they just get really screwed

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.649 
and then they just get really screwed
but<00:02:03.590> anyway<00:02:04.820> hooga<00:02:05.820> roots<00:02:06.000> back<00:02:06.210> later<00:02:06.450> that

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
but anyway hooga roots back later that

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.180 
but anyway hooga roots back later that
is<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:07.290> definitely<00:02:07.680> not<00:02:07.770> good<00:02:07.950> for<00:02:08.099> me

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
is it's definitely not good for me

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.740 
is it's definitely not good for me
that's<00:02:08.340> really<00:02:08.789> really<00:02:09.179> good<00:02:09.270> for<00:02:09.569> him

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
that's really really good for him

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.940 
that's really really good for him
because<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.440> basically<00:02:10.739> means

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
because it basically means

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.800 
because it basically means
replays<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.310> creature<00:02:12.640> well<00:02:12.970> this<00:02:13.390> is<00:02:13.540> what<00:02:13.720> the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
replays a creature well this is what the

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.500 
replays a creature well this is what the
card<00:02:13.959> says<00:02:14.200> whenever<00:02:14.650> he<00:02:14.830> plays<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.069> creature

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
card says whenever he plays a creature

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.050 
card says whenever he plays a creature
with<00:02:16.510> power<00:02:17.110> 3<00:02:17.560> or<00:02:17.709> greater<00:02:17.739> he<00:02:18.580> gets<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.879> draw

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
with power 3 or greater he gets to draw

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.089 
with power 3 or greater he gets to draw
a<00:02:19.090> card<00:02:19.330> so<00:02:19.690> that's<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.290> lot<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.739> cards<00:02:21.010> in

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
a card so that's a lot of the cards in

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.589 
a card so that's a lot of the cards in
the<00:02:21.160> deck<00:02:21.190> not<00:02:21.550> i<00:02:21.700> wouldn't<00:02:21.910> say<00:02:22.060> most<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.450> them

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
the deck not i wouldn't say most of them

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.190 
the deck not i wouldn't say most of them
but<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.310> large<00:02:24.310> portion<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.510> cards<00:02:25.810> in<00:02:26.019> the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
but a large portion of the cards in the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.640 
but a large portion of the cards in the
deck<00:02:26.940> do<00:02:27.940> do<00:02:28.510> have<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.959> on<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.349> on<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.560> card

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
deck do do have that on the on the card

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.780 
deck do do have that on the on the card
so<00:02:30.390> anyway<00:02:31.680> he<00:02:34.410> my<00:02:35.410> 33<00:02:36.069> is<00:02:36.190> now<00:02:36.310> officially

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
so anyway he my 33 is now officially

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.270 
so anyway he my 33 is now officially
stronger<00:02:37.209> than<00:02:37.330> he<00:02:37.510> is<00:02:37.569> 22<00:02:37.780> well<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.920> mean

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
stronger than he is 22 well I mean

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.309 
stronger than he is 22 well I mean
obviously<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.849> makes<00:02:40.000> sense<00:02:40.120> but<00:02:40.319> titania

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
obviously that makes sense but titania

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.690 
obviously that makes sense but titania
is<00:02:41.379> chosen<00:02:41.620> is<00:02:41.860> now<00:02:41.950> officially<00:02:42.370> stronger

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
is chosen is now officially stronger

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.400 
is chosen is now officially stronger
than<00:02:42.819> borderland<00:02:43.360> ranger<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:43.870> he<00:02:44.019> can't<00:02:44.200> swing

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
than borderland ranger so he can't swing

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.120 
than borderland ranger so he can't swing
with<00:02:44.560> that<00:02:44.739> but<00:02:45.370> he<00:02:45.670> can<00:02:45.849> still<00:02:46.030> swing<00:02:46.510> with

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
with that but he can still swing with

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.199 
with that but he can still swing with
gooks<00:02:48.130> pack<00:02:48.340> leader<00:02:48.580> if<00:02:48.760> he<00:02:48.849> wants<00:02:49.120> it

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
gooks pack leader if he wants it

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.170 
gooks pack leader if he wants it
interesting<00:02:50.170> that<00:02:50.610> my<00:02:51.610> opponent<00:02:51.819> left

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
interesting that my opponent left

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.479 
interesting that my opponent left
grazing<00:02:52.840> Glade<00:02:53.170> heart<00:02:53.410> in<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.739> deck<00:02:53.920> one<00:02:54.370> of

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
grazing Glade heart in the deck one of

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.920 
grazing Glade heart in the deck one of
the<00:02:54.549> main<00:02:54.849> reasons<00:02:55.239> why<00:02:55.329> I<00:02:55.360> took<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.660> out<00:02:55.750> is

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
the main reasons why I took it out is

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.360 
the main reasons why I took it out is
because<00:02:56.079> it<00:02:56.290> doesn't<00:02:56.590> get<00:02:56.680> triggered<00:02:57.010> by<00:02:57.190> this

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
because it doesn't get triggered by this

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.780 
because it doesn't get triggered by this
ability<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.780> anyway<00:02:59.230> my<00:02:59.680> deck<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.400> have<00:03:00.670> in

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
ability so anyway my deck that I have in

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.030 
ability so anyway my deck that I have in
real<00:03:00.940> life<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.269> have<00:03:01.420> two<00:03:01.599> of<00:03:01.750> these<00:03:01.870> guys<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.500> I

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
real life I have two of these guys and I

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.000 
real life I have two of these guys and I
think<00:03:03.250> I<00:03:03.340> have<00:03:03.579> a<00:03:04.420> few<00:03:04.989> groups<00:03:05.230> companions<00:03:05.860> a

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
think I have a few groups companions a

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.550 
think I have a few groups companions a
few<00:03:06.190> leatherback<00:03:06.610> bailiffs<00:03:07.090> all<00:03:07.660> those<00:03:08.110> cards

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
few leatherback bailiffs all those cards

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.729 
few leatherback bailiffs all those cards
get<00:03:09.090> tripped<00:03:10.090> by<00:03:10.269> that<00:03:10.450> ability<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.170> that's

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
get tripped by that ability so that's

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.690 
get tripped by that ability so that's
really<00:03:11.950> really<00:03:12.280> good<00:03:12.420> but<00:03:13.560> I'm<00:03:14.560> not<00:03:14.620> gonna<00:03:14.890> not

been<00:03:25.930> forests<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.680> I<00:03:27.010> have<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.519> have<00:03:27.700> enough

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
been forests and I have I have enough

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.670 
been forests and I have I have enough
forest<00:03:28.329> now<00:03:28.540> it's<00:03:28.810> okay<00:03:29.079> you<00:03:29.139> can<00:03:29.380> stop

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
forest now it's okay you can stop

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.390 
forest now it's okay you can stop
drawing<00:03:29.920> for<00:03:30.250> us<00:03:30.370> but<00:03:31.260> my<00:03:32.260> opponent<00:03:32.680> is<00:03:32.829> doing

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
drawing for us but my opponent is doing

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.670 
drawing for us but my opponent is doing
pretty<00:03:33.579> well<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.989> fact<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.319> they're

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
pretty well and the fact that they're

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.710 
pretty well and the fact that they're
thinking<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.310> not<00:03:36.430> doing<00:03:36.639> anything<00:03:36.819> leads<00:03:37.450> me

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
thinking and not doing anything leads me

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.210 
thinking and not doing anything leads me
to<00:03:37.900> believe<00:03:37.930> that<00:03:38.200> they<00:03:38.470> have<00:03:38.500> an<00:03:38.709> overrun<00:03:39.069> in

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
to believe that they have an overrun in

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.490 
to believe that they have an overrun in
their<00:03:39.310> hand<00:03:39.549> right<00:03:39.730> now<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:41.260> they're

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
their hand right now and they're

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.830 
their hand right now and they're
calculating<00:03:42.160> some<00:03:42.310> damage<00:03:42.700> but<00:03:42.730> so<00:03:43.690> that's

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
calculating some damage but so that's

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.819 
calculating some damage but so that's
something<00:03:44.019> that<00:03:44.170> I'm<00:03:44.319> going<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.470> really<00:03:44.709> have

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
something that I'm going to really have

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.300 
something that I'm going to really have
to<00:03:44.980> worry<00:03:45.190> about<00:03:46.410> they<00:03:47.410> can<00:03:47.560> only<00:03:47.650> get<00:03:47.920> in<00:03:48.040> for

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
to worry about they can only get in for

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.170 
to worry about they can only get in for
10<00:03:48.700> plus<00:03:49.829> 17<00:03:50.829> plus<00:03:51.160> 7<00:03:51.459> they<00:03:51.639> can<00:03:51.790> only<00:03:51.850> get<00:03:52.090> in

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
10 plus 17 plus 7 they can only get in

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.620 
10 plus 17 plus 7 they can only get in
for<00:03:52.329> 17<00:03:52.750> right<00:03:52.930> now<00:03:53.019> I'm<00:03:53.230> at<00:03:53.319> 18<00:03:53.650> but<00:03:53.950> I<00:03:54.940> can<00:03:55.480> I

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
for 17 right now I'm at 18 but I can I

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.270 
for 17 right now I'm at 18 but I can I
mean<00:03:55.810> I<00:03:55.840> can<00:03:56.049> still<00:03:56.230> do<00:03:56.349> some<00:03:56.410> blocking<00:03:56.709> but

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
mean I can still do some blocking but

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.390 
mean I can still do some blocking but
either<00:03:57.549> way<00:03:57.819> i<00:03:58.680> also<00:03:59.680> have<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.069> worry<00:04:00.280> about

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
either way i also have to worry about

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.449 
either way i also have to worry about
giant<00:04:00.880> growth<00:04:01.389> plus<00:04:02.230> 3<00:04:02.470> plus<00:04:02.500> 3<00:04:02.709> and<00:04:03.069> it's<00:04:03.340> an

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
giant growth plus 3 plus 3 and it's an

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.129 
giant growth plus 3 plus 3 and it's an
instant<00:04:03.790> so<00:04:04.090> i'm<00:04:04.269> not<00:04:04.510> going<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.780> swing<00:04:04.989> in

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
instant so i'm not going to swing in

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.199 
instant so i'm not going to swing in
next<00:04:05.410> turn<00:04:05.530> with<00:04:05.709> heedless<00:04:06.069> one<00:04:06.250> or<00:04:06.430> two<00:04:06.910> tanya

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
next turn with heedless one or two tanya

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.700 
next turn with heedless one or two tanya
has<00:04:07.299> chosen<00:04:07.569> or<00:04:07.870> something<00:04:08.169> like<00:04:08.290> that<00:04:08.349> but

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.080 

all<00:04:12.710> right<00:04:12.860> so<00:04:12.980> he's<00:04:13.160> got<00:04:13.310> a<00:04:13.340> giant<00:04:13.580> growth<00:04:13.910> in

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
all right so he's got a giant growth in

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.590 
all right so he's got a giant growth in
his<00:04:14.210> hand<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:16.820> question<00:04:17.150> is<00:04:17.239> do<00:04:17.359> I<00:04:17.390> want<00:04:17.450> to

slag<00:05:26.600> worm<00:05:26.900> next<00:05:27.229> turn<00:05:27.350> to<00:05:27.500> something<00:05:27.680> like

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
slag worm next turn to something like

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.580 
slag worm next turn to something like
that<00:05:28.100> which<00:05:28.310> is<00:05:28.340> such<00:05:28.790> a<00:05:28.940> good<00:05:29.090> card<00:05:29.360> I<00:05:30.260> do

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
that which is such a good card I do

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.230 
that which is such a good card I do
think<00:05:31.160> that<00:05:31.220> my<00:05:31.430> opponent<00:05:31.610> trimmed<00:05:31.940> his<00:05:32.060> deck

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
think that my opponent trimmed his deck

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.760 
think that my opponent trimmed his deck
down<00:05:32.390> so<00:05:32.630> this<00:05:32.780> could<00:05:32.930> actually<00:05:33.140> be<00:05:33.410> a<00:05:33.530> loss

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
down so this could actually be a loss

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.800 
down so this could actually be a loss
against<00:05:34.070> the<00:05:34.190> apex<00:05:34.490> predator<00:05:34.550> which<00:05:35.540> I<00:05:35.750> don't

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
against the apex predator which I don't

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.090 
against the apex predator which I don't
think<00:05:35.960> I've<00:05:36.169> done<00:05:36.320> yeah<00:05:36.440> I<00:05:36.470> don't<00:05:36.620> think<00:05:37.040> I've

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
think I've done yeah I don't think I've

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.469 
think I've done yeah I don't think I've
ever<00:05:37.190> lost<00:05:37.430> to<00:05:37.610> this<00:05:37.700> deck<00:05:38.860> online<00:05:39.860> which<00:05:40.250> is

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
ever lost to this deck online which is

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.790 
ever lost to this deck online which is
not<00:05:41.479> really<00:05:41.510> that<00:05:41.780> confusing<00:05:42.410> because<00:05:42.500> the

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
not really that confusing because the

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.940 
not really that confusing because the
deck<00:05:42.950> is<00:05:43.130> pretty<00:05:43.610> goddamn<00:05:44.000> offer<00:05:44.210> but<00:05:44.950> alright

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
deck is pretty goddamn offer but alright

another<00:05:46.190> the<00:05:47.000> creature<00:05:47.500> it's<00:05:48.500> good<00:05:48.680> for<00:05:48.830> me

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
another the creature it's good for me

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.350 
another the creature it's good for me
that's<00:05:49.430> why<00:05:49.520> I<00:05:49.580> didn't<00:05:49.820> swing<00:05:50.030> in<00:05:50.150> there<00:05:50.330> i

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
that's why I didn't swing in there i

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.270 
that's why I didn't swing in there i
think<00:05:50.750> is<00:05:51.200> because<00:05:51.380> he<00:05:51.560> wanted<00:05:51.800> to<00:05:51.919> use<00:05:52.070> all

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
think is because he wanted to use all

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.280 
think is because he wanted to use all
his<00:05:52.340> mana<00:05:52.520> yes<00:05:53.030> jagged<00:05:53.510> scar<00:05:53.600> chores<00:05:54.140> your

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
his mana yes jagged scar chores your

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
his mana yes jagged scar chores your

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:45.900 
I didn't I wasn't even looking at the

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.560 
I didn't I wasn't even looking at the
timer<00:07:46.320> I<00:07:46.469> just<00:07:46.680> assumed<00:07:47.009> it<00:07:47.130> would<00:07:47.280> give<00:07:47.460> me

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:47.570 
timer I just assumed it would give me

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.060 
timer I just assumed it would give me
enough<00:07:48.570> time<00:07:48.599> to<00:07:48.900> actually<00:07:49.229> think<00:07:49.620> about<00:07:49.740> it

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.070 
enough time to actually think about it

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.700 
enough time to actually think about it
but<00:07:50.310> that<00:07:50.729> was<00:07:50.909> I<00:07:51.150> was<00:07:51.750> really<00:07:52.199> annoying<00:07:52.409> but
