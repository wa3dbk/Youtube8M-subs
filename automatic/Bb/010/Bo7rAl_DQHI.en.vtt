well<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.859> my<00:00:31.949> XD<00:00:32.279> I'm<00:00:32.369> right<00:00:32.550> here

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
well this is my XD I'm right here

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.340 
well this is my XD I'm right here
obviously<00:00:33.420> it's<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.630> part<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.880> my<00:00:35.880> Glock<00:00:36.120> put<00:00:36.480> my

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
obviously it's a part on my Glock put my

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.030 
obviously it's a part on my Glock put my
XDM<00:00:37.910> and<00:00:39.469> this<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.680> what<00:00:40.950> happened<00:00:42.590> that<00:00:43.590> hole

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
XDM and this is what happened that hole

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.100 
XDM and this is what happened that hole
right<00:00:44.309> there<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.910> where<00:00:45.390> your<00:00:45.690> striker

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
right there is where your striker

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.180 
right there is where your striker
retaining<00:00:46.800> pin<00:00:47.039> goes<00:00:48.110> and<00:00:49.110> that's<00:00:49.559> what<00:00:49.800> broke

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
retaining pin goes and that's what broke

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.090 
retaining pin goes and that's what broke
it<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:51.660> basically<00:00:52.140> split<00:00:52.530> into<00:00:52.739> two<00:00:52.890> pieces

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
it like basically split into two pieces

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.760 
it like basically split into two pieces
from<00:00:53.520> dry<00:00:53.789> firing<00:00:54.090> over<00:00:54.300> time<00:00:54.629> because<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.710> do

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
from dry firing over time because I do

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.959 
from dry firing over time because I do
to<00:00:56.039> dry<00:00:56.280> fire<00:00:56.489> practices<00:00:57.770> so<00:00:58.770> what<00:00:59.039> happens<00:00:59.489> is

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
to dry fire practices so what happens is

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.210 
to dry fire practices so what happens is
this<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.079> your<00:01:01.230> firing<00:01:01.530> pin<00:01:02.780> basically<00:01:04.220> you

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
this is your firing pin basically you

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.920 
this is your firing pin basically you
know<00:01:05.339> pretty<00:01:05.610> much<00:01:05.640> goes<00:01:05.909> right<00:01:06.119> there<00:01:06.689> inside

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
know pretty much goes right there inside

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.560 
know pretty much goes right there inside
the<00:01:07.260> gun<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.909> there's<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.090> pin<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.510> goes

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the gun and there's a pin that goes

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.530 
the gun and there's a pin that goes
through<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.170> slot<00:01:10.729> and<00:01:11.729> when<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.970> dry<00:01:12.240> fire

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
through that slot and when you dry fire

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.310 
through that slot and when you dry fire
it<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.130> hits<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.390> roll<00:01:16.049> pin

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
it it you know it hits the the roll pin

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.480 
it it you know it hits the the roll pin
when<00:01:17.250> there's<00:01:17.430> no<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:18.060> know<00:01:18.180> when<00:01:18.390> you're<00:01:18.509> not

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
when there's no you know when you're not

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.249 
when there's no you know when you're not
when<00:01:20.490> there's<00:01:20.670> no<00:01:20.759> bullet<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> gun<00:01:21.540> or<00:01:21.900> in

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
when there's no bullet in the gun or in

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.810 
when there's no bullet in the gun or in
the<00:01:22.409> inner<00:01:22.680> chamber<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:25.460> you<00:01:26.460> know<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.700> can

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the inner chamber so you know it can

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.789 
the inner chamber so you know it can
damage<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.570> rope<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.380> overtime<00:01:29.720> so<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:31.110> mean<00:01:31.500> I

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
damage the rope in overtime so I mean I

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.210 
damage the rope in overtime so I mean I
know<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.250> not<00:01:32.369> really<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> problem<00:01:32.880> for<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
know it's not really a problem for the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.609 
know it's not really a problem for the
XDM<00:01:35.220> s<00:01:35.430> because<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.630> don't<00:01:36.810> have<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.290> drive

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
XDM s because you don't have to drive

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.789 
XDM s because you don't have to drive
fire<00:01:38.000> this<00:01:39.000> gun<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.509> take<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.869> down<00:01:41.240> but<00:01:42.240> all

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
fire this gun to take it down but all

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.639 
fire this gun to take it down but all
like<00:01:43.799> gina<00:01:44.130> was<00:01:44.280> saying<00:01:44.610> yeah<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.780> x<00:01:46.020> DS<00:01:46.320> you

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
like gina was saying yeah the x DS you

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.850 
like gina was saying yeah the x DS you
do<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.119> kinda<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.720> does<00:01:48.869> design<00:01:49.649> flaw

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
do so that kinda is it does design flaw

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.490 
do so that kinda is it does design flaw
i<00:01:50.040> think<00:01:50.310> because<00:01:51.210> over<00:01:51.750> time<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:52.200> pin<00:01:52.470> will

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
i think because over time this pin will

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.429 
i think because over time this pin will
fuck<00:01:53.250> up<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.540> do<00:01:54.780> have<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.079> go<00:01:55.170> buy<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> new

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
fuck up and you do have to go buy a new

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.280 
fuck up and you do have to go buy a new
one<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.979> went<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.030> Home<00:01:57.390> Depot<00:01:57.420> fucking
