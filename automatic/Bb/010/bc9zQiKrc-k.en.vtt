joint you can see is right here and
there's<00:00:29.680> a<00:00:29.740> little<00:00:29.890> bit<00:00:30.130> of<00:00:30.189> a<00:00:30.279> blip<00:00:30.490> there<00:00:30.699> you

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
silver is so soft that I can kind of

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.729 
silver is so soft that I can kind of
shape<00:00:40.870> it<00:00:41.050> generally<00:00:41.469> with<00:00:41.620> my<00:00:41.739> fingers<00:00:42.160> and

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
and I'm being really gentle with this

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.630 
and I'm being really gentle with this
because<00:01:11.890> I<00:01:12.040> don't<00:01:12.070> want<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:12.369> break<00:01:12.460> this

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
because I don't want to break this

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.330 
because I don't want to break this
little<00:01:12.820> labradorite<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.540> I<00:01:13.570> have<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:15.220> it

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
little labradorite that I have that it

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.179 
little labradorite that I have that it
can<00:01:15.460> push<00:01:15.700> all<00:01:15.970> the<00:01:16.299> way<00:01:16.330> through<00:01:16.860> all<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:18.100> way

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
can push all the way through all the way

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.320 
can push all the way through all the way
through<00:01:18.340> your<00:01:18.430> bezel<00:01:18.580> because<00:01:18.970> you're<00:01:19.150> going

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
through your bezel because you're going

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.289 
through your bezel because you're going
to<00:01:19.450> be<00:01:19.540> setting<00:01:19.780> it<00:01:20.580> by<00:01:21.580> putting<00:01:21.909> it<00:01:22.000> in<00:01:22.119> from

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
to be setting it by putting it in from

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.370 
to be setting it by putting it in from
the<00:01:22.409> top<00:01:23.409> down<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:25.000> that<00:01:25.180> so<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:25.990> won't<00:01:26.170> help

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
the top down like that so it won't help

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.280 
the top down like that so it won't help
much<00:01:26.650> if<00:01:26.890> your<00:01:27.040> bezel<00:01:27.400> just<00:01:27.610> fits<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.780> top<00:01:28.990> and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
much if your bezel just fits the top and

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.920 
much if your bezel just fits the top and
is<00:01:29.409> angled<00:01:29.920> in<00:01:30.130> still<00:01:30.549> you<00:01:31.540> want<00:01:31.689> it<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:31.840> be

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
is angled in still you want it to be

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.960 
is angled in still you want it to be
perpendicular<00:01:32.680> fit<00:01:33.009> it<00:01:33.130> either<00:01:33.340> way

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
perpendicular fit it either way

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.350 
perpendicular fit it either way
so<00:01:34.180> I'll<00:01:35.170> kind<00:01:35.409> of<00:01:35.500> work<00:01:35.770> with<00:01:35.950> it<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:37.119> keep

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
so I'll kind of work with it and keep

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.950 
so I'll kind of work with it and keep
flipping<00:01:37.720> around<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:40.000> anytime<00:01:40.930> I<00:01:40.960> see<00:01:41.350> a

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
flipping around and then anytime I see a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.300 
flipping around and then anytime I see a
part<00:01:43.960> that's<00:01:44.079> bumped<00:01:44.470> out<00:01:44.619> kind<00:01:45.159> of<00:01:45.189> like

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
part that's bumped out kind of like

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.310 
part that's bumped out kind of like
these<00:01:45.520> two<00:01:45.700> I<00:01:45.729> push<00:01:46.570> it<00:01:46.720> against<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.079> stone

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
these two I push it against the stone

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.760 
these two I push it against the stone
just<00:01:47.649> gently<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:50.049> I'm<00:01:50.140> just<00:01:50.320> pushing<00:01:50.530> this

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
just gently and I'm just pushing this

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.870 
just gently and I'm just pushing this
against<00:01:51.100> my<00:01:51.450> level<00:01:52.450> bench<00:01:52.750> block<00:01:53.049> here<00:01:53.439> and

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
against my level bench block here and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.889 
against my level bench block here and
perhaps<00:01:54.880> rock<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.450> stone<00:01:55.689> along<00:01:57.600> any<00:01:58.600> of

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
perhaps rock the stone along any of

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:05.760 
perhaps rock the stone along any of
those<00:02:00.960> rough<00:02:01.960> edges<00:02:02.170> until<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:05.380> got<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.560> nice

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
those rough edges until you got a nice

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.020 
those rough edges until you got a nice
smooth<00:02:06.070> bezel<00:02:06.399> and<00:02:06.460> at<00:02:06.549> this<00:02:06.610> point<00:02:06.729> you<00:02:06.880> might

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
smooth bezel and at this point you might

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.580 
smooth bezel and at this point you might
need<00:02:07.180> to<00:02:07.299> anneal<00:02:07.570> it<00:02:07.719> it<00:02:07.899> might<00:02:08.140> get<00:02:08.350> work

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
need to anneal it it might get work

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.840 
need to anneal it it might get work
harden<00:02:08.920> just<00:02:08.950> enough<00:02:09.340> that<00:02:09.519> you<00:02:09.610> need<00:02:09.729> to

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
harden just enough that you need to

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.420 
harden just enough that you need to
anneal<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:10.269> to<00:02:11.170> get<00:02:11.320> it<00:02:11.440> exactly<00:02:12.100> right<00:02:12.310> and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
anneal it to get it exactly right and

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.500 
anneal it to get it exactly right and
you<00:02:12.549> want<00:02:12.760> this<00:02:12.849> to<00:02:12.910> be<00:02:13.090> exactly<00:02:13.420> right

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
you want this to be exactly right

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.880 
you want this to be exactly right
because<00:02:13.840> by<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.020> time<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.230> solder<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.709> down

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
because by the time you solder it down

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.320 
because by the time you solder it down
it's<00:02:15.670> set<00:02:16.060> in<00:02:16.209> whatever<00:02:16.510> shape<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.780> put<00:02:16.900> it

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
it's set in whatever shape you put it

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.840 
it's set in whatever shape you put it
the<00:02:19.330> next<00:02:19.570> step<00:02:19.750> then<00:02:19.930> is<00:02:20.080> going<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.320> be<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:21.700> get

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
the next step then is going to be to get

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.790 
the next step then is going to be to get
rid<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.210> solder<00:02:22.480> seam<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.470> put<00:02:23.680> my

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
rid of this solder seam and I put my

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.770 
rid of this solder seam and I put my
solder<00:02:24.040> on<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.400> outside<00:02:25.090> because<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.480> find<00:02:25.690> it

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
solder on the outside because I find it

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.780 
solder on the outside because I find it
easier<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.380> get<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:26.980> off<00:02:27.100> so<00:02:27.340> I'm<00:02:27.460> going<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.640> use

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
easier to get it off so I'm going to use

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.530 
easier to get it off so I'm going to use
a<00:02:28.500> nice<00:02:29.500> fine<00:02:29.890> file<00:02:30.340> I'm<00:02:30.760> using<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.120> half<00:02:31.300> round

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
a nice fine file I'm using a half round

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.090 
a nice fine file I'm using a half round
but<00:02:31.810> I'm<00:02:31.870> just<00:02:31.960> using<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.350> flat<00:02:32.560> side<00:02:32.800> of<00:02:32.950> it

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
but I'm just using the flat side of it

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.400 
but I'm just using the flat side of it
and<00:02:33.250> I've<00:02:34.150> got<00:02:34.420> my<00:02:34.540> finger<00:02:34.870> braced<00:02:35.140> underneath

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
and I've got my finger braced underneath

and I've got my finger braced underneath
underneath<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.560> solder<00:02:39.070> seam<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.670> I'm<00:02:40.270> just

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
underneath the solder seam and I'm just

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.450 
underneath the solder seam and I'm just
going<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:40.600> lightly<00:02:41.700> file<00:02:42.750> until<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:43.780> can't<00:02:44.110> see

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
going to lightly file until I can't see

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.860 
going to lightly file until I can't see

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
solder starts and stops you're going to

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.060 
solder starts and stops you're going to
take<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.510> little<00:02:49.690> bit<00:02:49.810> of<00:02:49.930> your<00:02:50.110> bezel<00:02:50.620> with<00:02:50.890> you

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
take a little bit of your bezel with you

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.740 
take a little bit of your bezel with you
want<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.670> turn<00:02:51.790> it<00:02:51.940> around<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:52.420> I<00:02:52.480> can<00:02:52.570> get<00:02:52.660> it

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
want to turn it around so I can get it

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.420 
want to turn it around so I can get it
from<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.960> other<00:02:53.080> angle<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.950> if<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.130> need<00:02:54.310> to

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
from the other angle and if you need to

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.660 
from the other angle and if you need to
kind<00:02:54.640> of<00:02:55.230> make<00:02:56.230> sure<00:02:56.410> it's<00:02:56.560> very<00:02:56.770> rounded<00:02:57.310> over

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
kind of make sure it's very rounded over

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.730 
kind of make sure it's very rounded over
your<00:02:57.790> finger<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:59.020> that<00:02:59.050> you're<00:02:59.260> not<00:02:59.410> taking

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
your finger so that you're not taking

your finger so that you're not taking
any<00:02:59.860> more<00:03:00.070> away<00:03:00.340> than<00:03:00.550> you<00:03:00.640> need<00:03:00.820> to<00:03:00.970> you're

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
any more away than you need to you're

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.890 
any more away than you need to you're
just<00:03:01.360> getting<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.840> top<00:03:02.050> part<00:03:02.350> of<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.530> solder

just getting the top part of the solder
you<00:03:04.900> just<00:03:05.050> want<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.200> make<00:03:05.320> this<00:03:05.440> nice<00:03:05.650> and

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
you just want to make this nice and

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.640 
you just want to make this nice and
flush<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:06.430> nobody<00:03:06.670> can<00:03:06.760> tell<00:03:07.000> where<00:03:07.209> you

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
flush so nobody can tell where you

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.140 
flush so nobody can tell where you
soldered<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.800> or<00:03:08.950> at<00:03:09.070> least<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.730> untrained

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
soldered it or at least the untrained

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.930 
soldered it or at least the untrained
eye<00:03:10.330> can't<00:03:10.660> tell<00:03:10.870> where<00:03:10.990> your<00:03:11.110> soldered<00:03:11.440> it

eye can't tell where your soldered it

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.920 
eye can't tell where your soldered it
and<00:03:12.940> you'll<00:03:13.060> be<00:03:13.150> able<00:03:13.240> to<00:03:13.360> tell<00:03:13.570> there's<00:03:13.780> just

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
and you'll be able to tell there's just

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.170 
and you'll be able to tell there's just
a<00:03:14.160> color<00:03:15.160> difference<00:03:15.370> it'll<00:03:15.700> all<00:03:15.850> be<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.150> same

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
a color difference it'll all be the same

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.940 
a color difference it'll all be the same
level<00:03:16.780> of<00:03:16.840> shininess<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.530> won't<00:03:17.680> see<00:03:17.800> any

level of shininess you won't see any
lines<00:03:18.910> or<00:03:19.150> anything<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:20.470> then<00:03:20.770> I'm<00:03:20.890> going<00:03:20.980> to

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
lines or anything and then I'm going to

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.440 
lines or anything and then I'm going to
grab<00:03:21.220> my<00:03:21.370> sanding<00:03:21.760> stick<00:03:21.970> I<00:03:22.060> have<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.209> really

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
grab my sanding stick I have a really

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
grab my sanding stick I have a really
light<00:03:22.660> sandpaper<00:03:23.320> here<00:03:24.540> pretty<00:03:25.540> high<00:03:25.780> grit<00:03:26.170> I

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
light sandpaper here pretty high grit I

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.620 
light sandpaper here pretty high grit I
don't<00:03:27.190> want<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:27.430> rough<00:03:27.730> this<00:03:27.940> up<00:03:28.120> very<00:03:28.330> much<00:03:28.390> I

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
don't want to rough this up very much I

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.990 
don't want to rough this up very much I
want<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:28.840> smooth<00:03:29.110> it<00:03:29.230> out<00:03:29.350> so<00:03:29.769> you<00:03:30.040> could<00:03:30.880> do<00:03:30.970> a

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
want to smooth it out so you could do a

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.910 
want to smooth it out so you could do a
600<00:03:31.570> grit<00:03:32.580> 400<00:03:33.580> even<00:03:33.730> if<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:34.030> if<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.390> was<00:03:34.510> a

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
600 grit 400 even if you if it was a

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.009 
600 grit 400 even if you if it was a
pretty<00:03:35.920> big<00:03:36.190> solder<00:03:37.470> solder<00:03:38.850> seam<00:03:39.850> there<00:03:40.150> and

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
pretty big solder solder seam there and

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.560 
pretty big solder solder seam there and
that<00:03:41.140> pretty<00:03:41.350> well<00:03:41.560> takes<00:03:41.860> care<00:03:42.130> of<00:03:42.160> that<00:03:42.570> I'm

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
that pretty well takes care of that I'm

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.910 
that pretty well takes care of that I'm
gonna<00:03:43.750> check<00:03:43.930> my<00:03:43.959> fit<00:03:44.320> again<00:03:44.590> we<00:03:44.739> probably

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
gonna check my fit again we probably

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.180 
gonna check my fit again we probably
contorted<00:03:45.850> it<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.060> bit<00:03:46.239> with<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.480> sanding<00:03:47.190> push

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
contorted it a bit with the sanding push

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:55.550 
contorted it a bit with the sanding push
it<00:03:48.370> through<00:03:48.519> and<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:51.550> next<00:03:51.850> step<00:03:52.060> will<00:03:52.239> be

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.990 

sanding<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.650> bottom<00:03:56.980> smooth<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.430> I<00:03:57.519> just

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
sanding the bottom smooth and I just

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.820 
sanding the bottom smooth and I just
have<00:03:58.090> another<00:03:58.300> bench<00:03:58.540> block<00:03:58.810> here<00:03:59.140> that<00:03:59.320> I've

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
have another bench block here that I've

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.090 
have another bench block here that I've
taped<00:04:00.100> some<00:04:00.610> rough<00:04:00.820> sandpaper<00:04:01.180> to<00:04:01.600> and<00:04:02.100> it'll

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
taped some rough sandpaper to and it'll

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.130 
taped some rough sandpaper to and it'll
hold<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.880> bottom<00:04:04.239> part<00:04:04.480> whatever<00:04:04.660> the<00:04:04.870> bottom

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
hold the bottom part whatever the bottom

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.560 
hold the bottom part whatever the bottom
part<00:04:05.350> is<00:04:05.410> of<00:04:05.620> your<00:04:05.769> your<00:04:06.400> bezel<00:04:06.610> and<00:04:06.970> if

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
part is of your your bezel and if

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.240 
part is of your your bezel and if
there's<00:04:07.720> a<00:04:07.780> specific<00:04:08.050> side<00:04:08.560> to<00:04:08.800> it<00:04:08.920> like<00:04:09.130> a<00:04:09.160> lot

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
there's a specific side to it like a lot

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.400 
there's a specific side to it like a lot
of<00:04:09.459> stones<00:04:09.730> aren't<00:04:12.870> exactly<00:04:13.870> symmetrical

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
of stones aren't exactly symmetrical

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.660 
of stones aren't exactly symmetrical
there's<00:04:14.590> a<00:04:14.650> specific<00:04:15.010> side<00:04:15.160> to<00:04:15.310> it<00:04:15.400> be<00:04:15.489> sure<00:04:15.640> to

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
there's a specific side to it be sure to

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.009 
there's a specific side to it be sure to
mark<00:04:15.970> that<00:04:16.120> with<00:04:16.269> a<00:04:16.299> permanent<00:04:16.600> marker<00:04:16.959> or

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
mark that with a permanent marker or

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.509 
mark that with a permanent marker or
something<00:04:17.290> so<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.470> know<00:04:17.500> what<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.040> top<00:04:18.250> or

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
something so you know what the top or

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.580 
something so you know what the top or
the<00:04:18.609> front<00:04:18.880> of<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.090> back<00:04:19.239> is<00:04:19.510> because<00:04:20.169> it'll

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
the front of the back is because it'll

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.020 
the front of the back is because it'll
all<00:04:20.709> look<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:21.040> same<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.280> you<00:04:21.459> after<00:04:21.790> a<00:04:21.820> while

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
all look the same to you after a while

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.980 
all look the same to you after a while
and<00:04:22.410> so<00:04:23.410> I<00:04:23.440> lightly<00:04:24.040> press<00:04:24.700> down<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.570> make

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
and so I lightly press down and make

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.749 
and so I lightly press down and make
like<00:04:26.169> a<00:04:26.229> figure<00:04:26.470> 8

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:31.279 

against<00:04:29.759> the<00:04:29.939> sandpaper<00:04:30.389> make<00:04:30.990> sure<00:04:31.110> it's<00:04:31.229> on

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
against the sandpaper make sure it's on

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.200 
against the sandpaper make sure it's on
a<00:04:31.349> nice<00:04:31.590> flat<00:04:31.620> surface<00:04:32.430> you<00:04:32.460> get<00:04:32.729> the<00:04:32.849> benefit

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
a nice flat surface you get the benefit

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.330 
a nice flat surface you get the benefit
of<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.449> and<00:04:33.870> this<00:04:34.499> is<00:04:34.650> going<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.830> both<00:04:35.009> clean

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
of that and this is going to both clean

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.110 
of that and this is going to both clean
the<00:04:35.490> silver<00:04:35.909> and<00:04:37.520> rough<00:04:38.520> it<00:04:38.639> up<00:04:38.729> to<00:04:38.909> a<00:04:38.939> nice

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
the silver and rough it up to a nice

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.230 
the silver and rough it up to a nice
flat<00:04:39.509> spot<00:04:40.159> so<00:04:41.159> you'll<00:04:41.340> have<00:04:41.400> a<00:04:41.490> full<00:04:41.669> contact

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
flat spot so you'll have a full contact

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.450 
flat spot so you'll have a full contact
for<00:04:42.479> soldering<00:04:42.719> I<00:04:43.139> check<00:04:43.949> that<00:04:44.129> and<00:04:44.310> make<00:04:44.340> sure

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
for soldering I check that and make sure

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.730 
for soldering I check that and make sure
that<00:04:44.639> it's<00:04:44.969> rough<00:04:45.900> along<00:04:46.199> the<00:04:46.319> entire<00:04:46.680> edge

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
that it's rough along the entire edge

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.429 
that it's rough along the entire edge
you<00:04:47.340> can<00:04:47.430> kind<00:04:47.639> of<00:04:47.669> see<00:04:47.849> there's<00:04:48.029> a<00:04:48.439> different

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:49.439 
you can kind of see there's a different

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.619 
you can kind of see there's a different
texture<00:04:49.770> if<00:04:50.069> the<00:04:50.490> sandpaper<00:04:50.819> hasn't<00:04:51.330> hit<00:04:51.509> it

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:51.629 
texture if the sandpaper hasn't hit it

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:53.659 
texture if the sandpaper hasn't hit it
so<00:04:52.259> I'm<00:04:52.319> going<00:04:52.469> to<00:04:52.529> keep<00:04:52.650> going<00:04:52.800> back<00:04:53.069> kind<00:04:53.610> of

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
so I'm going to keep going back kind of

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:54.860 
so I'm going to keep going back kind of
flipping<00:04:53.939> it<00:04:53.969> around<00:04:54.090> because<00:04:54.539> your<00:04:54.629> fingers

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
flipping it around because your fingers

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.999 
flipping it around because your fingers
are<00:04:54.960> going<00:04:55.050> to<00:04:55.139> have<00:04:55.229> different<00:04:55.379> pressures<00:04:55.830> on

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
are going to have different pressures on

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.260 
are going to have different pressures on
it<00:04:56.159> and<00:04:56.629> this<00:04:57.629> nice<00:04:57.810> figure-eight<00:04:58.229> motion

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
it and this nice figure-eight motion

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.439 
it and this nice figure-eight motion
until<00:05:00.270> when<00:05:00.449> I<00:05:00.479> look<00:05:00.719> at<00:05:00.900> it<00:05:02.330> there's<00:05:03.330> a

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
until when I look at it there's a

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.219 
until when I look at it there's a
uniform<00:05:05.000> texture<00:05:06.000> along<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.479> bottom<00:05:06.659> and<00:05:06.990> now

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
uniform texture along the bottom and now

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.459 
uniform texture along the bottom and now
this<00:05:07.349> is<00:05:07.529> always<00:05:07.949> going<00:05:08.069> to<00:05:08.129> be<00:05:08.189> my<00:05:08.370> bottom

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:09.469 
this is always going to be my bottom

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:11.719 
this is always going to be my bottom
check<00:05:10.469> that<00:05:10.650> fit<00:05:10.889> again<00:05:11.189> you're<00:05:11.520> always

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
check that fit again you're always

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.840 
check that fit again you're always
checking<00:05:12.120> fit<00:05:12.419> with<00:05:12.569> stones
