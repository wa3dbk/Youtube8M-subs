is resting on let's do a video on cold
acetone<00:00:17.400> vapor<00:00:17.670> baths<00:00:18.140> so<00:00:19.140> one<00:00:19.320> thing<00:00:19.529> with<00:00:19.680> 3d

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
acetone vapor baths so one thing with 3d

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.390 
acetone vapor baths so one thing with 3d
prints<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:21.109> each<00:00:22.109> since<00:00:22.769> it's<00:00:22.890> built<00:00:23.039> up<00:00:23.189> layer

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
prints is each since it's built up layer

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.330 
prints is each since it's built up layer
by<00:00:23.430> layer<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:24.300> can<00:00:25.050> usually<00:00:25.199> see<00:00:25.680> ridges<00:00:26.189> and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
by layer you can usually see ridges and

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.359 
by layer you can usually see ridges and
lines<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.990> print<00:00:28.260> itself<00:00:28.380> from<00:00:29.160> where

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
lines in the print itself from where

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.030 
lines in the print itself from where
each<00:00:29.609> layer<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.650> one<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> great

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
each layer is and one of the great

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.209 
each layer is and one of the great
things<00:00:32.250> about<00:00:32.399> printing<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.530> ABS<00:00:34.530> plastic<00:00:35.070> is

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
things about printing in ABS plastic is

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.440 
things about printing in ABS plastic is
that<00:00:35.880> ABS<00:00:36.210> dissolves<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.340> acetone<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.390> you

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
that ABS dissolves in acetone and so you

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.840 
that ABS dissolves in acetone and so you
can<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:39.719> some<00:00:39.930> cool<00:00:40.170> stuff<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.739> order<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.219> use

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
can do some cool stuff in order to use

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.900 
can do some cool stuff in order to use
acetone<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.660> smooth<00:00:43.020> out<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.290> ridges<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:44.070> your

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
acetone to smooth out the ridges in your

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.139 
acetone to smooth out the ridges in your
3d<00:00:45.180> prints<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:46.680> way<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.219> by<00:00:47.280> doing<00:00:47.700> an

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
3d prints and one way is by doing an

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.389 
3d prints and one way is by doing an
acetone<00:00:48.510> vapor<00:00:48.809> bath<00:00:49.129> basically<00:00:50.129> what<00:00:50.280> it's

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
acetone vapor bath basically what it's

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.959 
acetone vapor bath basically what it's
designed<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.850> do<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:52.260> make<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.399> acetone

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
designed to do is to make the acetone

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.869 
designed to do is to make the acetone
evaporate<00:00:54.930> into<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> vapor<00:00:55.590> which<00:00:56.460> will<00:00:56.670> then

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
evaporate into a vapor which will then

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.689 
evaporate into a vapor which will then
condense<00:00:57.390> onto<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.559> print<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.190> as<00:00:59.520> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
condense onto the print and as it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.330 
condense onto the print and as it
condenses<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.840> eat<00:01:01.109> away<00:01:01.309> some<00:01:02.309> of

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
condenses it's going to eat away some of

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.820 
condenses it's going to eat away some of
the<00:01:02.579> plastic<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.420> give<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.960> nice<00:01:04.140> smooth

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the plastic and give it a nice smooth

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.330 
the plastic and give it a nice smooth
shine<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.030> also<00:01:06.689> kind<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.650> fill<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.040> some<00:01:08.310> of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
shine and also kind of fill in some of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.270 
shine and also kind of fill in some of
the<00:01:08.760> pores<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.510> gaps<00:01:10.049> caused<00:01:10.470> by<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.770> 3d

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
the pores and gaps caused by the 3d

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.649 
the pores and gaps caused by the 3d
printing<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.060> way<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.390> do<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.600> you

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
printing so one way you can do it you

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.510 
printing so one way you can do it you
can<00:01:12.780> do<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.869> hot<00:01:13.110> or<00:01:13.140> cold<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.770> really<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
can do it hot or cold I really like the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.520 
can do it hot or cold I really like the
cold<00:01:14.700> method<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.390> not<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> fastest<00:01:16.170> method

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
cold method it's not the fastest method

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.380 
cold method it's not the fastest method
but<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> easiest<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.090> really

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
but it's the easiest and you really

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.780 
but it's the easiest and you really
don't<00:01:18.659> need<00:01:18.930> anything<00:01:19.350> special<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.520> what<00:01:20.670> you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
don't need anything special so what you

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.640 
don't need anything special so what you
will<00:01:20.939> need<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.570> paint<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.350> will<00:01:22.470> fit

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
will need is a paint can that will fit

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.770 
will need is a paint can that will fit
completely<00:01:23.250> over<00:01:23.700> whatever<00:01:24.390> you're<00:01:24.630> trying

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
completely over whatever you're trying

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.260 
completely over whatever you're trying
to<00:01:24.990> vapor<00:01:25.380> bath<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:26.250> needs<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.850> larger<00:01:27.240> than

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
to vapor bath it needs to be larger than

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.539 
to vapor bath it needs to be larger than
that<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.380> walls<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.130> paint<00:01:29.340> can

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
that so that the walls of the paint can

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.380 
that so that the walls of the paint can
will<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:30.060> touch<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:31.170> object<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.250> are

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
will not touch the object that you are

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.149 
will not touch the object that you are
smoothing<00:01:33.470> obviously<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.740> will<00:01:34.829> need<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
smoothing obviously you will need the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.310 
smoothing obviously you will need the
lid<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.850> as<00:01:36.000> well<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.810> other<00:01:36.930> thing<00:01:37.170> you

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
lid to it as well the other thing you

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.440 
lid to it as well the other thing you
will<00:01:37.439> need<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.250> will<00:01:38.400> need<00:01:38.579> some<00:01:39.000> magnets

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
will need is you will need some magnets

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.399 
will need is you will need some magnets
so<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:41.030> cover<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.270> inside<00:01:42.720> with

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
so that you can cover the inside with

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.190 
so that you can cover the inside with
paper<00:01:43.860> towels<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:45.030> other<00:01:45.180> trick<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.600> found<00:01:45.930> is

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
paper towels the other trick I found is

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.920 
paper towels the other trick I found is
that<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:47.340> want<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.759> put<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.119> washer<00:01:48.360> or

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
that you want to put a washer or

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.260 
that you want to put a washer or
something<00:01:49.439> from<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> bottom<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.970> paint

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
something from the bottom of the paint

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.899 
something from the bottom of the paint
can<00:01:51.649> so<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.799> when<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.009> set<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.340> object<00:01:53.520> on

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
can so that when you set the object on

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.819 
can so that when you set the object on
top<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.270> its<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.750> objects<00:01:55.079> not<00:01:55.200> sitting<00:01:55.649> on

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
top of its the objects not sitting on

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.370

the lid itself if it's sitting on the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
it's pretty hard to remove afterward so

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.760 
it's pretty hard to remove afterward so
take<00:02:03.450> about<00:02:03.659> 40<00:02:04.020> minutes<00:02:04.049> from<00:02:04.380> once<00:02:04.680> you

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
take about 40 minutes from once you

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.419 
take about 40 minutes from once you
actually<00:02:04.920> cover<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:06.540> object<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:07.380> usually<00:02:08.190> pour

the acetone into a plastic container
that<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.120> safe<00:02:12.420> for<00:02:12.720> us

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
that is safe for us

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.670 
that is safe for us
toan<00:02:13.849> this<00:02:14.849> is<00:02:15.060> probably<00:02:15.480> polling<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.170> it

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
toan this is probably polling and it

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.280 
toan this is probably polling and it
doesn't<00:02:17.010> react<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.760> acetone<00:02:18.269> so<00:02:18.989> you<00:02:19.110> won't

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
doesn't react to acetone so you won't

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.140 
doesn't react to acetone so you won't
need<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.470> lot<00:02:19.709> of<00:02:19.739> acetone<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.610> need<00:02:20.819> just

need a lot of acetone you need just

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.630 
need a lot of acetone you need just
enough<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.690> make<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.989> paper<00:02:22.260> towels<00:02:22.620> wet<00:02:23.010> I

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
still going to be fumes in here so

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.690 
still going to be fumes in here so
careful<00:03:33.420> acetone<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.350> not<00:03:34.470> good<00:03:34.680> for<00:03:34.889> you<00:03:35.010> and

careful acetone is not good for you and
here<00:03:35.850> we<00:03:36.000> go<00:03:36.150> you'll<00:03:36.420> want<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.750> let<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:36.930> dry<00:03:37.319> it

here we go you'll want to let it dry it
is<00:03:38.190> still<00:03:38.430> completely<00:03:38.880> covered<00:03:39.329> in<00:03:39.420> acetone

is still completely covered in acetone

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.420 
is still completely covered in acetone
soon<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:40.980> acetone<00:03:41.489> will<00:03:41.970> evaporate<00:03:42.510> away

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
soon that acetone will evaporate away

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.059 
soon that acetone will evaporate away
it's<00:03:44.430> going<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.970> be<00:03:45.120> very<00:03:45.660> gummy<00:03:46.139> until<00:03:46.829> then

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
it's going to be very gummy until then

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.250 
it's going to be very gummy until then
so<00:03:47.639> try<00:03:47.850> not<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.150> like<00:03:48.359> don't<00:03:48.720> try<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:48.930> peel<00:03:49.230> it

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
so try not to like don't try to peel it

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.530 
so try not to like don't try to peel it
off<00:03:49.530> or<00:03:49.799> anything<00:03:49.950> like<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:51.060> let<00:03:51.209> it<00:03:51.329> dry

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
off or anything like that so let it dry

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.920 
off or anything like that so let it dry
and<00:03:51.810> I'll<00:03:52.109> come<00:03:52.350> back<00:03:52.380> to<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:52.769> when<00:03:52.920> it's<00:03:53.100> done

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
and I'll come back to it when it's done

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.780 
and I'll come back to it when it's done
so<00:03:54.930> on<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.200> Left<00:03:55.440> we<00:03:55.590> have<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:55.950> original<00:03:56.579> and

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
so on the Left we have the original and

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.819 
so on the Left we have the original and
on<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.299> right<00:03:57.510> we<00:03:57.810> have<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:58.170> after<00:03:58.650> the

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
on the right we have it after the

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.949 
on the right we have it after the
acetone<00:03:59.280> vapor<00:03:59.549> bath<00:03:59.849> and<00:04:00.569> as<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:00.810> can<00:04:00.900> see

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
acetone vapor bath and as you can see

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.660 
acetone vapor bath and as you can see
already<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:02.040> acetone<00:04:02.670> does<00:04:03.239> an<00:04:03.450> amazing<00:04:03.810> job

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
already the acetone does an amazing job

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.580 
already the acetone does an amazing job
smoothing<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:05.790> prints<00:04:06.139> the<00:04:07.139> way<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.440> the

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
smoothing the prints the way that the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.740 
smoothing the prints the way that the
acetone<00:04:08.040> eats<00:04:08.340> away<00:04:08.549> at<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.880> layers<00:04:09.269> it

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
acetone eats away at the layers it

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.740 
acetone eats away at the layers it
leaves<00:04:09.989> a<00:04:10.109> very<00:04:10.349> smooth<00:04:10.799> surface<00:04:10.829> behind

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
leaves a very smooth surface behind

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.690 
leaves a very smooth surface behind
which<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.840> think<00:04:13.109> looks<00:04:13.709> really<00:04:14.099> good<00:04:14.280> for

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
which I think looks really good for

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.819 
which I think looks really good for
organic<00:04:15.209> shapes<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.930> can<00:04:15.959> even<00:04:16.320> see<00:04:16.530> the

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
organic shapes you can even see the

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.250 
organic shapes you can even see the
amount<00:04:17.130> of<00:04:17.220> light<00:04:17.430> reflected<00:04:18.120> off<00:04:18.269> you<00:04:19.139> can

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
amount of light reflected off you can

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.860 
amount of light reflected off you can
see<00:04:19.410> just<00:04:19.709> how<00:04:19.859> smooth<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:20.489> is

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
see just how smooth that is

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.590 
see just how smooth that is
and<00:04:22.199> as<00:04:22.620> we<00:04:22.800> zoom<00:04:22.830> up<00:04:23.220> closer<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:24.060> original

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
and as we zoom up closer to the original

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.390 
and as we zoom up closer to the original
you<00:04:24.840> can<00:04:24.870> really<00:04:25.290> see<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.650> layers<00:04:25.919> that<00:04:26.250> are

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
you can really see the layers that are

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.390 
you can really see the layers that are
left<00:04:26.550> behind<00:04:26.610> after<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.300> printing<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:28.400> it's

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
left behind after the printing and it's

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.700 
left behind after the printing and it's
those<00:04:29.910> layers<00:04:30.120> just<00:04:30.270> aren't<00:04:30.810> as<00:04:30.900> visible

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
those layers just aren't as visible

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.180 
those layers just aren't as visible
after<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.699> acetone

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.920 

the<00:04:37.190> acetone<00:04:37.639> affects<00:04:38.030> more<00:04:38.330> than<00:04:38.360> just<00:04:38.810> the

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
the acetone affects more than just the

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.930 
the acetone affects more than just the
appearance<00:04:39.470> it<00:04:39.860> also<00:04:40.009> affects<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.610> strength

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
appearance it also affects the strength

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.450 
appearance it also affects the strength
of<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.300> prints<00:04:41.590> that<00:04:42.590> Sheen<00:04:42.919> that<00:04:42.949> you<00:04:43.220> see

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
of the prints that Sheen that you see

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.189 
of the prints that Sheen that you see
means<00:04:43.819> that<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.120> layers<00:04:44.330> have<00:04:44.690> melted

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
means that the layers have melted

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.490 
means that the layers have melted
together<00:04:45.789> which<00:04:46.789> increases<00:04:47.569> the<00:04:47.930> adhesion

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
together which increases the adhesion

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.770 
together which increases the adhesion
between<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.860> layers<00:04:49.159> means<00:04:50.060> I<00:04:50.240> can<00:04:50.419> handle

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
between the layers means I can handle

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.619 
between the layers means I can handle
much<00:04:51.080> higher<00:04:51.379> shear<00:04:51.979> forces<00:04:52.509> before<00:04:53.509> the

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:53.629 
much higher shear forces before the

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:56.439 
much higher shear forces before the
layers<00:04:53.840> start<00:04:54.199> to<00:04:54.349> separate<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:55.240> that<00:04:56.240> layer

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
layers start to separate and that layer

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.499 
layers start to separate and that layer
separation<00:04:57.169> is<00:04:57.319> often<00:04:57.889> a<00:04:58.099> big<00:04:58.669> failure<00:04:59.000> point

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
separation is often a big failure point

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.879 
separation is often a big failure point
for<00:04:59.900> 3d<00:05:00.319> printed<00:05:00.620> parts<00:05:02.379> you<00:05:03.379> will<00:05:03.560> have<00:05:03.800> to

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
for 3d printed parts you will have to

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.040 
for 3d printed parts you will have to
take<00:05:04.039> into<00:05:04.190> consideration<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:05.300> shape<00:05:05.599> of<00:05:05.810> the

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
take into consideration the shape of the

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.020 
take into consideration the shape of the
part<00:05:06.289> that<00:05:06.500> you're<00:05:06.650> smoothing<00:05:06.919> though<00:05:07.220> the

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
part that you're smoothing though the

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.570 
part that you're smoothing though the
vapor<00:05:08.270> may<00:05:08.630> not<00:05:08.810> reach<00:05:09.020> every<00:05:09.590> area<00:05:09.860> equally

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
vapor may not reach every area equally

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.080 
vapor may not reach every area equally
which<00:05:11.090> means<00:05:11.419> that<00:05:11.919> areas<00:05:12.919> that<00:05:13.250> are<00:05:13.490> kind<00:05:13.909> of

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
which means that areas that are kind of

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.200 
which means that areas that are kind of
hidden<00:05:14.330> by<00:05:15.110> other<00:05:15.440> parts<00:05:15.770> of<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:15.949> prints<00:05:16.310> like

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
hidden by other parts of the prints like

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.249 
hidden by other parts of the prints like
the<00:05:17.419> top<00:05:17.870> here<00:05:18.669> will<00:05:19.669> not<00:05:19.849> get<00:05:20.539> quite<00:05:21.080> as

the top here will not get quite as

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
smooth as the outside of the prints so

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.689 
smooth as the outside of the prints so
you<00:05:25.009> have<00:05:25.220> to<00:05:25.340> keep<00:05:25.490> that<00:05:25.669> in<00:05:25.729> mind<00:05:26.030> also<00:05:26.560> any
