speaking<00:00:13.639> proportion<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.790> art<00:00:15.000> refers<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.509> two

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
speaking proportion in art refers to two

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.980 
speaking proportion in art refers to two
different<00:00:16.320> things<00:00:16.699> one<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.510> natural

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
artist creates those proportions in such

artist creates those proportions in such
a<00:00:32.880> way<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.360> when<00:00:33.899> spectator<00:00:34.530> looks<00:00:35.010> at<00:00:35.219> an<00:00:35.399> a

a way that when spectator looks at an a

a way that when spectator looks at an a
piece<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.120> art<00:00:36.680> he<00:00:37.680> or<00:00:37.890> she<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.840> see<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.960> as

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
piece of art he or she can see it as

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.700 
piece of art he or she can see it as
real<00:00:40.410> as<00:00:40.620> possible<00:00:41.870> for<00:00:42.870> instance<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.500> this

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
real as possible for instance in this

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.200 
real as possible for instance in this
painting<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.520> see<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
painting you can see that the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.860 
painting you can see that the
proportions<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.829> head<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
proportions of the head and the the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.400 
proportions of the head and the the
torso<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.590> other<00:00:49.860> other<00:00:50.250> body<00:00:50.550> parts<00:00:50.969> are

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
torso and the other other body parts are

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.889 
torso and the other other body parts are
are<00:00:52.410> natural<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.309> real<00:00:53.579> therefore<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
are natural and real therefore the

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.380 
are natural and real therefore the
spectator<00:00:55.399> looks<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.820> painting<00:00:57.059> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
spectator looks at this painting and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.619 
spectator looks at this painting and
sees<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:58.050> real<00:00:58.710> figure<00:00:59.430> standing<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.180> front<00:01:00.359> of

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
sees a real figure standing in front of

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.050 
sees a real figure standing in front of
him<00:01:00.840> or<00:01:01.020> her<00:01:01.640> whereas<00:01:02.640> if<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:02.910> make<00:01:04.010> the

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
him or her whereas if we make the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.250 
him or her whereas if we make the
distortions<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.330> different<00:01:06.750> parts<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
distortions in different parts of the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.940 
distortions in different parts of the
body<00:01:07.610> we<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.820> manipulate<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:10.409> figure<00:01:10.740> in

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
body we can manipulate the figure in

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.800 
body we can manipulate the figure in
such<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> way<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:13.049> doesn't<00:01:13.350> look<00:01:14.100> natural

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
such a way that it doesn't look natural

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.670 
such a way that it doesn't look natural
but<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.049> gets<00:01:16.560> closer<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.100> our<00:01:17.670> idea<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:19.080> our

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
but it gets closer to our idea and our

philosophically<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:23.610> want<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.970> put<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
philosophically we want to put on the

that means the object which is closer to

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.780 
that means the object which is closer to
you<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.390> usually<00:01:46.320> larger<00:01:46.890> than<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.340> object

you is usually larger than the object

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.690 
you is usually larger than the object
which<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.090> further<00:01:48.360> away<00:01:48.750> from<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.700> for

which is further away from you and for
instance<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.750> painting<00:01:52.790> you<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:53.820> see

instance in this painting you can see
the<00:01:54.540> same<00:01:54.780> bird<00:01:56.540> getting<00:01:57.540> smaller<00:01:58.020> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the same bird getting smaller and

I have manipulated the proportion to

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.780 
I have manipulated the proportion to
