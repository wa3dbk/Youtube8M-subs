here and you're gonna want to collect
probably<00:01:00.280> 40-plus<00:01:01.280> snowballs<00:01:01.850> depending<00:01:02.780> on

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
probably 40-plus snowballs depending on

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.970 
probably 40-plus snowballs depending on
your<00:01:02.960> range<00:01:03.140> level<00:01:03.530> if<00:01:03.590> you<00:01:03.680> have<00:01:03.710> higher

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
your range level if you have higher

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.359 
your range level if you have higher
range<00:01:04.280> it's<00:01:04.549> a<00:01:04.610> lot<00:01:04.789> easier<00:01:05.299> and<00:01:06.069> it<00:01:07.069> collects

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
range it's a lot easier and it collects

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:08.709 
range it's a lot easier and it collects
automatically<00:01:07.969> I<00:01:08.029> didn't<00:01:08.270> collect<00:01:08.420> enough

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:08.719 
automatically I didn't collect enough

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.469 
automatically I didn't collect enough
here<00:01:08.899> but<00:01:09.109> uh<00:01:09.139> just<00:01:10.130> try<00:01:10.549> to<00:01:10.609> collect<00:01:10.819> about<00:01:10.999> 40

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
here but uh just try to collect about 40

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.059 
here but uh just try to collect about 40
I<00:01:11.509> think<00:01:11.569> that's<00:01:11.869> you'll<00:01:12.319> you'll<00:01:12.590> definitely

00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:13.069 
I think that's you'll you'll definitely

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:15.129 
I think that's you'll you'll definitely
need<00:01:13.189> 30<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:13.789> if<00:01:14.209> you<00:01:14.359> screw<00:01:14.659> up<00:01:14.689> because<00:01:14.990> your

00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:15.139 
need 30 and if you screw up because your

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:16.359 
need 30 and if you screw up because your
range<00:01:15.319> level<00:01:15.649> is<00:01:15.740> not<00:01:15.920> high<00:01:16.009> enough<00:01:16.039> you're

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
range level is not high enough you're

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.010 
range level is not high enough you're
gonna<00:01:16.429> need<00:01:16.639> more<00:01:16.849> so<00:01:17.450> then<00:01:17.659> you're<00:01:17.779> wondering

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
and you're gonna see the gull inches and

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.769 
and you're gonna see the gull inches and
what<00:01:22.909> you're<00:01:22.999> gonna<00:01:23.090> want<00:01:23.299> to<00:01:23.359> do<00:01:23.479> is<00:01:23.569> equip

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:23.779 
what you're gonna want to do is equip

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:26.109 
what you're gonna want to do is equip
the<00:01:23.929> snowballs<00:01:24.319> and<00:01:24.590> attack<00:01:25.369> these<00:01:25.520> guys<00:01:25.579> with

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
the snowballs and attack these guys with

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.690 
the snowballs and attack these guys with
them<00:01:26.359> and<00:01:26.539> it<00:01:27.200> takes<00:01:27.409> three<00:01:27.770> hits<00:01:28.009> each<00:01:28.249> and

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
them and it takes three hits each and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.219 
them and it takes three hits each and
sometimes<00:01:29.299> you'll<00:01:29.450> miss<00:01:29.479> I<00:01:29.719> didn't<00:01:29.929> miss<00:01:30.049> much

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
sometimes you'll miss I didn't miss much

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.080 
sometimes you'll miss I didn't miss much
because<00:01:30.499> I<00:01:30.560> have<00:01:30.679> higher<00:01:31.249> range<00:01:31.549> but<00:01:31.819> it<00:01:31.939> takes

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
because I have higher range but it takes

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.980 
because I have higher range but it takes
three<00:01:32.389> hits<00:01:32.929> each<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:34.749> then<00:01:35.749> they'll

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
three hits each and then they'll

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.019 
three hits each and then they'll
collapse<00:01:36.649> and<00:01:37.009> shatter<00:01:37.279> into<00:01:37.490> these<00:01:37.729> shards

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:38.029 
collapse and shatter into these shards

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
collapse and shatter into these shards
and<00:01:38.209> you're<00:01:38.329> gonna<00:01:38.419> want<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.719> pick<00:01:38.779> up<00:01:38.929> the
