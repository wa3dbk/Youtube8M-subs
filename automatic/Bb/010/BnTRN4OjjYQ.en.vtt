 1 but same time 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.990
 is that the squadron is heated until covered up by now ie about 1

 35 million public treatments 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.510
 thiago across the planet it seems to me that it is in is that the world is 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.570
 about to face a water crisis 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.490
 but that is exactly what is coming to pass, but only one 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.290
 very small part of all the water on the planet earth serves to supply the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.309
 population 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:12.659
 within the country to have problems with lack of water and the picture tends to worsen 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:17.709
 a projection made by scientists a title that in the year 2025 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.329
 2 503 inhabitants on the planet will be affected in some way it is right 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:29.659
 afterwards will be subjected to diseases such as cholera caused by 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.819
 poor water quality in the world but even having a future we will wait 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.980
 ahead of society and government 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.980
 has not been concerned about the issue of water 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.190
 then by ordinary citizens of mucus since the former president so precious 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.080
 and governments have not acted in a way that should 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.980
 score was enough of awareness is this 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.319
 ecopista health preservation of araguaína bahrein existence in the day 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.669
 December 13 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.629
 we can see the neglect of power 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.899
 public and society satellite image 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:06.349
 of points where there is the disposal of untreated waste 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.329
 that are collected in the residences 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.089
 of the population residing in that area and disposed of in the environment 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:18.089
 at two points near the expressway 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:22.119
 one of the main corridors to the south zone of marília 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:24.099
 action is this 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.080
 which in addition to polluting the environment produces an intense odor 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.750
 that can be felt 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.390
 when you pass through this road or if you live in the vicinity of it 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.709
 ap 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:17.769
 after the use of water 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.039
 whether in the bath in the cleaning of crockery a discharge from a pot 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.330
 sanitation is the beginning of the formation of 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
 depending on the south there are distinct denominations 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.000
 waste from 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.400
 residences formed the domestic sewage 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.580
 those resulting from rainwater are called sewage 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.620
 cops 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.070
 and those formed in the manufacturing process are called sewers 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.969
 industrial 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:52.289
 this differentiation is important because for each type there is formation 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.639
 of different substances 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.810
 and needs of these specific topics to remove and treat waste 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:05.349
 generally untreated sewage has numerous pathogens 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.360
 microorganisms toxic residues in nutrients that cause the growth of 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.870
 other types of 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.740
 only or fungi present in fewer numbers 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.860
 for this reason, sewage collection and treatment systems are important 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.460
 to health 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.040
 because I saw the risk of contamination as the transmission of diseases 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.770
 and it is also the environment with regard to pollution control of 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.770
 waters that are so scarce today 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:40.749
 The examples shown in the city of Marília are just two of several 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:43.840
 Existing untreated waste disposal points 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:46.759
 because there are many 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.639
 while a port city and maria with large collections of 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.970
 exempt all residues from residences 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:56.460
 in nature 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.619
 without worrying about environmental degradation 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:03.139
 and with the future losses that this attitude may cause 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.520
 already lasting for many years 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.000
 a town about 25 kilometers from marília 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:13.749
 with a population of 6 thousand inhabitants 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:15.460
 called east 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.900
 now has 100% of its generated waste 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:21.029
 treated 

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:26.129
 for this reason we visited the sewage treatment plant of the eastern city 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:29.049
 to show how this water treatment is done
