00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
these are all my star pics they have

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.530 
these are all my star pics they have
they<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:46.400> like<00:01:47.400> a<00:01:47.430> star<00:01:47.940> thing<00:01:48.300> in

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
they have like a like a star thing in

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.060 
they have like a like a star thing in
the<00:01:48.630> middle<00:01:49.640> it's<00:01:50.640> eat<00:01:51.300> the<00:01:52.290> pack<00:01:52.530> said<00:01:52.890> it's

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
the middle it's eat the pack said it's

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.480 
the middle it's eat the pack said it's
for<00:01:53.310> grip<00:01:53.870> and<00:01:54.870> I<00:01:55.320> guess<00:01:55.650> that's<00:01:55.920> kind<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.310> true

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
for grip and I guess that's kind of true

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.730 
for grip and I guess that's kind of true
because<00:01:59.490> you<00:02:00.060> know<00:02:00.180> put<00:02:00.990> your<00:02:01.230> thumb<00:02:01.470> through

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
because you know put your thumb through

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.160 
because you know put your thumb through
it<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:03.300> it's<00:02:04.020> pretty<00:02:04.170> comfortable<00:02:04.790> so<00:02:06.170> those

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
it and it's pretty comfortable so those

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.619 
it and it's pretty comfortable so those
are<00:02:07.200> all<00:02:07.380> my<00:02:07.560> star<00:02:08.340> pics<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.940> had<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> couple<00:02:09.390> more
