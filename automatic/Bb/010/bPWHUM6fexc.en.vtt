lesson this lesson is going to consist
of<00:00:04.830> trying<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.310> find<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.819> five<00:00:06.060> different

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:06.859 
of trying to find the five different

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.120 
of trying to find the five different
positions<00:00:07.859> using<00:00:08.130> one<00:00:08.550> specific<00:00:09.150> root<00:00:09.420> note

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
positions using one specific root note

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.230 
positions using one specific root note
this<00:00:11.130> case<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.550> what<00:00:11.670> I'm<00:00:11.759> going<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.910> do<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.150> I'm

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
this case of what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.879 
this case of what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.420> choose<00:00:12.630> C<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.349> I'm<00:00:13.440> going<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.590> choose

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
going to choose C so I'm going to choose

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.769 
going to choose C so I'm going to choose
the<00:00:14.480> the<00:00:15.480> first<00:00:16.080> fret<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.310> B<00:00:17.490> string

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
the the first fret on the B string

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.850 
the the first fret on the B string
that's<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.900> see

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
that's a see

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.420 
that's a see
so<00:00:21.860> in<00:00:22.280> order<00:00:22.850> to<00:00:23.029> find<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:23.450> next<00:00:23.630> route<00:00:24.430> what

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
so in order to find the next route what

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.160 
so in order to find the next route what
you're<00:00:25.610> going<00:00:25.760> to<00:00:25.820> do<00:00:26.000> is<00:00:26.180> go<00:00:26.330> over<00:00:26.570> a<00:00:26.779> whole

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
you're going to do is go over a whole

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.480 
you're going to do is go over a whole
step<00:00:27.470> and<00:00:27.849> up<00:00:28.849> one<00:00:29.270> two<00:00:29.660> three<00:00:30.290> strings<00:00:30.770> up<00:00:31.130> to

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
step and up one two three strings up to

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:41.540 
step and up one two three strings up to
the<00:00:31.670> a<00:00:31.700> string<00:00:32.300> so<00:00:36.280> this<00:00:37.280> is<00:00:37.309> position<00:00:37.970> one

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.520 

now<00:00:42.550> starting<00:00:43.030> from<00:00:43.210> that<00:00:43.360> same<00:00:43.720> see<00:00:44.170> that<00:00:44.410> we

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
now starting from that same see that we

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.650 
now starting from that same see that we
found<00:00:44.740> on<00:00:44.950> the<00:00:45.070> a<00:00:45.100> string<00:00:45.480> we're<00:00:46.480> going<00:00:46.600> to

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
found on the a string we're going to

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.380 
found on the a string we're going to
drop<00:00:46.870> down<00:00:46.930> two<00:00:47.410> strings

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
drop down two strings

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.850 
drop down two strings
and<00:00:49.989> also<00:00:50.350> one<00:00:50.860> whole<00:00:51.070> step<00:00:51.280> in<00:00:51.640> between

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and also one whole step in between

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.830 
and also one whole step in between
that's<00:00:53.860> your<00:00:54.100> position<00:00:54.280> too<00:00:54.910> that<00:00:54.940> you<00:00:55.629> can

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
that's your position too that you can

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.939 
that's your position too that you can
find<00:00:56.110> your<00:00:56.290> cenotes<00:00:58.590> now<00:00:59.590> if<00:00:59.710> you<00:00:59.800> go<00:00:59.920> over

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
find your cenotes now if you go over

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.490 
find your cenotes now if you go over
start<00:01:00.550> up<00:01:00.670> this<00:01:00.879> position<00:01:01.510> where<00:01:01.720> your<00:01:01.870> left

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
start up this position where your left

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.670 
start up this position where your left
off<00:01:02.649> with<00:01:02.829> that<00:01:02.980> same<00:01:03.220> see<00:01:04.199> now<00:01:05.199> this<00:01:05.379> one's<00:01:05.590> a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
off with that same see now this one's a

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.950 
off with that same see now this one's a
little<00:01:05.770> bit<00:01:05.979> harder<00:01:06.400> a<00:01:06.430> little<00:01:06.759> bit<00:01:07.690> harder

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
little bit harder a little bit harder

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.410 
little bit harder a little bit harder
stretch<00:01:08.290> but<00:01:08.560> basically<00:01:09.040> you<00:01:09.250> have<00:01:09.430> your<00:01:10.180> g

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
stretch but basically you have your g

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.530 
stretch but basically you have your g
string<00:01:10.680> your<00:01:11.680> low<00:01:11.890> E<00:01:11.920> string<00:01:12.190> and<00:01:12.729> that<00:01:13.240> same

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
string your low E string and that same

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.789 
string your low E string and that same
see

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
see

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:22.160 
see
that's<00:01:16.799> position<00:01:17.400> three<00:01:19.580> now<00:01:20.580> from<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.170> just

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
that's position three now from that just

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.960 
that's position three now from that just
like<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> octave<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.070> had<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.460> position

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
like the octave that we had in position

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.510 
like the octave that we had in position
two<00:01:24.270> you're<00:01:25.020> going<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.200> go<00:01:25.290> down<00:01:25.530> 2<00:01:25.830> steps<00:01:25.860> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
two you're going to go down 2 steps and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.550 
two you're going to go down 2 steps and
over<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> whole<00:01:27.180> step<00:01:27.450> herb<00:01:27.690> down<00:01:27.990> two<00:01:28.200> strings

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
over a whole step herb down two strings

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.889 
over a whole step herb down two strings
and<00:01:28.740> over<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> whole<00:01:29.250> step<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.450> have<00:01:30.659> both

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
and over a whole step so you have both

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.680 
and over a whole step so you have both
the<00:01:31.110> e<00:01:31.140> strings<00:01:31.680> accompanied<00:01:32.220> by<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.690> 10th

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
the e strings accompanied by the 10th

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.690 
the e strings accompanied by the 10th
fret<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> D<00:01:35.250> string<00:01:36.710> that's<00:01:37.710> position<00:01:38.280> for

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
fret on the D string that's position for

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.210 
fret on the D string that's position for
now<00:01:39.600> position<00:01:40.080> 5<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.649> going<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.830> bring<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.190> all

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
now position 5 is going to bring you all

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.090 
now position 5 is going to bring you all
the<00:01:41.490> way<00:01:41.520> back<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.299> essentially<00:01:42.930> one<00:01:43.890> mole

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the way back to essentially one mole

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.550 
the way back to essentially one mole
octave<00:01:44.580> above<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.060> first<00:01:45.299> fret<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:46.259> now<00:01:46.380> it's

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
octave above the first fret but now it's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.559 
octave above the first fret but now it's
on<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> 13th<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:47.610> you're<00:01:47.729> also<00:01:47.940> including

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
on the 13th but you're also including

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.669 
on the 13th but you're also including
the<00:01:48.690> 10th<00:01:48.929> fret<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.409> D<00:01:49.530> string<00:01:51.679> that's

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
the 10th fret on the D string that's

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.480 
the 10th fret on the D string that's
position<00:01:53.310> 5<00:01:54.080> so<00:01:55.080> what<00:01:56.069> I<00:01:56.100> would<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.369> is

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
position 5 so what I would do is

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.160 
position 5 so what I would do is
practice<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:57.060> trying<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.539> find<00:01:57.720> every

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
practice this trying to find every

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.919 
practice this trying to find every
single<00:01:58.560> no<00:01:58.770> see<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.970> know<00:02:00.060> start<00:02:00.330> start<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.810> day

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929

single no see you know start start a day
if<00:02:01.080> you<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.619> then<00:02:02.490> go<00:02:02.670> bc<00:02:03.210> all<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.869> sharps

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
if you have to then go bc all the sharps

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.350 
if you have to then go bc all the sharps
in<00:02:04.530> between<00:02:04.920> everything<00:02:05.429> and<00:02:05.909> you're<00:02:06.210> gonna

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
in between everything and you're gonna

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.779 
in between everything and you're gonna
know<00:02:07.110> where<00:02:07.619> all<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.160> really<00:02:08.280> need<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.519> do<00:02:08.610> is
