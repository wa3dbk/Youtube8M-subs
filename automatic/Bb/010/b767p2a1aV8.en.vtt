00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
than Jamie not a lot but I found the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.400 
than Jamie not a lot but I found the
suspension<00:02:14.579> just<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.970> little<00:02:15.299> bit<00:02:15.450> too<00:02:15.780> hard<00:02:16.109> I

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
suspension just a little bit too hard I

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.170 
suspension just a little bit too hard I
would<00:02:16.859> probably<00:02:17.100> get<00:02:17.609> it<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.819> little<00:02:18.030> bit

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
would probably get it a little bit

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.240 
would probably get it a little bit
softer<00:02:18.420> but<00:02:18.810> anybody<00:02:19.109> that<00:02:19.380> buys<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.709> dirt<00:02:20.040> bike

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
softer but anybody that buys a dirt bike

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.830 
softer but anybody that buys a dirt bike

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:24.389 
suspension that's just how it goes as a
