00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.850
 of course , on my own 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.080
 channel because this video will be yes 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.189

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.160

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.840
 with me once as Wednesdays comments 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.189
 and once on the n7 planstelle wanders 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.579
 is called I have no idea 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.899
 that would have to ask someone else now 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.760
 First of all what we do with and is 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.739
 a so that in deathmatch murders mw3 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.660
 I have played here with the acr 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.160
 Sounds like a magazine expanding the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.140
 I really have no idea about the perks 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.010
 real zero idea 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.850
 and there is somehow now so well 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.949
 lala 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.230
 Unfortunately, the first 17 die 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.050
 unfortunately one has in currently but 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.789
 you see it now I want you yes 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.140
 do not take away too much 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.149
 In any case, I should already here 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.049
 what kind of we love you 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.320
 tell 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.180
 namely that the public area of 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.369
 kubi I mean now the public 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.930
 teamleader that the public area full 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.600
 if we still have any people 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.320
 then we want to get them ourselves or 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.700
 then ask yourself but each kaya 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.369
 write applications that's no matter what 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.509
 you do or not but you become 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.439
 probably or you become relative 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.110
 certainly not taken because as I said 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.560
 I am full now and I am too 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.170
 not without 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.610
 These are really cool guys too 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.290
 still in switzerland and inside 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.880
 I'm not really that happy 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.979
 really great on the relaunch if it 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.320
 now everything starts and gets up 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.430
 every time a legendary time so now 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.799
 you should actually a topic namely 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.090
 the weather i think you will of the 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.729
 Most youtube you already heard yourself 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.220
 that the weather is easy at the moment 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.229
 donalds exaggerated my friends so 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.960
 that is not really normal in the 31 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.799
 32 degrees and as it were outside 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.659
 I do not want to run fan here 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.130
 I think it's full of heat and that 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.270
 was already thought over now 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.630
 actually one topic is namely 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.950
 why so many people gamble on it 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.119
 has my opinion two reasons the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.770
 first customer is of course that call of 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.030
 Duty and plaything has become because I 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.349
 My book I do not say about it because 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.849
 I think everyone will know it from you 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.920
 that call of duty just is not fun 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.300
 it does not matter anymore so I know it 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.739
 xbox and on pc that just too many 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.330
 running around people that's just zero 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.970
 bock makes if he gave this controller 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.739
 with collection and finances wants and that 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.470
 i think a reason why is real 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.209
 many recordings are now 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.769
 some people noticed something about it 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.670
 actually an old theme accent 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.170
 relatively fast happens relatively close and 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.950
 The second reason I think is like 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.200
 said to bathe weather summer sun beach 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.000
 leave wing whatever i know 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.260
 really the last two days I was not 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.650
 At home I have no idea 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.989
 provided 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.849
 Well, a bit halfhearted in the 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.890
 So get up early, Mr. Markus 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.780
 but it does not look so much because 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.970
 just never live 1000 times more fun 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.170
 makes as a gamble and currently and would be 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.269
 maybe not at all 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.739
 bad idea to go out to the 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.790
 but the fresh air for you 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.650
 Maybe she has it now 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:15.440
 not so special, I say now 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.220
 once almost yes that should be in principle 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.730
 already been 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.840
 every ear area already and is up 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.630
 every case is instructive 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.510
 template if you comment live mw3 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.100
 In general then years like that 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.870
 you can also sometimes you can 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.660
 I 'll look down in my kitchen 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.250
 The description is available every week 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.540
 two uploads once live once 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.500
 commented that here are for example 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.900
 a night with hits as well 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.340
 but I hope that there are a few 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.920
 see people of you who of course 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.690
 really real beast of you and yes then 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.980
 I would say or go in 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.980
 See it just fine
