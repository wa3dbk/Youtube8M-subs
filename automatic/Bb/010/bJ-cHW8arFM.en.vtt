00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.069
 hello everyone is welcome on 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.889
 the youtube channel of the website at 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.290
 of the year points like today 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.880
 I use the plate of the floral year to 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:23.070
 0.01 and I will use these patterns the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:26.550
 with hibiscus varnish I take the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.110
 vinyl luxury at cindy who's called who 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.110
 is called butterfly queen 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.820
 as usual promo scraper in 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.180
 rising plastic that rectangular 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.890
 with mons he is known and I buffered 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.890
 in white but hibiscus 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:15.340
 so in the end that's what it gives 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:18.190
 hibiscus from everywhere I remember that I 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.420
 used the 0.01 floret 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.440
 with his motives and so as 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.330
 usually we put a layer of top 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.100
 coat then so be super careful 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:33.399
 as usual when to put some 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:35.350
 top coat we really put a taste on 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.780
 take a big drop actually one in 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.600
 puts in the middle on the sides and touches 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.780
 more to nothing and above all we do not support 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.460
 the brush must be brush 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.030
 relatively light when you spend 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.030
 your top costs 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.179
 otherwise you will do all go 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.330
 therefore it is expected that it heated to a 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.680
 oil or cream as you want 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.680
 and that's another blows 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.140
 so soon for a next video
