00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.570
 so today is the people getting 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.640
 find for a new video on 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.650
 black ops 2 I know that I'm linking in this 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.150
 moment the black of the is in any case 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.710
 so you like me it makes me great 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.059
 pleasure 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.970
 but first of all I think you 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.589
 have noticed the quality of my microphone 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.830
 is not the same as usual 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.000
 so in fact the age and the helmet that 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.229
 I use on called me because he 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.330
 must know how to manage castes we use 

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:47.610
 one on my pc where I am I speak 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.049
 with skype etc and that I'm going even 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.989
 how to carve another on the wound 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:53.549
 so that's the tritton ax 180 brief and 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.140
 so basically I farted it's a moment 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:56.670
 headphones and I do not even want you 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.760
 tell how I pay them so it's 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.710
 So con wholesale and here I farted my 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.019
 headphones and I would change soon in this 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.970
 case I hope the quality is not 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.850
 disgusting compare a moment on 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.280
 helmet finally good we'll see well and so 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.289
 today people something 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.630
 again on my channel in any case on 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.250
 blackhawks 2 because good on ghost 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.479
 it was like that before 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.090
 it was logical knowing that they had 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.000
 no studio words on this part on 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.520
 this nuclear haye to 27 dresses 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.649
 below 10 kind sales settled with 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.280
 the focus so basically and here I have 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.829
 recorded live so there for once 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.020
 of quality on a present in any case 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.539
 on black ops 2 here I could 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.189
 recorded live now is sorry 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.590
 for old videos where precisely 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.600
 I promised you to register 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.310
 excuse me but gone live but 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.990
 nuclear except one but 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.499
 unfortunately I could not alas 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.689
 this time it's done so here 

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:58.049
 Nuclear is 27 to hatred on 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.760
 express map in hardcore domination so 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.610
 this v6 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.830
 so there at least what's cool is 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.260
 that you can really see what that 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.540
 gives on the job ie live 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.000
 what no studio mode because it's 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.560
 true that excuse me I 'm going to be 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.930
 honest with you the studio mode of 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.490
 time is a little disgusting we wait 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.810
 long done having balls that go 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.240
 next to really limit stuff we get 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.770
 says what he did he does not know 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.810
 too much happened on the spot 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.790
 because it gives something that happened 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.170
 not really gone like this again 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.270
 it's pretty cool to have a studio mode 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.000
 who record the parties and two 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.050
 previous and so I 'm fucking me 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.390
 we did not change how it's done 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.990
 I stammer my taste but this time 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.290
 no studio mode so live it 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.470
 pleasure and it will not be the last 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.940
 once I'm going straight down on the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.900
 registered parties that my case is 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.270
 not studio mode 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.620
 in any case I hope in any case 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.280
 the gameplay yeah I say a lot in 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.410
 anyway I know yesterday's gameplay 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.910
 so we were in a group to people 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.750
 in the group so I go to the sites and 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.660
 So there was this maaf frager ax 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.760
 exotic death were and someone 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.130
 that we did not know here and I go 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.100
 rhone were five people so I can 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.750
 say and we see there sorry if we are 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.980
 in europe 1 but unfortunately I 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.120
 play with my mates and conjure that my 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.010
 buddies to that happens to me to make 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.310
 gameplay so I inevitably you 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.170
 propose and here is a game I say I 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.739
 Assumed it completely I hate to play 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.530
 solo especially on this game to what is it 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.000
 true that I knew the time of 2 2 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.630
 when he was out he was everything 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.950
 fresh or downright a lot of people 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.810
 have talked about nuclear even me 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.940
 frankly excuse me for the term well 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.890
 sure a month I did not care there is not 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.150
 clear frankly I was playing just like 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.459
 that to have fun I was happy 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.870
 but now the time has changed for 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.380
 me now there is just the nuclear 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.140
 to all the stuff at strict series that 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.760
 I'm interested because frankly that 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.560
 request times it's a certain 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.400
 and that's exactly what I like about 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.560
 the game and so ben there it's true that I 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.329
 will be honest with you since my 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.400
 back on our 2 I noticed a few 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.829
 different things you compare back then 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.169
 is that now guys have fun 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.389
 completely to piss off the world of 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.489
 times that is to say that there you will see 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.080
 in the gameplay I think maybe in 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.180
 cut the aja I pulled it was to see if they 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.550
 still had bullets the guy is a 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.260
 little paranoid there are balls or not and 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.610
 so yeah I was saying that basically there is 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.919
 often guys who play at the 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.510
 thresher and that's up to you too 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.910
 that in the part we have completely 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.560
 made a carnage we managed to get rid of 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.240
 guys and whenever there was 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.460
 a risk or we had the risk that 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.479
 we will be us therefore me necessarily on 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.090
 this map is going to be a taboo I 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.139
 did not know the spawn of the shot 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.610
 I live you are going to Spain 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.900
 because with the people in my 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.310
 group I can tell you that there is frager 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.470
 already I think you've seen it the 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.699
 carie the first microphone he has carry it 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.139
 means he put us the microphone 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.460
 like that suddenly we bluntly 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.620
 it's like we've been told 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.999
 gaulle and he put the microphone in very little 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.030
 of time and suddenly we got it 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:08.199
 allowed to chain etc. 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.370
 someone who knows a lot of spawn 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.569
 besides, I'm dedicating 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.210
 pass a dedication to everyone it's 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:16.389
 to tell this match to exotic and amorphous 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.949
 us for ben here we will be able to do 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.629
 this part because it makes me feel that I 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.789
 am not the only one who made the 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:23.490
 nuclear you can see that there I 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.599
 do nuclear there in the first run 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.370
 Frag that did more than a few months 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.740
 he really knows the spawns on 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.689
 this game in a very good experience 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.219
 and so here it is true that nuclear 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:35.590
 I will be honest with you 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:37.810
 put another 10 why because we 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.310
 was in a group and that here are passengers 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.710
 could not continue the series because of a 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.000
 stupidity is not serious we do not care 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.500
 moment that I did the nuclear me that 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.469
 I'm going 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:50.650
 so I said it's true that there 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:53.349
 nuclear is one of my least stylish 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.520
 we'll say if we can say that because 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.439
 this is the group and it's true that 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.849
 there we chained like pigs and 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.889
 So that's not necessarily a 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:03.610
 nice nuclear but I still like 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:06.210
 to slow down and people who could 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.520
 to say it's spawn blocking 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.750
 frankly read is that in the 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.069
 part of admitting that an unlocking of his 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.770
 apart from that right now it's true 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:16.860
 I 'm alone in the spawn are three guys 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.569
 more than a few months ago 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.889
 oh fucking shit that's right in passing 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:22.899
 here I tried the nuclear double 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:23.740
 and I made fun of my mouth turn 

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:26.020
 these fucking my mouth 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.550
 finally, there's no blocking 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.560
 of spawn I will not even continue to 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.009
 debate on that no spawn blocking 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.419
 and for for the final score you can 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:36.370
 see that to guys who did 0 kills 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.860
 I also want to say that it's not 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.020
 boost it's guys limit we fell 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.879
 against 8 and the smart ones but in the end they 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.319
 did nothing thanks to the micro station 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:46.719
 because we simply judged 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:47.860
 and the guys had fun doing the 

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:49.539
 malignant and then that's it happened 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.300
 like that in any case it's the end of 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:56.680
 this video i will ask you 150 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:58.629
 like that I'm going to be like that I'm going 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.889
 try a ticket to me I tell you 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:01.599
 take care of yourself I wish you a 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.770
 good day a good evening cha cha 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:04.770
 or people at the next
