open this up the moment of truth
whoa<00:01:16.840> 1,200<00:01:17.840> miles<00:01:18.100> on<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.130> 32<00:01:20.030> thousand<00:01:20.480> mile

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
whoa 1,200 miles on a 32 thousand mile

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.840 
whoa 1,200 miles on a 32 thousand mile
v6<00:01:21.200> it's<00:01:21.770> almost<00:01:22.100> full<00:01:24.520> that<00:01:25.520> would<00:01:25.670> all<00:01:25.820> be

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
v6 it's almost full that would all be

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.050 
v6 it's almost full that would all be
going<00:01:26.120> into<00:01:26.420> your<00:01:26.600> engine<00:01:28.900> so<00:01:31.060> prototype

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
going into your engine so prototype

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.310 
going into your engine so prototype
worked<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:33.530> I<00:01:33.980> would<00:01:34.160> say<00:01:34.370> that<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.910> 4.0<00:01:35.810> v6

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
worked and I would say that the 4.0 v6

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.120 
worked and I would say that the 4.0 v6
needs<00:01:37.070> an<00:01:37.160> all<00:01:37.310> separator<00:01:38.530> okay<00:01:39.530> I<00:01:39.770> want<00:01:40.070> to

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
needs an all separator okay I want to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.240 
needs an all separator okay I want to
show<00:01:40.310> just<00:01:40.550> how<00:01:40.850> much<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:42.260> how<00:01:42.290> dirty<00:01:42.979> this

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
show just how much and how dirty this

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.980 
show just how much and how dirty this
oil<00:01:43.520> is<00:01:43.760> that<00:01:44.060> would<00:01:44.180> be<00:01:44.270> going<00:01:44.570> into<00:01:44.869> the

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
oil is that would be going into the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:57.280 
oil is that would be going into the
intake<00:01:51.940> this<00:01:53.290> can<00:01:54.400> holds<00:01:55.400> two<00:01:56.330> ounces<00:01:56.810> and

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
intake this can holds two ounces and

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.910 
intake this can holds two ounces and
that<00:01:58.250> was<00:01:58.400> probably<00:01:58.930> an<00:01:59.930> ounce<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.410> half<00:02:00.440> in

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
that was probably an ounce and a half in

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.219 
that was probably an ounce and a half in
there<00:02:01.850> at<00:02:02.180> 1,200<00:02:02.840> miles<00:02:04.750> so<00:02:05.750> that's<00:02:06.020> something

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
there at 1,200 miles so that's something

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.820 
there at 1,200 miles so that's something
you're<00:02:06.470> going<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.650> want<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:06.920> check<00:02:07.160> and<00:02:07.400> empty

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
you're going to want to check and empty

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.030 
you're going to want to check and empty
about<00:02:09.830> every<00:02:10.130> to<00:02:11.200> every<00:02:12.200> car<00:02:12.380> different<00:02:12.860> check

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
about every to every car different check

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.590 
about every to every car different check
it<00:02:13.160> at<00:02:13.250> two<00:02:13.400> thousand<00:02:13.910> three<00:02:14.000> thousand<00:02:14.480> miles

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
it at two thousand three thousand miles

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.960 
it at two thousand three thousand miles
you<00:02:14.780> may<00:02:14.900> need<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.170> change<00:02:15.350> it<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:16.459> empty<00:02:16.880> it

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
you may need to change it and empty it

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.759 
you may need to change it and empty it
every<00:02:17.959> 1,500<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.800> 2,000<00:02:19.340> miles<00:02:19.870> but<00:02:20.870> it's<00:02:21.500> well

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
every 1,500 to 2,000 miles but it's well

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.130 
every 1,500 to 2,000 miles but it's well
worth<00:02:21.980> it
