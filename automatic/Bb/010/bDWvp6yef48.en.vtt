we go up into the tunnels then we can

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.780 
we go up into the tunnels then we can
also<00:01:19.140> find<00:01:19.290> one<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> right<00:01:20.490> there

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
know when you have enough Souls then you

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.380 
know when you have enough Souls then you
need<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.409> bring<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.890> lantern<00:01:41.100> over<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.999 
that it could be and what they translate
to<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.630> within<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.110> game<00:01:58.290> if<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.979> are

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
to it within the game if you are

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.740 
to it within the game if you are
interested<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> deciphering<00:02:00.360> process

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
interested in the deciphering process

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.030 
interested in the deciphering process
then<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:00.930> do<00:02:01.049> have<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.320> separate<00:02:01.649> video<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:01.890> that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
then I do have a separate video on that

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.069 
then I do have a separate video on that
so<00:02:02.369> feel<00:02:02.610> free<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.820> check<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.090> out<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.930> this

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
so feel free to check that out so this

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.870 
so feel free to check that out so this
is<00:02:04.229> all<00:02:04.350> very<00:02:04.380> well<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.740> good<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.310> why<00:02:05.700> do<00:02:05.759> we

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
is all very well and good but why do we

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.510 
is all very well and good but why do we
need<00:02:05.939> these<00:02:06.270> names<00:02:06.570> well<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.920> tunnels<00:02:08.340> you

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
need these names well in the tunnels you

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.309 
need these names well in the tunnels you
can<00:02:08.640> actually<00:02:08.759> find<00:02:09.060> signs<00:02:09.479> with<00:02:09.840> these<00:02:10.050> names

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
can actually find signs with these names

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.020 
can actually find signs with these names
on<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.860> what<00:02:11.250> you're<00:02:11.370> going<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.520> need<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.790> do

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
on and what you're going to need to do

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.450 
on and what you're going to need to do
is<00:02:12.209> buy<00:02:12.629> either<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:13.080> bow

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
is buy either a bow

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.270 
is buy either a bow
knife<00:02:13.580> or<00:02:13.880> galvanic<00:02:14.390> all's<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.020> knife<00:02:15.860> the

knife or galvanic all's and knife the
signs<00:02:16.610> that<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:17.150> have<00:02:17.360> written<00:02:17.690> on<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.840> wall

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
signs that you have written on the wall

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.350 
signs that you have written on the wall
in<00:02:18.290> ciphertext<00:02:19.190> so<00:02:19.430> if<00:02:19.580> it<00:02:19.700> says<00:02:19.820> consumption

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
in ciphertext so if it says consumption

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.910 
in ciphertext so if it says consumption
cross<00:02:20.600> for<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:20.960> then<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.500> need<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.740> go<00:02:21.890> a

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
cross for you then you need to go a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.010 
cross for you then you need to go a
knife<00:02:22.280> consumption<00:02:22.880> cross<00:02:23.150> not<00:02:23.600> only<00:02:23.660> three

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
knife consumption cross not only three

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.810 
knife consumption cross not only three

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
of them and after you knife the third a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.050 
of them and after you knife the third a
wisp<00:02:26.750> will<00:02:27.140> spawn<00:02:27.530> now<00:02:28.280> wisps<00:02:28.730> are<00:02:28.820> only

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
wisp will spawn now wisps are only

wisp will spawn now wisps are only
visible<00:02:29.300> if<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.570> have<00:02:29.660> vulture<00:02:30.020> aid<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.410> what

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
visible if you have vulture aid and what

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.080 
visible if you have vulture aid and what
you<00:02:30.590> essentially<00:02:30.890> have<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.160> do<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.460> just<00:02:31.730> chase

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
you essentially have to do is just chase

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.750 
you essentially have to do is just chase
them<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.570> each<00:02:33.320> time<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.650> reach<00:02:33.920> one<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.580> will

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
them and each time you reach one it will

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.100 
them and each time you reach one it will
spawn<00:02:34.970> in<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.120> new<00:02:35.300> location<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:35.990> just

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
spawn in a new location and you just

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.060 
spawn in a new location and you just
have<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.260> chase<00:02:36.440> them<00:02:36.530> around<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.830> map<00:02:36.920> until

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
have to chase them around the map until

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.830 
have to chase them around the map until
you<00:02:37.250> eventually<00:02:37.490> reach<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.060> guillotine<00:02:38.450> you

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
you eventually reach the guillotine you

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.090 
you eventually reach the guillotine you
don't<00:02:39.050> need<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.230> hold<00:02:39.320> X<00:02:39.590> or<00:02:39.770> anything<00:02:39.920> like

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
don't need to hold X or anything like

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.470 
don't need to hold X or anything like
that<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:40.460> lot<00:02:40.640> of<00:02:40.700> people<00:02:40.910> think<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.150> do<00:02:41.330> but

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
that a lot of people think you do but

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.570 
that a lot of people think you do but
you<00:02:41.540> don't<00:02:41.780> as<00:02:42.230> long<00:02:42.440> as<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.650> run<00:02:42.920> into<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.430> and

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
you don't as long as you run into it and

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.460 
you don't as long as you run into it and
you<00:02:43.640> have<00:02:43.850> vulture<00:02:44.240> aid<00:02:44.390> you're<00:02:44.960> fine

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
you have vulture aid you're fine

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.320 
you have vulture aid you're fine
it<00:02:45.530> really<00:02:46.190> helps<00:02:46.460> with<00:02:46.580> this<00:02:46.760> if<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.150> get

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
it really helps with this if you get

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.670 
it really helps with this if you get
your<00:02:47.450> teammates<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.990> buy<00:02:48.110> vulture<00:02:48.410> aid<00:02:48.560> as

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
your teammates to buy vulture aid as

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.260 
your teammates to buy vulture aid as
well<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.070> it's<00:02:49.190> not<00:02:49.250> just<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:49.790> doing<00:02:50.120> it

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
well so it's not just you doing it

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.150 
well so it's not just you doing it
because<00:02:50.570> it<00:02:50.960> can<00:02:51.140> be<00:02:51.230> very<00:02:51.410> difficult<00:02:51.620> for<00:02:51.860> one

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
because it can be very difficult for one

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.430 
because it can be very difficult for one
person<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.820> make<00:02:52.970> all<00:02:53.240> the<00:02:53.540> like<00:02:53.780> individual

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
person to make all the like individual

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.640 
person to make all the like individual
jumps<00:02:55.100> they<00:02:55.220> need<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.520> get<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:56.210> the<00:02:56.660> wisps<00:02:57.020> so

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
jumps they need to get to the wisps so

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.170 
jumps they need to get to the wisps so
if<00:02:57.920> your<00:02:58.070> teammates<00:02:58.490> all<00:02:58.610> have<00:02:58.760> vulture<00:02:59.060> aid

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
if your teammates all have vulture aid

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.120 
if your teammates all have vulture aid
then<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.480> can<00:02:59.630> all<00:02:59.810> help<00:03:00.140> out<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.650> hopefully

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
then you can all help out and hopefully

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.940 
then you can all help out and hopefully
make<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.790> job<00:03:01.970> a<00:03:02.030> lot<00:03:02.210> easier<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:03.290> wisp<00:03:03.560> will

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
make the job a lot easier the wisp will

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.650 
make the job a lot easier the wisp will
finally<00:03:04.310> come<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.670> rest<00:03:04.880> at<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.330> guillotine

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
finally come to rest at the guillotine

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.330 
finally come to rest at the guillotine
itself<00:03:06.020> so<00:03:06.260> just<00:03:06.440> walk<00:03:06.650> over<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.070> it<00:03:07.190> and

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
itself so just walk over to it and

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.410 
itself so just walk over to it and
you'll<00:03:07.460> make<00:03:07.640> sure<00:03:07.670> that<00:03:07.910> you've<00:03:08.030> got<00:03:08.180> it<00:03:08.270> in

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
you'll make sure that you've got it in

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.540 
you'll make sure that you've got it in
place<00:03:08.660> then<00:03:09.500> all<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.740> need<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:09.980> do<00:03:10.100> is<00:03:10.280> kill

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
place then all you need to do is kill

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.330 
place then all you need to do is kill
five<00:03:10.910> zombies<00:03:11.630> but<00:03:12.320> they<00:03:12.470> have<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.830> be<00:03:12.950> zombies

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
five zombies but they have to be zombies

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.250 
five zombies but they have to be zombies
that<00:03:13.910> have<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.240> actual<00:03:14.480> light<00:03:14.690> from<00:03:15.080> the

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
that have the actual light from the

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.050 
that have the actual light from the
Whisperer<00:03:15.560> itself<00:03:15.920> or<00:03:16.100> go<00:03:16.280> to<00:03:16.340> them<00:03:16.730> as<00:03:16.850> you

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
Whisperer itself or go to them as you

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.870 
Whisperer itself or go to them as you
can<00:03:17.180> see<00:03:17.330> in<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.480> video<00:03:17.690> here<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:19.370> following

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
can see in the video here the following

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.360 
can see in the video here the following
step<00:03:20.150> is<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:20.660> one<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:21.110> took<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.860> most<00:03:22.130> time

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
step is the one that took the most time

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.710 
step is the one that took the most time
to<00:03:22.520> figure<00:03:22.760> out<00:03:22.910> when<00:03:23.150> we<00:03:23.360> were<00:03:23.450> doing<00:03:23.660> the

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
to figure out when we were doing the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.330 
to figure out when we were doing the
Easter<00:03:23.930> egg<00:03:24.020> for<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.170> first<00:03:24.470> time<00:03:24.770> it's<00:03:25.040> quite

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
Easter egg for the first time it's quite

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.040 
Easter egg for the first time it's quite
difficult<00:03:25.670> to<00:03:26.030> get<00:03:26.330> if<00:03:26.540> you<00:03:26.630> don't<00:03:26.780> avoid

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
difficult to get if you don't avoid

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.620 
difficult to get if you don't avoid
doing<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:27.740> what<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:28.040> need<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.280> do<00:03:28.610> is<00:03:28.850> first<00:03:29.510> of

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
doing so what you need to do is first of

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.600 
doing so what you need to do is first of
all<00:03:29.720> get<00:03:29.990> the<00:03:30.020> time<00:03:30.470> bombs<00:03:30.770> out<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.310> box

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
all get the time bombs out of the box

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.730 
all get the time bombs out of the box
these<00:03:32.510> time<00:03:32.750> bombs<00:03:32.960> are<00:03:33.140> going<00:03:33.350> to<00:03:33.440> allow<00:03:33.680> you

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
these time bombs are going to allow you

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.010 
these time bombs are going to allow you
to<00:03:33.890> actually<00:03:34.190> go<00:03:34.610> forward<00:03:35.240> in<00:03:35.540> time<00:03:35.810> rather

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
to actually go forward in time rather

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.380 
to actually go forward in time rather
than<00:03:36.200> back<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.760> way<00:03:37.910> you're<00:03:38.030> going<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.180> do

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
than back and the way you're going to do

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.430 
than back and the way you're going to do
that<00:03:38.570> is<00:03:38.720> you're<00:03:38.810> going<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:38.960> go<00:03:39.080> over<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.350> the

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
that is you're going to go over to the

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.350 
that is you're going to go over to the
guillotine<00:03:39.740> you're<00:03:40.490> going<00:03:40.610> to<00:03:40.670> place<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:40.970> time

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360

guillotine you need to be touching it in
some<00:03:48.050> way<00:03:48.200> as<00:03:48.380> far<00:03:48.590> as<00:03:48.650> I'm<00:03:48.830> aware<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.400> like

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
some way as far as I'm aware and like

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.850 
some way as far as I'm aware and like
there's<00:03:50.570> space<00:03:50.870> each<00:03:51.110> end<00:03:51.380> you<00:03:51.620> might<00:03:51.680> want<00:03:51.830> to

you<00:04:02.330> forward<00:04:02.630> in<00:04:02.990> time<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.800> round<00:04:03.980> infinity

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
you forward in time to round infinity

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.570 
you forward in time to round infinity
this<00:04:05.480> is<00:04:05.750> around<00:04:06.200> at<00:04:06.470> which<00:04:06.740> you<00:04:07.040> can't<00:04:07.370> kill

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
this is around at which you can't kill

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.340 
this is around at which you can't kill
zombies<00:04:08.000> they<00:04:08.330> still<00:04:08.600> follow<00:04:08.840> monkeys<00:04:09.230> and

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
zombies they still follow monkeys and

zombies they still follow monkeys and
things<00:04:09.560> like<00:04:09.710> that<00:04:09.860> but<00:04:10.100> it's<00:04:10.280> best<00:04:10.490> to<00:04:10.640> have

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
things like that but it's best to have

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.850 
things like that but it's best to have
weighed<00:04:11.120> them<00:04:11.420> rather<00:04:11.870> than<00:04:12.200> trying<00:04:12.470> to<00:04:12.560> kill

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
weighed them rather than trying to kill

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.700 
weighed them rather than trying to kill
them<00:04:13.100> because<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:13.700> won't<00:04:13.910> do<00:04:14.330> it<00:04:14.620> what<00:04:15.620> you're

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
them because you won't do it what you're

going<00:04:15.830> to<00:04:15.860> need<00:04:15.980> to<00:04:16.100> do<00:04:16.340> is<00:04:16.520> search<00:04:17.270> the

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
going to need to do is search the

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.539 
going to need to do is search the
characters<00:04:18.650> on<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.920> floor<00:04:19.190> that<00:04:19.430> are

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
scattered around the map for a switch so

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.240 
scattered around the map for a switch so
what<00:04:22.850> you<00:04:22.970> need<00:04:23.210> a

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
what you need a

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.980 
what you need a
obviously<00:04:24.670> to<00:04:24.760> be<00:04:24.850> very<00:04:25.030> vigilant<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:25.840> get

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
obviously to be very vigilant you get

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.720 
obviously to be very vigilant you get
about<00:04:26.110> 30<00:04:26.380> seconds<00:04:26.920> every<00:04:27.130> time<00:04:27.160> you<00:04:27.370> find<00:04:27.610> a

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
about 30 seconds every time you find a

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.370 
about 30 seconds every time you find a
course<00:04:27.970> you<00:04:28.120> get<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.330> little<00:04:28.540> bit<00:04:28.630> more<00:04:28.810> time<00:04:29.140> to

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
course you get a little bit more time to

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.150 
course you get a little bit more time to
search<00:04:29.620> and<00:04:30.000> either<00:04:31.000> Russ<00:04:31.630> man<00:04:31.810> Misti<00:04:32.440> Martin

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
search and either Russ man Misti Martin

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.950 
search and either Russ man Misti Martin
or<00:04:33.310> stillinger<00:04:33.820> will<00:04:34.030> be<00:04:34.150> on<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.510> floor<00:04:34.690> just

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
or stillinger will be on the floor just

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.480 
or stillinger will be on the floor just
their<00:04:35.110> corpse<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.620> you<00:04:35.710> search<00:04:35.950> it<00:04:36.190> and<00:04:36.340> if

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
their corpse and you search it and if

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.430 
their corpse and you search it and if
they<00:04:36.670> have<00:04:36.760> the<00:04:36.850> switch<00:04:37.090> then<00:04:37.450> you<00:04:38.110> got<00:04:38.260> lucky

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
they have the switch then you got lucky

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.050 
they have the switch then you got lucky
good<00:04:38.770> for<00:04:38.950> you<00:04:39.040> if<00:04:39.280> they<00:04:39.610> don't<00:04:39.820> then<00:04:40.030> you

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
good for you if they don't then you

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.580 
good for you if they don't then you
might<00:04:40.240> have<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.420> do<00:04:40.510> this<00:04:40.630> a<00:04:40.690> couple<00:04:40.750> times<00:04:41.200> but

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
might have to do this a couple times but

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.780 
might have to do this a couple times but
hopefully<00:04:42.040> you'll<00:04:42.130> get<00:04:42.250> there<00:04:42.460> in<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.670> end

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
hopefully you'll get there in the end

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.910 
hopefully you'll get there in the end
once<00:04:43.720> you<00:04:43.900> do<00:04:44.050> find<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.410> switch<00:04:44.620> you're<00:04:44.770> going

locations<00:05:44.560> on<00:05:44.800> the<00:05:45.040> map<00:05:45.220> I<00:05:45.460> will<00:05:45.850> show<00:05:46.120> you

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
locations on the map I will show you

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.240 
locations on the map I will show you
gameplay<00:05:46.419> of<00:05:46.690> all<00:05:46.870> four<00:05:47.260> locations<00:05:47.440> now<00:05:48.010> so

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
gameplay of all four locations now so

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
gameplay of all four locations now so
you<00:05:48.310> can<00:05:48.430> get<00:05:48.580> an<00:05:48.640> idea<00:05:48.700> for<00:05:49.000> where<00:05:49.150> the

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
you can get an idea for where the

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.290 
you can get an idea for where the
targets<00:05:49.630> spawn<00:05:49.960> and<00:05:50.229> it's<00:05:50.590> a<00:05:50.680> sharpshooter

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
targets spawn and it's a sharpshooter

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
easily the best gun for this you might

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.159 
easily the best gun for this you might
think<00:06:04.210> a<00:06:04.270> sniper<00:06:04.570> would<00:06:04.780> be<00:06:04.900> good<00:06:05.080> or

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
think a sniper would be good or

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:06.680 
think a sniper would be good or
something<00:06:05.380> like<00:06:05.470> that<00:06:05.530> but<00:06:06.190> it's<00:06:06.370> not

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
something like that but it's not

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.380 
something like that but it's not
seriously<00:06:07.690> use<00:06:08.290> the<00:06:08.590> PDW<00:06:09.280> for<00:06:09.729> a<00:06:09.760> start<00:06:10.090> it's

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.390 
seriously use the PDW for a start it's

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.120 
seriously use the PDW for a start it's
got<00:06:10.510> 50<00:06:10.840> bullets<00:06:11.080> in<00:06:11.169> a<00:06:11.260> clip<00:06:11.290> so<00:06:11.740> if<00:06:11.890> you<00:06:11.979> only

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
got 50 bullets in a clip so if you only

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.190 
got 50 bullets in a clip so if you only
fire<00:06:12.430> one<00:06:12.669> bullet<00:06:12.700> or<00:06:13.180> even<00:06:13.540> two<00:06:13.750> bullets<00:06:14.080> you

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
fire one bullet or even two bullets you

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.469 
fire one bullet or even two bullets you
won't<00:06:14.380> miss<00:06:14.530> any<00:06:14.740> targets<00:06:15.280> secondly<00:06:16.180> the

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
won't miss any targets secondly the

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.300 
won't miss any targets secondly the
reload<00:06:16.810> speed<00:06:17.080> on<00:06:17.200> it<00:06:17.320> is<00:06:17.440> great<00:06:17.680> anyway

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
reload speed on it is great anyway

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.159 
reload speed on it is great anyway
especially<00:06:18.580> if<00:06:19.030> you<00:06:19.180> have<00:06:19.300> slap<00:06:19.570> hand<00:06:19.900> and

thirdly the actual aim-down-sight moving

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.659 
thirdly the actual aim-down-sight moving
animation<00:06:23.169> is<00:06:23.290> just<00:06:23.320> generally<00:06:24.100> very<00:06:24.370> very

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
animation is just generally very very

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:27.300 
animation is just generally very very
smooth<00:06:25.210> it's<00:06:25.450> it's<00:06:25.630> it's<00:06:25.870> a<00:06:25.960> great<00:06:26.200> gun<00:06:26.440> so<00:06:27.010> use

permanent fire sale from this extra step

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.200 
permanent fire sale from this extra step
which<00:07:11.020> is<00:07:11.050> awesome<00:07:11.650> but<00:07:12.280> there's<00:07:12.970> not<00:07:13.090> really

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.210 
which is awesome but there's not really
