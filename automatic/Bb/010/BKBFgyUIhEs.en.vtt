00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
own ways of playing tournaments and this

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.959 
own ways of playing tournaments and this
is<00:00:46.020> merely<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> way<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.890> would<00:00:47.399> recommend<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
is merely the way I would recommend a

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.150 
is merely the way I would recommend a
beginning<00:00:48.390> player<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.469> play<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> first

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
beginning player to play in the first

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.939 
beginning player to play in the first
quartile<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.940> torment<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.829> would<00:00:52.829> recommend

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
quartile of a torment I would recommend

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.600 
quartile of a torment I would recommend
playing<00:00:53.760> tight<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.420> then<00:00:55.350> slowly<00:00:55.829> more

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
playing tight and then slowly more

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.630 
playing tight and then slowly more
aggressive<00:00:57.120> towards<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> end<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:59.280> by<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.579> I

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
aggressive towards the end and by that I

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.490 
aggressive towards the end and by that I
mean<00:00:59.730> in<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.510> first<00:01:00.719> quarter<00:01:00.989> you're<00:01:01.379> going

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
mean in the first quarter you're going

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.520 
mean in the first quarter you're going
to<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:01.620> playing<00:01:01.859> only<00:01:02.190> aces<00:01:02.969> kings<00:01:03.510> queens<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
to be playing only aces kings queens and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.060 
to be playing only aces kings queens and
Jack's<00:01:05.450> this<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.600> simply<00:01:06.900> because<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.560> pot<00:01:07.799> is

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
Jack's this is simply because the pot is

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.429 
Jack's this is simply because the pot is
going<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.880> small<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.229> not

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
going to be so small that it is not

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.890 
going to be so small that it is not
worth<00:01:10.740> fiddling<00:01:11.640> around<00:01:11.760> with<00:01:12.150> tabs<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.720> are

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
worth fiddling around with tabs that are

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.830 
worth fiddling around with tabs that are
only<00:01:13.350> going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.740> win<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.100> dirty<00:01:15.030> chips<00:01:15.479> or

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
only going to win you dirty chips or

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.200 
only going to win you dirty chips or
could<00:01:16.320> potentially<00:01:16.890> bust<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.280> out<00:01:17.430> if<00:01:17.670> you

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
could potentially bust you out if you

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.870 
could potentially bust you out if you
got<00:01:18.240> overly<00:01:18.930> excited<00:01:19.409> when<00:01:19.439> playing<00:01:19.830> them<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
got overly excited when playing them the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.270 
got overly excited when playing them the
other<00:01:21.060> way<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.110> recommend<00:01:22.590> playing<00:01:22.979> is

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
other way that I recommend playing is

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.149 
other way that I recommend playing is
the<00:01:23.490> way<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.119> play<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.890> simply

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
the way that I play but this is simply

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.190 
the way that I play but this is simply
because<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.820> believe<00:01:27.390> I'm<00:01:27.570> good<00:01:27.810> enough<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.020> get

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
because I believe I'm good enough to get

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.440 
because I believe I'm good enough to get
away<00:01:28.320> from<00:01:28.470> dangerous<00:01:29.040> hands<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.360> to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
away from dangerous hands and that is to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.880 
away from dangerous hands and that is to
try<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.750> get<00:01:30.810> involved<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.350> pots<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
try and get involved in pots in the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.310 
try and get involved in pots in the
beginning<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.460> very<00:01:32.640> cheap<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.240> attempt<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
beginning for very cheap and attempt to

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.740 
beginning for very cheap and attempt to
hit<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> big<00:01:34.950> hand<00:01:35.280> that's<00:01:35.700> well<00:01:35.909> disguised<00:01:36.360> and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
hit a big hand that's well disguised and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
hit a big hand that's well disguised and
bust<00:01:37.530> your<00:01:37.710> opponent<00:01:39.320> this<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.619> would

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
bust your opponent this I would

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.069 
bust your opponent this I would
recommend<00:01:40.979> doing<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.610> them<00:01:41.820> any<00:01:42.150> sort<00:01:43.020> of

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
recommend doing with them any sort of

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.539 
recommend doing with them any sort of
pocket<00:01:43.470> pair<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.220> get<00:01:44.369> into

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
pocket pair that you can get into

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.480 
pocket pair that you can get into
cheaply<00:01:45.149> with<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.500> flop<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.040> if<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.310> hit

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
cheaply with to the flop and if you hit

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.240 
cheaply with to the flop and if you hit
it<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.640> hit<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.360> don't<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.720> don't<00:01:48.960> you

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
it you hit it if you don't you don't you

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.639 
it you hit it if you don't you don't you
could<00:01:50.250> also<00:01:50.460> do<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:50.909> with<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.479> suited<00:01:52.229> cards

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
could also do this with a suited cards

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.149 
could also do this with a suited cards
and<00:01:53.240> try<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.299> hit<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.659> flush<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.290> when<00:01:56.070> you

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
and try and hit the flush and when you

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.740 
and try and hit the flush and when you
don't<00:01:56.399> try<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.790> get<00:01:56.909> out<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.180> there<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
don't try and get out of there the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.660 
don't try and get out of there the
problem<00:01:58.110> with<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.890> most

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
problem with this is is that most

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.209 
problem with this is is that most
beginning<00:02:00.149> players<00:02:00.360> will<00:02:00.899> hit<00:02:01.500> their<00:02:01.680> ace<00:02:01.860> and

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
beginning players will hit their ace and

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.209 
beginning players will hit their ace and
then<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> poor<00:02:03.960> kicker<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.680> get

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
then have a poor kicker and get

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.950 
then have a poor kicker and get
themselves<00:02:05.369> knocked<00:02:05.820> out<00:02:06.030> which<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.780> not

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
themselves knocked out which is just not

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.960 
themselves knocked out which is just not
what<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.140> want<00:02:07.320> other<00:02:08.160> hands<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.729> would

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
what you want other hands that I would

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.449 
what you want other hands that I would
maybe<00:02:09.720> recommend<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.619> try<00:02:10.830> playing<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
maybe recommend you try playing in the

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.630 
maybe recommend you try playing in the
early<00:02:11.670> stages<00:02:11.940> if<00:02:12.330> you

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
early stages if you

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.610 
early stages if you
think<00:02:12.760> you're<00:02:12.880> up<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.000> it<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.620> suited

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
think you're up to it is suited

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.740 
think you're up to it is suited
connected<00:02:15.069> cards<00:02:15.520> or<00:02:15.670> just<00:02:15.850> connected<00:02:16.330> cards

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
connected cards or just connected cards

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.440 
connected cards or just connected cards
is<00:02:17.080> these<00:02:17.740> have<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.069> potential<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.580> obviously

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
is these have the potential to obviously

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.590 
is these have the potential to obviously
make<00:02:19.660> straights<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:20.410> small<00:02:21.250> flashes<00:02:21.700> but

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
make straights and small flashes but

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.630 
make straights and small flashes but
don't<00:02:23.470> go<00:02:23.620> chasing<00:02:23.920> hands<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:26.640> think

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
don't go chasing hands that you think

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.130 
don't go chasing hands that you think
that<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.940> could<00:02:28.090> possibly<00:02:28.300> get<00:02:28.690> on<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.930> turn

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
that you could possibly get on the turn

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.449 
that you could possibly get on the turn
on<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:29.380> river<00:02:29.590> you're<00:02:29.980> basically<00:02:30.400> looking

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
on the river you're basically looking

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.360 
on the river you're basically looking
for<00:02:30.940> an<00:02:31.030> exceptional<00:02:31.750> flop<00:02:31.990> so<00:02:32.800> when<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.220> go

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
for an exceptional flop so when you go

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.370 
for an exceptional flop so when you go
into<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.700> hand<00:02:33.910> remember<00:02:34.720> that<00:02:35.110> when<00:02:35.260> you're

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
into the hand remember that when you're

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.630 
into the hand remember that when you're
on<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.500> flop<00:02:35.770> what<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.160> what<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.459> were

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
on the flop what you what you were

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.449 
on the flop what you what you were
actually<00:02:36.790> looking<00:02:37.209> for<00:02:37.600> because<00:02:38.140> if<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.680> you

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
actually looking for because if you you

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.580 
actually looking for because if you you
know<00:02:39.489> pick<00:02:40.300> up<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.600> gutshot<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:41.320> wasn't

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
know pick up a gutshot that wasn't

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.470 
know pick up a gutshot that wasn't
exactly<00:02:41.709> what<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.250> intended<00:02:42.790> you<00:02:42.970> intended

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
exactly what you intended you intended

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.630 
exactly what you intended you intended
to<00:02:43.569> make<00:02:43.660> an<00:02:43.810> open-ended<00:02:44.319> straight<00:02:44.560> or<00:02:44.920> you

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
to make an open-ended straight or you

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.250 
to make an open-ended straight or you
know<00:02:45.790> an<00:02:45.940> open-ended<00:02:46.450> straight<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.959> flush

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
know an open-ended straight and flush

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.890 
know an open-ended straight and flush
draw<00:02:47.530> which<00:02:48.040> would<00:02:48.220> be<00:02:48.370> remarkable<00:02:48.720> so<00:02:49.720> don't

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
draw which would be remarkable so don't

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.979 
draw which would be remarkable so don't
get<00:02:50.080> yourself<00:02:50.230> deluded<00:02:51.220> by<00:02:51.400> all<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:52.570> only<00:02:52.720> need

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
get yourself deluded by all I only need

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.350 
get yourself deluded by all I only need
four<00:02:53.860> cards<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.580> make<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.760> straight<00:02:55.090> here

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
four cards to make a straight here

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.570 
four cards to make a straight here
because<00:02:56.200> then<00:02:56.560> you're<00:02:56.680> just<00:02:56.709> chasing<00:02:57.070> cards

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
because then you're just chasing cards

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.220 
because then you're just chasing cards
and<00:02:57.730> that's<00:02:57.880> not<00:02:58.090> what<00:02:58.239> we're<00:02:58.840> trying<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.080> do

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
and that's not what we're trying to do

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.920 
and that's not what we're trying to do
in<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.440> first<00:02:59.590> stage<00:02:59.860> of<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.100> tournament<00:03:00.930> so

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
in the first stage of the tournament so

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.470 
in the first stage of the tournament so
yeah<00:03:02.110> that's<00:03:02.550> kind<00:03:03.550> of<00:03:03.700> how<00:03:03.880> I<00:03:03.910> recommend

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
yeah that's kind of how I recommend

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.850 
yeah that's kind of how I recommend
playing<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.050> first<00:03:05.290> section<00:03:05.590> of<00:03:05.769> the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
playing in the first section of the

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.840 
playing in the first section of the
tournament<00:03:06.360> but<00:03:07.360> it's<00:03:07.540> entirely<00:03:07.959> up<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.260> you

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
tournament but it's entirely up to you

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.120 
tournament but it's entirely up to you
don't<00:03:09.850> go<00:03:10.150> for<00:03:10.180> any<00:03:10.480> big<00:03:10.720> Bluffs<00:03:11.019> because<00:03:11.410> if

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
don't go for any big Bluffs because if

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.280 
don't go for any big Bluffs because if
you<00:03:12.610> are<00:03:12.760> bluffing<00:03:13.000> you're<00:03:13.510> basically<00:03:14.080> trying

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
especially if you're playing the low

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.210 
especially if you're playing the low
stakes<00:03:22.810> this<00:03:23.200> person<00:03:23.470> is<00:03:23.650> going<00:03:23.799> to<00:03:23.860> call<00:03:24.040> you

stakes this person is going to call you

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.590 
stakes this person is going to call you
with<00:03:24.370> practically<00:03:24.820> anything<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.360> it's<00:03:25.450> just

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
with practically anything and it's just

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.380 
with practically anything and it's just
not<00:03:25.750> worth<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.190> it's<00:03:27.190> much<00:03:27.489> better<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.880> pick<00:03:28.239> up

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
not worth it it's much better to pick up

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.509 
not worth it it's much better to pick up
pots<00:03:28.690> in<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.590> later<00:03:29.829> stages<00:03:30.010> of<00:03:30.430> the

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
pots in the later stages of the

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.880 
pots in the later stages of the
tournament<00:03:30.940> where<00:03:31.360> one<00:03:31.630> pot<00:03:31.840> there<00:03:32.110> would<00:03:32.860> be

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
tournament where one pot there would be

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.569 
tournament where one pot there would be
worth<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.670> tote<00:03:33.880> around<00:03:34.950> four<00:03:35.950> pots<00:03:36.280> in<00:03:36.489> the

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
worth a tote around four pots in the

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.580 
worth a tote around four pots in the
early<00:03:36.820> stage<00:03:37.060> so<00:03:37.540> really<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:38.230> just<00:03:38.290> want<00:03:38.560> to

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
early stage so really you just want to
