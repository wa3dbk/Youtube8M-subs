00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.560
 another khan video 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.019
 Once again I will speak of spelling and 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.039
 Once again let's talk about changes in the 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.750
 our agreement 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.290
 but I will give an example a proof that 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.449
 not changed to the surprise of many who 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.729
 believe that this has actually changed. 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.579
 The word has not changed is the following 

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:46.729
 prefixes that have two rows and ends in 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.449
 vowel title infra air enters at 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:52.159
 micro tele mini rule new day 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.350
 only then was the word 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.659
 following start by h or if it was a 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.600
 equal vowel for example picking up the 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.220
 prefix to the tone that finishes the word 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.930
 next one begins with agathe by car 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.710
 hypnosis or by the letter itself 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.909
 self-observation has the rest is stolen 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.150

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.360
 definition when you have r or 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.210
 s you fold letter z self portrait is everything 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.200
 along with two self-sufficient eps together 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.990
 with two s 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.079
 and that's where the mini in history comes in. 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.750
 is a mini-hospital with the cat nif 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:29.570

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.840

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.750
 two s 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.460
 and if you invent the mini-reform will 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.490
 be with two erres 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.320

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.680

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:01.360
