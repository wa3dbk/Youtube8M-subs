00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.889 
okay so one of the first things I
noticed<00:01:16.210> because<00:01:16.320> after<00:01:17.320> I<00:01:17.350> filled<00:01:17.859> the<00:01:18.899> the

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
noticed because after I filled the the

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.260 
noticed because after I filled the the
water<00:01:20.140> reservoir<00:01:20.380> with<00:01:21.250> half-full<00:01:22.000> with

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
white vinegar is that the machine still

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.190 
white vinegar is that the machine still
wasn't<00:01:26.200> operating<00:01:26.829> I<00:01:27.250> was<00:01:27.549> pressing<00:01:28.109> when<00:01:29.109> it

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
wasn't operating I was pressing when it

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.020 
wasn't operating I was pressing when it
was<00:01:29.289> ready<00:01:29.469> to<00:01:29.590> go<00:01:29.740> ready<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.159> brew<00:01:30.340> I<00:01:30.549> was

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
pressing the big brew button and then it

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.169 
pressing the big brew button and then it
would<00:01:35.049> kind<00:01:35.229> of<00:01:35.350> chugga<00:01:35.619> chugga<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.130> then<00:01:36.729> go

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
would kind of chugga chugga and then go

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.020 
would kind of chugga chugga and then go
silent<00:01:37.959> so<00:01:38.350> nothing<00:01:38.860> was<00:01:38.979> moving<00:01:39.219> so<00:01:39.700> that

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
silent so nothing was moving so that

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.550 
silent so nothing was moving so that
usually<00:01:40.299> means<00:01:40.689> that<00:01:40.810> there's<00:01:40.959> a<00:01:41.049> blockage<00:01:41.439> of

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
usually means that there's a blockage of

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.039 
usually means that there's a blockage of
some<00:01:41.709> sort<00:01:41.979> so<00:01:42.819> a<00:01:42.850> couple<00:01:43.149> of<00:01:43.209> the<00:01:43.299> tricks<00:01:43.569> that

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.860 
in there and as well if you separate
this<00:02:31.930> into<00:02:32.109> two<00:02:32.230> pieces<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:33.569> hold<00:02:34.569> on<00:02:34.720> I'll

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
this into two pieces and hold on I'll

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.330 
this into two pieces and hold on I'll
show<00:02:34.900> you

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.020 

I<00:02:39.370> have<00:02:39.700> removed<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.450> cake<00:02:41.050> cup<00:02:41.230> holder<00:02:41.530> and

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
I have removed the cake cup holder and

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.250 
I have removed the cake cup holder and
pulled<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.150> apart<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.840> kind<00:02:44.050> of<00:02:44.080> have<00:02:44.230> to

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
pulled it apart and you kind of have to

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.690 
pulled it apart and you kind of have to
give<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.590> Yank<00:02:44.770> but<00:02:45.069> it<00:02:45.160> will<00:02:45.310> pull<00:02:45.610> apart

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
give it a Yank but it will pull apart

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.420 
give it a Yank but it will pull apart
and<00:02:46.140> which<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.290> great<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.890> know<00:02:47.920> because<00:02:48.280> I

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
and which is great to know because I

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.670 
and which is great to know because I
didn't<00:02:48.700> realize<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.360> needed<00:02:50.349> a<00:02:50.470> little

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
didn't realize that and needed a little

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.470 
didn't realize that and needed a little
bit<00:02:50.739> of<00:02:50.800> cleaning<00:02:51.190> so<00:02:51.670> in<00:02:51.880> there<00:02:52.090> as<00:02:52.300> well

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
bit of cleaning so in there as well

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.940 
bit of cleaning so in there as well
there's<00:02:52.810> another<00:02:53.050> sharp<00:02:55.410> point<00:02:56.410> a<00:02:56.560> needle<00:02:56.860> II

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
there's another sharp point a needle II

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.339 
there's another sharp point a needle II
thing<00:02:57.220> that's<00:02:57.730> what<00:02:58.090> pokes<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:59.019> bottom<00:02:59.260> of

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
thing that's what pokes the bottom of

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.500 
thing that's what pokes the bottom of
the<00:02:59.410> hole<00:02:59.530> in<00:02:59.769> the<00:02:59.860> cake<00:03:00.010> up<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.459> if<00:03:01.269> you<00:03:01.360> just

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
the hole in the cake up and if you just

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.000 
the hole in the cake up and if you just
flip<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.750> over<00:03:02.489> right<00:03:03.489> here<00:03:04.410> same<00:03:05.410> idea<00:03:05.769> you

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
flip it over right here same idea you

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.070 
flip it over right here same idea you
take<00:03:06.370> your<00:03:06.550> paper<00:03:06.640> clip<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:10.239> just<00:03:10.569> give

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
take your paper clip and you just give

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.150 
take your paper clip and you just give
that<00:03:11.350> a<00:03:12.000> couple<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.150> little<00:03:13.269> pokes<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:14.980> did

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
that a couple of little pokes so I did

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.070 
that a couple of little pokes so I did
that<00:03:15.280> after<00:03:15.880> using<00:03:16.060> my<00:03:16.180> paperclip<00:03:16.690> trick<00:03:16.900> I

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
that after using my paperclip trick I

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.830 
that after using my paperclip trick I
snapped<00:03:17.470> everything<00:03:17.920> back<00:03:18.069> in<00:03:18.310> place<00:03:18.840> closed

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
snapped everything back in place closed

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.320 
snapped everything back in place closed
it<00:03:20.019> up<00:03:20.140> and<00:03:21.870> still<00:03:22.870> nothing<00:03:23.200> was<00:03:23.380> working<00:03:24.299> so<00:03:25.299> I

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
it up and still nothing was working so I

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.690 
it up and still nothing was working so I
went<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.290> another<00:03:26.470> YouTube<00:03:26.860> video<00:03:26.980> which

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
went to another YouTube video which

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.289 
went to another YouTube video which
showed<00:03:28.060> me<00:03:28.269> a<00:03:28.299> trick<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:29.349> use<00:03:29.680> with<00:03:30.489> my<00:03:30.819> and<00:03:31.180> I

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
showed me a trick to use with my and I

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.509 
showed me a trick to use with my and I
just<00:03:31.480> happen<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:31.810> have<00:03:32.040> an<00:03:33.040> electric

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
just happen to have an electric

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.949 
just happen to have an electric
toothbrush<00:03:33.940> which<00:03:34.209> will<00:03:34.420> now<00:03:34.540> need<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.780> be

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
toothbrush which will now need to be

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.440 
toothbrush which will now need to be
replaced<00:03:35.319> and<00:03:36.160> that<00:03:36.220> involves<00:03:37.030> coming<00:03:37.209> over

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
replaced and that involves coming over

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.120 
replaced and that involves coming over
here<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:37.720> removing<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.410> water<00:03:38.590> reservoir

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
here and removing the water reservoir

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:46.699 
here and removing the water reservoir
and<00:03:43.709> there's<00:03:44.709> this<00:03:44.950> little<00:03:45.220> hole<00:03:45.400> right<00:03:45.430> here

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
and there's this little hole right here

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.930 
and there's this little hole right here
which<00:03:47.709> I<00:03:47.829> guess<00:03:47.859> sometimes<00:03:49.049> gets<00:03:50.049> blocked<00:03:50.940> and

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
which I guess sometimes gets blocked and

00:03:51.940 --> 00:04:04.819 
which I guess sometimes gets blocked and
then<00:03:52.570> you<00:03:52.780> just<00:03:53.079> clean<00:03:53.890> it<00:03:53.920> out

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.440 

I<00:04:04.860> didn't<00:04:05.519> do<00:04:05.579> it<00:04:05.700> for<00:04:05.730> any<00:04:06.030> length<00:04:06.239> of<00:04:06.390> time

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
I didn't do it for any length of time

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.149 
I didn't do it for any length of time
probably<00:04:06.930> just<00:04:07.379> about<00:04:07.560> 30<00:04:07.860> seconds<00:04:08.280> or<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:08.430> and

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
probably just about 30 seconds or so and

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.910 
probably just about 30 seconds or so and
I<00:04:11.159> thought<00:04:11.879> that<00:04:12.870> that<00:04:13.019> had<00:04:13.290> done<00:04:13.439> the<00:04:13.590> trick<00:04:13.739> I

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
I thought that that had done the trick I

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.649 
I thought that that had done the trick I
so<00:04:14.129> I<00:04:14.159> put<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.519> water<00:04:14.640> reservoir<00:04:14.909> back<00:04:15.329> and

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
so I put the water reservoir back and

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.240 
so I put the water reservoir back and
then<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:15.870> figured<00:04:16.410> that<00:04:16.560> with<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.799> toothbrush

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
then I figured that with the toothbrush

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.599 
then I figured that with the toothbrush
hint<00:04:18.139> that<00:04:19.139> maybe<00:04:19.769> that<00:04:19.979> would<00:04:20.160> have<00:04:20.280> loosened

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
hint that maybe that would have loosened

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.360 
hint that maybe that would have loosened
up<00:04:20.729> any<00:04:21.600> blockage<00:04:22.049> of<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.830> water<00:04:23.160> reservoir

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
up any blockage of the water reservoir

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.029 
up any blockage of the water reservoir
because<00:04:23.910> clearly<00:04:24.720> there<00:04:25.080> was<00:04:25.199> no<00:04:25.380> water<00:04:25.650> or

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
because clearly there was no water or

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.110 
because clearly there was no water or
vinegar<00:04:26.370> in<00:04:26.940> that<00:04:27.090> case<00:04:27.360> being<00:04:28.289> drawn<00:04:28.590> out

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
vinegar in that case being drawn out

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.749 
vinegar in that case being drawn out
what<00:04:30.120> happened<00:04:30.570> was<00:04:30.900> initially<00:04:31.889> it<00:04:32.370> worked

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 
what happened was initially it worked

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.909 
what happened was initially it worked
and<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:33.870> was<00:04:33.960> able<00:04:34.199> to<00:04:34.229> get<00:04:34.350> a<00:04:34.410> couple<00:04:34.590> of<00:04:34.710> cycles

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
and I was able to get a couple of cycles

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.770 
and I was able to get a couple of cycles
of<00:04:35.190> vinegar<00:04:35.550> in<00:04:35.610> then<00:04:36.150> according<00:04:36.539> to<00:04:36.600> the

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
of vinegar in then according to the

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.090 
of vinegar in then according to the
Keurig<00:04:37.080> manual<00:04:37.500> you're<00:04:37.650> supposed<00:04:37.889> to<00:04:37.919> let<00:04:38.010> the

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
Keurig manual you're supposed to let the

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.310 
Keurig manual you're supposed to let the
Machine<00:04:38.430> sit<00:04:38.699> for<00:04:39.479> four<00:04:39.720> hours<00:04:40.050> before

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
Machine sit for four hours before

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.400 
Machine sit for four hours before
flushing<00:04:41.310> it<00:04:41.430> out<00:04:41.580> with<00:04:41.880> your<00:04:42.060> water<00:04:42.389> when<00:04:43.380> I

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
flushing it out with your water when I

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.730 
flushing it out with your water when I
did<00:04:43.620> that<00:04:43.910> once<00:04:44.910> again<00:04:45.380> nothing<00:04:46.380> was

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
did that once again nothing was

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.620 
did that once again nothing was
happening<00:04:46.919> as<00:04:47.310> you<00:04:47.729> can<00:04:47.880> imagine<00:04:47.970> by<00:04:48.570> this

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
happening as you can imagine by this

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.469 
happening as you can imagine by this
time<00:04:49.110> my<00:04:49.949> frustration<00:04:50.520> is<00:04:50.639> clearly<00:04:50.970> mounting

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
time my frustration is clearly mounting

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.600 
time my frustration is clearly mounting
because<00:04:51.960> I<00:04:52.229> started<00:04:52.710> this<00:04:52.770> process<00:04:53.340> this

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
because I started this process this

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.150
