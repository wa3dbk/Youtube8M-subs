00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
how this works basically once you donate

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.190 
how this works basically once you donate
that<00:01:53.250> was<00:01:53.340> worth<00:01:53.460> one<00:01:53.820> entry<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.570> if<00:01:55.140> you

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
that was worth one entry and if you

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.050 
that was worth one entry and if you
donated<00:01:55.590> more<00:01:55.740> each<00:01:56.250> five<00:01:56.520> dollars<00:01:56.790> got<00:01:56.939> you

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
donated more each five dollars got you

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.420 
donated more each five dollars got you
another<00:01:57.270> entry<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:58.170> Tyler<00:01:58.649> came<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.100> at<00:01:59.189> one
