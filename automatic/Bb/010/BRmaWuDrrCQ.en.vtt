00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
a couple things no but just trade before

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.830 
a couple things no but just trade before
you<00:00:10.860> start<00:00:11.130> off<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.969> two<00:00:12.090> axles<00:00:12.480> already<00:00:12.750> been

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
you start off the two axles already been

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.560 
you start off the two axles already been
replaced<00:00:13.110> with<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.799> new<00:00:13.950> axle<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:15.210> we<00:00:15.360> need<00:00:15.509> to

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
replaced with a new axle so we need to

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.900 
replaced with a new axle so we need to
add<00:00:15.690> our<00:00:15.719> brake<00:00:16.049> line<00:00:16.230> kit<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.640> our

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
add our brake line kit to this so our

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.460 
add our brake line kit to this so our
first<00:00:18.090> step<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.630> go<00:00:18.750> ahead<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.109> remove<00:00:19.350> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
first step is to go ahead and remove the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.560 
first step is to go ahead and remove the
original<00:00:19.529> brake<00:00:20.039> line<00:00:20.310> that's<00:00:21.000> inside<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
out okay once the old line removed we'd

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.429 
out okay once the old line removed we'd
go<00:00:29.820> ahead<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.210> install<00:00:30.359> our<00:00:30.599> new<00:00:30.660> line<00:00:31.260> that

well go ahead and wrap the in the one

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.229 
well go ahead and wrap the in the one
end<00:00:37.890> up<00:00:37.950> with<00:00:38.070> tape<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.460> help<00:00:38.610> protect<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:39.090> as

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
end up with tape to help protect it as

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.910 
end up with tape to help protect it as
we<00:00:39.450> push<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.719> through<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.870> frame<00:00:40.140> now<00:00:40.739> we'll

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
we push it through the frame now we'll

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.100 
we push it through the frame now we'll
go<00:00:41.040> ahead<00:00:41.070> unravel<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.090> slowly<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.660> push<00:00:42.989> it

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
go ahead unravel it slowly as we push it

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.569 
go ahead unravel it slowly as we push it
through<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> frame<00:00:43.590> until<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.190> reached<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
through the frame until it reached the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.240 
through the frame until it reached the
end<00:00:44.730> now<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:45.989> case<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.410> find<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.829> this

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
end now in this case we find that this

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.400 
end now in this case we find that this
length<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.640> line<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.969> too<00:00:48.120> short<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.719> help

length to line is too short to help

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.000 
length to line is too short to help
extend<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.890> we're<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.250> use<00:00:50.370> part<00:00:50.579> number

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
extend it we're going to use part number

these parts together and then tighten

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.710 
these parts together and then tighten
them<00:01:07.740> down<00:01:07.770> then<00:01:08.490> we'll<00:01:08.610> continue<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:09.030> pushing

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
them down then we'll continue on pushing

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.929 
them down then we'll continue on pushing
it<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.900> line<00:01:10.110> into<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.530> frame<00:01:10.830> okay<00:01:11.580> once<00:01:11.820> we

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
it a line into the frame okay once we

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.910 
it a line into the frame okay once we
reach<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.240> end<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.510> our<00:01:12.630> brake<00:01:12.930> line<00:01:13.200> we'll<00:01:13.830> go

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
reach the end of our brake line we'll go

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.859 
reach the end of our brake line we'll go
ahead<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.280> manipulate<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:14.909> bend<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.330> to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
ahead and manipulate it and bend it to

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.149 
ahead and manipulate it and bend it to
where<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.049> fits<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.350> original<00:01:16.650> fitting<00:01:16.890> us<00:01:17.009> on

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
where it fits the original fitting us on

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.800 
where it fits the original fitting us on

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the end of the frame and basically it's

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.600 
the end of the frame and basically it's
when<00:01:18.930> gently<00:01:19.259> bend<00:01:19.530> move<00:01:20.130> around<00:01:20.340> as<00:01:20.580> needed

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
when gently bend move around as needed

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.210 
when gently bend move around as needed
until<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.540> get<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.750> right<00:01:22.049> s-shape<00:01:22.560> where<00:01:23.130> it

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
until we get to right s-shape where it

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.890 
until we get to right s-shape where it
goes<00:01:23.340> into<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> frame<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.360> doesn't<00:01:24.659> rub<00:01:24.780> on

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
goes into the frame it doesn't rub on

our bracket that's pre-existing on the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.440 
our bracket that's pre-existing on the
frame<00:01:28.890> but<00:01:29.579> we'll<00:01:29.729> go<00:01:29.850> ahead<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.119> install<00:01:30.329> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
frame but we'll go ahead and install a

frame but we'll go ahead and install a
flexible<00:01:30.930> line<00:01:31.140> now<00:01:32.130> our<00:01:32.280> flexible<00:01:32.790> line<00:01:32.970> will

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
flexible line now our flexible line will

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.460 
flexible line now our flexible line will
fit<00:01:33.509> into<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> bracket<00:01:34.140> that's<00:01:34.259> already

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
fit into the bracket that's already
