marking on a man he showed his fingers I

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.980

assumed<00:01:11.040> he<00:01:11.190> didn't<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:11.700> knife<00:01:11.930> but<00:01:12.930> I

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.410 
going to
I<00:02:10.259> didn't<00:02:10.619> know<00:02:10.679> how<00:02:10.890> or<00:02:11.220> when<00:02:11.610> it's<00:02:12.150> just

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
happen that way and this is what the

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.610 
happen that way and this is what the
fights<00:02:14.310> are<00:02:14.579> gonna<00:02:14.760> look<00:02:15.000> like<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:16.260> just

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620

managed<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.040> say<00:02:17.189> this<00:02:17.340> was<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.549> fastest<00:02:18.030> way

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
managed to say this was the fastest way

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.970 
managed to say this was the fastest way
because<00:02:18.329> he<00:02:18.420> came<00:02:18.629> in<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:18.989> close<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.769> didn't

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
because he came in so close and I didn't

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.440 
because he came in so close and I didn't
have<00:02:20.069> enough<00:02:20.310> time<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.730> bring<00:02:20.909> my<00:02:21.090> hands<00:02:21.360> up

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.610 
have enough time to bring my hands up
the<00:02:21.569> way<00:02:21.659> I'm<00:02:21.780> supposed<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.260> because<00:02:22.439> it<00:02:22.530> just

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
the way I'm supposed to because it just

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.890 
the way I'm supposed to because it just
happened<00:02:23.069> so<00:02:23.189> fast<00:02:23.400> i<00:02:23.640> trapped<00:02:24.269> it<00:02:24.390> there<00:02:24.599> from

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
that would've been boom it would have

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.009 
that would've been boom it would have
been<00:02:26.220> applied<00:02:26.579> to<00:02:26.609> needle<00:02:27.150> mark<00:02:27.359> in<00:02:27.629> Marana<00:02:27.930> I
