you<00:00:10.980> know<00:00:11.099> had<00:00:11.250> that's<00:00:11.370> become<00:00:11.730> sort<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.269> a

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
you know had that's become sort of a

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.560 
you know had that's become sort of a
benchmark<00:00:12.570> for<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.830> sports<00:00:14.670> event<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
benchmark for a sports event the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.230 
benchmark for a sports event the
benchmark<00:00:16.080> I'd<00:00:16.260> say<00:00:16.470> yeah<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:17.369> beginning<00:00:18.090> of

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
benchmark I'd say yeah the beginning of

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.550 
benchmark I'd say yeah the beginning of
this<00:00:18.359> whole<00:00:18.420> thing<00:00:18.630> was<00:00:18.930> getting<00:00:19.140> those<00:00:19.320> three

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
this whole thing was getting those three

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.130 
this whole thing was getting those three
series<00:00:19.830> proportions<00:00:20.430> right<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.750> think<00:00:22.080> you

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
series proportions right and I think you

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.480 
series proportions right and I think you
have<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.380> step<00:00:22.590> back<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.890> actually<00:00:23.130> see<00:00:23.340> this

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
have to step back to actually see this

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.089 
have to step back to actually see this
in<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:23.789> country<00:00:24.180> but<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.720> whole<00:00:24.990> sense<00:00:25.890> of

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
in this country but the whole sense of

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.779 
in this country but the whole sense of
the<00:00:26.670> length<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.840> hood<00:00:28.140> where<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.789> famous

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the length of the hood where that famous

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.060 
the length of the hood where that famous
inline<00:00:30.210> six<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.349> shortness<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
inline six is the shortness of the

at the EM cars

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.680 
at the EM cars
we're<00:00:47.219> really<00:00:47.610> where<00:00:47.850> we're<00:00:48.000> inheriting<00:00:48.390> this

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
we're really where we're inheriting this

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.680 
we're really where we're inheriting this
from<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.340> then<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> grill<00:00:51.420> our

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
typical kidney grille we added a little

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.840 
typical kidney grille we added a little
bit<00:00:54.930> more<00:00:54.989> chrome<00:00:55.559> than<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:56.160> had<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.550> far<00:00:56.579> and

this line and yet there is more Headroom

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.390 
this line and yet there is more Headroom
more<00:01:24.330> elbow<00:01:24.540> room<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.500> car<00:01:25.799> than<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.189> the

more elbow room in this car than in the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.940 
more elbow room in this car than in the
in<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.820> previous<00:01:27.000> model<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.470> then<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:28.770> have

but some lines that we've had on

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.370 
but some lines that we've had on
previous<00:01:35.009> 3-series<00:01:35.729> as<00:01:35.939> well<00:01:36.150> but<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.200> this

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
previous 3-series as well but on this

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.770 
previous 3-series as well but on this
one<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:38.250> far<00:01:38.549> more<00:01:38.579> sculptural<00:01:39.240> than<00:01:39.630> it's

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
one it's far more sculptural than it's

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.280 
one it's far more sculptural than it's
ever<00:01:39.900> been

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
ever been

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.889 
ever been
if<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.310> actually<00:01:41.430> look<00:01:41.729> at<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.060> this

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
if you if you actually look at this this

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.109 
if you if you actually look at this this
this<00:01:43.229> whole<00:01:43.740> way<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> surface<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.820> going

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
this whole way that the surface is going

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.330 
this whole way that the surface is going
from<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.750> slide<00:01:46.229> compound<00:01:46.860> then<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.070> just

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
from this slide compound then it just

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.429 
from this slide compound then it just
ever<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.060> slight<00:01:48.299> pulls<00:01:48.570> out<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.930> then<00:01:49.259> goes

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
ever so slight pulls out and then goes

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.160 
ever so slight pulls out and then goes
into<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.310> know<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.759> look<00:01:51.180> down<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.810> this

into this you know you look down to this

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.490 
into this you know you look down to this
concave<00:01:52.680> convex<00:01:53.689> surface<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.869> mean<00:01:55.320> you're

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
concave convex surface I mean you're

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.840 
concave convex surface I mean you're
right<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.680> mean<00:01:55.890> with<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.280> with<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.670> tail

wide as possible so we have some things

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.870 
wide as possible so we have some things
also<00:02:04.170> inside<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.860> tail<00:02:05.100> lamps<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.670> knew

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
also inside the tail lamps that I knew

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.960 
also inside the tail lamps that I knew
that<00:02:06.570> emphasized<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.500> width<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.700> car

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
is all about I don't think we have to

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.649 
is all about I don't think we have to
worry<00:02:43.709> about<00:02:43.859> whether<00:02:44.489> this<00:02:44.819> car<00:02:45.090> whether<00:02:45.389> we

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
worry about whether this car whether we

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.869 
worry about whether this car whether we
say<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.079> car<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.409> a<00:02:46.439> benchmark<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:47.189> think<00:02:47.760> what

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
say this car is a benchmark I think what

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.250 
say this car is a benchmark I think what
we<00:02:48.000> have<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.239> worry<00:02:48.419> about<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.049> is<00:02:49.109> what

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
we have to worry about and this is what

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.990 
we have to worry about and this is what
we<00:02:49.349> try<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.590> do<00:02:49.799> is<00:02:49.949> make<00:02:50.099> sure<00:02:50.459> this<00:02:50.609> car<00:02:50.819> is<00:02:50.939> a

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
we try to do is make sure this car is a

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.780 
we try to do is make sure this car is a
3-series<00:02:51.389> and<00:02:51.719> after<00:02:52.379> that<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:53.159> takes<00:02:53.430> off<00:02:53.579> on

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
3-series and after that it takes off on

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.000 
3-series and after that it takes off on
its<00:02:53.939> own
