turn<00:02:57.209> on<00:02:57.239> in<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.600> second<00:02:59.329> and<00:03:00.329> I<00:03:00.510> got<00:03:00.690> wired

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
turn on in a second and I got wired

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.840 
turn on in a second and I got wired
doing<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.530> wire<00:03:01.709> wired<00:03:02.069> up<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.430> stereo

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
doing that wire wired up to the stereo

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.140 
doing that wire wired up to the stereo
to<00:03:03.569> turn<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.870> on<00:03:04.040> so<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.069> Mysterio<00:03:05.430> turns<00:03:05.640> on<00:03:05.819> it

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
to turn it on so I Mysterio turns on it

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.610 
to turn it on so I Mysterio turns on it
turns<00:03:06.450> on<00:03:07.760> got<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.989> ground<00:03:09.989> on<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.410> frame

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
turns on got the ground on the frame

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.860 
turns on got the ground on the frame
right<00:03:11.579> up<00:03:11.730> under<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.030> dash<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.569> then<00:03:12.660> I<00:03:12.720> got

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
right up under the dash and then I got

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.809 
right up under the dash and then I got
the<00:03:12.989> positive<00:03:13.139> run<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.829> batteries<00:03:14.579> well

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
the positive run to the batteries well

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.180 
the positive run to the batteries well
I'm<00:03:14.880> getting<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.630> reading<00:03:15.780> from<00:03:16.079> and<00:03:17.010> already

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
I'm getting the reading from and already

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.240 
I'm getting the reading from and already
calculated<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:17.880> sir<00:03:18.560> yes<00:03:19.560> stereo<00:03:20.480> voltmeter

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
calculated it sir yes stereo voltmeter

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.569 
calculated it sir yes stereo voltmeter
don't<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.340> want<00:03:23.609> point<00:03:24.030> one<00:03:24.209> best<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.989> voltage

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
don't you want point one best of voltage

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:54.230 
don't you want point one best of voltage
start<00:03:26.579> well

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:01.130 

but<00:03:55.240> yeah<00:03:55.480> that's<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:58.050> your<00:03:59.050> Becca<00:03:59.230> resting<00:03:59.740> I

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
but yeah that's a your Becca resting I

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.270 
but yeah that's a your Becca resting I
don't<00:04:02.140> think<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:02.380> ever<00:04:02.470> gets<00:04:02.740> any<00:04:02.920> higher<00:04:03.070> than

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
don't think it ever gets any higher than

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.910 
don't think it ever gets any higher than
15<00:04:03.760> I've<00:04:04.180> seen<00:04:04.450> it<00:04:04.570> that's<00:04:05.050> 15<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.710> not<00:04:05.800> go

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
15 I've seen it that's 15 and not go

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.320 
15 I've seen it that's 15 and not go
down<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:06.160> four<00:04:06.340> point<00:04:06.520> fourteen<00:04:07.090> point<00:04:07.300> nine

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
down the four point fourteen point nine

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.080 
down the four point fourteen point nine
and<00:04:07.720> just<00:04:07.930> sit<00:04:08.080> there<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:08.730> all<00:04:09.730> I<00:04:09.850> think<00:04:09.940> it

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
and just sit there and all I think it

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.230 
and just sit there and all I think it
would<00:04:10.180> go<00:04:10.240> past<00:04:10.390> fifteen<00:04:10.840> um<00:04:12.120> sooner<00:04:13.120> or<00:04:13.150> later

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
would go past fifteen um sooner or later

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.240 
would go past fifteen um sooner or later
and<00:04:13.480> probably<00:04:13.570> need<00:04:13.930> a<00:04:13.990> high<00:04:14.590> output<00:04:14.620> on<00:04:15.100> the

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
and probably need a high output on the

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.420 
and probably need a high output on the
net<00:04:15.400> alternator<00:04:15.940> and<00:04:16.709> voltage<00:04:17.709> regulator<00:04:18.190> but

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
net alternator and voltage regulator but

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.270 
net alternator and voltage regulator but
until<00:04:18.970> then

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.980 

pretty<00:04:22.030> neat<00:04:22.180> clean<00:04:23.190> wires<00:04:24.190> aren't<00:04:24.430> messy<00:04:24.990> so

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
pretty neat clean wires aren't messy so

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.640 
pretty neat clean wires aren't messy so
I<00:04:26.380> think<00:04:26.500> overall<00:04:26.890> it's<00:04:27.760> pretty<00:04:28.030> good<00:04:28.270> install

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
I think overall it's pretty good install

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.920 
I think overall it's pretty good install
see<00:04:29.650> you<00:04:29.710> guys<00:04:29.890> later
