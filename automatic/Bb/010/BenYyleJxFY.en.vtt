00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello girls how are they their day 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.189
 I have to talk about my labials jordan 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.350
 classics so this can be used 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.950
 as a guide for your future purchases 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.470
 so I hope you like it I'm going to 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.349
 start where the color cabaret this 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.800
 color is very beautiful is very elegant me 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:26.789
 seems requested is a mixture between 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.210
 equity with red and a little bit of brown 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.130
 and I do not know I quite quite like what 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.410
 I can use it for flamenco to 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.410
 meetings but mostly in its color 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.829
 there are too many 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:57.260
 this color has a bullet color 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.670
 Nice, it seems beautiful 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:05.689
 It is beautiful but when it comes to painting or water 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.460
 popular does not seem very little to me 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.600
 pigmented 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.760
 good is what happens with some 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.910
 I command some lipsticks are very 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:20.680
 pigmented and beautiful and others look 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:24.610
 what we the color of now 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:29.950
 they call black white and this color is a 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:34.690
 half burgundy wine seems to me already between 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.240
 a pint with pink if it's a mixture 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:43.170
 He pulled over for inah but it is 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:46.420
 touching yes you can say that lack of 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.540
 of its medium color difficult to carry but 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.720
 I believe that with a make-up on 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.850
 above 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.180
 the color that I'm going to show you is called 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:03.540
 great and this color is really one of 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:05.520
 My favorite is a purple and 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.470
 I have not seen any grapes since 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:14.820
 excuse me but yes I like it a lot 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.070
 already with violet and half lila I like 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.970
 a lot and I like it also because it's very 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:24.440
 dyed the smell that has the lipstick 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.440
 It was perfect with the name 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:34.490
 ah 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.440
 this color is called and it is always pay me 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.500
 has given laughter is colored and I do not know why 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.120
 will remind me in the movie the mask 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:48.110
 it's sorry I'm sorry 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:53.480
 it's the bullet in fact it looks very cute all 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:56.989
 you see a dark medium purple in fact not 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.670
 I am very convinced about the pigmentation of 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.120
 this lipstick 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.750
 but 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:08.319
 and it leaves you a medium soft purple color in 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.410
 the lips although they see it very dark 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.480
 I like it more or less 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.650
 I would have liked it to be much more than 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.650
 invented as the break 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.010
 well the label is now called ice and 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.430
 it's not really that you make me 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.640
 labial me for any occasion 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.300
 I bought before October because I had 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.709
 thought to do many milestone tutorials 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.160
 and I wanted to do a makeup on 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:42.970
 futuristic or a make -up 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.240
 extraterrestrial but I never did it but 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.240
 is very 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:56.890
 this color is called the mont and it is a 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:58.870
 color between nude and page and it seems like a 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.990
 unclear to my lips but the same is 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:06.520
 beautiful for a smokey eyes I like 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:09.580
 pretty but it's satin is not matte like that 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.970
 that you have to take it carefully 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.580
 I recommend it especially for lips more 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.380
 clear but like me I wear it myself 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.380
 I put any color if I like 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.570
 this one here is called page cloud and it's one 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.650
 of my favorites for any kind of 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.560
 good makeup is shine yes but I 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:36.300
 It seems that it is an ideal color for the 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.680
 my lips tone I like very much and 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.410
 in truth truth goes with any type 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.050
 makeup has not liked enough 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.850
 I know how to say it I recommend it and I 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.850
 presented for all skin types 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:56.200
 this color is called natural and good what 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.250
 I bought because I thought it was nude color 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:02.660
 no but it seems to me that more goes for the 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:07.550
 pink 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:09.740
 I do not know whether the bullet looks like 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.770
 a knot but look what the bullet is 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.560
 common or the color worthy but to paint 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.980
 I do not think it paints half pink dt 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.490
 no but the same is a very very very color 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:26.000
 very very nice highly recommended me 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:29.320
 I really like this color 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.320
 I think it's beautiful 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.550
 well the next color is called 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:38.010
 perfect ping and 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.430
 I do not know what the rays were in the brain 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:46.050
 who created this color and I also for 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.430
 compare it or improve what ray is 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.860
 this 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:57.930
 block or is it a target if you have a 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:06:01.200
 light pink tone but almost white and 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:04.860
 I do not know what happened in the brain to be able to 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.950
 put this from scratch or not me 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:12.800
 like I hate it for a disguise I think that 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:16.610
 yes it would be made to mix colors 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.610
 so that we are clearer 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:25.220
 This color is called raspberry and it is a 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:28.449
 fuchsia and purple with half medium around 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:33.930
 its side or it turns sunny 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:33.930
 I just have a perfect gloss 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:44.449
 and yes yes it has a given iridescent effect 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:49.039
 with blue highlights is very nice to live 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:53.289
 it costs it lipstick and if it's soft it runs 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:53.289
 easily notice a lot 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:04.100
 It was my collection of classic lipsticks and 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:07.010
