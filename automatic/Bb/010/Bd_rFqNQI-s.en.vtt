for Paris I know that a lot of people
think<00:06:10.610> tend<00:06:11.270> to<00:06:11.360> think<00:06:11.510> that<00:06:11.630> crop<00:06:12.910> cardigan

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
think tend to think that crop cardigan

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.990 
think tend to think that crop cardigan
is<00:06:14.270> cropped<00:06:14.600> jackets<00:06:15.199> crop<00:06:15.680> tops<00:06:16.280> and<00:06:16.970> things

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
is cropped jackets crop tops and things

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.420 
is cropped jackets crop tops and things
like<00:06:17.780> that<00:06:17.840> are<00:06:18.169> good<00:06:18.500> for<00:06:18.530> Paris<00:06:19.039> but<00:06:19.250> I

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
like that are good for Paris but I

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.400 
like that are good for Paris but I
actually<00:06:19.580> think<00:06:19.880> the<00:06:20.030> opposite<00:06:20.449> this<00:06:21.080> kind<00:06:21.350> of

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
actually think the opposite this kind of

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.260 
actually think the opposite this kind of
thing<00:06:21.620> I've<00:06:22.100> seen<00:06:22.370> it<00:06:22.490> done<00:06:22.520> time<00:06:23.030> and<00:06:23.060> time

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
thing I've seen it done time and time

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.480 
thing I've seen it done time and time
again<00:06:23.510> and<00:06:23.810> it's<00:06:24.590> just<00:06:24.710> not<00:06:24.979> a<00:06:25.039> good<00:06:25.250> look<00:06:25.460> for

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
again and it's just not a good look for

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.250 
again and it's just not a good look for
pear-shaped<00:06:26.180> so<00:06:26.720> I<00:06:26.780> would<00:06:26.990> go<00:06:27.080> with<00:06:27.200> something

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
pear-shaped so I would go with something

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.339 
pear-shaped so I would go with something
more<00:06:28.010> like<00:06:28.070> this<00:06:28.430> but<00:06:28.880> a<00:06:28.910> high<00:06:29.180> neck<00:06:29.419> it's<00:06:30.169> a

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:30.349 
more like this but a high neck it's a

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:32.620 
more like this but a high neck it's a
lot<00:06:30.590> of<00:06:30.710> detailing<00:06:31.250> a<00:06:31.460> lot<00:06:31.610> of<00:06:31.880> detailing<00:06:32.389> up

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630

here
even<00:06:33.770> if<00:06:33.860> she<00:06:33.979> would<00:06:34.099> go<00:06:34.430> for<00:06:34.460> something<00:06:34.849> like

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150
