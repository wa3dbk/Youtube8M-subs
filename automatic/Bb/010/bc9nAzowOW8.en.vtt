have George's redstone torches here and
repeated<00:01:11.700> here<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.420> was<00:01:12.930> very<00:01:13.170> ugly

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
repeated here and it was very ugly

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.109 
repeated here and it was very ugly
should<00:01:16.500> actually<00:01:16.650> recreated<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.759> then

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
should actually recreated it and then

two-part<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:32.080> have<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.650> door<00:02:33.310> mechanism

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
two-part you have the door mechanism

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.860 
two-part you have the door mechanism
itself<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.690> these<00:02:34.989> steps<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.709> since<00:02:36.870> pushing

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
itself and these steps and since pushing

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.400 
itself and these steps and since pushing
out<00:02:38.020> these<00:02:38.350> steps<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.950> like<00:02:40.020> plain<00:02:41.020> simple

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
out these steps to like plain simple

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.770 
out these steps to like plain simple
that<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.310> don't<00:02:42.580> want<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.000> show<00:02:43.209> you<00:02:43.270> how<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.540> do

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
that I don't want to show you how to do

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.490 
that I don't want to show you how to do
it<00:02:43.930> so<00:02:44.709> let's<00:02:44.950> move<00:02:45.130> on<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:46.500> door

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
it so let's move on to the door

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.370 
it so let's move on to the door
mechanism<00:02:47.770> itself<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:50.620> consists<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:52.380> three

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
mechanism itself it consists of three

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.870 
mechanism itself it consists of three
steps<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:54.750> they<00:02:55.750> are<00:02:55.840> controlled<00:02:56.290> by<00:02:56.880> putting

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
steps and they are controlled by putting

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.810 
steps and they are controlled by putting
repeaters<00:02:58.870> or<00:02:59.170> delay<00:02:59.680> eres<00:03:00.010> law<00:03:00.220> whatever<00:03:00.700> you

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
repeaters or delay eres law whatever you

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.960 
repeaters or delay eres law whatever you
want<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:01.030> call<00:03:01.180> it<00:03:01.920> down<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.220> actually<00:03:03.400> control

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
want to call it down to actually control

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.710 
want to call it down to actually control
what<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:04.660> going<00:03:04.989> on<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.330> first<00:03:07.600> thing

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
what is going on and so the first thing

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.650 
what is going on and so the first thing
this<00:03:08.019> will<00:03:08.230> do<00:03:08.410> is<00:03:08.650> it's<00:03:08.980> going<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.660> activate

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
this will do is it's going to activate

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.960 
this will do is it's going to activate
this<00:03:11.250> which<00:03:12.250> will<00:03:14.040> which<00:03:15.040> will<00:03:15.100> say<00:03:15.760> that

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
this which will which will say that

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.340 
this which will which will say that
whenever<00:03:16.269> these<00:03:17.260> are<00:03:18.840> our<00:03:19.840> in<00:03:20.049> these

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
whenever these are our in these

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.539 
whenever these are our in these
positions<00:03:21.180> um<00:03:22.230> they<00:03:23.230> will<00:03:23.410> push<00:03:23.680> out<00:03:23.860> so<00:03:24.310> I

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
positions um they will push out so I

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:33.720 
positions um they will push out so I
have<00:03:27.549> one<00:03:27.760> on<00:03:27.910> here<00:03:28.239> obviously<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:32.519> so<00:03:33.519> as

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
have one on here obviously and so as

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.780 
have one on here obviously and so as
soon<00:03:33.910> as<00:03:36.209> they<00:03:37.209> get<00:03:38.220> they<00:03:39.220> get<00:03:39.280> pushed<00:03:39.640> down

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
soon as they get they get pushed down

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.070 
soon as they get they get pushed down
and<00:03:40.269> don't<00:03:40.930> other<00:03:41.230> ones<00:03:41.560> get<00:03:41.799> pushed<00:03:42.130> up<00:03:42.370> and

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
and don't other ones get pushed up and

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.289 
and don't other ones get pushed up and
they<00:03:44.080> will<00:03:44.260> just<00:03:46.260> push<00:03:47.260> out<00:03:47.670> obviously<00:03:48.670> guess

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
they will just push out obviously guess

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:55.170 
they will just push out obviously guess
I<00:03:49.329> said<00:03:49.660> it<00:03:49.810> before<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:52.060> second<00:03:52.420> step<00:03:52.600> is<00:03:54.180> this

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
I said it before the second step is this

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.100 
I said it before the second step is this
one<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:55.860> it's<00:03:56.860> obviously<00:03:57.370> marked<00:03:58.090> by<00:03:58.360> putting

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
one and it's obviously marked by putting

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.030 
one and it's obviously marked by putting
it

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
it

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.180 
it
run<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.280> middle<00:04:01.610> like<00:04:01.850> that<00:04:01.880> and<00:04:03.160> that<00:04:04.160> is

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
run the middle like that and that is

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.940 
run the middle like that and that is
going<00:04:04.520> to<00:04:04.700> control<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:06.500> stones<00:04:06.950> it<00:04:07.280> self

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
going to control the stones it self

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.190 
going to control the stones it self
retracting<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:12.070> pulling<00:04:13.070> it<00:04:13.280> in<00:04:13.610> and<00:04:13.910> out<00:04:14.200> so

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
retracting and pulling it in and out so

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.830 
retracting and pulling it in and out so
on<00:04:15.910> and<00:04:16.959> then<00:04:17.959> the<00:04:18.170> first<00:04:18.500> oh<00:04:18.800> my<00:04:19.580> god<00:04:19.730> and<00:04:20.030> then

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
on and then the first oh my god and then

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.480 
on and then the first oh my god and then
the<00:04:21.080> third<00:04:21.410> step<00:04:22.070> is<00:04:23.620> well<00:04:24.620> it's<00:04:24.800> this<00:04:25.070> one<00:04:25.250> and

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
the third step is well it's this one and

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.080 
the third step is well it's this one and
it's<00:04:25.730> going<00:04:25.910> to<00:04:26.060> power<00:04:26.240> this<00:04:26.600> one<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:28.090> pistons

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
it's going to power this one and pistons

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.050 
it's going to power this one and pistons
are<00:04:29.300> surprisingly<00:04:30.200> sensitive<00:04:30.800> as<00:04:31.310> you<00:04:31.850> see

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
are surprisingly sensitive as you see

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.650 
are surprisingly sensitive as you see
here<00:04:32.270> just<00:04:32.570> by<00:04:32.690> putting<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:33.160> rest<00:04:34.160> on<00:04:34.660> here

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
here just by putting a rest on here

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.710 
here just by putting a rest on here
these<00:04:36.560> are<00:04:36.740> actually<00:04:37.160> getting<00:04:37.340> activated<00:04:38.090> I

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
these are actually getting activated I

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.500 
these are actually getting activated I
think<00:04:39.530> thick<00:04:39.770> that<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:41.750> same<00:04:41.990> way<00:04:42.970> about<00:04:43.970> this

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
think thick that the same way about this

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.410 
think thick that the same way about this
one<00:04:44.750> just<00:04:48.100> easier<00:04:49.100> to<00:04:49.130> see<00:04:49.460> as<00:04:49.670> you<00:04:50.120> can<00:04:50.240> see

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
one just easier to see as you can see

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.960 
one just easier to see as you can see
two<00:04:50.750> pistons<00:04:51.320> and<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.980> only<00:04:52.370> one<00:04:52.520> repeater

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
two pistons and the only one repeater

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.230 
two pistons and the only one repeater
actual<00:04:53.360> to<00:04:53.480> power<00:04:53.720> both<00:04:54.040> so<00:04:55.040> it's<00:04:55.400> there<00:04:56.000> ever

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
actual to power both so it's there ever

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.050 
actual to power both so it's there ever
since<00:04:56.510> two<00:05:00.250> but<00:05:01.250> it's<00:05:01.370> also<00:05:01.490> going<00:05:01.730> to<00:05:01.820> power

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
since two but it's also going to power

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.900 
since two but it's also going to power
this<00:05:02.330> one<00:05:02.540> which<00:05:02.990> will<00:05:03.290> push<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:04.070> piston<00:05:04.460> sup

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
this one which will push the piston sup

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.940 
this one which will push the piston sup
works<00:05:05.330> and<00:05:08.200> yeah<00:05:09.200> that's<00:05:09.350> pretty<00:05:09.500> much<00:05:09.710> how<00:05:09.920> it

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
works and yeah that's pretty much how it

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:16.570 
works and yeah that's pretty much how it
works<00:05:10.190> so<00:05:12.700> one<00:05:13.700> power<00:05:13.880> goes<00:05:14.150> through<00:05:15.280> this<00:05:16.280> one

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
works so one power goes through this one

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.490 
works so one power goes through this one
is<00:05:16.820> going<00:05:17.090> to<00:05:17.210> activate<00:05:17.570> so<00:05:17.870> as<00:05:18.020> soon<00:05:18.200> as<00:05:18.380> the

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
is going to activate so as soon as the

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.950 
is going to activate so as soon as the
Pistons<00:05:18.920> go<00:05:19.100> down<00:05:19.370> they<00:05:19.760> will<00:05:19.910> push<00:05:20.120> out<00:05:20.300> but

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
Pistons go down they will push out but

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.890 
Pistons go down they will push out but
before<00:05:21.140> the<00:05:21.530> Pistons<00:05:21.920> go<00:05:22.070> down<00:05:22.310> and<00:05:22.700> and<00:05:23.510> off

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
before the Pistons go down and and off

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.120 
before the Pistons go down and and off
obviously<00:05:24.910> these<00:05:25.910> are<00:05:25.970> going<00:05:26.300> to<00:05:26.390> push<00:05:26.620> out<00:05:27.620> I

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
obviously these are going to push out I

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.920 
obviously these are going to push out I
guess<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:31.400> then<00:05:31.790> the<00:05:31.940> Pistons<00:05:32.330> will<00:05:32.510> go<00:05:32.690> down

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
guess and then the Pistons will go down

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.530 
guess and then the Pistons will go down
and<00:05:33.290> they<00:05:33.500> will<00:05:33.650> push<00:05:33.890> out<00:05:34.100> as<00:05:34.910> I'm<00:05:35.330> going<00:05:35.480> to

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
and they will push out as I'm going to

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.780 
and they will push out as I'm going to
turn<00:05:35.720> it<00:05:35.840> on<00:05:36.110> sorry<00:05:36.980> when<00:05:37.490> your<00:05:37.610> turn<00:05:37.820> it<00:05:38.000> off

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
turn it on sorry when your turn it off

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.880 
turn it on sorry when your turn it off
this<00:05:40.790> will<00:05:41.060> stop<00:05:41.270> and<00:05:41.660> the<00:05:42.170> Pistons<00:05:42.500> will

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
this will stop and the Pistons will

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.160 
this will stop and the Pistons will
retract<00:05:43.550> with<00:05:44.390> the<00:05:44.660> stones<00:05:45.290> of<00:05:45.530> because

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
retract with the stones of because

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.630 
retract with the stones of because
normal<00:05:48.170> business<00:05:48.830> doesn't<00:05:49.100> really<00:05:49.400> work

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
normal business doesn't really work

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.780 
normal business doesn't really work
there's<00:05:50.600> not<00:05:50.720> even<00:05:50.780> a<00:05:51.050> single<00:05:51.440> normal<00:05:52.370> piston

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
there's not even a single normal piston

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.990 
there's not even a single normal piston
list<00:05:53.000> on<00:05:53.180> this<00:05:53.600> one<00:05:53.810> of<00:05:53.960> the<00:05:54.200> sticky<00:05:54.890> pistons

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.030 

that's<00:05:59.000> pretty<00:05:59.270> awesome<00:05:59.330> and<00:05:59.870> they<00:06:00.860> will
