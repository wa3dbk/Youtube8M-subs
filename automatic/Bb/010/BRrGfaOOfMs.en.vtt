00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
center and then we're going to be

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.710 
center and then we're going to be
forming<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.750> diagonal<00:01:45.750> off<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:47.039> the<00:01:47.130> right<00:01:47.720> and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
forming a diagonal off to the right and

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.289 
forming a diagonal off to the right and
these<00:01:48.840> are<00:01:48.899> two<00:01:49.170> bands<00:01:49.500> also<00:01:49.819> in<00:01:50.819> a<00:01:50.939> diagonal

these are two bands also in a diagonal

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.859 
these are two bands also in a diagonal
off<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:52.319> the<00:01:52.439> left<00:01:53.060> we're<00:01:54.060> going<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.390> cap<00:01:54.600> off

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
off to the left we're going to cap off

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.370 
off to the left we're going to cap off
this<00:01:55.140> bottom<00:01:55.590> band<00:01:55.969> with<00:01:56.969> one<00:01:57.270> band<00:01:57.600> wrapped

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
this bottom band with one band wrapped

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:08.800 
this bottom band with one band wrapped
four<00:01:58.649> times<00:01:59.119> one<00:02:01.399> one<00:02:02.539> two<00:02:05.090> three<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:07.130> four

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
four times one one two three and four

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.069 
four times one one two three and four
so<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> four<00:02:10.500> time<00:02:10.769> cat<00:02:11.130> band<00:02:11.900> we<00:02:12.900> need

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
so that is a four time cat band we need

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:14.990 
so that is a four time cat band we need
to<00:02:13.200> put<00:02:13.380> in<00:02:13.530> our<00:02:13.620> horizontal<00:02:14.280> bands<00:02:14.640> which<00:02:14.819> are

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
to put in our horizontal bands which are

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.870 
to put in our horizontal bands which are
going<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.360> be<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.720> two<00:02:15.840> time<00:02:16.349> twist<00:02:16.739> one<00:02:17.579> band

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
going to be a two time twist one band

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.080 
going to be a two time twist one band
twisted<00:02:18.660> two<00:02:18.840> times<00:02:19.110> on<00:02:19.890> each<00:02:20.069> of<00:02:20.280> these<00:02:20.430> rows

bands in the center forward now it's

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.379 
bands in the center forward now it's
just<00:03:29.940> straightforward<00:03:30.530> looping<00:03:32.000> all<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.269> way

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
just straightforward looping all the way

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
if bands are tight in there just kind of

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.990 
if bands are tight in there just kind of
wiggle<00:03:38.160> them<00:03:38.430> around<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.849> little<00:03:38.880> bit

that's<00:03:41.450> come<00:03:41.750> off<00:03:41.780> which<00:03:42.320> isn't<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.710> big<00:03:42.860> deal

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
that's come off which isn't a big deal

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.310 
that's come off which isn't a big deal
but<00:03:43.400> I<00:03:43.700> just<00:03:44.180> like<00:03:44.330> to<00:03:44.480> make<00:03:44.600> it<00:03:44.720> look<00:03:44.870> neat<00:03:45.080> for
