would be so scared for him
and<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:32.490> would<00:03:32.580> be<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.000> there's<00:03:33.720> so<00:03:33.840> many

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
and it would be so there's so many

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.390 
and it would be so there's so many
emotions<00:03:34.200> that<00:03:34.530> go<00:03:34.680> through<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.270> but<00:03:36.270> I<00:03:37.400> can't

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
emotions that go through you but I can't

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.150 
emotions that go through you but I can't
imagine<00:03:38.550> having<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.510> choose<00:03:39.780> well<00:03:40.170> what's<00:03:40.950> a

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
imagine having to choose well what's a

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.400 
imagine having to choose well what's a
worse<00:03:41.520> thing<00:03:41.880> for<00:03:42.150> me<00:03:42.270> having<00:03:42.630> my<00:03:42.750> child<00:03:43.020> in

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
worse thing for me having my child in

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.040 
worse thing for me having my child in
prison<00:03:43.830> for<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.070> rest<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.370> his<00:03:44.490> life<00:03:44.760> or<00:03:45.570> in<00:03:45.960> a

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
prison for the rest of his life or in a

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.280 
prison for the rest of his life or in a
casket<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:47.030> think<00:03:48.030> both<00:03:48.240> scenarios<00:03:48.900> are<00:03:49.110> at<00:03:49.170> the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
casket I think both scenarios are at the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.420 
casket I think both scenarios are at the
end<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.650> my<00:03:49.830> life

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
end of my life

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.480 
end of my life
but<00:03:51.150> for<00:03:51.480> Jordan<00:03:51.900> it's<00:03:52.500> definitely<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.340> end

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
but for Jordan it's definitely the end

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.150 
but for Jordan it's definitely the end
of<00:03:53.580> his<00:03:53.760> life<00:03:53.970> did<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.870> reality<00:03:55.110> of<00:03:55.380> having<00:03:55.950> to

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
of his life did the reality of having to

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.370 
of his life did the reality of having to
write<00:03:56.280> an<00:03:56.430> obituary<00:03:56.550> for<00:03:57.090> your<00:03:57.360> 18<00:03:58.110> year<00:03:58.230> old
