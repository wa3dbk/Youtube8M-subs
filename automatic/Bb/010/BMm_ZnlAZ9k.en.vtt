00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.440
 IF THE SUN AND THE AY ARE CHANGE. 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.220
 By Orepros 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.940
 Don't forget to leave a 'like'. :D 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.560
 Finally! 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.820
 It's night. 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.500
 I waited too long under this tree. 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.760
 I can finally leave here! 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.560
 I'm gonna have so much fun! :D 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.380
 I will attack many players! :) 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.200
 WHAT'S GOING ON?! 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.340
 It was NIGHT! 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.380
 WHY DID I BE ?! 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.880
 By the way... 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.180
 AVOID EVERYONE! 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.680
 The monsters will attack us! 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.300
 Next morning... 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.340
 Wow... 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.860
 We were very lucky last night! :D 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.420
 The monsters could not attack us! 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.820
 I think we won't see monsters for a while! :) 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.780
 Life will be easy now. 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.500
 Why are the monsters there? 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.480
 Lol, whatever. 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.840
 In the morning. 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.560
 WHY NOT? 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.900
 WHAT IS THE SUN? 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.880
 HELP!!! 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.920
 By the way ... again ... 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.800
 What a nice day. 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.780
 Time to go out! 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.420
 Wait a second ... 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.740
 WHAT HAPPENS OUTSIDE? 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.020
 WHY CANAPS NOT fall ?! 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.820
 IT'S MORNING! 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.020
 The next night ... 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.440
 HELP!!! 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.080
 Next day... 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.440
 Why did the moon replace the sun? 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.740
 That doesn't make sense. 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.080
 How can the sun be the light? 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.840
 If there's moon here instead of the sun ... 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.360
 ... WHAT IS THIS SUSE ?! 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.000
 HELP! 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.820
 And that would be, lol. 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.360
