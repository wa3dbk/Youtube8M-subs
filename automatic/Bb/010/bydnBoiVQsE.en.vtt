issues that we face we're very much on
the<00:05:50.150> same<00:05:50.180> page<00:05:50.540> and<00:05:50.780> that's<00:05:50.930> why<00:05:51.110> I<00:05:51.140> think

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
the same page and that's why I think

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.890 
the same page and that's why I think
you'll<00:05:51.530> see<00:05:51.740> Republicans<00:05:52.610> strongly<00:05:53.600> getting

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
you'll see Republicans strongly getting

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.100 
you'll see Republicans strongly getting
behind<00:05:54.050> Senator<00:05:54.500> McCain<00:05:54.830> and<00:05:55.360> in<00:05:56.360> pursuing<00:05:56.990> a

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
behind Senator McCain and in pursuing a

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.810 
behind Senator McCain and in pursuing a
campaign<00:05:57.830> with<00:05:58.040> bigger<00:05:58.250> and<00:05:58.430> I<00:05:58.490> think<00:05:58.700> it's

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
campaign with bigger and I think it's

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.300 
campaign with bigger and I think it's
very<00:05:58.880> encouraging<00:05:59.540> that<00:05:59.720> that<00:06:00.560> at<00:06:01.010> least<00:06:01.160> the

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
very encouraging that that at least the

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.340 
very encouraging that that at least the
polls<00:06:01.550> today<00:06:01.760> say<00:06:02.120> he's<00:06:02.360> tied<00:06:02.720> with<00:06:02.750> either

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
polls today say he's tied with either

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.710 
polls today say he's tied with either
one<00:06:03.620> of<00:06:03.680> the<00:06:03.830> potential<00:06:04.160> Democratic

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
one of the potential Democratic

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.180 
one of the potential Democratic
contenders<00:06:05.720> and<00:06:05.870> I<00:06:05.960> think<00:06:06.200> I<00:06:06.380> think<00:06:07.040> that's

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
contenders and I think I think that's

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.100 
contenders and I think I think that's
helped<00:06:07.460> by<00:06:07.580> the<00:06:07.640> fact<00:06:07.730> that<00:06:08.060> that<00:06:08.660> the

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
helped by the fact that that the

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.140 
helped by the fact that that the
Democrats<00:06:09.590> have<00:06:09.800> made<00:06:09.980> the<00:06:10.130> issue<00:06:10.310> experience

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
Democrats have made the issue experience

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.330 
Democrats have made the issue experience
right<00:06:11.600> and<00:06:11.840> ability<00:06:12.080> to<00:06:12.470> deal<00:06:12.650> with<00:06:12.860> national

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
right and ability to deal with national

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.160 
right and ability to deal with national
security<00:06:13.370> issues<00:06:14.030> and<00:06:14.240> when<00:06:14.330> it<00:06:14.450> when<00:06:14.840> I<00:06:14.870> mean
