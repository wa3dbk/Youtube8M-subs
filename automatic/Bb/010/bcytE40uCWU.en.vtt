the idea this week was to make a really

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.600 
the idea this week was to make a really
unique<00:00:43.460> invoker<00:00:44.000> because<00:00:44.720> poker<00:00:45.310> is<00:00:46.310> that

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
unique invoker because poker is that

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.550 
unique invoker because poker is that
hero<00:00:46.940> that's<00:00:47.300> kind<00:00:47.600> of<00:00:47.660> too<00:00:47.870> snobby<00:00:48.110> for<00:00:48.500> all

hero that's kind of too snobby for all
the<00:00:48.710> other<00:00:48.830> heroes<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.090> idea<00:00:50.330> of<00:00:50.390> this<00:00:50.630> is

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
the other heroes so the idea of this is

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.870 
the other heroes so the idea of this is
he<00:00:51.920> doesn't<00:00:52.100> even<00:00:52.310> look<00:00:52.430> like<00:00:52.490> the<00:00:52.760> other

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.880 
he doesn't even look like the other
invoker's<00:00:53.450> cuz<00:00:53.780> your<00:00:54.020> invoker<00:00:54.380> is<00:00:54.500> too<00:00:54.680> snobby

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.130 
and also the Hat has a purple style so
you<00:01:48.290> can<00:01:48.440> kind<00:01:48.650> of<00:01:48.970> change<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.180> set<00:01:50.390> if<00:01:50.600> you<00:01:50.780> if

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
you can kind of change the set if you if

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.469 
you can kind of change the set if you if
you<00:01:51.260> get<00:01:51.409> tired<00:01:51.620> of<00:01:51.799> it<00:01:51.920> as<00:01:52.040> it<00:01:52.190> is<00:01:52.370> I<00:01:52.610> like<00:01:53.299> that

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
you get tired of it as it is I like that

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.930 
you get tired of it as it is I like that
a<00:01:53.540> lot<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:54.620> IceBridge<00:01:55.070> bracers<00:01:55.520> I<00:01:55.729> thought

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
a lot the IceBridge bracers I thought

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.580 
a lot the IceBridge bracers I thought
matched<00:01:56.210> very<00:01:56.479> well<00:01:56.780> with<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.080> blue<00:01:57.320> gem

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
matched very well with the blue gem

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.940 
matched very well with the blue gem
there<00:01:57.830> I<00:01:58.070> also<00:01:58.940> again<00:01:59.750> was<00:01:59.960> trying<00:02:00.229> to<00:02:00.470> stay<00:02:00.799> as

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
there I also again was trying to stay as

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.060 
there I also again was trying to stay as
close<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.220> my<00:02:01.490> budget<00:02:01.820> as<00:02:01.940> $10<00:02:02.479> as<00:02:02.690> possible<00:02:03.260> so

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
close to my budget as $10 as possible so

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.520 
close to my budget as $10 as possible so
those<00:02:04.460> were<00:02:04.670> helpful<00:02:04.880> for<00:02:05.210> that<00:02:05.380> and<00:02:06.380> went

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
those were helpful for that and went

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.499 
those were helpful for that and went
with<00:02:06.680> ice<00:02:06.830> forged<00:02:07.250> spirit<00:02:07.670> because<00:02:08.060> I<00:02:08.450> think

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
with ice forged spirit because I think

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.580 
with ice forged spirit because I think
that<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:09.170> white<00:02:09.590> face<00:02:09.830> kind<00:02:10.219> of<00:02:10.310> matches<00:02:10.729> the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
that the white face kind of matches the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.949 
that the white face kind of matches the
white<00:02:12.590> in<00:02:12.920> his<00:02:13.249> outfit<00:02:13.969> here<00:02:14.239> but<00:02:14.810> also

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
white in his outfit here but also

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.030 
white in his outfit here but also
because<00:02:15.409> I<00:02:15.439> think<00:02:15.620> it's

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
because I think it's

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.640 
because I think it's
the<00:02:16.250> more<00:02:16.430> fun<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.060> playful<00:02:17.900> looking<00:02:18.200> spirits

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
the more fun and playful looking spirits

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.880 
the more fun and playful looking spirits
so<00:02:19.239> just<00:02:20.239> felt<00:02:20.480> like<00:02:20.959> it<00:02:21.140> looks<00:02:21.349> good<00:02:21.560> with<00:02:21.859> a

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
so just felt like it looks good with a

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.130 
so just felt like it looks good with a
set<00:02:22.219> and<00:02:22.760> finally<00:02:23.629> I<00:02:23.659> went<00:02:23.989> with<00:02:24.109> a

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
set and finally I went with a

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.830 
set and finally I went with a
sempiternal<00:02:24.530> revelation<00:02:25.400> spelt<00:02:25.840> you're

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
sempiternal revelation spelt you're

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.500 
sempiternal revelation spelt you're
getting<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.439> purple<00:02:27.859> from<00:02:28.400> up<00:02:28.670> top<00:02:28.939> in<00:02:29.299> his

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
getting the purple from up top in his

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.170 
getting the purple from up top in his
space<00:02:29.930> model<00:02:30.409> kind<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:31.010> echoed<00:02:31.340> down<00:02:31.549> here<00:02:31.939> and

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
space model kind of echoed down here and

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.569 
space model kind of echoed down here and
I<00:02:32.629> feel<00:02:32.810> like<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.019> has<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.409> same<00:02:33.709> sweeping

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
I feel like it has the same sweeping

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.330 
I feel like it has the same sweeping
clean<00:02:34.909> lines<00:02:35.209> that<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.140> Cape<00:02:36.379> and<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.739> guard

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
clean lines that the Cape and the guard

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.009 
clean lines that the Cape and the guard
had<00:02:37.579> even<00:02:38.060> if<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.299> doesn't<00:02:38.480> have<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.750> same

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
had even if it doesn't have the same

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.500 
had even if it doesn't have the same
color<00:02:39.290> so<00:02:40.220> there<00:02:40.400> were<00:02:40.459> fewer<00:02:40.790> choices<00:02:41.000> by<00:02:41.450> the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
color so there were fewer choices by the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.410 
color so there were fewer choices by the
way<00:02:41.659> for<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:41.959> item<00:02:42.409> slot<00:02:42.859> and<00:02:43.099> this<00:02:43.760> one<00:02:44.000> was

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
way for that item slot and this one was

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.970 
way for that item slot and this one was
the<00:02:44.450> one<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:44.900> looked<00:02:45.049> to<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.290> very<00:02:45.469> best<00:02:45.650> to

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
the one that looked to the very best to

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.879 
the one that looked to the very best to
me<00:02:46.209> okay<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:47.959> is<00:02:48.139> the<00:02:48.260> invoker<00:02:48.560> and

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
me okay so that is the invoker and

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.379 
me okay so that is the invoker and
there's<00:02:49.430> one<00:02:49.639> more<00:02:49.760> special<00:02:50.060> thing<00:02:50.329> about

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
there's one more special thing about

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.479 
there's one more special thing about
this<00:02:50.780> set<00:02:51.079> which<00:02:51.590> I'll<00:02:51.769> show<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:51.980> in<00:02:52.129> just<00:02:52.310> a

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:56.169 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.780

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.629 
alright so this is my mix-and-match and
Booker<00:02:59.090> set<00:02:59.359> in<00:02:59.599> game<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.349> I<00:03:01.099> want<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.489> pay

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
Booker set in game and I want you to pay

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.140 
Booker set in game and I want you to pay
attention<00:03:01.669> to<00:03:02.359> the<00:03:02.720> white<00:03:03.129> parts<00:03:04.129> of<00:03:04.489> his<00:03:04.879> cape

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
attention to the white parts of his cape

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.259 
attention to the white parts of his cape
and<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:06.230> hat<00:03:06.439> they're<00:03:07.040> actually<00:03:07.579> picking<00:03:08.060> up

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
and the hat they're actually picking up

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.690 
and the hat they're actually picking up
the<00:03:08.480> color<00:03:08.750> of<00:03:09.109> the<00:03:09.500> orbs<00:03:09.950> because<00:03:10.519> it's

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
the color of the orbs because it's

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.179 
the color of the orbs because it's
reflecting<00:03:11.329> that<00:03:11.480> so<00:03:12.200> it's<00:03:12.500> really<00:03:12.590> it's<00:03:13.040> not

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 
reflecting that so it's really it's not

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.520 
reflecting that so it's really it's not
like<00:03:13.519> a<00:03:13.549> special<00:03:14.209> effect<00:03:14.329> or<00:03:14.689> anything<00:03:14.870> it's

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
like a special effect or anything it's

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.250 
like a special effect or anything it's
just<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.859> way<00:03:16.040> dota<00:03:16.400> renders<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:17.959> know<00:03:18.049> light

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
just the way dota renders you know light

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.890 
just the way dota renders you know light
sources<00:03:18.620> but<00:03:19.579> I<00:03:19.609> think<00:03:19.939> it<00:03:20.060> looks<00:03:20.389> really

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
sources but I think it looks really

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.670 
sources but I think it looks really
really<00:03:21.049> good

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
really good

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.210 
really good
and<00:03:21.949> it's<00:03:22.729> subtle<00:03:23.090> it's<00:03:23.959> not<00:03:24.500> like<00:03:24.769> it's

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
and it's subtle it's not like it's

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.240 
and it's subtle it's not like it's
glowing<00:03:25.849> actually<00:03:26.810> but<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.560> think<00:03:27.829> it<00:03:27.949> really

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
glowing actually but I think it really

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.180 
glowing actually but I think it really
gives<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.150> set<00:03:29.389> a<00:03:29.629> sort<00:03:30.169> of<00:03:30.290> character<00:03:30.889> but

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
gives the set a sort of character but

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.849 
gives the set a sort of character but
you<00:03:31.250> don't<00:03:31.519> necessarily<00:03:31.669> see<00:03:32.239> with<00:03:32.750> them<00:03:32.989> with

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
you don't necessarily see with them with

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.170 
you don't necessarily see with them with
like<00:03:34.040> darker<00:03:34.489> colors<00:03:34.819> that<00:03:35.030> aren't

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
like darker colors that aren't

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.659 
like darker colors that aren't
reflecting<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.780> light<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.459> anyway<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.489> was

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:37.669 
reflecting the light so anyway I was

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.250 
reflecting the light so anyway I was
pretty<00:03:37.940> excited<00:03:38.389> about<00:03:38.449> it<00:03:38.599> when<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:38.870> noticed

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
pretty excited about it when I noticed

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.259 
pretty excited about it when I noticed
that<00:03:39.409> in-game<00:03:39.739> hope<00:03:40.489> you<00:03:40.609> guys<00:03:40.790> liked<00:03:41.030> it<00:03:41.180> as
