00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
where do we come from why are we here I

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.200 
where do we come from why are we here I
mean<00:00:03.389> what's<00:00:03.659> it<00:00:03.810> all<00:00:04.080> about<00:00:04.339> well<00:00:05.339> we're<00:00:06.089> not

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
mean what's it all about well we're not

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.280 
mean what's it all about well we're not
going<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.450> answer<00:00:06.569> any<00:00:06.930> of<00:00:07.080> those<00:00:07.230> questions

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
going to answer any of those questions

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.049 
going to answer any of those questions
instead<00:00:08.250> we're<00:00:08.429> going<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.610> be<00:00:08.670> looking<00:00:08.849> at<00:00:08.970> the

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
instead we're going to be looking at the

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.810 
instead we're going to be looking at the
way<00:00:09.260> mathematics<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.410> increasingly<00:00:11.280> being

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
way mathematics is increasingly being

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.789 
way mathematics is increasingly being

Mike Steele get a mic how are you good

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.769 
Mike Steele get a mic how are you good
thanks<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.430> look<00:00:20.730> first<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.060> would<00:00:21.240> ask<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.600> Mike

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
thanks I look first I would ask you Mike

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.660 
thanks I look first I would ask you Mike
was<00:00:22.020> how<00:00:22.680> did<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:22.890> get<00:00:23.039> interested<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.519> maths

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
was how did you get interested in maths

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.660 
was how did you get interested in maths
in<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.880> first<00:00:24.060> place<00:00:24.740> right<00:00:25.740> well<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.130> was<00:00:26.460> I

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
in the first place right well I was I

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.429 
in the first place right well I was I
was<00:00:26.880> pretty<00:00:27.090> keen<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.510> maths<00:00:27.990> when<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.289> was

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
was pretty keen on maths when I was

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.870 
was pretty keen on maths when I was
first<00:00:28.859> at<00:00:28.980> university<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:29.760> yeah<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.179> actually

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
first at university but yeah I actually

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.130 
first at university but yeah I actually
gave<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:32.910> up<00:00:33.090> for<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> while<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.690> went<00:00:33.930> and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
gave it up for a while and went and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.900 
gave it up for a while and went and
worked<00:00:34.469> as<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> newspaper<00:00:34.890> reporter<00:00:35.160> for<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> few

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
worked as a newspaper reporter for a few

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.990 
worked as a newspaper reporter for a few
years<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.360> yeah<00:00:37.050> then<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.579> got<00:00:38.579> inspired<00:00:38.879> by

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
years and yeah then I I got inspired by

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.940 
years and yeah then I I got inspired by
what<00:00:39.210> these<00:00:39.390> guys<00:00:39.600> at<00:00:40.200> Massey<00:00:40.440> were<00:00:40.649> doing

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
what these guys at Massey were doing

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.920 
what these guys at Massey were doing
Mike<00:00:41.370> MD<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.850> Dave<00:00:42.000> penny<00:00:42.300> they<00:00:42.480> were<00:00:42.540> using

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
Mike MD and Dave penny they were using

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.220 
Mike MD and Dave penny they were using
maths<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.350> study<00:00:43.559> biology<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.930> went<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.050> did

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
maths to study biology so I went and did

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.190 
maths to study biology so I went and did
a<00:00:46.260> PhD<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:47.070> them<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.840> because<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.930> field

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
a PhD with them and because the field

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.869 
a PhD with them and because the field
has<00:00:49.320> really<00:00:49.469> just<00:00:49.770> taken<00:00:50.100> off<00:00:50.250> since<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.760> I've

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
has really just taken off since and I've

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.389 
has really just taken off since and I've
never<00:00:51.030> really<00:00:51.360> been<00:00:51.809> tempted<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.289> go<00:00:53.039> back<00:00:53.219> and

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
never really been tempted to go back and

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.170 
never really been tempted to go back and
do<00:00:53.460> anything<00:00:53.640> different<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:55.430> biomass<00:00:56.430> biology

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
do anything different so biomass biology

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.860 
do anything different so biomass biology
plus<00:00:57.420> mathematics<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.350> came<00:00:58.890> together<00:00:59.100> what

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
plus mathematics that came together what

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.410 
plus mathematics that came together what
20<00:01:00.870> years<00:01:01.050> ago<00:01:01.170> or<00:01:01.379> some<00:01:01.500> was<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.940> it<00:01:02.940> probably

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
20 years ago or some was it it probably

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.149 
20 years ago or some was it it probably
was<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.780> won't<00:01:03.960> hold<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.290> down<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.799> then<00:01:04.979> it's

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
was I won't hold it down to it then it's

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.010 
was I won't hold it down to it then it's
it<00:01:05.489> sounds<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.820> long<00:01:06.000> time<00:01:06.210> ago<00:01:06.479> now<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.689> year

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
it sounds a long time ago now that year

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.880 
it sounds a long time ago now that year
you're<00:01:07.200> probably<00:01:07.380> right

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
you're probably right

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.380 
you're probably right
yeah<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.580> what<00:01:08.790> what<00:01:08.909> essentially<00:01:09.180> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
yeah and so what what essentially is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.390 
yeah and so what what essentially is
biomathematics<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.740> yeah<00:01:11.040> well<00:01:11.280> it's

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
biomathematics can you yeah well it's

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.060 
biomathematics can you yeah well it's
using<00:01:12.090> maths<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.110> study<00:01:13.320> problems<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.890> biology

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
using maths to study problems in biology

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.039 
using maths to study problems in biology
a<00:01:14.640> whole<00:01:14.909> range<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.330> problems<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.930> know

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
a whole range of problems you know

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.370 
a whole range of problems you know
ranging<00:01:16.320> from<00:01:17.270> genomic<00:01:18.380> evolutionary

ranging from genomic evolutionary

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.929 
ranging from genomic evolutionary
studies<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.189> sort<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.400> thing<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.640> we're

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
studies the sort of thing that we're

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.270 
studies the sort of thing that we're
working<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.720> other<00:01:22.229> studies<00:01:22.560> by<00:01:22.860> others<00:01:23.159> in

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
our group at the biomass centre we've

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.310 
our group at the biomass centre we've
got<00:01:25.020> people<00:01:25.740> looking<00:01:26.009> at<00:01:26.340> using<00:01:27.320> calculus

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
got people looking at using calculus

populations change over time in the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.170 
populations change over time in the
oceans

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
oceans

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.210 
oceans
we've<00:01:33.479> got<00:01:33.600> other<00:01:33.720> people<00:01:34.079> who<00:01:34.829> are<00:01:34.950> looking

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
we've got other people who are looking

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.910 
we've got other people who are looking
at<00:01:35.400> processes<00:01:36.390> within<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> body<00:01:37.020> biochemical

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
at processes within the body biochemical

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.670 
at processes within the body biochemical
processes<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:39.420> there's<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.020> whole<00:01:40.229> range<00:01:40.500> of

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
processes so there's a whole range of

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.340 
processes so there's a whole range of
applications<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:42.060> even<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.689> statistical

applications and even in statistical

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.139 
applications and even in statistical
approaches<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.100> ecology<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.670> looking<00:01:45.030> at

mean<00:01:59.040> with<00:01:59.159> mathematical<00:01:59.880> modeling<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.630> can

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
mean with mathematical modeling you can

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.170 
mean with mathematical modeling you can
predict<00:02:01.680> what<00:02:01.860> will<00:02:01.950> happen<00:02:02.009> without<00:02:02.579> you

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
predict what will happen without you

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.969

know<00:02:03.299> waiting<00:02:03.630> til<00:02:04.020> they<00:02:04.200> all<00:02:04.380> go<00:02:04.530> they<00:02:04.860> all

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
know waiting til they all go they all

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.530 
know waiting til they all go they all
vanished<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.520> too<00:02:05.700> late<00:02:05.880> yeah<00:02:06.329> that's

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
vanished and it's too late yeah that's

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.330 
vanished and it's too late yeah that's
you<00:02:07.110> know<00:02:07.200> that's<00:02:07.409> that's<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.710> big<00:02:07.860> plus<00:02:08.099> them

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
you know that's that's a big plus them

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.550 
you know that's that's a big plus them
for<00:02:08.670> modelling<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.810> actually<00:02:09.929> look

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
for modelling so you can actually look

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.020 
for modelling so you can actually look
at<00:02:10.709> with<00:02:10.890> with<00:02:11.250> quite<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.520> lot<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.640> surety<00:02:12.209> with

at with with quite a lot of surety with

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.550 
at with with quite a lot of surety with
model<00:02:13.270> about<00:02:13.450> what<00:02:13.660> what<00:02:13.870> might<00:02:14.080> happen<00:02:14.319> if

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
model about what what might happen if

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.230 
model about what what might happen if
things<00:02:14.709> stay<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.130> way<00:02:15.550> they<00:02:15.580> are<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:15.880> then<00:02:16.120> X

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
things stay the way they are and then X

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.350 
things stay the way they are and then X
Y<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.870> any<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.890> guess<00:02:18.069> more<00:02:18.220> importantly<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.970> can

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
Y a any I guess more importantly you can

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.970 
Y a any I guess more importantly you can
adjust<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.959> parameters<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.560> can<00:02:20.709> say<00:02:20.830> well

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
adjust the parameters you can say well

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.220 
adjust the parameters you can say well
what<00:02:21.490> would<00:02:21.640> happen<00:02:22.060> if<00:02:22.209> we<00:02:22.420> did<00:02:22.600> this<00:02:22.810> or<00:02:23.080> if

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
what would happen if we did this or if

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.720 
what would happen if we did this or if
we<00:02:23.350> did<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.680> or<00:02:23.950> what<00:02:24.190> would<00:02:24.310> be<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.550> best

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
we did that or what would be the best

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.790 
we did that or what would be the best
strategy<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:25.330> achieve<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.290> certain<00:02:26.530> objective

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
strategy to achieve a certain objective

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.090 
strategy to achieve a certain objective
okay<00:02:27.780> there<00:02:28.780> are<00:02:28.840> any<00:02:28.959> other<00:02:29.080> projects<00:02:29.770> at<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
okay there are any other projects at the

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.280 
okay there are any other projects at the
moment<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:30.610> you're<00:02:30.730> working<00:02:31.120> on<00:02:31.270> that<00:02:31.330> I'd

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
moment that you're working on that I'd

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.280 
moment that you're working on that I'd
be<00:02:32.470> very<00:02:32.860> dear<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.190> your<00:02:33.280> heart<00:02:33.959> yeah<00:02:34.959> well<00:02:35.260> I

be very dear to your heart yeah well I

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.229 
be very dear to your heart yeah well I
guess<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.680> guess<00:02:35.920> most<00:02:36.190> of<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.400> work<00:02:36.550> that<00:02:36.850> I'm

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
guess I guess most of the work that I'm

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.750 
guess I guess most of the work that I'm
involved<00:02:37.540> with<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:38.020> really<00:02:38.470> using<00:02:39.100> maths<00:02:39.489> to

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
involved with is really using maths to

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.050 
involved with is really using maths to
study<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:41.080> know<00:02:41.200> genomic<00:02:41.800> data<00:02:42.040> genetic<00:02:42.819> data

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
study you know genomic data genetic data

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.630 
study you know genomic data genetic data
what<00:02:43.569> can<00:02:43.600> we<00:02:43.870> say<00:02:44.050> about<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.640> evolutionary

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
what can we say about the evolutionary

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.259 
what can we say about the evolutionary
history<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.390> origins<00:02:46.959> of<00:02:47.110> species<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.860> of

history and origins of species of of

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.320 
history and origins of species of of
diseases<00:02:49.269> like<00:02:49.450> HIV<00:02:50.110> epidemic<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:51.330> influenza

what<00:02:53.290> can<00:02:53.440> we<00:02:53.530> say<00:02:53.739> about<00:02:54.300> some<00:02:55.300> of<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.480> early

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
what can we say about some of the early

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.410 
what can we say about some of the early
earliest<00:02:56.620> origins<00:02:57.160> in<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.640> tree<00:02:57.880> of<00:02:58.000> life<00:02:58.180> if

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
earliest origins in the tree of life if

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.020 
earliest origins in the tree of life if
you<00:02:58.540> like<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.459> really<00:03:00.640> try<00:03:00.880> and<00:03:00.910> make

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
you like and to really try and make

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.930 
you like and to really try and make
sense<00:03:01.360> of<00:03:01.600> this<00:03:02.130> huge<00:03:03.130> amount<00:03:03.430> of<00:03:03.519> genomic

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
sense of this huge amount of genomic

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.880 
sense of this huge amount of genomic
data<00:03:04.120> that's<00:03:04.450> becoming<00:03:04.810> available<00:03:04.989> so<00:03:05.800> it

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
data that's becoming available so it

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.370 
data that's becoming available so it
always<00:03:06.069> also<00:03:06.250> have<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.730> historical<00:03:07.330> aspect<00:03:08.170> to

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
always also have a historical aspect to

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.699 
always also have a historical aspect to
it<00:03:08.410> in<00:03:09.160> terms<00:03:09.550> of<00:03:10.060> well<00:03:10.480> it's<00:03:10.660> an<00:03:11.110> evolution

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
it in terms of well it's an evolution

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.130 
it in terms of well it's an evolution
yeah<00:03:12.700> that's<00:03:12.970> correct<00:03:13.180> I<00:03:13.480> mean<00:03:13.510> some<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:13.900> the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
yeah that's correct I mean some of the

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.290 
yeah that's correct I mean some of the
timescales<00:03:15.040> you're<00:03:15.370> just<00:03:15.580> looking<00:03:15.910> in<00:03:16.150> the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
timescales you're just looking in the

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.060 
timescales you're just looking in the
case<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.660> viruses<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.320> perhaps<00:03:17.590> only<00:03:17.739> looking

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
case of viruses you perhaps only looking

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.000 
case of viruses you perhaps only looking
a<00:03:18.130> few<00:03:18.310> years<00:03:18.579> in<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.150> case<00:03:19.360> of<00:03:19.829> mammals<00:03:20.829> you

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
a few years in the case of mammals you

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.410 
a few years in the case of mammals you
might<00:03:21.190> be<00:03:21.310> looking<00:03:21.610> back<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:21.940> know<00:03:22.000> 60

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
might be looking back you know 60

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.420 
might be looking back you know 60
million<00:03:22.720> years<00:03:22.900> in<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.650> origin<00:03:23.950> of<00:03:24.040> life<00:03:24.220> you

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
million years in the origin of life you

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.100 
million years in the origin of life you
might<00:03:24.579> be<00:03:24.700> going<00:03:24.880> back<00:03:24.940> billions<00:03:25.420> of<00:03:25.600> years<00:03:25.870> so

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
might be going back billions of years so

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.500 
might be going back billions of years so
you<00:03:26.170> know<00:03:26.350> it's<00:03:26.769> a<00:03:27.100> real<00:03:27.430> range<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.940> timescales

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
you know it's a real range of timescales

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.720 
you know it's a real range of timescales
there<00:03:28.780> so<00:03:29.320> what's<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.190> future<00:03:30.579> to<00:03:30.700> think

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
there so what's the the future to think

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.380 
there so what's the the future to think
of<00:03:31.180> this<00:03:31.570> particular<00:03:31.900> area<00:03:32.440> of<00:03:32.730> your<00:03:33.730> bio<00:03:34.030> Mets

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
of this particular area of your bio Mets

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.410 
of this particular area of your bio Mets
itself<00:03:34.900> I<00:03:35.280> future<00:03:36.280> how<00:03:36.430> old<00:03:36.610> in<00:03:36.730> here<00:03:36.910> it's

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
itself I future how old in here it's

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.509 
itself I future how old in here it's
it's<00:03:37.750> of<00:03:38.019> course<00:03:38.470> it's<00:03:38.650> hard<00:03:38.799> to<00:03:38.950> say<00:03:39.160> but<00:03:39.220> this

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
it's of course it's hard to say but this

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.490 
it's of course it's hard to say but this
area<00:03:39.910> has<00:03:40.090> just<00:03:40.150> exploded<00:03:40.810> in<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.320> last

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
area has just exploded in the last

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.130 
area has just exploded in the last
decade<00:03:42.340> or<00:03:42.370> so<00:03:42.519> there's<00:03:43.359> an<00:03:43.570> area<00:03:43.930> called

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
decade or so there's an area called

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.410 
decade or so there's an area called
bioinformatics<00:03:44.769> that<00:03:45.459> has<00:03:45.640> really<00:03:45.880> taken<00:03:46.000> off

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
bioinformatics that has really taken off

talking about yeah that's true I mean at

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:39.379 
talking about yeah that's true I mean at
school<00:04:37.770> you<00:04:37.889> learn<00:04:38.069> that<00:04:38.400> you<00:04:38.789> know<00:04:38.909> maths<00:04:39.180> is

school you learn that you know maths is
essential<00:04:40.050> as<00:04:40.229> a<00:04:40.469> tool<00:04:40.800> play<00:04:41.099> in<00:04:41.159> physics<00:04:41.669> and

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
essential as a tool play in physics and

essential as a tool play in physics and
the<00:04:41.939> hard<00:04:42.180> sciences<00:04:42.779> and<00:04:43.849> you<00:04:44.849> don't<00:04:45.210> really

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
the hard sciences and you don't really

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.999 
the hard sciences and you don't really
get<00:04:45.509> a<00:04:45.569> sense<00:04:45.870> of<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.199> applications<00:04:46.830> and

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
get a sense of the applications and

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.499 
get a sense of the applications and
biology<00:04:47.340> but<00:04:47.490> but<00:04:47.699> you<00:04:48.029> know<00:04:48.150> they<00:04:48.330> say

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
biology but but you know they say

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.659 
biology but but you know they say

a lot of physicists I've heard a moving
out<00:05:01.319> of<00:05:01.439> physics<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:01.949> getting<00:05:02.129> into<00:05:02.310> the

out of physics and getting into the

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.580 
out of physics and getting into the
biology<00:05:02.520> side<00:05:03.479> of<00:05:03.659> things<00:05:03.870> because<00:05:04.139> there's

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
biology side of things because there's

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.100 
biology side of things because there's
so<00:05:04.830> much<00:05:05.009> scope<00:05:05.340> for<00:05:05.400> doing<00:05:05.909> new<00:05:06.240> work<00:05:06.509> whereas

like and as a work style you pretty much

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.519 
like and as a work style you pretty much
anchored<00:05:15.569> to<00:05:15.629> the<00:05:15.719> office<00:05:15.990> or<00:05:16.139> do<00:05:16.199> you<00:05:16.259> get<00:05:16.409> to

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:16.529 
anchored to the office or do you get to

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:18.980 
anchored to the office or do you get to
travel<00:05:16.770> or<00:05:17.129> how<00:05:17.550> does<00:05:17.729> that<00:05:17.879> work<00:05:18.089> yeah

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
the other side of the world to New

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.300 
the other side of the world to New
Zealand<00:05:24.270> in<00:05:24.749> our<00:05:25.229> summer<00:05:25.529> and<00:05:25.860> they<00:05:26.069> come<00:05:26.279> out

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
Zealand in our summer and they come out

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.459 
Zealand in our summer and they come out
partly<00:05:26.819> I<00:05:27.089> suppose<00:05:27.599> to<00:05:27.779> visit<00:05:28.050> New<00:05:28.139> Zealand

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469 
partly I suppose to visit New Zealand

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.769 
partly I suppose to visit New Zealand
but<00:05:28.589> also<00:05:29.060> you<00:05:30.060> know<00:05:30.180> they<00:05:30.330> enjoy<00:05:30.509> working

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:30.779 
but also you know they enjoy working

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:32.719 
but also you know they enjoy working
here<00:05:31.229> and<00:05:31.439> no<00:05:31.650> we<00:05:31.800> don't<00:05:32.009> spend<00:05:32.250> a<00:05:32.310> lot<00:05:32.339> of<00:05:32.490> time

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
here and no we don't spend a lot of time

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.450 
here and no we don't spend a lot of time
in<00:05:32.849> the<00:05:32.939> office<00:05:32.969> we<00:05:33.419> we<00:05:33.960> go<00:05:34.139> to<00:05:34.199> you<00:05:34.800> know<00:05:34.830> cafes

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
in the office we we go to you know cafes

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.760 
in the office we we go to you know cafes
and<00:05:35.819> and<00:05:36.000> so<00:05:36.180> on<00:05:36.360> in<00:05:37.020> some<00:05:37.229> ways<00:05:37.379> it's<00:05:37.560> a<00:05:37.620> lot

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
and and so on in some ways it's a lot

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.429 
and and so on in some ways it's a lot
more<00:05:37.919> productive<00:05:38.250> to<00:05:38.550> work<00:05:38.729> there

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:39.439 
more productive to work there

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.959 
more productive to work there
mathematics<00:05:40.439> in<00:05:40.589> that<00:05:40.740> sense<00:05:40.979> is<00:05:41.159> is

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:41.969 
mathematics in that sense is is

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.179 
mathematics in that sense is is
excellent<00:05:42.479> because<00:05:42.839> you<00:05:43.199> can<00:05:43.409> somehow<00:05:43.740> do<00:05:43.919> it

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:44.189 
excellent because you can somehow do it

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:47.179 
excellent because you can somehow do it
anywhere<00:05:44.669> you<00:05:44.969> know<00:05:45.089> you<00:05:45.479> just<00:05:45.629> need<00:05:45.839> the<00:05:46.189> good

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:47.189 
anywhere you know you just need the good

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:49.639 
anywhere you know you just need the good
people<00:05:47.580> and<00:05:47.819> inspiring<00:05:48.270> location<00:05:49.020> some<00:05:49.409> paper

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:49.649 
people and inspiring location some paper

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:52.360 
people and inspiring location some paper
and<00:05:49.979> pins<00:05:50.189> maybe<00:05:50.849> a<00:05:50.939> computer<00:05:51.449> a<00:05:51.479> laptop

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
and pins maybe a computer a laptop

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.920 
and pins maybe a computer a laptop
ultimately<00:05:53.370> the<00:05:53.699> the<00:05:53.729> work<00:05:54.089> you<00:05:54.240> do<00:05:54.389> will<00:05:54.629> end

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
ultimately the the work you do will end

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.050 
ultimately the the work you do will end
up<00:05:55.139> somewhere<00:05:55.529> in<00:05:55.589> a<00:05:55.710> computer<00:05:56.159> and<00:05:56.339> whether

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
up somewhere in a computer and whether

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.029 
up somewhere in a computer and whether
it's<00:05:57.240> a<00:05:57.360> research<00:05:57.990> paper<00:05:58.319> or<00:05:58.500> whether<00:05:58.710> it's<00:05:58.979> a

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
it's a research paper or whether it's a

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.610 
it's a research paper or whether it's a
computer<00:05:59.310> program<00:05:59.460> that<00:06:00.500> biologists<00:06:01.500> will

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
computer program that biologists will

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.249 
computer program that biologists will
use<00:06:02.089> computers<00:06:03.089> are<00:06:03.210> essential<00:06:03.659> but<00:06:03.839> but

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 
use computers are essential but but

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:05.920 
use computers are essential but but
generally<00:06:04.469> we<00:06:04.830> do<00:06:04.949> a<00:06:04.979> lot<00:06:05.159> of<00:06:05.189> our<00:06:05.399> I<00:06:05.639> guess

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
generally we do a lot of our I guess

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.290 
generally we do a lot of our I guess
more<00:06:06.930> creative<00:06:07.439> work<00:06:07.649> out<00:06:07.919> of<00:06:08.129> the<00:06:08.250> office<00:06:08.279> hmm

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
more creative work out of the office hmm

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.839 
more creative work out of the office hmm
well<00:06:09.779> Mike<00:06:10.379> you<00:06:10.409> clearly<00:06:11.189> love<00:06:11.399> what<00:06:11.610> you<00:06:11.699> do

well Mike you clearly love what you do

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:13.189 
well Mike you clearly love what you do
and<00:06:12.089> maybe<00:06:12.270> I<00:06:12.419> should<00:06:12.629> have<00:06:12.719> worked<00:06:12.839> harder<00:06:13.139> at

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
and maybe I should have worked harder at

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:14.570 
and maybe I should have worked harder at
massacres<00:06:13.589> and<00:06:13.740> I'll<00:06:13.830> travel<00:06:14.129> more<00:06:14.399> but

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
massacres and I'll travel more but

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.219 
massacres and I'll travel more but
anyway<00:06:14.819> thanks<00:06:15.300> very<00:06:15.419> much<00:06:15.539> for<00:06:15.689> talking<00:06:15.810> okay
