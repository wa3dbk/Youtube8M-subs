00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:10.180
 It becomes world of tanks video part 112 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:15.730
 This time the German Thiago medium tank 45 h type in the video before participation in the 7.5 cm method 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:17.920
 I wanted to make a 10.5 stream movie, but recently I wasn't able to get on the plating 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.030
 It has been pulled out from the warehouse 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:25.120
 This battle is a tier 7 upper limit 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.120
 Let earns Pechipechi and damage without quenching unreasonable 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:42.070
 Let's facing this state on the west side in the battle start Risupon position was the top 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.070
 If you are lucky you may see enemies coming from you 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.540
 Ne 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:54.840
 I 'm afraid that premonition of the movement of that Sanrokumaruichi 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.840
 Naa likely attached to the two district positive in that it is good to su 1 No. 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:05.270
 Koch apparently hellcat is the manner was reflected in how the us went to spot the enemy 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.270
 Get ready for the first time in position 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:13.180
 I feel only be in that it looked'll But there tapir Hey position beat smb. Up by ganging up on the Oh 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.869
 I have not seen anything and let's go down 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.920
 It is impossible to stop the front line with just this guy 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.920
 Heading is weak and 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:37.200
 The main body of Kana which has been lowered to the safe zone is concentrated in the city area 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.450
 To switch to 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.450
 It looks like the enemy is also slightly more central 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:51.790
 There is a house or something like it is not likely to hit it in a bad position, or an enemy from a western farmer 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.190
 You're hitting me to cover it 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:02:01.140
 Should I hold back here ? 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:07.979
 If you do not manage to come home from this hill, the view of the city area will be destroyed by cross fire 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:12.400
 Is it possible to sniper where I came and let it go down? 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:18.280
 I received a useless shot while I was waiting 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:20.720
 As we showed the movement that the view on the north side piles up here, it is better to move forward in line with this 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.120
 Let's go from this Kagawa 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.120
 I can only see at pass cupola 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:37.569
 Useless advance forward advance 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:41.409
 I moved to the position where I saw it because it is an atmosphere that urban members are likely to break through 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.170
 The enemy has been seen here and there. 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:47.910
 Do that guy 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.360
 Because the technique of love is strong, it will be blown away 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.360
 Follow 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:58.030
 Enemy may also take evasive action 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.030
 First of all, one more shot 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:07.870
 Well , I would like to go to the position of Sanroku Maruichi . 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:13.420
 There are many enemies who still seem to be defeated if they are standing still 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:16.150
 Mochoi When asked engage the enemy that the foot Maruichi is beaten down enemy comes proceed 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.980
 Let's prepare for it 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:25.049
 May come from the west or may climb this hill 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.049
 I will wait in a position where you can see both 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.670
 It is likely to come out 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.670
 Follow 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.300
 Already 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.720
 Please 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:45.220
 I managed to defeat it well but there are still enemies remaining 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.790
 Do you want to go out to work from here while you are buying with numbers ? 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:53.530
 I would like to go on the west side of the line if possible 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:57.610
 However I If you do not defeat the black sea bream that are hidden earlier in the back 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:04.580
 Actually I was thinking of a surprise attack from the west side 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:10.420
 Route Let's do I in the one-car also appeared smell only enemy that was found too sweet 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.420
 It should have been quicker for 6 points 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:19.489
 I did it, and I thought it was 3 p 1 p 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.489
 Let's start from where Sthal Emile was 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.080
 It looks like I 'll hit it somehow 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.540
 Let 's go down, let's do it from Ms. 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.810
 Soi Ya 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.810
 I can go down one more shot 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:47.610
 I hit it 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:50.150
 Is it a chance to come out to the square from myself 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.150
 Abba Yo 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:05:01.130
 Now there is still some control over Sthal Emir in the northwest. 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:04.720
 The war situation is in a state of antagonism to head a little from the city side to see the possibility of Emil coming out 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.720
 I want to go here carefully 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.230
 There it is 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.400
 Follow 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.000
 me 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.670
 I hit it 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.670
 The issue should have been long, calm and slow 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.860
 Riding Well 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.900
 This is good after the m 4 45-3 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:35.889
 It is thought that both will enter the map southeast 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:40.600
 If this is left as it is, the rest 8 will be handed over the role of a scout to each other in this and the east allies after this 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:47.080
 As it was likely to do the same exchange for about a minute , take me at at 2 nearby 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:48.529
 Thing to me that the sash or have at east three sides also edged To proceed move towards specific base side 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:54.069
 is 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:54.069
 This is a chat and exchange of maps only, so fast forward 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.180
 Yoshi Yoshi at 2 seems to be coming 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.970
 Eat it 45 of the enemy were visible 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.620
 He's 10.5 centimeters 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.010
 Yaro go another shot 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.010
 Follow 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.780
 Was it alright hidden behind the house? 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.100
 I wonder if it is a house that can be broken 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:33.140
 def 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.140
 It looks like it's not completely broken 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:42.409
 Besides, you can see the enemy's m 4 already, but you can leave other allies in battle. 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.409
 Wonder 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.830
 I see it again 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:56.040
 Although it seems to be able to bring in up to Naa once partially destroyed'm not missing here 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.490
 It is not realistic to open a house gap 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:02.319
 Let's pack 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:04.620
 In addition , at 2 of dying is thrust into here, and it is here to put together and defeat 

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:04.620
 Let's go 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:14.730
 m 4 The perspective did it 45 left it 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.730
 Or Mukkuru 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.060
 No problem 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:24.300
 I will put a piece at a stretch by sandwiching this as it is 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:26.220
 Get your ad call and you 're ready to go 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:31.760
 Name fur 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:31.760
 Somewhat yes Yes I left-left 

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:51.850
 End of battle This is the victory m get the badge 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:53.500
 I just looked back now and I didn't have the time to make it in the early stages 

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:57.360
 Video ends here 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.360
 Thank you for your viewing
