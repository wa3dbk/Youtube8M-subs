00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
the player behind him near her space to

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:43.510 
the player behind him near her space to
move<00:02:33.380> into<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:36.140> he<00:02:36.230> gets<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.530> shot<00:02:36.710> off<00:02:42.520> here

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
move into and he gets the shot off here

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.420 
move into and he gets the shot off here
again<00:02:43.820> you'll<00:02:44.060> see<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:45.260> support<00:02:45.710> striker

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
again you'll see the support striker

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.420 
again you'll see the support striker
making<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.540> run<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.110> drag<00:02:48.470> players<00:02:48.800> out<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.280> way

making a run to drag players out the way

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.480 
making a run to drag players out the way
and<00:02:50.080> in<00:02:51.080> this<00:02:51.320> case<00:02:51.590> he's<00:02:52.040> going<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.310> leave

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
and in this case he's going to leave

00:02:52.490 --> 00:03:00.680 
and in this case he's going to leave
space<00:02:52.850> for<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.180> pass<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.720> be<00:02:53.840> made<00:02:54.020> into

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.000 

in<00:03:01.690> this<00:03:01.870> video<00:03:02.080> we're<00:03:02.349> going<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.500> take<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.739> look

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
in this video we're going to take a look

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.979 
in this video we're going to take a look
at<00:03:03.159> how<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.400> active<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.090> effects<00:03:04.750> all

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
at how the active I I effects all

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.890 
at how the active I I effects all
situations<00:03:05.799> and<00:03:06.159> how<00:03:06.849> that<00:03:06.909> extends<00:03:07.690> into

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
situations and how that extends into

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.309 
situations and how that extends into
defending<00:03:11.069> impairs<00:03:12.069> 2011<00:03:13.000> you'll<00:03:13.959> see<00:03:14.140> here

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
defending impairs 2011 you'll see here

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.360 
defending impairs 2011 you'll see here
when<00:03:14.440> we<00:03:14.500> stop<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.799> video<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.250> the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
when we stop the video that the

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.280 
when we stop the video that the
formation<00:03:15.879> of<00:03:15.970> teams<00:03:16.269> at<00:03:16.510> times<00:03:16.810> could<00:03:17.140> be

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
formation of teams at times could be

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.640 
formation of teams at times could be
really<00:03:17.530> have<00:03:18.780> hazardous<00:03:19.780> easier<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.440> the

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
really have hazardous easier that the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.860 
really have hazardous easier that the
space<00:03:21.010> in<00:03:21.250> between<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.970> defensive<00:03:22.480> line<00:03:22.510> and

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
space in between the defensive line and

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.740 
space in between the defensive line and
the<00:03:22.930> midfield<00:03:23.319> line<00:03:23.530> is<00:03:23.920> far<00:03:24.220> too<00:03:24.250> big

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
the midfield line is far too big

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.699 
the midfield line is far too big
allowing<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.810> player<00:03:25.959> to<00:03:26.019> drift<00:03:26.349> into<00:03:26.590> the

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
allowing the player to drift into the

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.970 
allowing the player to drift into the
space<00:03:26.950> gear<00:03:27.250> shot<00:03:27.519> off<00:03:28.019> it<00:03:29.019> prepares<00:03:29.409> 2012

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
space gear shot off it prepares 2012

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.729 
space gear shot off it prepares 2012
we're<00:03:30.129> going<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.310> pause<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.730> action<00:03:30.819> here<00:03:31.420> and

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
we're going to pause the action here and

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.599 
we're going to pause the action here and
you<00:03:32.739> should<00:03:32.950> be<00:03:33.040> able<00:03:33.129> to<00:03:33.250> see<00:03:33.370> that<00:03:33.489> the

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
you should be able to see that the

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.430 
you should be able to see that the
communication<00:03:33.970> between<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.690> defensive<00:03:35.260> and

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
communication between the defensive and

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.330 
communication between the defensive and
the<00:03:35.620> midfield<00:03:36.010> lines<00:03:36.250> is<00:03:36.549> much<00:03:36.879> better<00:03:38.220> so<00:03:39.220> the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
the midfield lines is much better so the

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.130 
the midfield lines is much better so the
team<00:03:39.549> generally<00:03:40.060> tries<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.690> hold<00:03:40.840> its<00:03:41.049> shape

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
team generally tries to hold its shape

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.559 
team generally tries to hold its shape
much<00:03:41.709> better<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.790> it<00:03:42.940> results<00:03:43.299> in<00:03:43.390> this

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
much better and it results in this

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.020 
much better and it results in this
player<00:03:43.840> bunching<00:03:44.349> we've<00:03:45.220> already<00:03:45.400> seen<00:03:45.730> how

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
player bunching we've already seen how

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.990 
player bunching we've already seen how
the<00:03:46.480> active<00:03:46.810> AI<00:03:46.930> effects<00:03:47.709> formations<00:03:48.670> and

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
the active AI effects formations and

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.339 
the active AI effects formations and
defending<00:03:49.720> now<00:03:49.840> we're<00:03:49.959> going<00:03:50.049> to<00:03:50.109> take<00:03:50.290> a

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
defending now we're going to take a

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.110 
defending now we're going to take a
closer<00:03:50.680> look<00:03:50.829> at<00:03:51.190> how<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:51.579> active<00:03:51.970> I<00:03:52.090> I

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
closer look at how the active I I

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.369 
closer look at how the active I I
effects<00:03:52.900> individual<00:03:53.500> decisions<00:03:55.170> so<00:03:56.170> at<00:03:56.290> the

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
there but then he'll spot then in

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.879 
there but then he'll spot then in
midfield<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.510> danger<00:04:04.930> has<00:04:05.019> changed<00:04:05.500> so<00:04:05.739> he

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
midfield the danger has changed so he

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
the new attacking possibilities that

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.860 
the new attacking possibilities that
we've<00:04:35.889> added<00:04:36.070> into<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.520> game<00:04:36.639> so<00:04:37.599> that<00:04:37.780> the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
we've added into the game so that the

we've added into the game so that the
balance<00:04:38.199> is<00:04:38.380> just<00:04:38.620> right

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.210 

turning<00:04:42.450> our<00:04:42.570> attention<00:04:42.600> now<00:04:43.260> to<00:04:43.320> a<00:04:43.770> brand<00:04:44.130> new
