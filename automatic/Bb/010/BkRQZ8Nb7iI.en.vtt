 Internet channel we are going to know the 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.610
 víctor history vásquez tie former 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.880
 general manager of chaya and macerated in 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:26.439
 pisco he is a lawyer by profession but 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.150
 he has this business and does not suddenly know 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.550
 maybe not doing the business of his life 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.220
 that is ready welcome to such a 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.470
 thank you very much and I did not take 28 years 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.290
 already a lawyer if yes exactly 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.380
 as well a lawyer ventures into this 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.120
 good business actually I already this 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.500
 I have been exercising the right for many 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.230
 years but I always wanted to have a 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.030
 own business and I have always been 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.120
 fascinated pisco or always has 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.530
 liked very much and in my house always 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.600
 we have had the habit of the ends 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.400
 of the week to have family lunches and 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.750
 always then take a girl in a 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:05.110
 thing like that and a day like to try to 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.200
 break the scheme we thought of macerating 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.659
 He said this we had seen it before in 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.670
 several bars in several restaurants and the 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.170
 truth is that we think it's a super good 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.150
 idea to try to do it in our homes 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.280
 we know people who also do it 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.950
 own houses there are many people who more 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.380
 it was fixed on its own and this started us 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.300
 to go out pretty well we started 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.860
 try with various ingredients and 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.590
 soon one day I realized that really 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.240
 the macerated pisco was not sold then 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.430
 in an individual presentation in 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.020
 actually people buy it by the glass 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.000
 practically when you 're in a bar in 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.470
 one in a restaurant and it seems like a 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.770
 good opportunity I thought there was 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.410
 there is a good potential to differentiate 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.240
 no and nothing occurred to me and I sent 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.610
 the perfect business with how much of 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.970
 initial capital you started more or less 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.460
 about 20 thousand soles if the subject is 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.080
 it's complicated because you have to buy the 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.760
 disc on the one hand to buy all the 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.700
 ingredients you have to do the development 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.940
 of the brand the bottles all the whole 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.550
 labeling subject to be realities 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.619
 and the process itself is not what we say is that 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.080
 is one is a slow process because every 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.150
 bottle does more was three months then 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.370
 this is a subject that requires time is 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.340
 an issue that requires investment and good 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.490
 it's a cost issue when a how much was your 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.320
 initial production and now answer 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.810
 this we or are more or less in each 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.580
 production time that are like you 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.360
 I say about three months or less are 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.210
 taking this out I do not know weigh between 500 and 800 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.280
 bottles 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.590
 this good they are placing we say with 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.300
 him with him over time this is not that 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:46.240
 initially all come out during that 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:48.130
 period this will be then in about 15 months 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.010
 and if you tell me something publicist that 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.250
 this makes it expert 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.260
 surely exactly good always 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.450
 there are people who help me do not say 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.350
 exactly very well now account for 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.150
 what is how many types of flavors do 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.070
 we now have five 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.930
 types of presentations are five 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.640
 macerated different is the mash of 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.040
 strawberry the coca leaf mash the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.990
 I mentioned aguaymanto macerate of 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.330
 cinnamon and grape mash by google 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.460
 is not down is because the fruit itself 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.640
 exactly every each bottle has 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.950
 inside the fruit with which the process 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.350
 of maceration let's say as follows 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.640
 working when you do not have it 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.080
 there is always the possibility that 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.010
 when you take out of the bottle you can 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.600
 eat the fruit more was this this 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.900
 in how much time was this accelerated 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.420
 country each one is macerated three months 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.920
 each one will be or three months if this now 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.320
 yes little the presentation also 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.020
 thank you tell me where all that what 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.180
 you sell in a virtual way you have it in a 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.490
 physical point yes we mainly 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.710
 we sell through our 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.270
 facebook is our our main 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.830
 point of sale but we also 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.310
 we found in a liquor store that 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.650
 call to the day wine where one day came 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.990
 As a girl, it's a liquor store that's left 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.060
 the spring avenue almost reaching 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.820
 whitewashed and there you can also find 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.510
 our brand so is the fan page which 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.070
 is that there are macerated in pisco that 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:20.860
 you can find us on facebook 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:23.950
 ch to him and it's a Quechua word that 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:27.070
 means to toast for something new that I 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.650
 he really liked the meaning and in 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.880
 I really wanted him to have something on 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.880
 more than a simple name that says 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.400
 I wish they had meaning behind 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.650
 and a little bit that reflects the whole idea of 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.540
 broad mark hence how much does a 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.310
 older bottle we do not sell 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:48.250
 at 40 soles 40 if this always good 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.720
 we get this promotions not this if 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.860
 buy quantities can always be 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.630
 make discounts you can include glasses 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.430
 yes yes yes you buy it and you also have 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.030
 good is a bottle but you can 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.800
 sell me two bottles and expensive 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.420
 If we sell the amount that the 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.010
 that people require towards people 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.600
 requires a bottle is a bottle if 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.810
 people require a box is a box 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.040
 whatever it is that suits the 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.710
 person there is no problem with 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.810
 hector what is the business prediction 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.970
 well we actually look for this 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.880
 always grow we seek to be in many 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.990
 more points of sale and right now we 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.700
 we find in a process of growth 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.760
 working with a distributor that we 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.430
 will help place us in one place 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.280
 the question is about the product the 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.100
 next what kind of pisco do you use for 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:44.080
 if this we use pisco de uva 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:47.500
 torontel since it is one of the grapes that 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.650
 is used to make the pisco is a 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.650
 grape of the aromatic type that is 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.930
 quite nice let's say and that 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.360
 we consider that he plays a lot 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.250
 well with the maceration process with the 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.660
 theme of fruits and everything and all 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.970
 peaks that we use 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.620
 only pisco the war torontel good 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.940
 it would be father's day accordingly 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.740
 surely this can also be a 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.050
