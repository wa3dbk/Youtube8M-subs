00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.489
 has a presence for our public to 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.070
 people build from the beginning of the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.199
 program this beautiful piece and now we 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.229
 also will I'm going to study to pass 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.900
 for the zone will launch because this is a 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.100
 touch bag changer looks and knows how 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.659
 it works 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.150
 You're going to pick up, do not pick up from here. 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.439
 better than the time is this she will do 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.920
 so she will close here fold it 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.780
 again look at it so she needs 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.600
 change it or carry it all 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.900
 open, you will not leave it inside the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.220
 bag part so other space mass 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.650
 That's how it looks , and it leaves. 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.320
 inside the bag needs to change the baby 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.229
 she goes there she opens the piece herself and the mother 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.360
 puts in the bag in rhythm nothing she 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.700
 stay little stay little and who? 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.530
 not even know it's time they want at the time 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.159
 what we want then in forecast is 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.710
 our focus also then it is important to 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.619
 a piece so important she has April 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.390
 work and opened or changed over baby 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.130
 change or place it inside the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.899
 pocket like these little pieces and 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.119
 also trust end i will explain 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.950
 here it has become if this is a step 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.560
 at a very well explained step then the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.940
 All right, I've already left the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.940
 site tá 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.840
 will need to dribble the plastic can be 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.650
 number 1 222 is the thickness 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.630
 the lining the acrylic blanket and the fabric 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.210
 stamped dinho then coloco cuts everything 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:32.480
 the fabric always a little bigger than the 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:36.780
 mother then the length is 70 and the width 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.970
 4570 by 45 and this measure that tati 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.280
 I brought it to the tape measure, we go. 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.340
 now they have an idea of 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.500
 How much is the printed part looks from 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.120
 stamped she will put can save and 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.480
 here you can see 4445 has printed this 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.730
 part of the one that has the white fabric 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.190
 need a white fabric 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.190
 there it will be a little smaller and it looks like it 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.240
 remade the painting that is then that part 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.260
 equitable 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.530
 she's going to put it so look 27 is giving 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.170
 wide and buy the same 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.150
 here next to the width of this thing okay 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.680
 This is where this is going. 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.100
 stay after geilson 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.530
 she does the painting is also excluding a 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.440
 another model 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.239
 So what are you doing late ? I did. 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.150
 at home there I will pass this on not to 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.630
 make it late of course who we 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.930
 Talk about what it 's like not to do not 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.910
 Do people, I tried after I finished. 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.730
 Not really good at risk 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.680
 so comb before riding is better 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.660
 It 's better, it's better to paint better. 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.340
 risk better for everything then it's good 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.620
 You pass this tip on her, right? 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.480
