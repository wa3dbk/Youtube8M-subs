 throwing in a bomb then he saw is 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.010
 he realizes that his life is in 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.630
 danger and that has somehow 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.300

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:58.260
 favorite son the genres are the action 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.490
 psychological science fiction insein and 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.650

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.070

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.030
 in that game that everyone good 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:11.010
 constant have it better is something like that and 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.490
 he is playing one day but suddenly 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.530
 he wakes up in measure and then they go to 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.140
 see what fart because we play nothing more 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.530
 nothing is played because they beat him but 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.710
 then he remembers everything and good that 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.330
 have love if I do not know why it's not that 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.500
 does not say and why until the end of the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.640
 series begins everything that would already be love 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.620
 and in games 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.590
 I do not know what those are called but they're like 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.560
 bombs there's nothing like that and there's 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.930
 knives but there are no for example 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.420
 swords no pistols are bombs 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.360
 pumps pumps then they are in the 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.430
 island are like 15 people not like 30 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.880
 people and if you want there are in the magazine 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.770
 they have to get 7 crystallites and here 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.110
 in the little hill it unfolds from the hand 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.110
 when you die and good 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.130
 it's all all televised to the and 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.619
 then people think that their show 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.730
 but in real life there are real deaths 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.590
 there are betrayals despair of everything 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.140
 type there are different types of ping 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.950
 called by the bin are the little bombs in 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.950
 different types 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.450
 in fact, I'm going to say it for 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.850
 entering that island is because someone 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.740
 wrote a letter saying that you do not 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.800
 I wanted to see in the world and you wanted me to 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.450
 die and good 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.060
 this person says that time to have 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.890
 been fought very gamer gamer so 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.890
 we always walk for all family 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.659
 his father told his father that he was a 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.019
 good for nothing since I do not have work 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.579
 and your magnetic mind then you 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.739
 they will discover who sent that 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:57.099
 letter and why also from the other 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:00.370
 principal that is not according to the name but is 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.560
 a trace with dyes finish chinganas and 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.739
 they're afraid of the plane so it's got 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.510
 scary but hey there are two episodes 12 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.250
 episodes of this are very well their 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:14.810
 episodes and yes 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.810
 faults in a season 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.800
 it stays in an ending where it is like 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.630
 I say do not take an ending where and 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.180
 can import anime because both 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.700
 things like in any other anime but 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.860
 that here stays in that if it will continue but 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:36.680
 taking that what we want to know there is 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.750
 manga and already start the manga are already 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.830
 being different chapters development 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.590
 so then I think that for January 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.000
 we could have this anime all but not 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.910
 I have seen none 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.190
 As I say, you have not seen any 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.740
 that is nothing of which day that if it goes to 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.780
 leave in January or anything like that alone is my 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.080
 iberostar 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.120
 I leave it there for you to watch it at and 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.090
 well in a little while more the videos of the 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.490
