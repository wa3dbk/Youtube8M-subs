00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.570
 only a selection will appear 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.489
 where is it 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.350
 this will take about 10 minutes 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.620
 I'm going to cancel it because I already have it 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.620

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.339
 after they have united it they will have a 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.379
 rar file like this to peel 6.20 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.800

 iso file to mount your image of 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.430
 disk need an image emulator 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.930
 of disk in my case I use the daemon 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.940

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.580

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.970
 disk images and look for the image of 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.970
 disk 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.590
 they select it and the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.590
 mounts 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.090
 but while the image is mounted 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.159

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.729
