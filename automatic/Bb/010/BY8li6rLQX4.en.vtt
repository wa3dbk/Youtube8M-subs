00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.649
 today in how it is done we are going to prepare a 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.690
 delicious chocolate mousse cake 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.330
 is a recipe that will please the most 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.820
 sweet tooth of the family and especially to the 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.000
 children for this we are going to remove the 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.300
 following ingredients some cookies 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.730
 chocolate to make liquid cream sugar 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.830
 and butter let's proceed to the 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.980
 recipe the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.650
 take the cookies put them in a bowl and 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.419
 crush them with a mortar or 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.809
 we can crush in a blender if 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.690
 meanwhile you want in a saucepan 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.670
 we put all the butter to melt 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.489
 to make the base and for the base 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.949
 we also need 100 grams of 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.010
 melting chocolate we melt all 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:53.850
 in a pot and so we will prepare the dough 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.239
 when I'm stuck we take the chocolate 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.110
 and we add to the cookies that we put 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.300
 crushed 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.180
 As you can see in Hebron, they are already crushed 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.240
 and now I take the chocolate 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:13.460
 cheat be careful because it burns 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.980
 and not enough to go a uniting 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.500
 a homogenous mass I'm moving the 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.490
 Cookies with a spatula or spoon 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.340
 of wood so as not to burn us 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.140
 and I already have the base of the cake in a 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.280
 cake in a cake mold that 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.790
 previously greased butter 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.340
 good to introduce the cookies the mass of 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.520
 cookies with chocolate and butter and 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.680
 today we are going to make the base we are going to a 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.460
 crushing it by mounting it to agree 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.259
 all the base of the command of the cake you see 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.790
 how it has been 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.220
 but what we are going to do is leave it 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.530
 cool one hour because it is hot and 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.200
 If not, one would be bad for us 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.530
 then let's let the dough cool and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.170
 meanwhile I have not said it before 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.080
 we put in a little eight milk 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.759
 sheets of neutral gelatin so that it 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.530
 go softening that that's going to be what 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.750
 that will make us harden the mousse 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.660
 but in the meantime remember the base 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.660
 let's let it cool one hour 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.819
 in the time of that hour we can 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.500
 take advantage of it by melting the rest of 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.500
 chocolate that we are going to use to 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.060
 make the mousse in this case are 300 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.480
 grams of chocolate we're going 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.400
 you will see melting and fusing 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.810
 is making a a molten chocolate 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.510
 when it is already formulated we add the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.420
 gelatin that is dissolved in milk 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.360
 is that this soft and we're going 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.910
 doing little by little on fire not very 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.230
 strong and medium fire moving from time to time 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.300
 when so that no lumps come out 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.769
 when we already have them dissolved we add 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.740
 the milk that we have to soak it 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:01.390
 we can take advantage of it in the recipe 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:05.370
 we move until everything is very 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.370
 very soft chocolate cream 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.700
 our is going to take it out the mus the 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.340
 we have there encloses 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.640
 the mold with cream recipes 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.860
 mounted and the egg whites cheap 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.870
 mentioned is a recipe that I have 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.340
 in another channel of how cream is mounted 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.239
 mounted here I have already done 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.819
 previously and we add it to the cream 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.180
 chocolate that we have we add all the 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.180
 whipped cream 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.790
 and we mix it very well this will make the 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.739
 very soft wench 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.230
 and we mix it very well with chocolate 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.840
 melted with the gelatin when it's 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.959
 this of loose we add immediately the 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.060
 Clear raised to the point of snow are 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.340
 mounted to the point of snow that also 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.840
 I have the recipe in another tournament where 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.090
 You will see how to do it in a very 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:02.359
 simple let's join the the clear ones with 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.359
 with chocolate and cream and now 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:08.959
 that we have everything well mixed what 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:10.519
 put in the mold with the cookies is 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.739
 the part that covers the top part 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.109
 mousse we let it cool in the fridge 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.859
 throughout the night so that the mousse 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:22.250
 harden and the next day look what 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.080
 that we have a delicious cake 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.570
 chocolate mousse is that right now and what 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.430
 good looking have we are going to delay the 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.500
 to be able to consume it 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.720
 we unmold it and look help I have it 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.910
 there now we are going to decorate it and that already gives 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.780
 consumer taste I've used 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.150
 minutes of chocolate in used strawberries are 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.010
 you can use cream you can use cinnamon 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.350
