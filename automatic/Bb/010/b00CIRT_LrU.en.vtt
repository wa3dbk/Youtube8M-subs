 generation is scarce 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.550
 weeks and as always happens in these 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.960
 many cases we are about to retire 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.000
 our consoles and lose the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.740
 opportunity to enjoy certain jewels 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.410

 he has a good time of life with this 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.520
 in mind we wanted to present a list 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.710
 with the game that some members of the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.539
 staff consider the one that 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.699

 the arrival of playstation 4 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.810

 promise a look never seen before and 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.300
 in 2009 we realized that the promise 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.740
 it was a bit short but still 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.720
 it was about one of the titles 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.090

 that turns its victims into 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.140
 aggressive and dangerous creatures to 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.180
 as the process of infestation 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.340
 advances also change their attributes 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.010
 from fast and rabid individuals 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.049
 up heavens but deadly enemies the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.700
 level of challenge is significant in 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.890
 special if we take into account that 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.829

 some advance the greatest lesson of 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.120
 the last of us' opponents more 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.610
 dangerous are not the monsters but the 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.890
 humans who seek to survive in order to 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.780
 accounts the theme and the plot explore a 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.760
 of the most terrifying perspectives of 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.830
 love and surrender by another human being not 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.930
 it is an excessive passion for the 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.120
 world but to choose an object one 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.380
 person a fragile idea to value it for 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.380

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.020
 many times you have to scale all kinds 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.480
 of structures and sometimes induce a 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.520
 little of vertigo the plot is exciting 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.320
 and has good humor in the dialogues and in 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.660

 quality and beauty in every way 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.750
 uncharted 2 among thieves I think the 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.750
 best of the trilogy 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:43.089

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.160
 tremendous history in terms of dungeon 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.200

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.770
 eloquent 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.480
 however demon s souls was the title 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.700
 who made the study known to the 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.950
 great public in the West and it was not for 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.990
 chance the game is the culmination of 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.580
 a decade of work in the genre the 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.210
 which could unleash its full potential 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.860
 thanks to the power of the current generation 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.930
 far away are the days when the veteran 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.060
 lonely could acquire the last 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.670
 diabolical creation of the old school and 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.680
 spend weeks trying to finish it on 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.960
 abandonment of campaigns in favor of 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.970
 multiplayer the casual games and the 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.830

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.920
 danger 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.770
 demon s souls is a refuge for those 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.180
 players or rather the strength of 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.970
 death in which only a few 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.890
 chosen may inhabit I do not exaggerate the 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.750
 affirm that the series restored my faith 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.030
 in video games finally something 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.790

 the start and the first battle against a 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.650
