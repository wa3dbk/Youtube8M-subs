basically show you how small this is I

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.480 
basically show you how small this is I
compare<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.430> size<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:19.490> binocular

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
compare it to the size of a binocular

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.689 
compare it to the size of a binocular
case<00:00:21.289> comes<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:22.529> very<00:00:22.830> attractive<00:00:22.949> black

extremely small compared to any of the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.410 
extremely small compared to any of the
other<00:00:31.890> portables<00:00:32.399> I'm<00:00:32.579> basically<00:00:33.030> holding<00:00:33.300> it

push lift up on the plastic piece and

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.000 
push lift up on the plastic piece and
then<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.520> push<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.300> setting<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.770> one

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
then you push the setting this is one

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.790 
then you push the setting this is one
liter<00:00:48.170> per<00:00:49.170> pulse

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
liter per pulse

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.410 
liter per pulse
it's<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.100> bulb<00:00:50.399> bursting<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:52.820> oxygen<00:00:53.820> at<00:00:54.149> 1

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
it's a bulb bursting of oxygen at 1

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.600 
it's a bulb bursting of oxygen at 1
liter<00:00:54.629> per<00:00:54.870> minute<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.289> then<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.460> turn

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
liter per minute and then you can turn

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.970 
liter per minute and then you can turn
it<00:00:56.670> up<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.969> 2<00:00:57.239> what<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.379> about<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:58.949> you

and then 3 liters per minute and this is

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.490 
and then 3 liters per minute and this is
a<00:01:08.909> little<00:01:09.590> nozzle<00:01:10.590> where<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.939> o2<00:01:12.110> or<00:01:13.110> ninety

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
a little nozzle where the o2 or ninety

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.320 
a little nozzle where the o2 or ninety
percent<00:01:13.710> purity<00:01:14.220> will<00:01:14.549> come<00:01:14.760> out<00:01:14.909> depending

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
percent purity will come out depending

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.350 
percent purity will come out depending
on<00:01:15.420> humidity<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.049> altitude<00:01:17.030> this<00:01:18.030> particular

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
on humidity and altitude this particular

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.050 
on humidity and altitude this particular
unit<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.900> very<00:01:19.140> quiet<00:01:19.700> it'll<00:01:20.700> tell<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.939> the

unit is very quiet it'll tell you the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.330 
unit is very quiet it'll tell you the
battery<00:01:21.360> setting<00:01:21.830> you<00:01:22.830> got<00:01:22.979> 25%<00:01:24.710> for<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
battery setting you got 25% for the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:35.310 
battery setting you got 25% for the
got<00:01:27.850> 25%<00:01:28.330> 50%<00:01:29.700> 75%<00:01:30.900> 100%<00:01:31.900> and<00:01:34.080> it's<00:01:35.080> got<00:01:35.230> an

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
got 25% 50% 75% 100% and it's got an

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.860 
got 25% 50% 75% 100% and it's got an

unit because that is extremely small
very<00:01:46.330> light<00:01:46.660> and<00:01:46.900> this<00:01:47.229> is<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.619> carrying<00:01:48.040> case

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
very light and this is the carrying case

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.750 
very light and this is the carrying case
where<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:49.900> do<00:01:50.110> just<00:01:50.440> basically<00:01:51.310> put<00:01:51.550> it<00:01:51.610> right
