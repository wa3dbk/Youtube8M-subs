00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.439
 is the man in black 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:13.400
 with the lenses placed in london box 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.110
 with latex gloves Julius Caesar at 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.789
 throughout your career 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.840
 how many artists have painted a painting 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:23.760
 in your honor 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.369
 I imagined many, however, 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.910
 nobody has ever painted something like I'm going 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:34.579
 to make me stay superb ensures that 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:38.449
 Impressionist style we will make glue 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:44.329
 and after using a fat brush is this 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:46.800
 bright substance that if we're going to 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:51.500
 paint with bright name 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.500
 Lords of the mind 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.260
 stars when you said you were going to 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.850
 do something that they had never done me 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:04.330
 I imagined going to paint with blood 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.729
 with glitter, look who I am for 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.460
 judge you July Caesar tell me if I'm wrong 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.800
 but I think 99.9 percent of 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.140
 all the children in kindergarten paint with 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.270
 bright is good let's keep talking about 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.930
 this better please that between the team 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.930
 of art 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.120
 there are black men 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.860
 let's wash dishes 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.040
 what a disappointment man in black we bring the 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.890
 champion and you want to put it to wash 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.570
 frets 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.090
 the name of the black does not go up 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.580
 quadrilateral goes to the polyhedron of 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.700
 hip but 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.820
 made of sharp and each one of you 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.070
 to have this that is really I'm going to 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.539
 teaching how we will do this is a 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.060
 glue made here in the anthill in 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:03.479
 I can not leave the same laboratory 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.600
 ice cream we have an image which is 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.090
 will reveal very soon with this substance 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.580
 I said the look 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.810
 strange are the boys doing 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.540
 you can also do this 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.879
 July side Caesar because I do not want 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.010
 but he serves me better what I have to 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.629
 you are inspired by what the island has left you 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.910
 what your career has left you 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.500
 that you want something big something that 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.440
 Really 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.170
 inspire you in this is weird because the 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.330
 man in black uses as a canvas the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.630
 universe 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.080
 this 10th of the black man is a canvas 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.080
 charro 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.980
 they have time can do it calmly 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.050
 did you do these sections that are left 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:53.670
 something nice to the beast man in black 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.670
 he lives on his own island 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.590
 we also have roller and we have 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:03.310
 larger brushes if they want to do 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.970
 something with what they are doing back there 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.049
 to see I can not see anything 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.019
 July Cesar Chavez is not getting 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:14.489
 its firm in this canvas we can sell 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.489
 this on ebay as a self-portrait 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.500
 and the cans for the production said 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:26.490
 that they were going to use the knee to paint 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.980
 nolan day the roller does not hear me once 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.390
 dine 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.390
 and I had to hang it 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:48.620
 for those who also tried to save 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.239
 nor the one who has paid his last letter 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.010
 now so it was like telegram 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.120
 saving letter is that the vowels of 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.120
 also every droplet 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.430
 m 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.959
 leave your accountant 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.610
 Caesar would like to add something to the part 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.450
 above 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.450
 Thank you 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.380
 I really have my raincoat 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.380
 stilts 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.360
 and some stolen watches and this I bring that 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.920
 when putting neither black nor white there is no way 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.370
 to make Chinese shorts to the man of 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.370
 black I do not want to take out Japanese bread 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.420
 I think mine was very nice 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.280
 now at home they will be about to see it 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.190
 when we use the fairy dust that 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.470
 the man in black brings the neutrals 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.440
 theater with fairy dust 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.510
 in fact if someone has seen a bell 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.820
 please tell us until you know that the 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.950
 man in black 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.930
 the capture I believe that a 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.880
 star the affair became a 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:02.370
 shooting star grabbed the dust in the background 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:06.750
 and that could have gone through the stationery 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:10.970
 and man is writing a diary 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.860

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:34.560

 I like the truth yes 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.960
