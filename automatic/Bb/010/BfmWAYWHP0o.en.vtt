that that streak of self-preservation

that that streak of self-preservation
every<00:02:59.950> once<00:03:00.130> in<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.340> while<00:03:00.750> but<00:03:01.750> notice<00:03:02.790> all<00:03:03.790> as

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
every once in a while but notice all as

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.360 
every once in a while but notice all as
well<00:03:04.300> a<00:03:05.970> little<00:03:06.970> bit<00:03:07.090> of<00:03:07.180> stiffness<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:09.250> you're

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
well a little bit of stiffness so you're

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.220 
well a little bit of stiffness so you're
going<00:03:09.489> to<00:03:09.580> have<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.700> little<00:03:09.970> bit<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.230> localized

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
going to have a little bit of localized

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.920 
going to have a little bit of localized
swelling<00:03:11.850> because<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:13.180> proteins<00:03:13.630> that<00:03:13.870> he

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
swelling because the proteins that he

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.410 
swelling because the proteins that he
just<00:03:14.110> injected<00:03:14.709> into<00:03:14.860> that<00:03:14.980> finger<00:03:15.370> are<00:03:16.239> going

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
just injected into that finger are going

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.699 
just injected into that finger are going
to<00:03:16.480> cause<00:03:16.660> my<00:03:16.870> body<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.320> have<00:03:17.440> an<00:03:17.530> allergic

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
to cause my body to have an allergic

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.539 
to cause my body to have an allergic
reaction<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:19.920> that's<00:03:20.920> what's<00:03:21.160> happening

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
reaction and that's what's happening

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:22.130 
reaction and that's what's happening
right<00:03:21.700> now

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
right now

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.410 
right now
so<00:03:23.140> we'll<00:03:23.830> give<00:03:23.980> it<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.100> few<00:03:24.280> minutes<00:03:24.370> I'll<00:03:25.150> give

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
so we'll give it a few minutes I'll give

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.880 
so we'll give it a few minutes I'll give
you<00:03:25.510> an<00:03:25.600> update<00:03:25.660> give<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:27.040> a<00:03:27.100> timeline<00:03:28.890> we'll

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
you an update give you a timeline we'll

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.949 
you an update give you a timeline we'll
see<00:03:30.100> if<00:03:30.190> this<00:03:30.340> pain<00:03:30.610> gets<00:03:31.030> worse<00:03:31.269> or<00:03:31.720> if<00:03:31.870> it

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
see if this pain gets worse or if it

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.770 
see if this pain gets worse or if it
fades

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.880 

it's<00:03:36.050> been<00:03:36.260> about<00:03:36.410> 15<00:03:36.650> minutes<00:03:38.590> no<00:03:39.590> visible

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890

reaction<00:03:40.160> we're<00:03:40.970> down<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.480> a<00:03:41.930> dull<00:03:42.500> throb<00:03:42.860> I

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
reaction we're down to a dull throb I

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.460 
reaction we're down to a dull throb I
can<00:03:44.210> pretty<00:03:44.360> much<00:03:44.420> ignore<00:03:44.750> now<00:03:45.140> and

flexibility is returning this is not

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.380 
flexibility is returning this is not
even<00:03:50.840> as<00:03:50.960> bad<00:03:51.140> as<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.320> wasp<00:03:51.590> sting

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
don't really pose any threat so that's

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.470 
don't really pose any threat so that's
