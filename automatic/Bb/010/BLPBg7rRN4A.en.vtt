00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.000
 today I want you to schubert sr1 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.010
 imagine it is a helmet for 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.900
 athlete and racer as well as very good 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.210
 suitable for the race track here 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.619
 it is the model that represents 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.660
 means he is in a friendly 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.520
 matt black in combination with red 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:36.480
 painted air intake grille red 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:37.470
 logo and lettering the helmet is available 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.170
 currently still in others 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.600
 color combinations and decors currently for 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.180
 In 2015, there is the instance in the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.149
 combination with red blue and orange as 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:58.410
 dekore gives s play to late trad and 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:59.850
 pretzel the visor has several races 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.949
 points and has a visor 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.570
 Lock this one can also use 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.860
 in the city for fresh air one 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.140
 small gap to leave open 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.640
 easy to earn with the visor open 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.509
 and that we are up to the stop 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.799
 subject 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.799
 This creates a small gap 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.990
 These are the inside 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.549
 ventilation for the visor 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.200
 together with the pin lok becomes one 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.880
 fogging the visor avoided 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.289
 The air will be on you as you go along 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.670
 guided and one notices the air draft 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.409
 absolutely not in the face 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.090
 At cold temperatures this is very 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.799
 important for cooling when warm 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.210
 temperatures there is a ventilation on 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.470
 upper head and chin area for the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.569
 there are three children's ventilation 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.640
 Settings one for the direct 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.560
 ventilation at the air he is on 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.479
 the pages are directed and closed 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.929
 here you have to say that for all 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.939
 ventilation to really means it 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.740
 drinks no breeze wednesday that applies 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.869
 also for sight it absolutely closes 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.819
 tight and clean off at the back of the head there 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.679
 There are two air outlets around emerging 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.750
 to be able to remove moisture 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.810
 and thus for a better climate too 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.810
 to care 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.760
 in the helm version so in 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.130
 matt black are the logo and the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.079
 typefaces except the flex fund das 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.860
 Nape pad of the helmet reflects that 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.860
 light as well 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.790
 at the back of the head is a 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.379
 all the attention or 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.900
 speed, the control 5 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:53.000
 grad adjusted or adjusted 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.879
 he already improves anyway 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.260
 very good aerodynamics of the sr1 since the 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.750
 helms is very easy and really 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.989
 you do not notice it so well 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.209
 as not delivered under the ride 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.129
 the sr1 with a clear vision pin 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.049
 lures here is the dark tinted like it 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.700
 mounted here, the exchange is ok 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.829
 simply one presses on the time 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.299
 button with the pushes logo and opens 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.370
 that targets it out of the bracket 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.620
 jumps the same one does with the 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.480
 other side to put it back 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.459
 It's easy to do that 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.959
 in the bracket over time one 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.959
 Light pressure and close it 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.530
 in trade, there are different visor to 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.210
 buy among other things also mirrored 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.130
 or with price visor 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.560
 The pilot has to be from the clan so far 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.560
 taken or bought extra 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.640
 the breath is wise only in one 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.980
 Mounted and can easily 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.510
 he should be lost 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.230
 it also goes there separately 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.090
 nachzukaufen 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.709
 you can almost at all times shoves 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.090
 Every part should buy something after 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.090
 be broken or lost 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.860
 the wind deflector in the chin area is in 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.240
 scope of delivery and should it from 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.310
 seal something down 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.500
 It also made for quieter 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.780
 driving sounds he will only in a hat 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.430
 plugged in the assembled state concealed 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.110
 but the fog for the kids ventilation 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.620
 You can not do this under the ride 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.620
 adjust more 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.250
 here on the side it is not about 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.540
 A ventilation because of the very quiet helmet 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.580
 also for use on the race track 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.860
 thought is one can here small 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.420
 openings in the ear area open to 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.080
 run the helmet a bit louder again 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.080
 close 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.040
 The inner lining can be completely 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.550
 take it out by hand to wash it 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.380
 can 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.210
 he is in a touch of the helmet and 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.400
 is secured with snaps that 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.360
 Inner lining is antibacterial 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.040
 skin friendly and isolate well 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.140
 through the form is the ventilation of the 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.430
 Helms are optimized in the high range 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.050
 her petz mounted it in 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.050
 different strengths to buy there 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.980
 Anyone over the push will sr1 all 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.780
 data its aerodynamics and easy 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.270
 want to know my experiences with it 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.590
 should point to horsemen on apocalypse 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.690
 com 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.520
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.700
 if yes, I'm happy about every thumb 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.700
 up 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.080
