00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
today we're going to draw a dump truck

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.660 
today we're going to draw a dump truck
I'm<00:00:03.720> going<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.110> use<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.440> pencil<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:05.130> start<00:00:05.430> with

I'm going to use a pencil to start with

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.080 
I'm going to use a pencil to start with
so<00:00:06.210> I<00:00:06.240> can<00:00:06.540> do<00:00:06.779> some<00:00:07.020> planning<00:00:07.710> about<00:00:08.490> where<00:00:08.849> to

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
so I can do some planning about where to

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.720 
so I can do some planning about where to
put<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.510> center<00:00:09.960> line<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.280> can<00:00:11.550> get

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
put this center line so that I can get

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.570 
put this center line so that I can get
my<00:00:11.940> wheels<00:00:12.540> in<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.620> right<00:00:13.799> place<00:00:14.099> with<00:00:14.370> my

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
my wheels in the right place with my

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.950 
my wheels in the right place with my
trunk<00:00:15.030> notice<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.230> big<00:00:16.830> square<00:00:17.730> front<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.810> the

trunk notice the big square front of the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.929 
trunk notice the big square front of the
dump<00:00:19.170> truck<00:00:19.310> that's<00:00:20.310> where<00:00:20.609> we're<00:00:20.730> going<00:00:20.880> to

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
dump truck that's where we're going to

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.270 
dump truck that's where we're going to
start

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:24.280

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
so to put our wheels in the first wheel

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.270 
so to put our wheels in the first wheel
is<00:00:42.790> going<00:00:43.000> to<00:00:43.059> stay<00:00:43.390> right<00:00:43.870> here<00:00:43.930> in<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:45.040> front

a tiny little circle in the middle then
I<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.450> these<00:01:42.660> shapes<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:44.190> they<00:01:44.340> look

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
I have these shapes and like they look

I have these shapes and like they look
like<00:01:44.670> big<00:01:47.030> V<00:01:48.030> shapes<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:49.320> give<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.650> some

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
like big V shapes to give it some

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.420 
like big V shapes to give it some
texture<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.580> my<00:01:51.170> hubcap<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.830> car<00:01:53.130> that

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
texture in my hubcap is it a car that

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.490 
texture in my hubcap is it a car that
call<00:01:53.640> them<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.910> hubcap

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
call them a hubcap

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.270 
call them a hubcap
so<00:01:56.070> I've<00:01:56.250> got<00:01:56.430> my<00:01:56.460> wheels<00:01:56.880> all<00:01:57.810> set<00:01:58.260> so<00:01:58.980> for<00:01:59.220> the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
so I've got my wheels all set so for the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.720 
so I've got my wheels all set so for the
front<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.640> my<00:01:59.730> dump<00:02:00.000> truck<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.420> need<00:02:00.480> a<00:02:01.200> window

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.730 

then<00:02:05.730> I<00:02:05.910> have<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> line<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.810> goes<00:02:06.960> across<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
then I have a line that goes across the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.170 
then I have a line that goes across the
bottom<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.369> my<00:02:08.430> truck<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.950> I'm<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.000> put

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
bottom of my truck and I'm going to put

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.480 
bottom of my truck and I'm going to put
that<00:02:12.330> top<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.960> it<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.620> know<00:02:13.710> dump<00:02:14.010> trucks<00:02:14.250> have

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
that top on it you know dump trucks have

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.870 
that top on it you know dump trucks have
this<00:02:14.670> little<00:02:14.910> edge<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:16.050> goes<00:02:16.200> over<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.620> top

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
this little edge that goes over the top

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.480 
this little edge that goes over the top
comes<00:02:17.880> down<00:02:18.530> metal<00:02:19.530> edge<00:02:21.830> big<00:02:22.830> difference<00:02:23.310> in

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
comes down metal edge big difference in

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.630 
comes down metal edge big difference in
making<00:02:23.730> our<00:02:23.970> truck<00:02:24.300> strong<00:02:25.100> this<00:02:26.100> line<00:02:26.430> is

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
making our truck strong this line is

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.870 
making our truck strong this line is
keep<00:02:27.000> going<00:02:27.030> here<00:02:27.890> then<00:02:28.890> I'm<00:02:29.370> going<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.700> put

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
keep going here then I'm going to put

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.930 
keep going here then I'm going to put
these<00:02:30.030> lines<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.630> go<00:02:30.959> down<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.280> truck<00:02:32.640> kind

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
these lines that go down the truck kind

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.390 
these lines that go down the truck kind
of<00:02:33.060> gives<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.420> some<00:02:33.600> texture<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.950> see<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.370> a

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
of gives it some texture you see that a

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.309 
of gives it some texture you see that a
lot<00:02:35.730> on<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.180> side<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.780> dump<00:02:37.260> trucks

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.490 

and<00:02:40.890> we're<00:02:41.819> going<00:02:41.939> to<00:02:42.000> take<00:02:42.269> away<00:02:42.629> this<00:02:42.989> bottom

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
and we're going to take away this bottom

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.020
