00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
really what it makes this game stand out

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.700 
really what it makes this game stand out
is<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.790> multiplayer<00:04:05.150> is<00:04:05.660> just<00:04:05.960> awesome<00:04:06.470> and

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 
is the multiplayer is just awesome and

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.250 
is the multiplayer is just awesome and
it's<00:04:07.220> a<00:04:07.340> whole<00:04:07.550> new<00:04:07.730> experience<00:04:08.030> I've<00:04:08.690> this<00:04:09.200> is

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
it's a whole new experience I've this is

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.990 
it's a whole new experience I've this is
actually<00:04:09.800> the<00:04:09.950> only<00:04:10.070> game<00:04:10.460> that<00:04:10.490> I've<00:04:10.790> logged

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
actually the only game that I've logged

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
actually the only game that I've logged
on<00:04:11.710> the<00:04:12.710> most<00:04:12.920> hours<00:04:13.340> in<00:04:13.490> multiplayer<00:04:13.790> so<00:04:14.330> it's

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
on the most hours in multiplayer so it's

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.280 
on the most hours in multiplayer so it's
really<00:04:15.470> different<00:04:15.680> from<00:04:16.130> a<00:04:16.280> shooter<00:04:16.610> a<00:04:17.290> racing

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
really different from a shooter a racing

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.080 
really different from a shooter a racing
game<00:04:18.320> so<00:04:18.830> it's<00:04:19.100> really<00:04:19.310> awesome<00:04:19.580> and<00:04:20.000> I'm

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
game so it's really awesome and I'm

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.300 
game so it's really awesome and I'm
really<00:04:20.330> looking<00:04:20.510> forward<00:04:20.900> to<00:04:21.310> Assassin's
