should<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:58.050> very<00:00:58.199> fast<00:00:58.850> just<00:00:59.850> go<00:01:00.539> through<00:01:00.750> some

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
should be very fast just go through some

should be very fast just go through some
functions<00:01:01.289> with<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.620> get<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> Lorentz<00:01:04.700> elevator

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
functions with it get a Lorentz elevator

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
course with Rollo

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.219 

it's<00:01:15.659> covered<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:16.020> park<00:01:16.380> light<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.750> I<00:01:18.750> used

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
it's covered with park light and I used

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.480 
it's covered with park light and I used
grey<00:01:19.740> Park<00:01:20.369> light<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.880> then<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.509> airbrushed

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
grey Park light and then we airbrushed

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.380 
grey Park light and then we airbrushed
olive<00:01:23.490> over<00:01:24.090> it

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
olive over it

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.649 
olive over it
and<00:01:25.700> airbrushed<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.970> gray<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.750> make<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.049> blend

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
and airbrushed the gray to make it blend

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.399 
and airbrushed the gray to make it blend
and<00:01:30.659> then<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.229> battery<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:32.310> hidden<00:01:33.320> under<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
and then the battery is hidden under the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.550 
and then the battery is hidden under the
canopy<00:01:34.770> there's<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> magnet<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:37.409> it

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
canopy there's a magnet and then it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.850 
canopy there's a magnet and then it
clips<00:01:37.860> into<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> front

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:50.490 

and<00:01:42.790> it<00:01:43.750> stills<00:01:44.170> away<00:01:47.700> right<00:01:48.700> up<00:01:48.850> in<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:50.350> the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
and it stills away right up in in the

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.300 
and it stills away right up in in the
fuselage<00:01:50.920> here

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
fuselage here

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.930 
fuselage here
it's<00:01:52.150> a<00:01:52.180> Geforce<00:01:53.520> receiver<00:01:55.740> there<00:01:56.740> 18a<00:01:57.160> PSC's

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
it's a Geforce receiver there 18a PSC's

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.450 
it's a Geforce receiver there 18a PSC's
and<00:02:00.750> looking<00:02:01.750> forward<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.350> maiden<00:02:03.190> we

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
and looking forward to the maiden we

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.800 
and looking forward to the maiden we
just<00:02:03.670> wanted<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:03.940> get<00:02:04.030> this<00:02:04.180> film<00:02:04.480> of<00:02:04.660> the

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
just wanted to get this film of the

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.250 
just wanted to get this film of the
plane<00:02:05.400> like<00:02:06.400> always<00:02:07.120> just<00:02:07.630> in<00:02:07.750> case<00:02:07.960> something

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
plane like always just in case something

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.950 
plane like always just in case something
bad<00:02:08.590> happens<00:02:09.250> we've<00:02:09.520> got<00:02:09.790> the<00:02:09.940> footage<00:02:10.270> of<00:02:10.510> the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
bad happens we've got the footage of the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.090 
bad happens we've got the footage of the
plane<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:11.640> thanks<00:02:12.640> for<00:02:12.760> watching
