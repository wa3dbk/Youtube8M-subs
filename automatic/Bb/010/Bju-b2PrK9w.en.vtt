00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
inserting PICC lines is putting that

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.370 
inserting PICC lines is putting that
PICC<00:00:10.679> line<00:00:10.950> into<00:00:11.670> your<00:00:11.700> patient<00:00:12.200> but<00:00:13.200> let's

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
here when you're tethering a PICC line

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.719 
here when you're tethering a PICC line
or<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.409> central<00:01:07.950> venous<00:01:08.189> catheter<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:10.369> to<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
or a central venous catheter in to the

vein and down through your superior vena
cava<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:19.560> might<00:01:19.820> extend<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.240> down<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.080> even

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
cava you might extend and down and even

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.320 
cava you might extend and down and even
tickle<00:01:23.750> that<00:01:24.750> right<00:01:25.140> atrium<00:01:25.820> now<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:26.880> know

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
tickle that right atrium now we know

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.890 
tickle that right atrium now we know
that<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.780> right<00:01:28.049> atrium<00:01:28.549> you<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.909> an<00:01:30.270> SA

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
that in the right atrium you have an SA

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.670 
that in the right atrium you have an SA
node<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.970> SA<00:01:32.970> node<00:01:33.240> stands<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:34.110> sinus

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
node and that SA node stands for sinus

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.399 
node and that SA node stands for sinus
atrial<00:01:35.460> note<00:01:36.020> that<00:01:37.020> SA<00:01:37.530> node<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:39.409> main

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
atrial note that SA node is the main

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.039 
atrial note that SA node is the main
battery<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.700> heart<00:01:42.500> so<00:01:43.500> if<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.860> tickle<00:01:44.280> any

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
battery of the heart so if we tickle any

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.249 
battery of the heart so if we tickle any
portion<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.790> atrium<00:01:47.960> we<00:01:48.960> have<00:01:49.229> a

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
portion of that atrium we have a

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.830 
portion of that atrium we have a
possibility<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.130> exciting<00:01:51.030> some<00:01:51.420> cardiac

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
possibility of exciting some cardiac

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.639 
possibility of exciting some cardiac
cells<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:53.280> them<00:01:53.490> firing<00:01:53.820> if<00:01:54.500> we<00:01:55.500> have

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
cells and have them firing if we have

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.190 
cells and have them firing if we have
that<00:01:55.920> we<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.340> electrical<00:01:56.969> site<00:01:57.240> ability<00:01:57.719> all

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
that we have electrical site ability all

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.310 
that we have electrical site ability all

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
inserting it okay another great nursing

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.210 
inserting it okay another great nursing
question<00:02:48.100> you<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.280> nurse<00:02:49.520> you're<00:02:50.120> measuring

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
question you the nurse you're measuring

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.830 
question you the nurse you're measuring
the<00:02:52.220> patient's<00:02:52.790> arm<00:02:53.920> you're<00:02:54.920> measuring<00:02:55.840> how

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
the patient's arm you're measuring how

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.710 
the patient's arm you're measuring how
far<00:02:57.400> it's<00:02:58.400> sticking<00:02:58.940> out<00:02:59.150> of<00:02:59.300> the<00:02:59.360> patient's

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
far it's sticking out of the patient's

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.190 
far it's sticking out of the patient's
arm<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:01.010> usually<00:03:01.490> every<00:03:01.700> morning<00:03:02.330> or<00:03:02.930> every

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
arm so usually every morning or every

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.490 
arm so usually every morning or every
shift<00:03:04.060> we're<00:03:05.060> measuring<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.810> length<00:03:06.200> at

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
shift we're measuring the length at

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.180 
shift we're measuring the length at
which<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.190> PICC<00:03:07.430> line<00:03:07.670> is<00:03:08.600> sticking<00:03:09.170> out<00:03:09.350> of

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
which the PICC line is sticking out of

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.540 
which the PICC line is sticking out of
the<00:03:10.490> patient<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.709> it's<00:03:12.709> cool<00:03:12.920> because<00:03:13.130> little

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
the patient and it's cool because little

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.040 
the patient and it's cool because little
PICC<00:03:13.700> lines<00:03:13.970> they<00:03:14.209> have<00:03:14.240> little<00:03:14.630> measuring

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
PICC lines they have little measuring

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.560 
PICC lines they have little measuring
rods<00:03:15.320> that<00:03:16.160> show<00:03:16.459> you<00:03:16.520> exactly<00:03:16.910> how<00:03:17.090> far

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
rods that show you exactly how far

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.560 
rods that show you exactly how far
sticking<00:03:18.380> out<00:03:18.910> so<00:03:19.910> let's<00:03:20.120> say<00:03:20.330> in<00:03:20.480> the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
sticking out so let's say in the

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.050 
sticking out so let's say in the
beginning<00:03:20.660> of<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:20.990> shift<00:03:21.430> it's<00:03:22.430> seven

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
beginning of the shift it's seven

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.080 
beginning of the shift it's seven
centimeters<00:03:23.780> or<00:03:23.930> whatever<00:03:25.000> during<00:03:26.000> the

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
centimeters or whatever during the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.240 
centimeters or whatever during the
middle<00:03:26.330> of<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.570> shift<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:27.530> patient<00:03:27.950> starts

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
middle of the shift the patient starts

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.940 
middle of the shift the patient starts
complaining<00:03:28.580> of<00:03:28.850> lightheadedness

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
complaining of lightheadedness

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.670 
complaining of lightheadedness
nauseousness<00:03:30.950> shortness<00:03:31.850> of<00:03:32.000> breath<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.680> now

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
nauseousness shortness of breath and now

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.960 
nauseousness shortness of breath and now
it's<00:03:34.520> about<00:03:35.050> three<00:03:36.050> centimeters<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:37.700> PICC

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
it's about three centimeters the PICC

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.330 
it's about three centimeters the PICC
line<00:03:38.180> has<00:03:38.450> gone<00:03:38.630> in<00:03:38.959> a<00:03:39.620> little<00:03:39.860> bit<00:03:39.980> too<00:03:40.190> much

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
line has gone in a little bit too much

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.240 
line has gone in a little bit too much
and<00:03:41.290> now<00:03:42.290> is<00:03:42.470> tickling<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:44.030> heart<00:03:44.350> atrium<00:03:45.350> so

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
and now is tickling the heart atrium so

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.390 
and now is tickling the heart atrium so
what<00:03:46.400> does<00:03:46.520> the<00:03:46.610> nurse<00:03:46.790> do<00:03:48.070> well

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
what does the nurse do well

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.820 
what does the nurse do well
should<00:03:50.300> the<00:03:50.420> nurse<00:03:50.810> pull<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.200> PICC<00:03:51.380> line<00:03:51.560> out

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
should the nurse pull the PICC line out

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:52.690 
should the nurse pull the PICC line out
a<00:03:51.860> little<00:03:52.280> bit

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
a little bit

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.000 
a little bit
should<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.750> nurse<00:03:54.700> call<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.730> rapid<00:03:56.270> response

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
should the nurse call a rapid response

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.250 
should the nurse call a rapid response
should<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.160> nurse<00:03:58.370> assess<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.300> patient<00:03:59.750> or

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
should the nurse assess the patient or

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.520 
should the nurse assess the patient or
should<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.130> nurse<00:04:01.690> call<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:02.870> doctor<00:04:03.320> and

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
should the nurse call the doctor and

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.530 
should the nurse call the doctor and
that's<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.400> kind<00:04:04.790> of<00:04:04.880> question<00:04:05.239> that<00:04:05.270> you're

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
that's a kind of question that you're

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.120 
that's a kind of question that you're
probably<00:04:05.810> going<00:04:06.020> to<00:04:06.110> get<00:04:06.320> on<00:04:06.620> a<00:04:07.720> NCLEX<00:04:08.950> type<00:04:09.950> of

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
probably going to get on a NCLEX type of

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.890 
probably going to get on a NCLEX type of
practice<00:04:10.850> test<00:04:11.150> or<00:04:11.420> even<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:12.680> NCLEX<00:04:12.980> itself

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
practice test or even the NCLEX itself

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.449 
practice test or even the NCLEX itself
but<00:04:14.900> always<00:04:15.260> always<00:04:15.920> always<00:04:17.350> data-action

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
but always always always data-action

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.020 
but always always always data-action
response

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
response

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.540 
response
data-action<00:04:20.959> response<00:04:21.470> basically<00:04:22.280> always

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
data-action response basically always

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.230 
data-action response basically always
get<00:04:23.030> an<00:04:23.180> assessment<00:04:23.540> first<00:04:24.020> of<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.470> patient

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
get an assessment first of the patient

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.040 
get an assessment first of the patient
then<00:04:26.240> have<00:04:26.720> an<00:04:26.840> action<00:04:27.730> call<00:04:28.730> the<00:04:28.940> doctor<00:04:29.360> do

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
then have an action call the doctor do

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.310 
then have an action call the doctor do
not<00:04:30.320> pull<00:04:30.650> out<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:31.460> PICC<00:04:32.000> line<00:04:32.240> because<00:04:33.230> you

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
not pull out the PICC line because you

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.170 
not pull out the PICC line because you
might<00:04:33.500> cause<00:04:33.710> more<00:04:33.950> harm<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.820> patient

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
might cause more harm to the patient

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.420 
might cause more harm to the patient
than<00:04:35.300> good<00:04:35.540> so<00:04:36.440> call<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.830> doctor

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
than good so call the doctor

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.910 
than good so call the doctor
but<00:04:38.330> assess<00:04:38.780> your<00:04:38.990> patient<00:04:39.380> first<00:04:39.560> make<00:04:39.890> sure

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
but assess your patient first make sure

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.560 
but assess your patient first make sure
your<00:04:40.160> patient<00:04:40.550> is<00:04:41.350> stable<00:04:42.350> and<00:04:43.300> don't<00:04:44.300> leave

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
your patient is stable and don't leave

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.220 
your patient is stable and don't leave
the<00:04:44.600> patient<00:04:45.170> themselves<00:04:45.490> so<00:04:46.960> one<00:04:47.960> more<00:04:48.200> thing

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
the patient themselves so one more thing

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.960 
the patient themselves so one more thing
that<00:04:48.500> you<00:04:48.710> have<00:04:48.920> to<00:04:48.950> do<00:04:49.250> with<00:04:49.460> PICC<00:04:49.700> lines

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
that you have to do with PICC lines

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.920 
that you have to do with PICC lines
itself<00:04:50.450> is<00:04:51.550> measure<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.880> patient's<00:04:53.330> arm<00:04:53.419> in

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
itself is measure the patient's arm in

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.230 
itself is measure the patient's arm in
terms<00:04:54.380> of<00:04:54.500> their<00:04:54.620> circumference<00:04:55.240> for

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
terms of their circumference for

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.730 
terms of their circumference for
measuring<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:56.840> circumference<00:04:57.380> of<00:04:57.620> the

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
measuring the circumference of the

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.430 
measuring the circumference of the
patient's<00:04:58.100> arm<00:04:58.900> because<00:04:59.900> as<00:05:00.020> we're<00:05:00.169> measuring

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
patient's arm because as we're measuring

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.560 
patient's arm because as we're measuring
it<00:05:00.830> we<00:05:01.610> want<00:05:01.820> to<00:05:01.850> make<00:05:01.910> sure<00:05:02.030> that<00:05:02.450> the

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
it we want to make sure that the

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.930 
it we want to make sure that the
patient's<00:05:02.990> arm<00:05:03.169> is<00:05:03.410> not<00:05:03.640> inflating<00:05:04.640> which

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
patient's arm is not inflating which

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.330 
patient's arm is not inflating which
would<00:05:05.540> indicate<00:05:05.900> that<00:05:06.140> the<00:05:06.500> patient<00:05:06.919> has<00:05:07.160> an

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
would indicate that the patient has an

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.659 
would indicate that the patient has an
infection<00:05:07.400> in<00:05:08.090> that<00:05:08.270> arm<00:05:08.510> or<00:05:09.550> that<00:05:10.550> the

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
infection in that arm or that the

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.700 
infection in that arm or that the
patient's<00:05:11.060> arm<00:05:11.240> is<00:05:11.450> just<00:05:11.540> getting<00:05:11.930> irritated

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
patient's arm is just getting irritated

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.730 
patient's arm is just getting irritated
from<00:05:13.430> the<00:05:13.550> PICC<00:05:13.730> line<00:05:13.970> itself<00:05:14.419> so<00:05:15.260> usually

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
from the PICC line itself so usually

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.250 
from the PICC line itself so usually
before<00:05:15.950> you<00:05:16.250> start<00:05:16.580> the<00:05:16.760> shift<00:05:17.030> you<00:05:17.990> measure

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
before you start the shift you measure

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.460 
before you start the shift you measure
the<00:05:18.560> arm<00:05:18.770> and<00:05:19.840> somewhere<00:05:20.840> at<00:05:20.990> the<00:05:21.110> end<00:05:21.140> of<00:05:21.410> the

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
the arm and somewhere at the end of the

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.010 
the arm and somewhere at the end of the
shift<00:05:21.710> or<00:05:22.010> during<00:05:22.460> shift<00:05:22.700> change<00:05:22.850> you<00:05:23.840> measure

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
shift or during shift change you measure

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.620 
shift or during shift change you measure
the<00:05:24.229> arm<00:05:24.410> again<00:05:24.770> to<00:05:25.340> see<00:05:25.580> if<00:05:25.700> the<00:05:25.850> patient<00:05:26.030> has

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.100 

has<00:05:29.630> any<00:05:29.930> type<00:05:30.260> of<00:05:30.290> swelling<00:05:30.830> in<00:05:31.130> that<00:05:31.340> arm<00:05:31.610> and

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
has any type of swelling in that arm and

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.060 
has any type of swelling in that arm and
usually<00:05:33.110> it<00:05:33.229> should<00:05:33.380> always<00:05:33.620> be<00:05:33.770> at<00:05:34.040> least

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
usually it should always be at least

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.790 
usually it should always be at least
half<00:05:34.520> a<00:05:34.700> centimeter<00:05:35.330> or<00:05:35.690> maybe<00:05:36.320> even<00:05:36.440> one

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
half a centimeter or maybe even one

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.130 
half a centimeter or maybe even one
centimeter<00:05:37.430> higher<00:05:38.440> but<00:05:39.440> that's<00:05:40.430> the<00:05:40.820> norm

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
centimeter higher but that's the norm

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.370 
centimeter higher but that's the norm
cool

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
cool

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.930 
cool
so<00:05:43.310> let's<00:05:43.550> go<00:05:43.729> into<00:05:45.340> let's<00:05:46.340> see<00:05:46.550> here

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
let's go into TPN and IV fluid therapy

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.070 
let's go into TPN and IV fluid therapy
