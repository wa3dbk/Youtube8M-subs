00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello jesus we are here again for 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.110
 get some doubts about the scream 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.269
 rec llosa or the electric guitar if 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.699
 usually the guys want to start 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.529
 with an electric guitar or the one that 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.820
 want an electric guitar my son 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.369
 has the case my son 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.679
 and many say not first have to 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.509
 start with the criolla and then move on to 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:27.150
 the electric I want to make us that 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.480
 Which question begins with a with 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.699
 other 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.430
 another of the myths one of the myths 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.750
 urban life laws always 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.910
 we come to incursionan 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.980
 pretend that your child is 18 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.520
 years 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.990
 can get the card 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.540
 to drive and I got the right card and 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.060
 he wants to learn on the motorcycle with car 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.090
 are two different worlds the world of 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.370
 motorcycle the world of the car the two of you 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.440
 a place with the two travels towards what 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.650
 want with him with the theme of 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.530
 guitars I mean I have the two low for 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.200
 that people can appreciate them are two 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.360
 completely different worlds the myth 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.390
 that a boy has to start with 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.940
 a Creole and then move to the 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.440
 electric is how my son has been good 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.660
 he wants to play the drums but I'm going to 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.759
 start with a drummer legiiero buy from 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.430
 santiago de estero by froilán gonzález 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.540
 to later go to the battery are 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.180
 two different worlds 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.920
 What I suggest is that if you want 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.660
 learn with electric guitar that 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.610
 learn with electric guitar not because 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.740
 also the other wants to learn to play 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.130
 the sax but some flute does not or 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.880
 they are different worlds and then if 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.440
 is 8 years old 97 what is coming in 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.600
 electric guitars of size for 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.040
 guys also yes 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.110
 the issue for it are the costs always 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.060
 shopping manuals to learn a 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.790
 classical guitar to make them me 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.740
 Argentine we say Creole guitar 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.409
 electric guitar 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.229
 but the techniques to play are 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.090
 completely different the theme of the 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.580
 myths that says no because the guitar of 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.530
 This electric has wire ropes 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.360
 and it's much harder, not the other way around 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.810
 the ropes much softer than in the 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.940
 classical guitar to tighten the 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.620
 strings on the classical guitar is more 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.810
 you have to tighten it better so that it pulls 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.310
 some sound on electric paper supports you 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.900
 this the finger you already touched yes then I 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.700
 I recommend that if your son wants 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.989
 learn to play electric guitar that 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.760
 start directly with a guitar 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.260
 the former who does have much more cost of 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.140
 start because the guitar does not come out anymore 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.080
 face that the classical guitar needs a 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.060
 amplifier to make it sound and good 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.950
 and then when the myth of 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.370
 change some microphones that because it's 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.459
 the musician uses this microphone 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.870
 like everything and then the pedals and all 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.650
 those issues if you can 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.150
 observe in the space between the let's say 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.430
 the ends of the first frame of the 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.349
 sixth string is much smaller the 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.569
 size than in the classical guitar in the 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.310
 where five classical strings come 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.120
 classical guitar entered six strings 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.610
 of the electric guitar 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.560
 the touch is different yes whether I 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.490
 what came up that if your son wants 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.950
 learn to play 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.870
 with Creole or classical guitar that 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.630
 start with classical guitar if you want 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.820
 touch electric starter a little bit 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.880
 stronger on the bus compare for the 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.440
 purchase of the instrument but start 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.940
 directly with instruments is not not 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.940
 they have to turn on the first walk 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.380
 on a motorbike to respond by car or walk 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.370
 by car to ride a motorcycle are two 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.010
 different worlds 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.980
 I do not know if you want to ask me something that is 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.290
 that we are on the subject of cost of one 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.930
 more expensive than the other and how can we 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.790
 start or know what is the guitar of 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.060
 guitar chords 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.620
 chord to say good is a guitar of 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.750
 chords for my son 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.930
 it is not very expensive nor is it very cheap that 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.550
 it will serve you more but as an ideal 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.280
 to go always buy what would be something 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.500
 mid-range true be in prices 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.750
 of this video if I see someone now 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.430
 at the beginning of March they will not do what 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.690
 same price here the best thing if you see it to 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.050
 end of year and a half not 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.170
 but the price issue always looks for something 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.820
 out there is intermediate range as well as in 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.680
 the guitars for it is not a 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.110
 another guitar say that I buy a good 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.760
 cheap now for when you learn it 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.310
 buy a better guitar but you have to 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.220
 think the same I keep working and 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.420
 improving a comfortable car starts the 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.920
 way in auto like that you have to 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.400
 start driving in a car that already 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.750
 be line up to pieces below yes or no 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.330
 it's about that it's a matter of buying the most 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.400
 cheap until you learn to buy something 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.230
 average policy also happens for example 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.210
 with a lot of battery as a 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.710
 battery my son gave but gloves to your 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.070
 son you sat him behind a battery 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.500
 sometime not and good looking for a friend 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.680
 have a battery that you let him play 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.690
 to see if he sees the world because one thing is 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.280
 see or be a drummer playing in a 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.830
 band with all the lights and something else 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.990
 turn back from the battery without knowing 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.330
 you have to play and well we know that 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.210
 Battery learning is much more 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.190
 let's say a lot more not slow but it's 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.529
 much more meticulous in the rhythm themes 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.359
 and those issues that start there 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:12.589
 singing a song with cures could be 

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:17.899
 will remove me with two chords that do not 

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:17.899
 it's a lot big
