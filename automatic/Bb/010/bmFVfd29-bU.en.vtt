 so we'll have to download 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.680
 in the description of this video 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.329
 then you install it and as soon as you 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.070
 are in story mode you just have to 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.019
 press the key f5 watch bean 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.850
 and here we have the little native trainer who 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.520
 open we have several options players 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.480

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.920

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.870
 change everything and I'm going to show you a 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.859
 little so the options available here 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.020
 in player already what we will be able 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.129
 do these exchanges and the skin of our 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.989
 character so that's it really 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.930
 beautiful looking we have several choices 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.070
 michael franklin trevor and we have 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.300
 animals so that's what is really 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.190
 gorgeous look at the coyote that is 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.179
 just here hop there look i did 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.440
 look at the three unemployed in addition to 

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:10.690
 pc are really beautiful 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.190
 so be careful there are also fish 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.810
 available from which you can get 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.640
 turn into fish where I had 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.130
 dolphins or if there or weather 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.130
 dolphin researchers at the dish it's here 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.599
 that's dolphin actually if you if you 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.280
 so choose his characters without 

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:25.599
 to be in the sea but you go all 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.039
 stupidly dying of which one really gaffe 

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:28.270
 to you and look so I try to 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.920
 take other stuff a pigeon here at 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.810
 full to playa people a people an abuse 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.860
 here and there so he tells me that I am 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.970
 dead because I did not have time to 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.649
 sell I do not know what happened 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.759
 at sharks die there I took a 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.080
 shark and saw that I'm not in the water 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.239
 I'm dead clothes so do 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.950
 just be careful with the animals that 

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:45.940
 you choose then here I'm going 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.739
 to return we will see a little the 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.239
 other options that can be here on 

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:51.069
 can teleport it's also it's not 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:53.739
 wrong or then here we can add 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.020
 money go up the levels the level of 

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:59.340
 search without right or title say no 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.009
 never have canvases be invincible 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.149
 ignore the police increased the friendliness 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.129
 next is really a super jump 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.129
 also then at the level of weapons have 

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:10.179
 little to see so explosive bullets 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.319
 rocket vehicles so I'm going to you 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.300
 show it right now in my opinion that 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.230
 must be like his the console we're going 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.640
 try to run and take a vehicle 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.650
 quickly and not even I'll show you that 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.900
 with the word become f4 here you go 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.159
 in vehicle because spawner and you 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.989
 choose a vehicle you want 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.930
 to spawn so that too is really 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.450
 beautiful we will count 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.609
 little vehicle that's a little trick to 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.819
 to dry not enough rare to the dishes 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:33.859
 the ajb 701 bim up to watch her but not 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.030
 beautiful and in addition if you look 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.530
 well in front of it feels like she has 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.849
 stuff at the moment we can not 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.530
 shoot with media anyway feet 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:44.209
 the pilots on it and so against 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.540
 to shoot at the rule and the option aim 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.129
 shoot 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.670
 no I can shoot crazy stuff 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.670
 with the vehicle 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.360
 so how would I say that this 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.360
 car there 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.790

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.810

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.330
 your office are you going to have this little 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.790
 icon the script hook 5 which you make 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.280

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.000
 three folders that are right here 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.410
 so you take them out of this folder there and 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.210
