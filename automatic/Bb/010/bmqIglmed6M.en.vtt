00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
those unheralded type of prospects when

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.319 
those unheralded type of prospects when
it<00:00:41.790> comes<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.629> year's<00:00:42.960> NFL<00:00:43.410> draft<00:00:43.469> and

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
it comes to this year's NFL draft and

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.420 
it comes to this year's NFL draft and
unfortunately<00:00:45.329> he<00:00:46.020> shouldn't<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.680> because<00:00:47.160> I

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
unfortunately he shouldn't be because I

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.760 
unfortunately he shouldn't be because I
think<00:00:47.670> he<00:00:47.820> should<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.300> viewed<00:00:48.690> as<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.960> more

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
think he should be viewed as a more

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.680 
think he should be viewed as a more
legitimate<00:00:50.160> prospect<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.149> given<00:00:51.480> more

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
legitimate prospect and be given more

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.689 
legitimate prospect and be given more
credit<00:00:52.199> for<00:00:52.230> who<00:00:52.590> he<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.800> them<00:00:53.190> what<00:00:53.370> he<00:00:53.460> has

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
credit for who he is them what he has

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.660 
credit for who he is them what he has
been<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.210> far<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.710> guess<00:00:55.920> when<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.219> comes<00:00:56.489> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
been so far and I guess when it comes to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.490 
been so far and I guess when it comes to
the<00:00:56.789> NFL<00:00:57.000> Draft<00:00:57.390> we'll<00:00:57.570> see<00:00:57.719> how<00:00:57.930> much<00:00:58.079> respect

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
the NFL Draft we'll see how much respect

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.979 
the NFL Draft we'll see how much respect
ur<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.770> for<00:00:59.010> his<00:00:59.160> game<00:00:59.399> in<00:01:00.210> terms<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.600> where<00:01:00.809> he

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
ur is for his game in terms of where he

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.709 
ur is for his game in terms of where he
ultimately<00:01:01.140> ends<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:01.829> getting<00:01:01.980> selected<00:01:02.719> but

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
ultimately ends up getting selected but

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.990 
ultimately ends up getting selected but
when<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.870> look<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:04.409> Justin<00:01:05.189> Hardy's<00:01:05.519> game<00:01:05.760> what

great<00:03:18.950> who<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.160> talked<00:03:19.430> about<00:03:19.520> before<00:03:19.790> he<00:03:20.540> lacks

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
great who I talked about before he lacks

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.020 
great who I talked about before he lacks
that<00:03:20.960> great<00:03:21.350> speed<00:03:21.740> of<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:22.040> smaller<00:03:22.340> guy<00:03:22.730> that

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
that great speed of a smaller guy that

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.810 
that great speed of a smaller guy that
you<00:03:23.180> would<00:03:23.330> want<00:03:23.690> he's<00:03:24.380> not<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:25.010> biggest<00:03:25.340> he's

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
you would want he's not the biggest he's

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.000 
you would want he's not the biggest he's
not<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.360> fastest<00:03:26.960> he's<00:03:27.110> not<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.470> quickest<00:03:27.860> or

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
not the fastest he's not the quickest or

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.430 
not the fastest he's not the quickest or
most<00:03:28.190> explosive<00:03:28.940> so<00:03:29.390> there's<00:03:29.660> some<00:03:29.990> question

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
most explosive so there's some question

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.000 
most explosive so there's some question
about<00:03:30.860> how<00:03:31.250> he<00:03:31.310> would<00:03:32.020> equate<00:03:33.020> his<00:03:33.440> abilities

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
about how he would equate his abilities

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.950 
about how he would equate his abilities
to<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.490> NFL<00:03:34.700> level<00:03:34.910> how<00:03:35.300> his<00:03:35.570> game<00:03:35.780> would

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
to the NFL level how his game would

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.570 
to the NFL level how his game would
translate<00:03:36.350> because<00:03:36.560> he<00:03:36.860> won't<00:03:37.130> have<00:03:37.430> the

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
translate because he won't have the

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
consistent plays and when you're talking

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.790

about<00:04:05.480> taking<00:04:05.810> receivers<00:04:06.230> in<00:04:06.320> the<00:04:06.410> first<00:04:06.650> two

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
about taking receivers in the first two

rounds<00:04:07.000> especially<00:04:08.000> in<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.180> really<00:04:08.510> good<00:04:08.720> draft

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
rounds especially in a really good draft

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.020 
rounds especially in a really good draft
class<00:04:09.410> like<00:04:09.770> this<00:04:10.010> one<00:04:10.220> for<00:04:10.430> wide<00:04:10.580> receivers

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
again like last year you know solid is

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.539 
again like last year you know solid is
nice<00:04:14.060> but<00:04:14.810> it's<00:04:14.990> not<00:04:15.130> spectacular<00:04:16.130> and<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.370> lot

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
nice but it's not spectacular and a lot

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.060 
nice but it's not spectacular and a lot
of<00:04:16.580> teams<00:04:16.910> are<00:04:17.060> going<00:04:17.180> to<00:04:17.239> look<00:04:17.480> at

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
of teams are going to look at

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.409 
of teams are going to look at
spectacular<00:04:19.070> traits<00:04:19.370> over<00:04:19.669> solid<00:04:19.940> traits

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
spectacular traits over solid traits

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.390 
spectacular traits over solid traits
whether<00:04:20.630> or<00:04:20.810> not<00:04:20.960> they<00:04:21.169> should<00:04:21.200> you<00:04:22.160> know<00:04:22.220> he

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
whether or not they should you know he

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.270 
whether or not they should you know he
has<00:04:22.550> an<00:04:22.729> average<00:04:22.910> ability<00:04:23.510> to<00:04:23.540> win<00:04:23.840> jump

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
at the NFL level that's something that's

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.450 
at the NFL level that's something that's
important<00:04:26.380> you<00:04:26.410> have<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.740> be<00:04:26.860> able<00:04:26.950> to<00:04:27.100> adjust

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460

something<00:04:30.790> he<00:04:30.970> was<00:04:31.120> okay<00:04:31.480> yeah<00:04:31.690> but<00:04:32.170> it's<00:04:32.290> not

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
something he was okay yeah but it's not

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.409 
something he was okay yeah but it's not

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.270 
necessarily a strength of his game I
also<00:04:34.780> have<00:04:35.020> some<00:04:35.200> concerns<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.860> about<00:04:36.100> not

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
also have some concerns to about not

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.129 
also have some concerns to about not
only<00:04:36.310> his<00:04:36.730> level<00:04:37.090> of<00:04:37.180> competition<00:04:37.750> that<00:04:38.020> he

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
only his level of competition that he

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.770 
only his level of competition that he

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
played in in East Carolina but more so

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.840 
played in in East Carolina but more so
the<00:04:41.320> fact<00:04:41.620> that<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.950> system<00:04:42.370> that<00:04:42.400> he<00:04:42.610> played

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
the fact that the system that he played

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.250 
the fact that the system that he played
it<00:04:43.000> may<00:04:43.180> have<00:04:43.330> created<00:04:43.600> a<00:04:43.870> lot<00:04:44.020> of<00:04:44.169> his

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
it may have created a lot of his

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.870 
it may have created a lot of his
opportunities<00:04:44.950> and<00:04:45.160> may<00:04:45.310> have<00:04:45.400> allowed<00:04:45.669> him

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
opportunities and may have allowed him

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.330 
opportunities and may have allowed him
to<00:04:46.000> get<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.270> type<00:04:46.450> of<00:04:46.480> consistent<00:04:47.340> separation

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
to get the type of consistent separation

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.250 
to get the type of consistent separation
that<00:04:48.430> he<00:04:48.580> got<00:04:48.730> to<00:04:48.940> get<00:04:49.090> as<00:04:49.240> open<00:04:49.540> as<00:04:49.660> he<00:04:49.780> was<00:04:49.990> as

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
that he got to get as open as he was as
