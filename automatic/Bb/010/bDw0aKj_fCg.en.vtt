00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 and well let's change the subject 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.990
 first live show of the voice that was the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.090
 last Sunday but the 8 representatives 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.800
 Team Golden Girl 'us 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.330
 tell how they felt about the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.330
 songs that they had to interpret 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:27.470
 they told me that they were wow how 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.770
 impressed and then they told me that 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.410
 they hope to see me at the bio works and 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.340
 They said I'm like a mini broxton 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.340
 as a father 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.060
 it's over 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.289
 the regimes of the fifth season is 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.780
 a very great person artistically 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.760
 for me always months all occasions 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.430
 when they sent me a song that 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.879
 I wanted the fifth season I felt so 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.879
 happy 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.790
 charm at first when they saw me 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.549
 when they gave me the song it was a 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.140
 little low tone for me and I do not 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.600
 I liked it a lot but then I 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.600
 They totally changed and I love it 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:25.220
 that was the experience that happened for me 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:27.770
 mind and all my audience and like that as 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.330
 that that was just like right now 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.400
 I have that emotion still as if 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.649
 was present there that was a 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.649
 phenomenal experience 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.649
 to learn 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.610
 The moment I saw that they told me I was going 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.700
 to sing with you I learned that I felt 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.520
 I was happy because it's a Mariachi song 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.320
 a Mexican song and then it's the guy 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.219
 of gender I think that kind of gender 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.219
 and I felt very happy 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.369
 the song is something very special something very 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.769
 beautiful 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.180
 and I thank god that they chose me 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.180
 of that song to reach it 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.430
 what barbarians that talented are and I 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.430
 I insist I hope one of the angels wins
