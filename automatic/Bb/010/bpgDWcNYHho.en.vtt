00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
you need to go but also forces you to

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
that opens the multiplayer map design is

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.130 
that opens the multiplayer map design is
fun<00:04:11.379> but<00:04:11.890> too<00:04:12.069> similar<00:04:12.459> to<00:04:12.579> quake<00:04:12.819> 3<00:04:13.150> it<00:04:13.989> would

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
fun but too similar to quake 3 it would

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.630

have<00:04:14.230> been<00:04:14.349> nice<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.560> see<00:04:14.769> more<00:04:14.890> levels<00:04:15.430> like

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
have been nice to see more levels like

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.129 
have been nice to see more levels like
the<00:04:15.819> exterior<00:04:16.150> environments<00:04:16.959> from<00:04:17.049> the
