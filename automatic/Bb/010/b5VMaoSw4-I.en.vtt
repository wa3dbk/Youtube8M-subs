00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
taking too much whole I think when you

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.340 
taking too much whole I think when you
grab<00:00:48.039> him<00:00:48.449> so<00:00:49.449> naturally<00:00:49.899> quick<00:00:50.109> that<00:00:50.260> you

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
grab him so naturally quick that you

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.809 
grab him so naturally quick that you
make<00:00:50.499> him<00:00:50.649> want<00:00:50.829> to<00:00:50.890> get<00:00:51.039> aggressive<00:00:51.249> and<00:00:51.730> then

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:51.819 
make him want to get aggressive and then

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:53.579 
make him want to get aggressive and then
that<00:00:51.969> takes<00:00:52.120> more<00:00:52.390> out<00:00:52.420> of<00:00:52.569> him<00:00:52.809> when<00:00:53.350> you<00:00:53.440> let

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
that takes more out of him when you let

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:55.529 
that takes more out of him when you let
him<00:00:53.710> cruise<00:00:53.949> you'll<00:00:54.579> go<00:00:54.699> faster<00:00:54.940> but<00:00:55.420> he'll

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
him cruise you'll go faster but he'll

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.299 
him cruise you'll go faster but he'll
also<00:00:55.690> relax<00:00:56.079> better<00:00:56.350> so<00:00:56.620> bright<00:00:57.039> it's<00:00:57.280> a
