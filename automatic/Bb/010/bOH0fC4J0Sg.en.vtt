00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:08.189
 folded and will protect even from the load 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.799
 on cut-resistant this fabric 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.810

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.759
 Ten centimeters probably 2 but 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.830
 here is not so counted that she could 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.470
 get into the book 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.610
 let's say for repair instructions 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.970
 let's say yes here on this side are two 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.630

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.159
 made for attaching cans 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.060
 regretted annoyed forever when riding

 Do we have Velcro and there are two down there 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.790
 Velcro at the corners and left and right that 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.440
 for the reliability of the edges like this 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:11.620
 processed so that they do not wrap 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.220
