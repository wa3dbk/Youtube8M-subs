00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hi everyone! How are you ? 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.130
 I came to talk about the white feminist Beto 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.420
 sangay was always published by harper 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.550
 meeting 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.009
 so this is a test book without leaving 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.310
 a genre that I find quite interesting 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.949
 I'll leave up to one downstairs I did do 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.010
 of the time video of indication of books of 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.019
 and started with the theme that also 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.730
 It matters when I saw this book I was 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.670
 I wanted to buy and I got 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.710
 buy then start arrogating 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.960
 sangay is North American she is 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.640
 university professor and moreover 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.920
 has several sections published in 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.390
 magazines newspapers and so on 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.570
 In addition, it has also published a 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.100
 romance and a storybook 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.989
 I'm curious to know the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.850
 fiction because I found it well written 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.739
 delicious in this book 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.420
 this book did not match the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.100
 my expectations and this is not 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.390
 necessarily bad 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.539
 I thought it was going to be a more 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.260
 theory about feminism even at age 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.059
 no book a little lighter 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.180
 not that it does not have much content 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.700
 but she also has a certain humor and 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.530
 the texts are simple 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.840
 in this book is basically going to present 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.840
 For us, let's say a thesis. 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.729
 her idea that is here on the title 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.430
 bd family book 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:29.490
 from her point of view it is not possible 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:32.159
 there is only one kind of feminism that is 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.079
 right and everyone has to be like that 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.650
 this will work for everyone 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:41.189
 on the contrary people are different 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:44.610
 and they can apply the ideas 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.869
 feminists in different ways and each 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.009
 person will do this in a way 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.860
 only 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.290
 even though sometimes I dream a little 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.540
 no feminist let's say like this 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.759
 I think I'll give her an example. 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.850
 even though I think it gets clearer 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.829
 She talks about music on the raps. 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.570
 Americans who are many with a 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.060
 very strong language 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.600
 lived very sexist very macho and 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.250
 and she comments that she has 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.590
 complete the science of it she sees the 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.370
 lyrics is the motto school completely 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.560
 lyrics but she still thinks so 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.770
 these cool songs I think they have 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.430
 a legal rhythm to listen to these 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.250
 music and that does not make it - 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.530
 feminist still does not let people 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.080
 change her like the women of those 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.340
 songs are treated in these women 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.600
 of the two approved persons 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.870
 on the contrary 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.709
 but the fact that she's listening to this song does not 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.730
 does not make her not feminist does 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.050
 of her at best a bad feminist but 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.720
 this does not mean that it is not 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.580
 and it's very interesting because 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.040
 so she's going to say that in the background each 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.890
 person has his way of living the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.600
 feminism something I did not know 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.470
 before reading the book is that in reality 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.540
 not all texts are about feminism 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.570
 only very few texts are 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.640
 about feminism only she speaks 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.989
 much about cultural phenomena and 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.989
 social 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:24.420
 from the feminist point of view but not 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.100
 exclusively feminism in the background is 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.230
 quite interesting she will comment 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.640
 on hunger-type cultural phenomena 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.680
 games and 50 years gray and grouse music 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.670
 but she will also talk about other 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.370
 things then cases of sexual harassment are 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.650
 cases that ended up going to the media will 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.400
 talk about the woman's right to control 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.549
 the port the role of the woman 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.810
 in society, all this from here on 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:57.959
 sometimes she even uses feminists 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.180
 Theoretical same for about 14 years will 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.280
 go 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.940
 but if it is not a book that holds it is 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.860
 this theoretical feminism is interesting 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.940
 as she shows in all these 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.970
 cases and yes 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.910
 and this idea of feminism is not unique 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.790
 not ideal and so on. 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.350
 I think I'm going to read to you guys. 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.480
 final trick 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.480
 which I think sums up very well what 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.890
 She speaks and I 'm not even English. 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.710
 do a translation here on the hour 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.360
 she speaks so weak feminism is seems 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.390
 be the only way I can be me 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.670
 and feminist at the same time is well 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.680
 interesting the book is very tasty 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:45.570
 I read then my already so I recommend 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.410
 and I think I agree with her on 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.540
 many aspects doing however because I 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.790
 I think this is not a good case book 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.960
 that you are looking for is a 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.610
 theoretical 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.210
 I do not think it works for this 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:04.290
 purpose is that it is a more 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.580
 reading delicious dollar then what I think 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.550
 that this would be the only case I did not 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.020
 indicate otherwise if you have seen and already 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.750
 interested I think it's a very 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.490
 legal and implements 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.890
 You might not even agree at all. 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.990
 picking up any branch that is not 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.850
 but I think enough 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.850
 interesting that it makes us think 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.550
 only I agreed with a good deal 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.930
 than she 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.120
 the staff still do not know anything about 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.520
 Some Brazilian publishers want 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.460
 publish this book but if you know 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.169
 Let me know what this is if you want to know. 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.940
 something you have not spoken about is just 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.590
 ask me in the comments 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.910
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.910
 and goodbye full
