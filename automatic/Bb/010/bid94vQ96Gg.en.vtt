00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
right through that into the bowl wall if

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.210 
right through that into the bowl wall if
you<00:00:42.629> will<00:00:42.930> go<00:00:43.079> around<00:00:43.320> enough

spirit<00:02:42.280> mode<00:02:43.860> now<00:02:44.860> like<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.640> mentioned<00:02:46.210> in<00:02:46.270> the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
spirit mode now like I mentioned in the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.970 
spirit mode now like I mentioned in the
other<00:02:46.390> video<00:02:46.630> when<00:02:47.110> in<00:02:47.230> spirit<00:02:47.710> mode<00:02:47.830> you

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
other video when in spirit mode you

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.050 
other video when in spirit mode you
don't<00:02:48.070> transition<00:02:48.700> other<00:02:48.850> areas<00:02:49.330> so<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:51.060> can

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
don't transition other areas so I can

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.380 
don't transition other areas so I can
walk<00:02:52.300> up<00:02:52.510> here<00:02:52.810> into<00:02:53.560> this<00:02:54.280> ghost<00:02:54.730> version<00:02:55.420> of

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
walk up here into this ghost version of

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.870 
walk up here into this ghost version of
this<00:02:58.390> is<00:02:58.480> an<00:02:58.540> invisible<00:02:58.750> floor<00:02:59.320> here<00:02:59.590> oh<00:02:59.880> I

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
this is an invisible floor here oh I

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.920 
this is an invisible floor here oh I
went<00:03:01.600> too<00:03:01.750> far

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930

all right that's it
okay<00:03:09.849> now<00:03:10.390> we're<00:03:11.019> gonna<00:03:11.079> deactivate

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.559 

and<00:03:15.140> here's<00:03:15.379> the<00:03:15.499> best<00:03:15.620> part<00:03:16.069> bye-bye

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.619 

now<00:03:20.170> enough<00:03:20.739> of<00:03:20.829> the<00:03:20.920> spirit<00:03:21.370> mode<00:03:21.519> codes<00:03:21.879> here

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
now enough of the spirit mode codes here

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.349 
now enough of the spirit mode codes here
are<00:03:22.780> some<00:03:22.930> emotes

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
are some emotes

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.229 

there's<00:03:25.810> actually<00:03:26.230> an<00:03:26.439> animation<00:03:27.069> code<00:03:27.579> that

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
there's actually an animation code that

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.440 
there's actually an animation code that
lets<00:03:28.629> you<00:03:28.780> do<00:03:28.930> pretty<00:03:29.109> much<00:03:29.230> emotes<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:31.060> uses

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
lets you do pretty much emotes it uses

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.110 
lets you do pretty much emotes it uses
the<00:03:31.629> L<00:03:31.810> button<00:03:32.079> so<00:03:32.379> we've<00:03:32.530> got<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:33.010> it's<00:03:33.849> best

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
the L button so we've got the it's best

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.270 
the L button so we've got the it's best
to<00:03:34.209> have<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.599> levitation<00:03:35.290> code<00:03:35.620> deactivated

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
to have the levitation code deactivated

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.160 
to have the levitation code deactivated
for<00:03:36.400> this<00:03:37.709> still<00:03:38.709> show-off<00:03:38.950> situps

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:50.450 

and<00:03:43.380> there's

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.650 

push-ups

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.400 

this<00:03:55.660> next<00:03:55.959> demo<00:03:56.319> is<00:03:56.560> pretty<00:03:56.950> amusing

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.110 

you<00:03:59.950> can<00:04:00.100> make<00:04:00.280> link<00:04:01.030> or<00:04:01.270> any<00:04:02.170> other<00:04:03.120> character

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
you can make link or any other character

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.740 
you can make link or any other character
do<00:04:04.360> am<00:04:05.280> sort<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.340> bunnyhop<00:04:06.940> motion

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
do am sort of bunnyhop motion

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.860 
do am sort of bunnyhop motion
you<00:04:08.320> can't<00:04:08.620> move<00:04:08.890> with<00:04:09.160> it<00:04:09.310> unless<00:04:10.150> you<00:04:10.630> use

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
you can't move with it unless you use

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.220 
you can't move with it unless you use
the<00:04:11.140> speed<00:04:11.440> code<00:04:11.740> that<00:04:11.920> I<00:04:11.950> used<00:04:13.590> so<00:04:14.590> you<00:04:15.040> got

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
the speed code that I used so you got

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.039 
the speed code that I used so you got
bunny<00:04:17.230> hopping<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.799> then<00:04:18.160> I'll<00:04:18.310> press<00:04:18.519> a<00:04:19.049> and

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
bunny hopping and then I'll press a and

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.539 
bunny hopping and then I'll press a and
it'll<00:04:20.260> just<00:04:20.410> kind<00:04:20.500> of<00:04:20.590> hop<00:04:20.769> forward<00:04:21.250> you<00:04:21.340> can't

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
it'll just kind of hop forward you can't

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.480 
it'll just kind of hop forward you can't
really<00:04:21.790> control<00:04:22.090> them<00:04:22.300> still<00:04:22.660> though<00:04:22.870> but

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490
