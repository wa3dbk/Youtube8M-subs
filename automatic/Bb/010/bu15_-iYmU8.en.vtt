that you don't burn your hands use a
towel<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:53.700> something<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:55.100> that<00:01:56.100> looks<00:01:56.340> good

towel or something and that looks good
but<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.299> don't<00:01:57.570> like<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.869> serve<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.350> way<00:01:58.500> so

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
but I don't like to serve it that way so

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.510 
but I don't like to serve it that way so
I've<00:01:58.829> placed<00:01:59.100> another<00:01:59.490> plate<00:02:00.479> on<00:02:00.659> top<00:02:01.219> flip<00:02:02.219> it

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520

back<00:02:02.700> over<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.240> voila<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:04.020> looks<00:02:04.200> much

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
back over and voila that looks much
