with<00:00:48.860> weapons<00:00:49.370> at<00:00:49.760> least<00:00:50.059> I<00:00:50.329> would<00:00:50.780> like<00:00:50.809> to

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
with weapons at least I would like to

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.290 
with weapons at least I would like to
see<00:00:51.260> something<00:00:52.129> on<00:00:52.460> lines<00:00:52.670> of<00:00:52.910> a

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
see something on lines of a

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.810 
see something on lines of a
double-barreled<00:00:54.050> shotgun<00:00:54.469> now<00:00:54.860> I<00:00:55.160> say<00:00:55.610> this

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
double-barreled shotgun now I say this

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
because even though a dull barrel

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.040 
because even though a dull barrel
shotgun<00:00:58.399> seems<00:00:58.700> quite<00:00:59.239> obscure<00:00:59.660> and<00:00:59.840> quite

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050

and then the right one which is

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
absolutely incredible now of course if

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.880 
absolutely incredible now of course if
battlefield<00:02:28.760> 4<00:02:28.970> was<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.720> accommodate<00:02:30.470> a

battlefield 4 was to accommodate a

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.040 
battlefield 4 was to accommodate a
double-barrel<00:02:31.520> shotgun<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:32.090> would<00:02:32.510> expect<00:02:32.870> it

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
double-barrel shotgun I would expect it

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.800 
double-barrel shotgun I would expect it
probably<00:02:33.410> won't<00:02:33.620> have<00:02:33.920> this<00:02:34.190> kind<00:02:34.459> of

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
probably won't have this kind of

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.750 
probably won't have this kind of
implementation<00:02:35.810> but<00:02:36.050> it'd<00:02:36.530> be<00:02:36.709> still<00:02:37.010> very

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
implementation but it'd be still very

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.059 
implementation but it'd be still very
very<00:02:38.240> cool<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:39.200> know<00:02:39.319> to<00:02:39.380> kind<00:02:39.709> of<00:02:39.830> think

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
very cool you know to kind of think

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.060 
very cool you know to kind of think
about<00:02:40.340> what<00:02:40.610> might<00:02:41.360> happen<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:42.080> it's<00:02:42.890> quite<00:02:43.040> a

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
about what might happen and it's quite a

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.790 
about what might happen and it's quite a
cool<00:02:43.250> concept<00:02:43.490> nonetheless<00:02:43.970> but<00:02:44.930> on<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.680> way

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
cool concept nonetheless but on the way

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.600 
cool concept nonetheless but on the way
of<00:02:45.920> gadgets<00:02:46.310> now<00:02:46.540> we've<00:02:47.540> all<00:02:47.630> seen<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.610> suav

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
of gadgets now we've all seen the suav

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.810 
of gadgets now we've all seen the suav
the<00:02:49.940> C<00:02:50.120> UAV<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:51.190> something<00:02:52.190> else<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:52.520> can't

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
the C UAV and something else I can't

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.870 
the C UAV and something else I can't
really<00:02:53.270> remember<00:02:53.510> but<00:02:53.989> oh<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.040> mine<00:02:55.430> now

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
really remember but oh the a a mine now

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.270 
really remember but oh the a a mine now
those<00:02:56.330> type<00:02:56.570> of<00:02:56.600> gadgets<00:02:56.989> are<00:02:57.140> really<00:02:57.530> really

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
those type of gadgets are really really

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.970 
those type of gadgets are really really
awesome<00:02:58.310> but<00:02:59.270> I<00:02:59.600> would<00:03:00.080> I<00:03:00.200> see<00:03:00.410> some<00:03:00.650> type<00:03:00.950> of

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
awesome but I would I see some type of

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.850 
awesome but I would I see some type of
gadget<00:03:01.970> that's<00:03:02.360> specific<00:03:03.350> to<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.620> water

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
gadget that's specific to the water

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.430 
gadget that's specific to the water
specifically<00:03:04.840> underwater<00:03:05.840> gadgets<00:03:06.320> now

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
specifically underwater gadgets now

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.050 
specifically underwater gadgets now
there's<00:03:07.100> not<00:03:07.220> really<00:03:07.400> many<00:03:07.580> to<00:03:07.790> choose<00:03:07.850> from

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
there's not really many to choose from

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.530 
there's not really many to choose from
as<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.620> underwater<00:03:10.130> gadgets<00:03:10.610> go<00:03:10.790> because<00:03:11.269> I

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
as the underwater gadgets go because I

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.520 
as the underwater gadgets go because I
mean<00:03:12.230> you<00:03:12.350> could<00:03:12.470> have<00:03:12.620> underwater<00:03:13.239> weapons

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
mean you could have underwater weapons

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.170 
mean you could have underwater weapons
for<00:03:15.530> example<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.010> cortege<00:03:16.340> egos<00:03:16.640> there's<00:03:17.000> one

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
for example and cortege egos there's one

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.479 
for example and cortege egos there's one
campaign<00:03:17.750> mission<00:03:18.110> where<00:03:18.350> you<00:03:18.620> you<00:03:19.250> place<00:03:19.459> a

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
campaign mission where you you place a

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.750 
campaign mission where you you place a
scuba<00:03:19.970> diver<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.900> have<00:03:20.989> this<00:03:21.110> underwater

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
scuba diver and you have this underwater

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.759 
scuba diver and you have this underwater
assault<00:03:22.760> rifle<00:03:23.150> obviously<00:03:23.480> fires<00:03:24.050> at<00:03:24.290> special

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
assault rifle obviously fires at special

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.520 
assault rifle obviously fires at special
rounds<00:03:25.190> which<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.550> really<00:03:26.360> really<00:03:26.810> cool<00:03:26.989> but

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
rounds which is really really cool but

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.430 
rounds which is really really cool but
an<00:03:27.709> assault<00:03:28.370> rifle<00:03:28.540> underwater<00:03:29.540> specific

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
an assault rifle underwater specific

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.080 
an assault rifle underwater specific
assault<00:03:30.739> rifle<00:03:31.100> wouldn't<00:03:31.730> work<00:03:31.880> in

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
assault rifle wouldn't work in

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.970 
assault rifle wouldn't work in
battlefield<00:03:32.720> because<00:03:32.870> once<00:03:33.590> you<00:03:33.709> go<00:03:33.799> in<00:03:33.890> the

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
battlefield because once you go in the

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.880 
battlefield because once you go in the
water<00:03:34.160> you<00:03:34.760> can<00:03:34.790> only<00:03:35.030> use<00:03:35.299> a<00:03:35.540> pistol<00:03:35.900> so<00:03:36.260> for

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
water you can only use a pistol so for

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.860 
water you can only use a pistol so for
example<00:03:37.250> then<00:03:37.400> say<00:03:37.760> an<00:03:38.000> underwater<00:03:38.510> pistol

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
example then say an underwater pistol

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.650 
example then say an underwater pistol
sounds<00:03:39.440> very<00:03:39.530> cool<00:03:39.860> and<00:03:40.180> probably<00:03:41.180> would<00:03:41.360> work

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
sounds very cool and probably would work

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.350 
sounds very cool and probably would work
quite<00:03:42.200> well<00:03:42.470> but<00:03:42.680> fun<00:03:43.220> fact<00:03:43.519> in<00:03:43.700> real<00:03:43.880> life

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
quite well but fun fact in real life

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.360

five or ten feet through the water of
course<00:03:51.829> it<00:03:52.040> depends<00:03:52.280> on<00:03:52.370> what<00:03:52.579> kind<00:03:52.820> of<00:03:52.880> weapon

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.509 
course it depends on what kind of weapon
you're<00:03:53.390> firing<00:03:53.750> for<00:03:54.350> example<00:03:54.709> then<00:03:54.860> let's<00:03:55.340> go

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
you're firing for example then let's go

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.250 
you're firing for example then let's go
all<00:03:55.820> go<00:03:56.060> out<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.269> say<00:03:56.420> a<00:03:56.450> 50<00:03:56.870> Cal<00:03:57.019> now<00:03:57.140> you've

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
all go out and say a 50 Cal now you've

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.530 
all go out and say a 50 Cal now you've

quite pointless because bullet weapons

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.340 
quite pointless because bullet weapons
work<00:04:16.519> just<00:04:17.120> fine<00:04:17.359> in<00:04:17.419> the<00:04:17.600> water<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.229> of

work just fine in the water and of
course<00:04:18.560> what<00:04:19.070> happens<00:04:19.430> when<00:04:19.640> you<00:04:19.820> meet<00:04:20.030> an

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
weapon that fires bullets so you're

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.360

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
gonna be outgunned in the water and

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.830 
gonna be outgunned in the water and
outgunned<00:04:40.370> on<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.729> land<00:04:40.940> so<00:04:41.210> there's<00:04:41.660> no

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
outgunned on the land so there's no

place for really underwater weapons in
battlefield<00:04:44.539> 4<00:04:44.770> however<00:04:45.820> how<00:04:46.820> about<00:04:47.120> a

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
battlefield 4 however how about a

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.469 
battlefield 4 however how about a
breathing<00:04:48.919> apparatus<00:04:49.160> or<00:04:49.610> a<00:04:49.640> breathing<00:04:50.300> mask

breathing apparatus or a breathing mask

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.110 
breathing apparatus or a breathing mask
or<00:04:50.900> just<00:04:51.229> a<00:04:51.289> fishbowl<00:04:51.710> something<00:04:52.160> that<00:04:52.640> divers

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
or just a fishbowl something that divers

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.909 
or just a fishbowl something that divers
really<00:04:53.390> used<00:04:53.570> to<00:04:53.810> go<00:04:54.229> into<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.530> water<00:04:54.710> and

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
really used to go into the water and

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.890 
really used to go into the water and
stay<00:04:55.099> there<00:04:55.340> for<00:04:55.820> a<00:04:55.880> long<00:04:56.000> period<00:04:56.060> of<00:04:56.479> time<00:04:56.659> now

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
stay there for a long period of time now

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.080 
stay there for a long period of time now
I'm<00:04:57.289> not<00:04:57.500> expecting<00:04:58.010> anything<00:04:58.280> on<00:04:58.700> the<00:04:58.909> lines

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
I'm not expecting anything on the lines

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.480 
I'm not expecting anything on the lines
of<00:04:59.300> an<00:04:59.450> hour<00:04:59.659> you<00:05:00.260> can<00:05:00.289> stay<00:05:00.620> underwater<00:05:00.919> for

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
of an hour you can stay underwater for

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.550 
of an hour you can stay underwater for
but<00:05:01.729> something<00:05:02.330> that<00:05:02.539> extends<00:05:03.140> it<00:05:03.260> for<00:05:03.470> about

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
but something that extends it for about

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.730 
but something that extends it for about
10<00:05:04.370> 20<00:05:04.760> seconds<00:05:05.300> would<00:05:05.450> be<00:05:05.740> absolutely

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
10 20 seconds would be absolutely

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.219 
10 20 seconds would be absolutely
incredible<00:05:07.640> so<00:05:07.820> some<00:05:08.479> type<00:05:08.690> of<00:05:08.720> breathing

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
incredible so some type of breathing

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.440 
incredible so some type of breathing
apparatus<00:05:09.320> to<00:05:09.919> make<00:05:10.070> the<00:05:10.550> ability<00:05:10.940> to<00:05:11.300> take

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
apparatus to make the ability to take

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.330 
apparatus to make the ability to take
advantage<00:05:11.570> of<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.140> ability<00:05:12.200> of<00:05:12.500> diving<00:05:12.919> and

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
advantage of the ability of diving and

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.760 
advantage of the ability of diving and
just<00:05:14.000> so<00:05:14.150> you<00:05:14.210> can<00:05:14.419> be<00:05:14.539> a<00:05:14.570> bit<00:05:14.750> bit<00:05:15.110> more<00:05:15.140> sneaky

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
just so you can be a bit bit more sneaky

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.640 
just so you can be a bit bit more sneaky
and<00:05:15.979> you<00:05:16.789> can<00:05:16.940> travel<00:05:17.300> underwater<00:05:17.630> for<00:05:18.440> a<00:05:18.500> bit

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
and you can travel underwater for a bit

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.560 
and you can travel underwater for a bit
longer<00:05:18.890> I<00:05:19.280> think<00:05:19.460> that<00:05:19.700> kind<00:05:19.880> of<00:05:19.940> concept<00:05:20.300> of

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
longer I think that kind of concept of

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.770 
longer I think that kind of concept of
breathing<00:05:21.409> apparatus<00:05:21.500> is<00:05:22.099> really<00:05:22.490> very<00:05:23.240> very

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
breathing apparatus is really very very

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.630 
breathing apparatus is really very very
awesome<00:05:23.960> but<00:05:24.440> of<00:05:24.650> course<00:05:25.099> I'd<00:05:25.280> love<00:05:25.400> to<00:05:25.520> hear

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
awesome but of course I'd love to hear

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.310 
awesome but of course I'd love to hear
