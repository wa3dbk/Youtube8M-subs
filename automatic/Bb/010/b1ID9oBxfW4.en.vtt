probably<00:01:30.960> not<00:01:31.170> going<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.500> tackle<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.040> I

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
probably not going to be a tackle that I

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.609 
probably not going to be a tackle that I
would<00:01:32.430> go<00:01:32.970> out<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.210> my<00:01:33.240> way<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.509> get<00:01:33.780> unless<00:01:34.350> it

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
would go out of my way to get unless it

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.039 
would go out of my way to get unless it
was<00:01:34.860> maybe<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.610> CCM<00:01:36.060> where<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.900> can

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
was maybe like in a CCM where you can

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.600 
was maybe like in a CCM where you can
upgrade<00:01:37.259> some<00:01:37.619> stuff<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.100> him<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.369> make<00:01:38.400> him

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
upgrade some stuff on him and make him

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.670 
upgrade some stuff on him and make him
into<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.790> little<00:01:39.000> bit<00:01:39.119> more<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.390> beast<00:01:39.680> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
into a little bit more of a beast the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.929 
into a little bit more of a beast the
impact<00:01:40.979> block<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.400> footwork<00:01:41.729> though<00:01:41.880> is

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
impact block and the footwork though is

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.179 
impact block and the footwork though is
definitely<00:01:42.420> good<00:01:42.740> ultimately<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:44.040> not

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
definitely good ultimately just not

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.399 
definitely good ultimately just not
strong<00:01:44.460> enough<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.850> my<00:01:44.939> opinion<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
strong enough in my opinion to to be a

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.289 
strong enough in my opinion to to be a
tackle<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.950> don't<00:01:47.100> really<00:01:47.579> care<00:01:47.820> about<00:01:47.970> and

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
tackle you don't really care about and

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.880 
tackle you don't really care about and
that's<00:01:48.630> even<00:01:48.960> assuming<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.439> offensive<00:01:49.770> line

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
that's even assuming the offensive line

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.249 
that's even assuming the offensive line
means<00:01:50.220> anything<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.670> Madden<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.000> year<00:01:51.259> Geno

means anything in Madden this year Geno
Smith<00:01:52.560> one<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> most<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.820> know<00:01:53.939> highly

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
Smith one of the most you know highly

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.880 
Smith one of the most you know highly
anticipated<00:01:55.170> quarterbacks<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.710> draft

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
anticipated quarterbacks in the draft

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.969 
anticipated quarterbacks in the draft
you<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.850> see<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.270> 85<00:01:57.719> speed<00:01:58.110> 84<00:01:58.590> agility

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
you can see it's the 85 speed 84 agility

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.459 
you can see it's the 85 speed 84 agility
those<00:01:59.219> are<00:01:59.369> great<00:01:59.640> ratings<00:02:00.060> he<00:02:00.960> also<00:02:01.110> gets<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
those are great ratings he also gets the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.069 
those are great ratings he also gets the
93<00:02:01.950> throw<00:02:02.189> power<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.759> he<00:02:02.820> has<00:02:03.000> all<00:02:03.299> 80s<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:03.990> the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
93 throw power and he has all 80s in the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.469 
93 throw power and he has all 80s in the
accuracy<00:02:04.590> department<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.579> Geno<00:02:05.969> Smith<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.450> a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
accuracy department so Geno Smith is a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.749

quarterback<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.200> could<00:02:07.350> use<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:08.009> you

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
probably about an accurate as the throw

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.400 
probably about an accurate as the throw
powers<00:02:42.330> low<00:02:42.570> which<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.930> good<00:02:43.140> because<00:02:43.260> they

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
powers low which is good because they

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.740 
powers low which is good because they
criticized<00:02:43.860> his<00:02:44.040> arm<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.550> then<00:02:45.360> he<00:02:45.450> gets<00:02:45.540> you

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
criticized his arm and then he gets you

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.090 
criticized his arm and then he gets you
know<00:02:45.840> good<00:02:46.080> throw<00:02:46.320> short<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.770> medium

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
know good throw short and medium

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.830 
know good throw short and medium
accuracy<00:02:47.610> but<00:02:47.760> his<00:02:47.850> deep<00:02:48.060> accuracy<00:02:48.570> is<00:02:48.630> only<00:02:48.750> a

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
accuracy but his deep accuracy is only a

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.840 
accuracy but his deep accuracy is only a
70<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.770> he<00:02:49.860> definitely<00:02:50.010> could<00:02:50.370> play<00:02:50.550> for<00:02:50.760> me

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
70 and he definitely could play for me

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.900 
70 and he definitely could play for me
in<00:02:50.910> like<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> West<00:02:51.360> Coast<00:02:51.450> types<00:02:51.840> type<00:02:52.530> scheme

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
solid enough in my opinion then we're

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.750 
solid enough in my opinion then we're
gonna<00:03:01.410> look<00:03:01.560> at<00:03:01.650> cordarrelle<00:03:02.100> patterson<00:03:02.580> and

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
running back in the draft he ends up

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.710 
running back in the draft he ends up
with<00:03:23.760> pretty<00:03:23.970> much<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.120> ratings<00:03:24.510> i<00:03:24.600> was

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
with pretty much the ratings i was

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.320 
with pretty much the ratings i was
expecting<00:03:25.020> him<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.700> 87<00:03:26.700> speed<00:03:26.970> 90

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
expecting him to 87 speed 90

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.580 
expecting him to 87 speed 90
acceleration<00:03:27.930> which<00:03:28.050> is<00:03:28.140> going<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.320> help<00:03:28.380> that

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
acceleration which is going to help that

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.170 
acceleration which is going to help that
87<00:03:29.220> speed<00:03:29.460> gets<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.240> 96<00:03:30.990> carry<00:03:31.320> out<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.830> gate<00:03:32.180> 87

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
87 speed gets a 96 carry out the gate 87

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.910 
87 speed gets a 96 carry out the gate 87
truck<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:34.080> I<00:03:34.110> mean<00:03:34.290> he's<00:03:34.440> definitely<00:03:34.890> a

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
truck so I mean he's definitely a

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.460 
truck so I mean he's definitely a
running<00:03:35.190> back<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.640> could<00:03:36.000> work<00:03:36.270> for<00:03:36.330> me<00:03:36.600> if<00:03:37.320> I

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
running back that could work for me if I

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.960 
running back that could work for me if I
was<00:03:37.620> in<00:03:37.740> you<00:03:37.890> know<00:03:37.980> some<00:03:38.160> type<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.340> power<00:03:38.670> run

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
was in you know some type of power run

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.000 
was in you know some type of power run
scheme<00:03:39.330> I'd<00:03:40.050> really<00:03:40.260> like<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.530> see<00:03:40.740> his<00:03:40.830> catch

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
scheme I'd really like to see his catch

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.370 
scheme I'd really like to see his catch
rating<00:03:41.400> but<00:03:41.550> since<00:03:41.790> it's<00:03:41.940> not<00:03:42.090> on<00:03:42.270> there<00:03:42.480> I'm

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
rating but since it's not on there I'm

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.780 
rating but since it's not on there I'm
just<00:03:43.440> gonna<00:03:43.650> assume<00:03:43.830> it's<00:03:44.100> probably<00:03:44.430> low<00:03:44.640> in

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
just gonna assume it's probably low in

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.150 
just gonna assume it's probably low in
the<00:03:44.820> 60s<00:03:45.330> so<00:03:46.170> probably<00:03:46.470> won't<00:03:46.740> work<00:03:46.890> for<00:03:47.070> my

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
the 60s so probably won't work for my

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.000 
the 60s so probably won't work for my
West<00:03:47.370> Coast<00:03:47.460> offense<00:03:47.970> but<00:03:48.650> in<00:03:49.650> any<00:03:49.800> of<00:03:49.950> that

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
West Coast offense but in any of that

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.230 
West Coast offense but in any of that
here<00:03:50.160> we<00:03:50.250> go<00:03:50.340> into<00:03:50.490> the<00:03:50.610> defense<00:03:50.970> because<00:03:51.150> he

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
here we go into the defense because he

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.580 
here we go into the defense because he
was<00:03:51.360> only<00:03:51.450> four<00:03:51.720> defenders<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.140> first<00:03:52.440> ones

him the over 80 speed i was expecting

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
them to even though he did run a slow 40

them to even though he did run a slow 40
time<00:04:04.410> i<00:04:04.650> did<00:04:05.250> get<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.490> 77<00:04:06.060> speed<00:04:06.360> low

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020

which<00:04:10.740> is<00:04:10.860> pretty<00:04:11.040> good<00:04:11.280> but<00:04:11.820> essentially

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
which is pretty good but essentially

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.030 
which is pretty good but essentially
he's<00:04:12.540> basically<00:04:12.930> like<00:04:13.020> a<00:04:13.170> watered<00:04:13.590> down<00:04:13.620> Bart

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
he's basically like a watered down Bart

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.700 
he's basically like a watered down Bart
Scott<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.610> I<00:04:15.150> really<00:04:15.600> don't<00:04:15.960> see<00:04:16.109> him<00:04:16.530> making

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:16.710 
Scott and I really don't see him making

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.240 
Scott and I really don't see him making
a<00:04:17.010> huge<00:04:17.280> impact<00:04:17.460> and<00:04:18.030> unimaginative<00:04:18.950> um<00:04:19.950> you

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
a huge impact and unimaginative um you

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.010 
a huge impact and unimaginative um you
know<00:04:20.370> solid<00:04:20.850> maybe<00:04:21.060> back<00:04:21.299> up<00:04:21.510> or<00:04:21.660> something

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
know solid maybe back up or something

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.630 
know solid maybe back up or something
but<00:04:22.049> definitely<00:04:22.560> not<00:04:22.680> starter<00:04:23.070> material<00:04:23.550> in

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
but definitely not starter material in

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.200 
but definitely not starter material in
my<00:04:23.669> opinion

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
my opinion

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.909 
my opinion
the<00:04:25.020> next<00:04:25.229> person<00:04:25.350> we're<00:04:25.530> going<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.710> look<00:04:25.770> at

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
the next person we're going to look at

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.680 
the next person we're going to look at
his<00:04:26.100> star<00:04:26.370> lotulelei<00:04:29.000> mean<00:04:30.000> he<00:04:30.210> ended<00:04:30.419> up<00:04:30.539> with

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
his star lotulelei mean he ended up with

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.089 
his star lotulelei mean he ended up with
a<00:04:30.750> 96<00:04:31.050> strength<00:04:31.650> what<00:04:31.919> is<00:04:32.009> that<00:04:32.130> 93<00:04:32.430> black<00:04:33.000> shed

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
a 96 strength what is that 93 black shed

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.490 
a 96 strength what is that 93 black shed
85<00:04:35.099> Power<00:04:35.430> Move<00:04:35.759> tackling<00:04:36.479> 91<00:04:37.020> I<00:04:37.259> mean<00:04:37.410> he

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
85 Power Move tackling 91 I mean he

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.320 
85 Power Move tackling 91 I mean he
definitely<00:04:37.650> could<00:04:38.069> get<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.340> plate<00:04:38.550> DT<00:04:38.970> for<00:04:39.210> me

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
definitely could get the plate DT for me

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.240 
definitely could get the plate DT for me
