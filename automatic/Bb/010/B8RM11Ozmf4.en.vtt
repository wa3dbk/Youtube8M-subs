crunch<00:01:50.340> as<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:51.380> never<00:01:52.380> learned<00:01:52.649> clunch<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.460> would

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
crunch as I never learned clunch I would

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.270 
crunch as I never learned clunch I would
like<00:01:54.360> crunch<00:01:54.720> over<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.290> he<00:01:55.799> goes<00:01:56.009> into<00:01:56.189> a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
like crunch over it and he goes into a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.980 
like crunch over it and he goes into a
Garchomp<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.329> guess<00:01:57.509> he<00:01:57.659> was<00:01:57.780> not

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
Garchomp and I guess he was not

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.560 
Garchomp and I guess he was not
expecting<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> Dragon<00:01:59.159> Claw<00:01:59.340> which<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.700> plus

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
expecting the Dragon Claw which is plus

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.810 
expecting the Dragon Claw which is plus
3<00:02:01.079> attack<00:02:01.469> now<00:02:01.799> because<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.549> my

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
3 attack now because of my

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.480 
3 attack now because of my
overconfidence<00:02:03.659> which<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.110> find<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.189> much

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
overconfidence which I find is much

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.249 
overconfidence which I find is much
better<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.820> run<00:02:06.119> than<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.630> people<00:02:06.840> who<00:02:06.990> use

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
better to run than the people who use

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.809 
better to run than the people who use
intimidate<00:02:07.829> which<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.160> actually<00:02:08.340> his<00:02:08.580> dream

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
intimidate which is actually his dream

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.410 
intimidate which is actually his dream
world<00:02:09.030> ability<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.660> can't<00:02:09.989> use

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
world ability so I can't use

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.630 
world ability so I can't use
anyways<00:02:10.690> because<00:02:10.929> i<00:02:11.110> only<00:02:11.260> play<00:02:11.500> with<00:02:11.709> release

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
anyways because i only play with release

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.930 
anyways because i only play with release
dreamworld<00:02:13.090> abilities<00:02:13.560> or<00:02:14.560> shed<00:02:15.190> skin<00:02:15.580> like<00:02:15.849> I

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
dreamworld abilities or shed skin like I

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.210 
dreamworld abilities or shed skin like I
find<00:02:16.390> overconfidence<00:02:17.170> works<00:02:17.410> amazingly

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
find overconfidence works amazingly

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.860 
find overconfidence works amazingly
because<00:02:18.550> look<00:02:18.730> I'm<00:02:18.880> at<00:02:19.000> plus<00:02:19.360> for<00:02:19.630> attack

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
because look I'm at plus for attack

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.870 
because look I'm at plus for attack
right<00:02:20.140> now<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:21.480> it's<00:02:22.480> just<00:02:22.750> going<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:23.400> do<00:02:24.400> make

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
right now and it's just going I do make

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.220 
right now and it's just going I do make
the<00:02:25.000> mistake<00:02:25.360> here<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.780> going<00:02:26.050> for<00:02:26.200> the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
the mistake here of going for the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.479 
the mistake here of going for the
payback<00:02:26.770> on<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:28.060> SP<00:02:28.600> on<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:29.220> it's<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.310> only

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
payback on this SP on and it's the only

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.910 
payback on this SP on and it's the only
reason<00:02:31.090> it's<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.420> mistake<00:02:31.600> is<00:02:32.200> because<00:02:32.709> it's

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
reason it's a mistake is because it's

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.430 
reason it's a mistake is because it's
not<00:02:33.130> actually<00:02:34.030> an<00:02:34.090> Espeon<00:02:34.660> is<00:02:34.840> actually<00:02:35.319> his

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
not actually an Espeon is actually his

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.420 
not actually an Espeon is actually his
or<00:02:35.770> rock<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:38.410> know<00:02:38.500> he<00:02:38.650> is<00:02:38.769> very<00:02:39.069> slick

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
or rock and you know he is very slick

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.740 
or rock and you know he is very slick
because<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:39.970> know<00:02:40.030> I<00:02:40.060> went<00:02:40.180> for<00:02:40.300> a<00:02:40.390> payback<00:02:40.510> on

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
because you know I went for a payback on

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.540 
because you know I went for a payback on
he's<00:02:41.050> able<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.319> get<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.560> hidden<00:02:41.890> power<00:02:42.099> on<00:02:42.340> me

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
he's able to get a hidden power on me

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.420 
he's able to get a hidden power on me
and<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:44.170> don't<00:02:44.380> know<00:02:44.709> what<00:02:44.980> kind<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.250> hidden

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
and I don't know what kind of hidden

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.970 
and I don't know what kind of hidden
power<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.569> don't<00:02:47.019> even<00:02:47.380> normally<00:02:47.680> know

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
power this is I don't even normally know

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.600 
power this is I don't even normally know
what<00:02:48.100> my<00:02:48.220> own<00:02:48.340> hidden<00:02:48.519> powers<00:02:48.910> are<00:02:49.739> but<00:02:50.739> he's

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
what my own hidden powers are but he's

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.259 
what my own hidden powers are but he's
got<00:02:51.819> life<00:02:52.120> orb<00:02:53.459> I'm<00:02:54.459> go<00:02:54.700> ahead<00:02:54.819> and<00:02:54.940> use<00:02:55.030> Brick

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
got life orb I'm go ahead and use Brick

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.000 
got life orb I'm go ahead and use Brick
Break<00:02:55.299> again<00:02:55.840> because<00:02:56.290> this<00:02:56.470> time<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.860> will

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
Break again because this time it will

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.070 
Break again because this time it will
kill<00:02:57.280> him<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.480> think<00:02:58.569> that<00:02:58.780> puts<00:02:58.959> me<00:02:59.049> a

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
kill him and I think that puts me a

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.680 
kill him and I think that puts me a
plus-5<00:03:00.010> attack<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:02.430> actually<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.670> do<00:03:04.390> get<00:03:04.630> a

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
plus-5 attack and actually I do get a

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.949 
plus-5 attack and actually I do get a
crit<00:03:04.989> there<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.380> doesn't<00:03:05.590> matter<00:03:05.950> because<00:03:06.959> you

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
crit there it doesn't matter because you

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.300 
crit there it doesn't matter because you
know<00:03:08.049> with<00:03:08.200> all<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.470> overconfidence<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:09.190> the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
know with all the overconfidence and the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.840 
know with all the overconfidence and the
two<00:03:09.459> dragon<00:03:09.850> dances<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.370> whole<00:03:12.459> reason<00:03:12.640> I

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
two dragon dances and the whole reason I

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.039 
two dragon dances and the whole reason I
won't<00:03:13.000> put<00:03:13.150> speed<00:03:13.420> on<00:03:13.540> this<00:03:13.630> thing<00:03:13.690> is

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
won't put speed on this thing is

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.130 
won't put speed on this thing is
definitely<00:03:14.380> because<00:03:14.950> he<00:03:15.130> slows<00:03:15.579> anything<00:03:16.420> as

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
definitely because he slows anything as

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.080 
definitely because he slows anything as
she'll<00:03:17.350> say<00:03:17.560> because<00:03:18.459> I<00:03:18.549> could<00:03:18.700> actually<00:03:18.850> get

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
she'll say because I could actually get

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.110 
she'll say because I could actually get
out<00:03:19.150> sped<00:03:19.510> after<00:03:19.989> on<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.410> double<00:03:20.620> speed<00:03:21.120> and

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
out sped after on that double speed and

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.780 
out sped after on that double speed and
he<00:03:22.299> goes<00:03:22.480> back<00:03:22.720> into<00:03:23.019> his<00:03:23.470> serene<00:03:24.400> which<00:03:24.640> is

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
he goes back into his serene which is

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.410 
he goes back into his serene which is
his<00:03:24.970> multaq<00:03:26.340> um<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.430> don't<00:03:27.940> know<00:03:28.090> if<00:03:28.180> he<00:03:28.299> was

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
his multaq um I don't know if he was

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.569 
his multaq um I don't know if he was
hoping<00:03:29.380> I<00:03:29.470> guess<00:03:29.620> he<00:03:29.739> was<00:03:29.829> kind<00:03:30.040> of<00:03:30.100> hoping<00:03:30.280> he

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
hoping I guess he was kind of hoping he

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.880 
hoping I guess he was kind of hoping he
would<00:03:30.700> be<00:03:30.790> able<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:31.030> survive<00:03:31.590> just<00:03:32.590> so<00:03:32.709> he<00:03:32.799> can

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
would be able to survive just so he can

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.780 
would be able to survive just so he can
kill<00:03:33.100> me<00:03:33.250> off<00:03:33.959> but<00:03:34.959> he<00:03:35.200> doesn't<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:35.859> actually

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
kill me off but he doesn't and actually

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.220 
kill me off but he doesn't and actually
he<00:03:36.880> just<00:03:36.910> ends<00:03:37.510> up<00:03:37.570> making<00:03:37.720> me<00:03:37.959> stronger

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
he just ends up making me stronger

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.410 
he just ends up making me stronger
because<00:03:38.470> of<00:03:38.650> overconfidence<00:03:39.299> unless<00:03:40.299> i'm

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
because of overconfidence unless i'm

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.840 
because of overconfidence unless i'm
already<00:03:40.570> at<00:03:40.750> six<00:03:41.049> I<00:03:41.489> think<00:03:42.489> this<00:03:42.609> might<00:03:42.820> have

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
already at six I think this might have

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.460 
already at six I think this might have
been<00:03:42.970> my<00:03:43.030> sick<00:03:43.359> though<00:03:43.630> yeah<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.320> thing

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
been my sick though yeah the thing
