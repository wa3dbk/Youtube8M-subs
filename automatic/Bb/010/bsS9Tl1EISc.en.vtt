invisible take a shower move away and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.990 
invisible take a shower move away and
you<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.920> do<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.159> pretty<00:01:05.309> much<00:01:05.489> every<00:01:05.790> time

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
you can do this pretty much every time

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.870 
you can do this pretty much every time
and<00:01:06.439> that's<00:01:07.439> how<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.830> spot<00:01:08.220> works<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.700> we're

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and that's how that spot works and we're

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.210 
and that's how that spot works and we're
going<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.060> show<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.299> one<00:01:09.600> more<00:01:09.630> spot<00:01:10.140> if<00:01:10.409> you

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
going to show you one more spot if you

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.710 
going to show you one more spot if you
don't<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.610> any<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.909> these<00:01:12.060> spots<00:01:12.299> just

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
don't like any of these spots just

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.440 
don't like any of these spots just
because<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.890> know<00:01:14.010> they're<00:01:14.340> pretty<00:01:15.000> bit<00:01:15.240> and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
because you know they're pretty bit and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.499 
because you know they're pretty bit and
on<00:01:16.140> both<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.770> these<00:01:17.040> sides<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:18.119> left<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
on both of these sides the left and

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.999 
on both of these sides the left and
right<00:01:18.570> side<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.080> middle<00:01:19.650> there's<00:01:19.860> these

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
right side in the middle there's these

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.859 
right side in the middle there's these
two<00:01:20.070> little<00:01:20.460> rafters<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.119> it's<00:01:21.509> kind<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
two little rafters and it's kind of a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.469 
two little rafters and it's kind of a
good<00:01:22.020> spot<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.640> textures<00:01:23.970> are<00:01:24.180> kind<00:01:24.420> of

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
good spot so the textures are kind of

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.300 
good spot so the textures are kind of
confusing<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.439> they're<00:01:25.650> transparent<00:01:26.100> when

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
confusing so they're transparent when

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.350 
confusing so they're transparent when
you're<00:01:26.430> behind<00:01:26.580> them<00:01:26.880> but<00:01:27.030> when<00:01:27.210> you're<00:01:27.330> in

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
you're behind them but when you're in

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.149 
you're behind them but when you're in
front<00:01:27.540> there<00:01:27.780> obviously<00:01:27.900> solved<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
front there obviously solved so it's the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.010 
front there obviously solved so it's the
same<00:01:29.220> thing<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.729> side<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.720> gives<00:01:30.930> you

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
same thing on that side it gives you

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.050 
same thing on that side it gives you
kind<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.920> fakes<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.280> out<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.970> just

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
kind of like fakes you out and you just

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.280 
kind of like fakes you out and you just
have<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.270> make<00:01:33.360> sure<00:01:33.420> you're<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> open<00:01:34.110> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
have to make sure you're on the open and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.230
