00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
filmed this video it was just I needed a

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:55.619 
filmed this video it was just I needed a
bit<00:00:54.309> more<00:00:54.339> light<00:00:54.820> because<00:00:55.239> it<00:00:55.330> was<00:00:55.420> quite<00:00:55.600> a

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
bit more light because it was quite a

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.630 
bit more light because it was quite a
dull<00:00:55.900> day<00:00:56.170> and<00:00:56.439> I'm<00:00:56.530> also<00:00:56.860> under<00:00:57.339> a<00:00:57.369> ceiling

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640

dull day and I'm also under a ceiling
which<00:00:57.909> is<00:00:58.000> slanted<00:00:58.479> which<00:00:58.629> means<00:00:58.960> there<00:00:59.110> isn't

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
which is slanted which means there isn't

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.000 
which is slanted which means there isn't
as<00:00:59.409> good<00:00:59.559> light

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
am using a label and I'm using a round

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.030 
am using a label and I'm using a round
one<00:02:33.209> I'll<00:02:33.480> then<00:02:34.110> make<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.590> nice<00:02:34.739> bright

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.880 
one I'll then make it a nice bright
color<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:36.060> is<00:02:36.209> very<00:02:36.330> evident<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.770> I

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
color so that it is very evident and I

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.560 
color so that it is very evident and I
will<00:02:38.010> fade<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.430> slightly<00:02:38.670> just<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.209> can<00:02:39.330> add

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
will fade it slightly just so I can add

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.100 
will fade it slightly just so I can add
text<00:02:39.840> on<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.470> then<00:02:41.010> add<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> text<00:02:41.790> on<00:02:41.940> I'll<00:02:42.840> write

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
text on I then add a text on I'll write

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.020 
text on I then add a text on I'll write
whatever<00:02:43.350> this<00:02:43.800> is<00:02:43.920> how<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.130> make<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.459> pastry

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
whatever this is how to make a pastry

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.479 
whatever this is how to make a pastry
and<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.870> will<00:02:46.020> change<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.380> font<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.310> main

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
and I will change the font and the main

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.400 
and I will change the font and the main
thing<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:48.060> will<00:02:48.209> usually<00:02:48.360> put<00:02:48.690> in<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.930> bolder

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
thing I will usually put in a bolder

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.320 
thing I will usually put in a bolder
font<00:02:49.680> just<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.130> stands<00:02:50.459> out<00:02:50.610> again<00:02:51.030> and

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
font just so it stands out again and

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330 
font just so it stands out again and
this<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.690> what<00:02:51.870> I've<00:02:52.050> done<00:02:52.290> for<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.620> so

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
this is what I've done for this so

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.920 
this is what I've done for this so
that's<00:02:53.520> just<00:02:53.670> what<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:53.880> do<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.209> save<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.900> my

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
that's just what I do I save it to my

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.960 
that's just what I do I save it to my
desktop<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:56.010> that's<00:02:56.130> why<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.340> make<00:02:56.520> my<00:02:56.760> phone

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
desktop and that's why I make my phone

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.750 
desktop and that's why I make my phone
now<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.450> go<00:02:58.410> over<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.830> video<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.250> click

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
now I go over to a video and click

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.080 
now I go over to a video and click
custom<00:03:00.660> thumbnail<00:03:01.110> mouths<00:03:01.440> put<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:01.920> on<00:03:02.130> that

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
was just the one I did in the past but

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.770 
was just the one I did in the past but
this<00:03:05.160> is<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.459> one<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:05.700> just<00:03:05.910> did<00:03:06.090> now<00:03:06.300> and

that is just uploading but obviously I'm

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.340 
that is just uploading but obviously I'm
going<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:08.970> cancel<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.390> because<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:10.019> wasn't

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
going to cancel that because that wasn't

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.680 
going to cancel that because that wasn't

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
for that video I'll show you how to

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.170 
for that video I'll show you how to
schedule<00:03:12.959> upload<00:03:13.590> as<00:03:13.950> well<00:03:14.370> seeing<00:03:14.910> as<00:03:15.060> I

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
schedule upload as well seeing as I

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.300 
schedule upload as well seeing as I
often<00:03:15.660> get<00:03:15.780> asked<00:03:15.960> this<00:03:16.140> question<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:17.160> just

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
often get asked this question you just

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.040 
often get asked this question you just
go<00:03:17.460> to<00:03:17.520> upload<00:03:17.880> and

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
go to upload and

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.930 
go to upload and
then<00:03:19.260> there<00:03:19.650> should<00:03:19.890> be<00:03:20.070> a<00:03:20.100> little<00:03:20.370> arrow<00:03:20.580> and

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
then there should be a little arrow and

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.210 
then there should be a little arrow and
it<00:03:21.180> says<00:03:21.390> scheduled<00:03:21.990> and<00:03:22.260> then<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.710> click<00:03:23.010> on

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
it says scheduled and then you click on

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.130 
it says scheduled and then you click on
whatever<00:03:23.700> your<00:03:24.000> video<00:03:24.240> you're<00:03:24.390> uploading<00:03:24.600> and

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
whatever your video you're uploading and

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.290 
whatever your video you're uploading and
then<00:03:25.590> there's<00:03:25.800> calendars<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.640> times<00:03:26.940> which

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
then there's calendars and times which

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.910 
then there's calendars and times which
you<00:03:27.570> can<00:03:27.780> choose<00:03:27.990> so<00:03:28.260> that's<00:03:28.440> just<00:03:28.650> how<00:03:28.860> you

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
you can choose so that's just how you

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.490 
you can choose so that's just how you
schedule<00:03:29.400> upload<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.210> often<00:03:30.480> do<00:03:30.960> this

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
schedule upload and I often do this
