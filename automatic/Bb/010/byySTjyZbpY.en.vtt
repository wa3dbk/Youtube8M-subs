00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
for the most part I think the driving is

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.860 
for the most part I think the driving is
pretty<00:03:38.850> good<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.090> like<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.600> car

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
customization and stuff like that I feel

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.860 
customization and stuff like that I feel
like<00:03:41.820> they<00:03:42.060> really<00:03:42.270> hit<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.600> nail<00:03:42.630> on<00:03:42.840> the

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
like they really hit the nail on the

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.750 
like they really hit the nail on the
head<00:03:42.990> there<00:03:43.050> but<00:03:43.709> they<00:03:43.830> should<00:03:44.070> it<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:44.550> called

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
head there but they should it is called

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.270 
head there but they should it is called
Grand<00:03:45.030> Theft<00:03:45.180> Auto<00:03:45.800> so<00:03:46.800> they<00:03:46.890> better<00:03:47.040> get<00:03:47.160> the

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
Grand Theft Auto so they better get the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.570 
Grand Theft Auto so they better get the
auto<00:03:47.490> part<00:03:47.940> right<00:03:48.980> there's<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.040> good<00:03:50.220> sense<00:03:50.459> of

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
auto part right there's a good sense of

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.400 
auto part right there's a good sense of
humor<00:03:50.880> but<00:03:51.030> when<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.270> get<00:03:51.420> any<00:03:51.570> anywhere<00:03:52.080> past

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
humor but when you get any anywhere past

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.060 
humor but when you get any anywhere past
that<00:03:53.480> like<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.630> individual<00:03:55.230> parts<00:03:55.590> of<00:03:55.709> GTA

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070

the<00:04:16.920> reason<00:04:17.220> I'm<00:04:17.370> criticizing<00:04:18.270> the<00:04:18.390> game<00:04:18.540> is

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
the reason I'm criticizing the game is

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.130 
the reason I'm criticizing the game is
because<00:04:19.830> we<00:04:20.820> tried<00:04:21.419> the<00:04:21.930> last<00:04:22.200> heist<00:04:23.030> like<00:04:24.140> 30

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
because we tried the last heist like 30

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.550 
because we tried the last heist like 30
40<00:04:25.710> 30<00:04:26.100> or<00:04:26.250> 40<00:04:26.580> times<00:04:26.610> we<00:04:27.090> just<00:04:27.120> died<00:04:27.450> 30<00:04:27.780> 40

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:55.730 
in the game just because of our

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.520 
in the game just because of our
struggles<00:06:56.300> not<00:06:56.600> only<00:06:56.870> on<00:06:56.990> that<00:06:57.140> last<00:06:57.290> mission

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810 
but throughout everything it was a good

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.150 
but throughout everything it was a good
idea<00:06:59.840> it<00:07:00.830> was<00:07:00.979> a<00:07:01.010> way<00:07:01.280> to<00:07:01.340> bind<00:07:01.700> us

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160

it<00:07:02.760> was<00:07:02.940> I<00:07:03.830> think<00:07:04.830> was<00:07:04.920> a<00:07:04.950> solid<00:07:05.370> choice<00:07:05.520> anyway

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 
there's now apparently a freaking roller

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.460

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840 
the track they're always I don't think

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.510 
the track they're always I don't think

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 
so I think this is on I think baby park

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.210 
so I think this is on I think baby park
was<00:07:56.550> actually<00:07:57.030> kind<00:07:57.300> of<00:07:57.420> I<00:07:57.660> don't<00:07:58.560> say<00:07:58.800> boring

00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220 
was actually kind of I don't say boring

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.040 
was actually kind of I don't say boring
but<00:07:59.490> like<00:07:59.700> pretty<00:08:00.480> standard<00:08:00.960> pretty

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.050 
but like pretty standard pretty

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.710 
but like pretty standard pretty
straightforward
