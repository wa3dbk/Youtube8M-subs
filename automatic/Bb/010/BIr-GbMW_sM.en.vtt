00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
has to use data the other previous

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.340 
has to use data the other previous
versions<00:03:35.480> use<00:03:35.600> like<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.750> little<00:03:36.020> magnetic

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
versions use like a little magnetic

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.870 
versions use like a little magnetic
charge<00:03:36.710> that<00:03:36.860> usually<00:03:37.130> broke<00:03:37.340> on<00:03:37.490> me<00:03:37.610> so<00:03:37.790> I'm

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
charge that usually broke on me so I'm

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.960 
charge that usually broke on me so I'm
glad<00:03:38.060> they<00:03:38.210> went<00:03:38.300> to<00:03:38.450> this<00:03:38.570> one<00:03:38.780> and<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:40.790> little

glad they went to this one and a little

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.150 
glad they went to this one and a little
wall<00:03:41.120> charger<00:03:41.480> like<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:41.870> thing<00:03:42.710> pops<00:03:42.950> up<00:03:43.130> like

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
wall charger like so thing pops up like

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.290 
wall charger like so thing pops up like
that<00:03:44.860> okay<00:03:45.860> all<00:03:46.370> right<00:03:46.520> so<00:03:46.640> let's<00:03:46.730> get<00:03:46.880> to<00:03:46.940> the

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
that okay all right so let's get to the

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.420 
that okay all right so let's get to the
jaw<00:03:47.570> bone<00:03:47.600> itself<00:03:48.200> so<00:03:48.500> this<00:03:48.650> is<00:03:48.860> you<00:03:49.160> can<00:03:49.280> see

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
jaw bone itself so this is you can see

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.950 
jaw bone itself so this is you can see
very<00:03:49.880> very<00:03:50.240> small<00:03:50.740> and<00:03:52.330> what<00:03:53.330> this<00:03:53.450> is<00:03:53.720> as

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
very very small and what this is as

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.540 
very very small and what this is as
reasons<00:03:54.470> called<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.740> job<00:03:54.950> on<00:03:55.160> this<00:03:55.280> little

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
reasons called a job on this little

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.070 
reasons called a job on this little
piece<00:03:55.700> right<00:03:55.730> here<00:03:55.910> actually<00:03:56.180> sits<00:03:56.720> on<00:03:56.930> your

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
piece right here actually sits on your

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.350 
piece right here actually sits on your
jawbone<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:57.860> since<00:03:58.550> it's<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.760> vibration

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
jawbone and since it's the vibration

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.420 
jawbone and since it's the vibration
that<00:03:59.480> definitely<00:03:59.990> helps<00:04:00.320> so<00:04:01.190> it<00:04:01.280> does<00:04:01.400> not

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
that definitely helps so it does not

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.930 
that definitely helps so it does not
transmit<00:04:02.030> any<00:04:02.360> any<00:04:03.110> volume<00:04:03.560> or<00:04:03.860> any<00:04:04.010> noise<00:04:04.610> or

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
transmit any any volume or any noise or

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.540 
transmit any any volume or any noise or
voice<00:04:05.180> on<00:04:05.420> your<00:04:05.630> end<00:04:05.930> if<00:04:06.680> you're<00:04:06.920> not<00:04:07.040> talking

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
voice on your end if you're not talking

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
voice on your end if you're not talking
so<00:04:07.700> it<00:04:07.790> waits<00:04:07.970> for<00:04:08.120> this<00:04:08.240> filled<00:04:08.420> that

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
so it waits for this filled that

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.240 
so it waits for this filled that
vibration<00:04:09.110> your<00:04:09.290> jawbone<00:04:09.470> that<00:04:09.680> keeps<00:04:10.100> the

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
vibration your jawbone that keeps the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.950 
vibration your jawbone that keeps the
noise<00:04:10.460> reduction<00:04:10.760> down<00:04:11.120> there's<00:04:11.630> not<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:11.810> lot

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
noise reduction down there's not a lot

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.080 
noise reduction down there's not a lot
of<00:04:11.990> background<00:04:12.260> noise<00:04:12.620> as<00:04:12.860> well<00:04:13.160> and<00:04:13.880> it<00:04:13.910> looks

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
of background noise as well and it looks

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.930 
of background noise as well and it looks
like<00:04:14.120> his<00:04:14.650> I<00:04:15.650> think<00:04:15.920> this<00:04:16.250> one<00:04:16.430> includes<00:04:16.790> an

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
like his I think this one includes an

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.150 
like his I think this one includes an
on-off<00:04:17.420> switch<00:04:17.989> which<00:04:18.500> is<00:04:18.680> definitely<00:04:18.830> a<00:04:19.070> lot

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
on-off switch which is definitely a lot

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.250 
on-off switch which is definitely a lot
easier<00:04:19.370> than<00:04:19.760> the<00:04:20.420> previous<00:04:20.810> version<00:04:20.959> so<00:04:21.230> you

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
easier than the previous version so you

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.800 
easier than the previous version so you
have<00:04:21.380> to<00:04:21.440> hold<00:04:21.620> down<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:21.890> button<00:04:22.630> and<00:04:23.630> there's

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
have to hold down the button and there's

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.330 
have to hold down the button and there's
the<00:04:24.200> speaker<00:04:24.530> in<00:04:24.590> there<00:04:24.740> to<00:04:24.830> speak<00:04:25.010> I<00:04:25.100> said<00:04:25.280> the

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
the speaker in there to speak I said the

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
the speaker in there to speak I said the
speaker<00:04:25.580> should<00:04:25.760> be<00:04:25.880> a<00:04:25.910> little<00:04:26.090> bit<00:04:26.240> better

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
speaker should be a little bit better

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.360 
speaker should be a little bit better
this<00:04:26.630> time<00:04:26.690> as<00:04:27.050> far<00:04:27.230> as<00:04:27.350> a<00:04:27.560> little<00:04:28.100> bit<00:04:28.190> louder

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
this time as far as a little bit louder

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.800 
this time as far as a little bit louder
for<00:04:28.700> the<00:04:28.760> audio<00:04:29.060> quality<00:04:29.120> that's<00:04:29.630> where<00:04:29.750> you

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
for the audio quality that's where you

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.540 
for the audio quality that's where you
plug<00:04:29.990> it<00:04:30.140> in<00:04:30.230> to<00:04:30.320> charge<00:04:30.380> it<00:04:30.710> up<00:04:30.800> at<00:04:31.010> and<00:04:31.310> looks

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
plug it in to charge it up at and looks

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.190 
plug it in to charge it up at and looks
like<00:04:31.670> this<00:04:31.850> for<00:04:32.030> this<00:04:32.120> little<00:04:32.300> LED<00:04:32.780> light<00:04:32.990> this

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
like this for this little LED light this

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.600 
like this for this little LED light this
well<00:04:33.470> so<00:04:34.040> I'm<00:04:34.100> gonna<00:04:34.190> do<00:04:34.280> a<00:04:34.340> little<00:04:34.490> comparison

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
well so I'm gonna do a little comparison

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.930 
well so I'm gonna do a little comparison
here<00:04:35.210> to<00:04:35.420> the<00:04:36.370> previous<00:04:37.370> version<00:04:37.490> this<00:04:37.730> is<00:04:37.820> the

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
here to the previous version this is the

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.850 
here to the previous version this is the
jawbone<00:04:38.390> prime<00:04:38.420> the<00:04:38.960> last<00:04:39.140> version<00:04:39.410> a<00:04:39.620> job

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
jawbone prime the last version a job

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:47.140 
jawbone prime the last version a job
only<00:04:40.040> came<00:04:40.340> out<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:41.110> so<00:04:42.110> you<00:04:42.200> see<00:04:42.260> that<00:04:46.150> side

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
only came out and so you see that side

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.990 
only came out and so you see that side
by<00:04:47.420> side<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:48.020> jawbone<00:04:48.440> prime<00:04:48.500> is<00:04:49.070> definitely

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
by side the jawbone prime is definitely

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.420 
by side the jawbone prime is definitely
a<00:04:50.030> little<00:04:50.060> bit<00:04:50.300> longer<00:04:50.680> then<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.830> new<00:04:51.950> job<00:04:52.220> on

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
a little bit longer then the new job on

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.120 
a little bit longer then the new job on
icon<00:04:53.800> like<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:55.100> is<00:04:55.430> hold<00:04:56.210> it<00:04:56.300> down<00:04:56.420> here<00:04:57.130> okay

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
icon like so is hold it down here okay

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.530 
icon like so is hold it down here okay
definitely<00:04:58.430> you<00:04:58.790> can<00:04:58.910> really<00:04:59.060> see<00:04:59.240> the<00:04:59.330> size

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
definitely you can really see the size

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.930 
definitely you can really see the size
comparison<00:05:00.140> there

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.730 

okay<00:05:06.940> but<00:05:07.510> this<00:05:07.810> one<00:05:07.870> is<00:05:08.080> still<00:05:08.230> good<00:05:08.290> device

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
okay but this one is still good device

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.870

special someone there but the net here

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.980 
special someone there but the net here
is<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.520> jawbone<00:05:13.030> prime<00:05:13.150> right<00:05:13.570> here<00:05:13.750> so<00:05:13.900> i'm

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
is the jawbone prime right here so i'm

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.210 
is the jawbone prime right here so i'm
going<00:05:14.170> to<00:05:14.230> test<00:05:14.470> this<00:05:14.560> thing<00:05:14.740> out<00:05:14.920> for<00:05:14.980> a

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
going to test this thing out for a

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.830 
going to test this thing out for a

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
and I do look on comparison here with

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.220 
and I do look on comparison here with
the<00:05:18.880> jawbone<00:05:19.270> prime<00:05:19.300> talking<00:05:19.900> on<00:05:19.990> the<00:05:20.050> phone
