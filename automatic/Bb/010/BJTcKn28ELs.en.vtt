00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
mmm-hmm I used to do it the old way with

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.670 
mmm-hmm I used to do it the old way with
a<00:00:16.070> brush<00:00:16.340> and<00:00:16.550> a<00:00:16.670> bottle<00:00:17.289> then<00:00:18.289> I<00:00:18.380> went<00:00:18.500> to<00:00:18.560> an

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
a brush and a bottle then I went to an

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.880 
a brush and a bottle then I went to an
airbrush<00:00:19.509> and<00:00:20.509> then<00:00:20.720> this<00:00:21.140> weekend<00:00:21.560> at<00:00:21.800> the

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
airbrush and then this weekend at the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.540 
airbrush and then this weekend at the
hobby<00:00:22.220> shop

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
hobby shop

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.510 
hobby shop
I<00:00:22.880> found<00:00:23.829> these<00:00:25.869> flow<00:00:26.869> quill<00:00:27.279> enamel<00:00:28.279> paint

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
I found these flow quill enamel paint

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.400 
I found these flow quill enamel paint
markers<00:00:28.969> which<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:30.020> guys<00:00:30.169> at<00:00:30.320> the<00:00:30.349> shop

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
markers which the guys at the shop

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.250 
markers which the guys at the shop
suggested<00:00:31.129> to<00:00:31.250> me<00:00:31.399> I<00:00:31.960> think<00:00:32.960> they<00:00:33.110> work

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
suggested to me I think they work

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.040 
suggested to me I think they work
awesome<00:00:33.829> they're<00:00:34.610> a<00:00:34.640> lot<00:00:34.879> easier<00:00:35.360> to<00:00:35.539> use<00:00:35.750> in

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
awesome they're a lot easier to use in

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.090 
awesome they're a lot easier to use in
the<00:00:36.140> brush<00:00:36.379> and<00:00:36.649> the<00:00:37.640> airbrush<00:00:38.739> like<00:00:39.739> I<00:00:39.860> do<00:00:39.920> is

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
the brush and the airbrush like I do is

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.830 
the brush and the airbrush like I do is
give<00:00:40.250> it<00:00:40.280> a<00:00:40.370> few<00:00:41.329> shakes<00:00:42.039> and<00:00:44.290> then<00:00:46.570> come<00:00:47.570> over

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
give it a few shakes and then come over

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.950 
give it a few shakes and then come over
to<00:00:47.989> your<00:00:48.220> track

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
to your track

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.220 
to your track
this<00:00:50.960> is<00:00:51.170> rail<00:00:51.410> Brown<00:00:51.739> so<00:00:52.520> I'm<00:00:52.640> just<00:00:52.790> gonna

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
this is rail Brown so I'm just gonna

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:01.150 
this is rail Brown so I'm just gonna
call<00:00:54.230> her<00:00:54.380> in<00:00:55.630> the<00:00:56.630> ties<00:00:59.800> it's<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:00.950> little

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
call her in the ties it's a little

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.749 
call her in the ties it's a little
easier<00:01:01.579> to<00:01:01.700> do<00:01:01.850> it<00:01:02.000> before<00:01:02.780> you<00:01:03.230> bust<00:01:03.829> but

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
easier to do it before you bust but

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.190 
easier to do it before you bust but
since<00:01:05.030> this<00:01:05.149> section<00:01:05.540> of<00:01:05.630> track<00:01:05.659> is<00:01:05.960> already

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
since this section of track is already

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.490 
since this section of track is already
done<00:01:06.409> I'll<00:01:06.560> just<00:01:06.590> demoing<00:01:07.250> it<00:01:08.200> it's<00:01:09.200> good

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
done I'll just demoing it it's good

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.469 
done I'll just demoing it it's good
enough<00:01:09.680> for<00:01:09.860> this<00:01:12.280> you<00:01:13.280> just<00:01:13.460> go<00:01:13.640> along<00:01:13.759> color

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
enough for this you just go along color

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.989 
enough for this you just go along color
the<00:01:14.630> ties<00:01:14.840> in<00:01:17.170> that's<00:01:18.170> all<00:01:18.319> there<00:01:18.469> is<00:01:18.560> to<00:01:18.770> it

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:18.999 
the ties in that's all there is to it

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:21.789 
the ties in that's all there is to it
and<00:01:19.999> if<00:01:20.149> you're<00:01:20.299> careful<00:01:20.539> enough<00:01:20.799> and

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
and if you're careful enough and

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.410 
and if you're careful enough and
actually<00:01:22.159> do<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.369> pretty<00:01:22.520> good<00:01:22.639> job<00:01:22.819> make<00:01:23.299> it

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
actually do a pretty good job make it

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.639 
actually do a pretty good job make it
look<00:01:23.569> halfway<00:01:23.869> realistic<00:01:26.350> you're<00:01:27.350> just<00:01:27.530> gonna

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
look halfway realistic you're just gonna

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.629 
look halfway realistic you're just gonna
shake<00:01:27.950> this<00:01:28.219> is<00:01:28.279> rust<00:01:28.929> so<00:01:29.929> if<00:01:30.049> you<00:01:30.139> can<00:01:30.259> see

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:30.639 
shake this is rust so if you can see

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:33.239 
shake this is rust so if you can see
break<00:01:31.639> here<00:01:31.880> that's<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.149> blob<00:01:32.389> of<00:01:32.569> solder<00:01:32.810> that

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249 
break here that's a blob of solder that

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:36.940 
break here that's a blob of solder that
my<00:01:34.249> primitive<00:01:34.490> soldering<00:01:35.149> skills<00:01:35.859> want<00:01:36.859> to

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
my primitive soldering skills want to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.589 
my primitive soldering skills want to
hide<00:01:37.130> that<00:01:37.159> I'll<00:01:38.090> just<00:01:38.270> take<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:38.630> marker

00:01:40.589 --> 00:01:40.599 
hide that I'll just take the marker

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:44.889 
hide that I'll just take the marker
paint<00:01:41.599> over<00:01:41.929> it<00:01:41.959> like<00:01:42.170> that<00:01:43.119> at<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.329> same<00:01:44.599> time

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
paint over it like that at the same time

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.609 
paint over it like that at the same time
there's<00:01:45.679> a<00:01:45.829> felt<00:01:46.490> tips<00:01:46.759> on<00:01:47.090> on<00:01:47.990> these<00:01:48.139> markers

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
there's a felt tips on on these markers

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.289 
there's a felt tips on on these markers
so<00:01:49.459> if<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:49.609> use<00:01:49.759> know<00:01:49.909> enough<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.090> get<00:01:50.240> a

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
so if you use know enough to get a

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.629 
so if you use know enough to get a
groove<00:01:50.599> in<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.899> tip<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.709> you<00:01:51.799> can<00:01:51.950> just<00:01:52.130> slide

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:52.639 
groove in the tip and you can just slide

00:01:52.639 --> 00:02:00.890 
groove in the tip and you can just slide
it<00:01:52.969> along<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:53.299> rail<00:01:58.479> just<00:01:59.479> like<00:01:59.719> this

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
it along the rail just like this

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.080 
it along the rail just like this
and<00:02:01.410> that<00:02:01.500> tip<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:02.520> rides<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:03.180> rail<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:05.090> think

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
and that tip just rides the rail I think

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.430 
and that tip just rides the rail I think
it's<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.270> lot<00:02:06.390> neater<00:02:06.660> than<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:08.460> other<00:02:08.850> ways<00:02:09.060> a

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
it's a lot neater than the other ways a

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:21.200 
it's a lot neater than the other ways a
lot<00:02:10.440> easier<00:02:10.800> -<00:02:13.190> it<00:02:14.190> may<00:02:14.310> take<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.580> couple<00:02:14.670> coats

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.320 

but<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.950> pretty<00:02:23.400> much<00:02:23.580> all<00:02:23.850> there<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:24.090> to

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
but this is pretty much all there is to

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.300 
but this is pretty much all there is to
it<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:27.420> other<00:02:27.600> one<00:02:27.810> they<00:02:28.020> make<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.890> kit<00:02:29.100> is

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
it the other one they make in the kit is

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:52.890 
it the other one they make in the kit is
a<00:02:29.340> rail<00:02:29.760> Brown<00:02:32.360> which<00:02:33.360> if<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.750> want<00:02:34.050> to

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.780 

okay<00:02:53.930> mmm<00:02:55.300> if<00:02:56.300> you<00:02:56.450> want<00:02:56.720> you<00:02:57.340> before<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.610> put

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
okay mmm if you want you before you put

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.699 
okay mmm if you want you before you put
the<00:02:58.910> rust<00:02:59.150> on<00:02:59.709> as<00:03:00.709> we<00:03:00.920> go<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:03.230> put<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.560> real

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
the rust on as we go you put the real

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:12.009 
the rust on as we go you put the real
brown<00:03:04.040> on<00:03:08.470> which<00:03:09.470> gives<00:03:09.739> it<00:03:09.860> that<00:03:10.720> real<00:03:11.720> Brown

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
brown on which gives it that real Brown

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:28.210 
brown on which gives it that real Brown
look<00:03:12.319> and<00:03:12.560> then<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.519> rush<00:03:13.760> over<00:03:14.030> it

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.530 

as<00:03:28.790> you<00:03:28.970> can<00:03:29.090> see<00:03:29.270> that<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.720> tie<00:03:29.960> Brown<00:03:30.550> in<00:03:31.550> the

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
as you can see that the tie Brown in the

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.160 
as you can see that the tie Brown in the
rail<00:03:32.690> Brown<00:03:33.550> look<00:03:34.550> almost<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:35.000> same<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:36.080> I

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
rail Brown look almost the same so I

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.120 
rail Brown look almost the same so I
just<00:03:36.380> use<00:03:36.620> both<00:03:36.860> for<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.130> PI's<00:03:37.340> I<00:03:39.070> don't<00:03:40.070> know

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
just use both for the PI's I don't know
