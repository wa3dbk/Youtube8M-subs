colored powder to like a brown one maybe
some<00:03:28.280> other<00:03:28.370> colors<00:03:28.790> works<00:03:29.600> really<00:03:30.170> really

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
some other colors works really really

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.130 
I'll link to all the stuff down below
then<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.460> dry<00:03:40.730> my<00:03:40.970> hair<00:03:41.150> I've<00:03:41.390> been<00:03:41.540> using<00:03:41.780> this

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
then to dry my hair I've been using this

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.010 
then to dry my hair I've been using this
hair<00:03:42.470> dryer<00:03:42.500> for<00:03:43.160> so<00:03:43.610> long<00:03:43.940> can<00:03:44.420> actually<00:03:44.780> see

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
hair dryer for so long can actually see

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.620 
hair dryer for so long can actually see
this<00:03:45.620> old<00:03:45.950> video<00:03:46.370> that<00:03:46.670> I<00:03:46.700> did<00:03:46.790> reviewing<00:03:47.510> this

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
this old video that I did reviewing this

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.590 
this old video that I did reviewing this
I<00:03:47.900> think<00:03:48.140> like<00:03:48.320> four<00:03:48.680> or<00:03:48.830> five<00:03:48.860> years<00:03:49.040> ago

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
I think like four or five years ago

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.910 
I think like four or five years ago
probably<00:03:50.600> closer<00:03:50.810> to<00:03:50.990> 5<00:03:51.290> i'll<00:03:51.560> link<00:03:51.740> to<00:03:51.800> that

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
probably closer to 5 i'll link to that

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.950 
probably closer to 5 i'll link to that
of<00:03:52.160> course<00:03:52.370> i<00:03:52.760> don't<00:03:53.390> even<00:03:54.460> it's<00:03:55.460> so<00:03:55.790> worn<00:03:56.660> that

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
of course i don't even it's so worn that

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.720 
of course i don't even it's so worn that
i<00:03:57.080> can't<00:03:57.380> remember<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:58.040> whole<00:03:58.250> name<00:03:58.400> i<00:03:58.490> think

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
i can't remember the whole name i think

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.860 
i can't remember the whole name i think
it's<00:03:58.850> barb<00:03:59.240> or<00:03:59.540> the<00:04:00.260> Eco<00:04:00.680> 8000<00:04:01.490> this<00:04:01.910> is<00:04:02.210> such<00:04:02.840> a

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
it's barb or the Eco 8000 this is such a

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.420 
it's barb or the Eco 8000 this is such a
cool<00:04:03.140> hair<00:04:03.380> dryer<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.740> only<00:04:04.010> thing<00:04:04.190> as<00:04:04.310> it

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
cool hair dryer the only thing as it

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.240 
cool hair dryer the only thing as it
takes<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:04.880> really<00:04:05.120> long<00:04:05.240> time<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:06.110> for<00:04:07.100> me<00:04:07.220> I

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
takes a really long time so for me I

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.760 
takes a really long time so for me I
think<00:04:07.550> it<00:04:07.910> takes<00:04:08.120> about<00:04:08.750> 20<00:04:09.170> minutes<00:04:09.200> to<00:04:09.530> dry

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
think it takes about 20 minutes to dry

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.980 
think it takes about 20 minutes to dry
my<00:04:09.920> hair<00:04:10.070> completely<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.910> to<00:04:11.510> me<00:04:11.660> that's<00:04:11.900> a

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
my hair completely and to me that's a

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.420 
my hair completely and to me that's a
long<00:04:12.110> time<00:04:12.380> because<00:04:12.560> if<00:04:12.740> I<00:04:12.830> don't<00:04:12.890> use<00:04:13.250> an

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
long time because if I don't use an

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.880 
long time because if I don't use an
eco-friendly<00:04:13.760> low<00:04:14.510> radiation<00:04:14.750> hair<00:04:15.650> dryer

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
eco-friendly low radiation hair dryer

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.330 
eco-friendly low radiation hair dryer
like<00:04:16.160> this<00:04:16.489> then<00:04:17.359> I<00:04:17.870> can<00:04:18.350> blow<00:04:18.560> dry<00:04:18.770> my<00:04:18.830> hair<00:04:19.010> in

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
like this then I can blow dry my hair in

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.909 
like this then I can blow dry my hair in
a<00:04:19.549> matter<00:04:19.790> of<00:04:19.910> minutes<00:04:20.120> but<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.989> thing<00:04:21.230> they

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
a matter of minutes but the thing they

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.040 
a matter of minutes but the thing they
actually<00:04:22.310> explained<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:23.030> me<00:04:23.180> that<00:04:23.210> most<00:04:23.780> hair

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
actually explained to me that most hair

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.500 
actually explained to me that most hair
dryers

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
dryers

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.230 
dryers
as<00:04:24.750> much<00:04:24.990> radiation<00:04:25.260> as<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.830> microwave<00:04:26.550> so

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
as much radiation as a microwave so

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.090 
as much radiation as a microwave so
another<00:04:27.540> reason<00:04:28.020> not<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.200> wash<00:04:28.470> your<00:04:28.680> hair<00:04:28.860> too

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
another reason not to wash your hair too

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.860 
another reason not to wash your hair too
much<00:04:29.280> because<00:04:29.580> if<00:04:29.850> you're<00:04:29.970> using<00:04:30.210> a<00:04:30.390> hair

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
much because if you're using a hair

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.200 
much because if you're using a hair
dryer<00:04:30.900> every<00:04:31.650> single<00:04:31.950> day<00:04:32.100> you're<00:04:32.610> pointing

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
dryer every single day you're pointing

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.410 
dryer every single day you're pointing
radiation<00:04:33.990> at<00:04:34.170> your<00:04:34.590> head<00:04:35.210> sounds<00:04:36.210> a<00:04:36.270> little

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
radiation at your head sounds a little

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.210 
radiation at your head sounds a little
crazy<00:04:36.570> but<00:04:36.870> they<00:04:37.020> even<00:04:37.260> showed<00:04:37.530> me<00:04:37.560> a<00:04:37.770> meter

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
crazy but they even showed me a meter

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.040 
crazy but they even showed me a meter
when<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:38.550> met<00:04:38.820> them<00:04:39.000> in<00:04:39.090> person<00:04:39.150> like<00:04:39.840> they

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
when I met them in person like they

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.250 
when I met them in person like they
metered<00:04:40.800> one<00:04:41.160> regular<00:04:41.700> hair<00:04:41.910> dryer<00:04:42.150> and<00:04:42.420> this

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
metered one regular hair dryer and this

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.790 
metered one regular hair dryer and this
one<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:43.770> it<00:04:43.860> was<00:04:43.890> shocking<00:04:44.670> so<00:04:45.270> no<00:04:46.170> more<00:04:46.440> for

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
one and it was shocking so no more for

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.830 
one and it was shocking so no more for
me<00:04:46.830> I<00:04:46.980> use<00:04:47.280> this<00:04:47.580> whenever<00:04:47.910> I<00:04:48.240> dry<00:04:48.510> my<00:04:48.660> hair

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
me I use this whenever I dry my hair

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.780 
me I use this whenever I dry my hair
sometimes<00:04:49.710> I'll<00:04:49.860> let<00:04:49.980> it<00:04:50.070> air<00:04:50.250> dry<00:04:50.280> but<00:04:50.760> i

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
sometimes I'll let it air dry but i

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.000 
sometimes I'll let it air dry but i
don't<00:04:51.000> really<00:04:51.120> like<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.510> way<00:04:51.540> that<00:04:51.810> it<00:04:51.930> looks

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
don't really like the way that it looks

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.190
