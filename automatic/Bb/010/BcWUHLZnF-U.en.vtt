00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:07.930
 I am a guitarist sound creator Siamese This time I'm picking wrists 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:12.480
 I would like to talk about usage 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:16.710
 As a common point of those who do not go well picking and stroke 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.730
 It is common to say that you play with your arms 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:26.220
 It is such a feeling that a person who is fixed in this place or coffee is said to say 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:30.599
 Toka or I listen to do this play are when put to the Umino basis obtained by very many in at 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.560
 If you do so, you can not make a delicate pick and it will make a mistake 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.500
 It will be 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.450
 So this time 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:42.520
 I would like to talk about ways to improve such picking. 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:45.190
 Tteyuu of Tteyuu have in common does not work picking play in Mako arm Toka elbow 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:51.699
 After all things like playing with just my wrist 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.490
 Well there are many things, but basically picking and stroke is this upper arm 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.740
 Movement from 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:01:02.320
 I think this movement is easy to understand with the patient when standing and playing 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:06.430
 Movement of such a stroke This is becoming more and more compact 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:11.800
 I think it's easy to understand the image that this is happening 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:15.910
 In Eemaa course from 9-cho, 1 but I almost do not move here Toka when the word 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:21.600
 If you imagine the movement of your muscles, the movement will change at all 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:26.850
 Basically it's like doing this with your fingertips when picking 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:31.320
 I have a thumb and a forefinger pick, and I'm going to lower my thumb and forefinger this way 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:35.729
 Is not good tone of is ng This core of it says Konekuri turn such picking 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.009
 It is to I do not recommend because I think that control is also no softening so much easier 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.290
 This of Tteyuu use a fingertip 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:46.530
 I like this usually of a using a swing of the neck and arm in the basic 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.340
 Standard picking ale 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:55.350
 Actually, the muscle here is also used at the time of uh button sound 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.210
 Since it is fine, more detailed nuances after such basic picking can be done 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:04.190
 It is time to express 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.190
 It is Toka fast down picking or rather after that Well some technical system of the guitar 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:15.540
 When the damping and his play to this kind of fast play 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:20.010
 Though spear things like say that I'll a little plus the power of Otani finger is basically finger 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:25.150
 It's not the main thing, but it 's the swing of the neck and the swing of the arm after that 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:28.900
 Understanding the wind, which say that there is a basis for Well picking on this extension line 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.150
 I guess it would be nice if you could get your wrists moved 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.799
 It's basically good if you say 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:40.629
 8 This kind of side movement and the feeling of mixed child of the post rotation 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:44.200
 I may for a moment Corporation Danko shake in a state of defeat that wrist 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.170
 And to about 45 degrees this kind of feeling I guess I Tteyuu this movement 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.230
 This comes here 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.230
 Ray 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.620
 It is such a movement 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.620
 Because it is useless only with the wrist 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.500
 Shake the arm 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:03.120
 I'm going to say this way and it is quick to use the abandoned neck 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.750
 The effect of the snap 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:11.080
 When it comes to strokes, picking is also the same 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.700
 I hope it will be done in the sense of what I said 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.890
 car 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:20.550
 Well, when I'm actually pulling a word, I'm almost moving here and I'm not actually moving just that of muscle 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:26.580
 Something like the original movement 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:31.050
 I think that if I'll play with the image becomes quite to play in this sharp 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:34.560
 We want the high in common with care or rather a mistake 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.710
 It looks like it disappeared like this when viewed from the front, but also when viewed from the side 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:43.510
 To 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:48.040
 It is this kind of movement, and after that, it strikes it like this. 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.200
 Although I will do the picking technique of rumah ah 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:57.239
 Ah 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:04:02.489
 Such I here is also that so that this kind of such a high draw does not hit in this beautiful 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:06.660
 It draws toward and picking Toka such high to outside is ang to and say, pitch Kingu' 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:09.220
 Since the picking trajectory is not stable, let's become a clumsy play but it is also beautiful 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:15.060
 Picking start of Well No of in 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.060
 So I want you to look at the tip of my pick, but for the woman of this string 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:30.580
 You're straight down and it's very important . 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.270
 Well , let's mix the movement of the arm and wrist well and do picking as it is now 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.590
 To give 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:41.480
 Well it's time to draw the words to tell you the more detailed things Toka after the code I 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:46.370
 The movement of the wrist depending on the time of playing is fine in the way of swinging the arm Well that side is 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:52.040
 I want you to wear it while you 're going, but basically I said it first 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:54.140
 When the Tteyuu muscle movement from the upper arm is in Omoto it becomes more and more compact 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.770
 Oh 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:01.319
 From public company delicate detailed picking 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:05.330
 It's about being like a love stroke 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:09.830
 So basically it's a word 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.520
 4 got a to become me it's a good one, even if here Nde only would go even fingertips 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:16.129
 is not it 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:21.880
 Well there are people who have a bad attitude, but if the attitude is bad, for example 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:25.310
 Such Fu when you well when the guitarist child hard practice when sitting 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.760
 Left shoulder is down Semare the head in the right shoulder rises 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:32.200
 This remains practice, for example, I said I'm this kind of point of view will tend 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:36.220
 If there is some practice going to be a girl there 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.680
 Here is really burden you take and can be seen when the get go and see a little once this to 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:44.050
 I think it's amazing, but it takes a lot of money here 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:50.470
 Then, the burden on the upper arm is what it means, and this is spring and muscular 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:52.220
 As I said at the beginning of spring, Kujo 1 -the movement is already blocked so smooth 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:58.250
 It is this that can not do bichi prefecture 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:59.030
 Even so, I'll bring my posture to the middle of my body's sister's center axis. 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.950
 Give 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:05.260
 If you make this free 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.260
 9 on the premise of this move 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:15.249
 You should be able to be able to do bichi prefecture very easily if you do picking 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:20.819
 I'm glad that people who can not pick well will be helpful 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:20.819
 We have prepared six new free gifts for watching this video
