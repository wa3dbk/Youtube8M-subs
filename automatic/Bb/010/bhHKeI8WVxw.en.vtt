00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.140 
quite nice indeed
but<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.500> probably<00:01:14.100> doesn't<00:01:14.340> come<00:01:14.610> across<00:01:14.729> that

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
but it probably doesn't come across that

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.030 
but it probably doesn't come across that
well<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.630> camera<00:01:16.320> because<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.680> all<00:01:16.890> those

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
well on camera because of all those

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.340 
well on camera because of all those
reflections<00:01:17.790> there<00:01:18.000> let's<00:01:18.659> take<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.960> look<00:01:19.170> at

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
reflections there let's take a look at

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.649 
reflections there let's take a look at
the<00:01:19.500> back<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.430> device<00:01:20.759> as<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.479> see

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
the back of the device as you can see

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.660 
the back of the device as you can see
they've<00:01:21.900> moved<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.320> camera<00:01:22.619> position<00:01:23.310> from

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
they've moved the camera position from

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.060 
they've moved the camera position from
the<00:01:24.030> middle<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:25.080> left<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.680> think<00:01:25.920> I'm<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
fan of that so far but it is like an

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.410 
fan of that so far but it is like an

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
absolutely giant phone both the sim card

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.649 
absolutely giant phone both the sim card
