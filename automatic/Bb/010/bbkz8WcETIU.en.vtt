hi<00:00:00.359> guys<00:00:00.599> welcome<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.170> tech<00:00:01.439> friction<00:00:01.800> for

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hi guys welcome to tech friction for

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.100 
hi guys welcome to tech friction for
today<00:00:02.340> let's<00:00:02.490> end<00:00:02.730> how<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:02.939> helmet<00:00:03.449> actually

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
today let's end how a helmet actually

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.320 
today let's end how a helmet actually
protects<00:00:04.500> you<00:00:04.710> or<00:00:05.339> safeguards<00:00:05.910> you<00:00:06.029> so<00:00:06.180> this

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
protects you or safeguards you so this

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.870 
protects you or safeguards you so this
is<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.480> helmet<00:00:06.899> you<00:00:06.930> can<00:00:07.170> see<00:00:07.350> over<00:00:07.560> here

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880 
is a helmet you can see over here

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.759 
is a helmet you can see over here
there's<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.000> glass<00:00:09.210> over<00:00:09.510> here<00:00:09.570> so<00:00:09.809> here's

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
there's a glass over here so here's

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.339 
there's a glass over here so here's
where<00:00:11.070> we're<00:00:11.429> getting<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.820> impact<00:00:12.330> when<00:00:13.170> we

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
where we're getting the impact when we

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.560 
where we're getting the impact when we
helmet<00:00:14.160> let's<00:00:14.340> see<00:00:14.519> what<00:00:14.730> we<00:00:14.940> have<00:00:15.150> inside<00:00:15.330> a

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
helmet let's see what we have inside a

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.650 
helmet let's see what we have inside a
helmet<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.500> just<00:00:17.279> going<00:00:17.970> inside<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.480> helmet

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
helmet so just going inside the helmet

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.550 
helmet so just going inside the helmet
over<00:00:18.960> here<00:00:19.289> just<00:00:19.800> removing<00:00:20.210> the<00:00:21.210> cover<00:00:22.080> so

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
over here just removing the cover so

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.470 
over here just removing the cover so
this<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.160> cow<00:00:23.310> I'm<00:00:23.460> removing<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.180> inside

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
this is the cow I'm removing so inside

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.540 
this is the cow I'm removing so inside
you<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.750> see<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.170> white<00:00:25.650> material<00:00:25.890> over<00:00:26.340> here

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
you can see a white material over here

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.710 
you can see a white material over here
so<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.680> something<00:00:28.910> what<00:00:29.910> we<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.269> insane

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
so this is something what we have insane

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720 
so this is something what we have insane
let's<00:00:30.960> see<00:00:31.170> it's<00:00:31.590> had<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> closer<00:00:32.099> look<00:00:32.430> over

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
let's see it's had a closer look over

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.380 
let's see it's had a closer look over
here<00:00:33.079> right<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.800> what<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.309> material<00:00:35.520> okay

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
here right so what is this material okay

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.190 
here right so what is this material okay
let's<00:00:36.600> see<00:00:36.780> now<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.649> thermo<00:00:38.129> hold<00:00:39.200> so

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
let's see now this is thermo hold so

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.380 
let's see now this is thermo hold so
here<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.500> can<00:00:40.620> see<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.309> exactly<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
here you can see this is exactly the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.619 
here you can see this is exactly the
material<00:00:42.809> what<00:00:43.110> we<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.559> inside<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.480> is

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
material what we have inside so this is

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.229 
material what we have inside so this is
the<00:00:45.719> thermo<00:00:46.020> call<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.640> looks<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the thermo call so this looks like the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.170 
the thermo call so this looks like the
helmet<00:00:48.600> itself<00:00:48.899> yeah<00:00:49.469> yeah<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> helmet

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
helmet itself yeah yeah this is a helmet

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.020 
helmet itself yeah yeah this is a helmet
so<00:00:51.329> over<00:00:51.539> here<00:00:51.920> inside<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.129> helmet<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.820> have

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
so over here inside the helmet we have

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.119 
so over here inside the helmet we have
the<00:00:54.510> thermocore<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.410> what<00:00:55.559> happens<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.100> that

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the thermocore so what happens is that

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.760 
the thermocore so what happens is that
when<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.730> an<00:00:56.969> impact<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.199> helmet<00:00:58.559> at

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
when we get an impact on the helmet at

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.000 
when we get an impact on the helmet at
this<00:00:59.100> point<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.870> impact<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.320> directly<00:01:01.680> going

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
this point the impact is directly going

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.799 
this point the impact is directly going
into<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.760> thermoball<00:01:03.239> which<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.570> just

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
into this thermoball which is just

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.140 
into this thermoball which is just
inside<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.769> helmet<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.610> not<00:01:05.790> directly

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
inside the helmet so it is not directly

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.929 
inside the helmet so it is not directly
going<00:01:06.450> into<00:01:07.140> our<00:01:07.229> head<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:08.369> happens<00:01:08.790> is

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
going into our head so what happens is

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.390 
going into our head so what happens is
that<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.600> portion<00:01:10.320> when<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.650> hits<00:01:10.920> over<00:01:11.189> here

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
that this portion when it hits over here

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.910 
that this portion when it hits over here
can<00:01:11.520> please<00:01:11.700> brace<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.080> break<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
can please brace so here is break so the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.980 
can please brace so here is break so the
impact<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.520> taken<00:01:15.000> care<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.240> by<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
impact is taken care of by the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.980 
impact is taken care of by the
thermocore<00:01:16.650> body<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.369> as<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.270> result<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.840> that

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
thermocore body and as a result of that

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.620 
thermocore body and as a result of that
less<00:01:19.530> amount<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> Lord<00:01:20.820> will<00:01:21.270> only<00:01:21.450> be

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
less amount of the Lord will only be

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.420 
less amount of the Lord will only be
transferring<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> head<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.070> means

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
transferring to the head so that means

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.480 
transferring to the head so that means
when<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.640> hit<00:01:24.060> over<00:01:24.299> here<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.439> top<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
when we hit over here on the top of the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.149 
when we hit over here on the top of the
helmet<00:01:26.700> here<00:01:27.270> what<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:27.990> inside<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:29.100> a

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
helmet here what we have inside is a

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.069 
helmet here what we have inside is a
thermocol<00:01:29.790> as<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.090> have<00:01:30.210> seen<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.900> this

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
thermocol as you have seen so this

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.770 
thermocol as you have seen so this
chemical<00:01:31.409> unit<00:01:31.860> guess<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.790> hit<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.180> it

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
chemical unit guess the hit and it

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.810 
chemical unit guess the hit and it
damaged<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.229> again<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.680> here<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.250> getting

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
damaged this again so here it is getting

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.850 
damaged this again so here it is getting
hit<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.240> diminished<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.590> means

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
hit and it's diminished so that means

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.580 
hit and it's diminished so that means
that<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.430> core<00:01:38.820> impact<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.780> whole<00:01:40.049> lot<00:01:40.409> of

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
that the core impact the whole lot of

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.740 
that the core impact the whole lot of
the<00:01:40.740> impact<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.369> taken<00:01:41.759> by<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.390> thermo

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the impact is taken by this thermo

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.170 
the impact is taken by this thermo
called<00:01:42.960> body<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.430> thermic<00:01:44.759> whole<00:01:44.909> body

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
called body and the thermic whole body

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.719 
called body and the thermic whole body
makes<00:01:45.600> sure<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.680> much<00:01:46.979> impact<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.549> been

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
makes sure that that much impact is been

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.210 
makes sure that that much impact is been
lost<00:01:47.970> here<00:01:48.149> inside<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.990> body<00:01:49.200> itself<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.740> so

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
lost here inside the body itself and so

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.920 
lost here inside the body itself and so
very<00:01:50.430> less<00:01:50.640> amount<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:51.149> force<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.509> been<00:01:51.689> going

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
very less amount of force is been going
