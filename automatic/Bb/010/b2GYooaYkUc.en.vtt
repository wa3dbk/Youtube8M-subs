this is actually an 84 a lot of blowers
out<00:00:22.800> there<00:00:23.039> are<00:00:23.189> seven<00:00:23.640> hundred<00:00:23.939> pounds<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
out there are seven hundred pounds and

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.200 
out there are seven hundred pounds and
less<00:00:25.010> well<00:00:26.010> where<00:00:26.340> does<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.519> extra<00:00:26.820> weight

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
less well where does that extra weight

fan all the way up to the blower body
and<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> reinforcements<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:38.070> all<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
and the reinforcements it's all the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.850 
and the reinforcements it's all the
details<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> manufacturing<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.620> give

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
details in the manufacturing to give

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.340 
details in the manufacturing to give
this<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.160> heavy<00:00:41.730> construction<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.780> extra

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
this the heavy construction that extra

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.400 
this the heavy construction that extra
weight<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:44.520> think<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.910> lot<00:00:45.360> better<00:00:45.629> quality<00:00:45.930> as

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
weight we think a lot better quality as

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.740 
weight we think a lot better quality as
far<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> overall<00:00:47.160> design<00:00:47.539> we<00:00:48.539> talked

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
far as the overall design we talked

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.990 
far as the overall design we talked
about<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.289> blower<00:00:49.590> being<00:00:49.950> over<00:00:50.340> engineered

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
about this blower being over engineered

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.439 
about this blower being over engineered
over<00:00:51.360> built<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:52.579> good<00:00:53.579> place<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.969> look<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
over built a good place to look is the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.479 
over built a good place to look is the
auger<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:55.079> certainly<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.920> case<00:00:56.160> here

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
auger it certainly is the case here

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.849 
auger it certainly is the case here
heaviest<00:00:57.030> auger<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.719> industry<00:00:58.350> has<00:00:58.829> a

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
heaviest auger in the industry has a

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.220 
heaviest auger in the industry has a
real<00:00:59.219> tight<00:00:59.550> spiral<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.390> there's<00:01:00.570> more<00:01:00.899> metal

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
real tight spiral so there's more metal

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.299 
real tight spiral so there's more metal
there<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.370> full<00:01:02.579> 16<00:01:03.300> inches<00:01:03.890> if<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.010> zoom

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
there it's a full 16 inches if you zoom

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.160 
there it's a full 16 inches if you zoom
in<00:01:05.519> closer<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:06.450> how<00:01:06.600> tight<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
in closer you can see how tight the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.460 
in closer you can see how tight the
webbing<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.799> how<00:01:08.250> thick<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.760> is

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
webbing is how thick that is

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.160 
webbing is how thick that is
we<00:01:10.470> got<00:01:10.650> gussets<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:12.060> side<00:01:12.390> as<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.960> can

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
we got gussets on the side as you can

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.880 
we got gussets on the side as you can
see<00:01:13.470> right<00:01:14.400> through<00:01:14.460> here<00:01:15.110> very<00:01:16.110> strong<00:01:16.560> auger

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
see right through here very strong auger

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.690 
see right through here very strong auger
a<00:01:17.780> lot<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.960> models<00:01:19.350> out<00:01:19.500> there<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.770> chain<00:01:20.220> drive

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
a lot of models out there a chain drive

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.969 
a lot of models out there a chain drive
that<00:01:21.060> means<00:01:21.240> they<00:01:21.390> run<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> hydraulic<00:01:22.290> fan<00:01:22.650> and

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that means they run a hydraulic fan and

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.580 
that means they run a hydraulic fan and
then<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> shaft<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.420> they<00:01:24.810> run<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> chain<00:01:25.439> and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
then a shaft and they run a chain and

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.890 
then a shaft and they run a chain and
sprocket<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> auger<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:27.360> means<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.780> you

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
sprocket on the auger that means if you

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.140 
sprocket on the auger that means if you
catch<00:01:28.200> anything<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.979> auger<00:01:29.220> not<00:01:29.579> if<00:01:29.909> but

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
catch anything in the auger not if but

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.870 
catch anything in the auger not if but
when<00:01:31.070> you're<00:01:32.070> going<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> shear<00:01:32.850> pin

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
when you're going to have a shear pin

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.899 
when you're going to have a shear pin
protection<00:01:33.810> well<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.310> imagine<00:01:35.759> out

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
protection well you can imagine out

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.060 
protection well you can imagine out
there<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.329> cold<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.659> snow<00:01:36.960> trying<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.470> mess

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
there in a cold and snow trying to mess

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.890 
there in a cold and snow trying to mess
with<00:01:38.100> gloves<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.820> get<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.150> shear<00:01:39.479> pin<00:01:39.689> back

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
with gloves and get that shear pin back

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.399 
with gloves and get that shear pin back
in<00:01:40.280> with<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> direct<00:01:41.790> drive<00:01:42.090> auger<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.079> we

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
in with the direct drive auger that we

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.700 
in with the direct drive auger that we
have<00:01:44.090> it's<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.240> built-in<00:01:45.689> pressure<00:01:45.990> relief<00:01:46.439> so

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
have it's a built-in pressure relief so

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.889 
have it's a built-in pressure relief so
if<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.950> hit<00:01:47.159> something<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.090> pressure<00:01:48.390> spikes

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
if you hit something the pressure spikes

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.920 
if you hit something the pressure spikes
oil<00:01:49.560> bypasses<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.579> motor<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.600> fail-safe

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
oil bypasses the motor it's a fail-safe

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.609 
oil bypasses the motor it's a fail-safe
it's<00:01:52.500> easier<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.250> more<00:01:53.340> reliable<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.619> best

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
it's easier it's more reliable and best

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.950 
it's easier it's more reliable and best
of<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:55.890> there's<00:01:56.130> no<00:01:56.310> maintenance<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
of all there's no maintenance on it the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.200 
of all there's no maintenance on it the
most<00:01:58.170> critical<00:01:58.710> area<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> snow<00:01:59.640> blower<00:01:59.909> is

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
the blower or the auger is what leads

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.929 
the blower or the auger is what leads
with<00:04:43.319> the<00:04:43.439> blower<00:04:43.680> so<00:04:44.340> if<00:04:44.490> you're<00:04:44.669> driving

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:44.939 
with the blower so if you're driving

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:48.110 
with the blower so if you're driving
into<00:04:45.270> a<00:04:45.389> curb<00:04:45.810> or<00:04:46.310> manhole<00:04:47.310> cover<00:04:47.550> whatever

into a curb or manhole cover whatever
you<00:04:48.300> could<00:04:48.479> imagine<00:04:48.889> the<00:04:49.889> auger<00:04:50.159> is<00:04:50.400> going<00:04:50.580> to

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
you could imagine the auger is going to

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.459 
you could imagine the auger is going to
hit<00:04:50.819> it<00:04:50.939> first<00:04:51.270> and<00:04:51.629> that's<00:04:51.930> something<00:04:52.259> we

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:52.469 
hit it first and that's something we

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:53.929 
hit it first and that's something we
definitely<00:04:52.889> want<00:04:53.069> to<00:04:53.189> avoid<00:04:53.430> again<00:04:53.699> when<00:04:53.849> we
