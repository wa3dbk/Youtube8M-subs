00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
tweak is this at the top of each rep

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.020 
tweak is this at the top of each rep
when<00:00:29.640> your<00:00:29.910> knees<00:00:30.150> are<00:00:30.179> fully<00:00:30.660> extended<00:00:31.080> also

this happen well your quadriceps are

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.190 
this happen well your quadriceps are
made<00:01:13.439> up<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.710> four<00:01:14.490> individual<00:01:15.119> heads<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.689> all

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
made up of four individual heads and all

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.770 
made up of four individual heads and all
of<00:01:16.439> them<00:01:16.560> inserts<00:01:17.009> onto<00:01:17.310> your<00:01:17.909> lower<00:01:18.180> leg<00:01:18.479> and

they<00:01:19.290> perform<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> basic<00:01:20.009> function<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
they perform the basic function of the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.289 
they perform the basic function of the
extension<00:01:21.920> however<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.820> four<00:01:24.030> heads

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
extension however one of the four heads

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.570 
extension however one of the four heads
which<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.689> called<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.200> rectus<00:01:25.770> femoris<00:01:26.130> and

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
which is called the rectus femoris and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.399 
which is called the rectus femoris and
it's<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> one<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.570> sits<00:01:27.780> right<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
it's the one that sits right in the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.460 
it's the one that sits right in the
middle<00:01:28.829> portion<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.790> your<00:01:29.939> thigh<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:31.110> head

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
middle portion of your thigh that head

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.710 
middle portion of your thigh that head
originates<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.340> your<00:01:32.460> pelvis<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.329> top

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
originates up on your pelvis and on top

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.679 
originates up on your pelvis and on top
of<00:01:33.750> performing<00:01:34.670> knee<00:01:35.670> extension<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.450> also

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
of performing knee extension it also

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.230 
of performing knee extension it also
performs<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.439> function<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.070> hip<00:01:38.579> flexion<00:01:39.000> as

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
performs the function of hip flexion as

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.749 
performs the function of hip flexion as
well<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:40.229> by<00:01:40.409> combining<00:01:40.619> both<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.670> those

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
well so by combining both of those

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.620 
well so by combining both of those
functions<00:01:42.360> knee<00:01:42.600> extension<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.439> hip<00:01:43.860> flexion

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
functions knee extension and hip flexion

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.120 
functions knee extension and hip flexion
into<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> exercise<00:01:46.200> you're<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.890> end<00:01:47.040> up

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
into the exercise you're going to end up

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.310 
into the exercise you're going to end up
getting<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> more<00:01:47.909> well-rounded<00:01:48.320> stimulation

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
getting a more well-rounded stimulation

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.310 
getting a more well-rounded stimulation
of<00:01:49.409> your<00:01:49.470> quads<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.189> each<00:01:50.520> rep<00:01:51.110> because<00:01:52.110> you'll

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
of your quads on each rep because you'll

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.319 
of your quads on each rep because you'll
be<00:01:52.530> training<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.100> rectus<00:01:53.399> femoris<00:01:53.759> through

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
be training the rectus femoris through

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.300 
be training the rectus femoris through
both<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.780> its<00:01:55.049> functions<00:01:55.500> again<00:01:56.040> knee

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
both of its functions again knee

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.910 
both of its functions again knee
extension<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.210> hip<00:01:57.420> flexion<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.079> difference

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
extension and hip flexion the difference

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.219 
extension and hip flexion the difference
here<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.219> not<00:01:59.399> going<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.820> anything<00:02:00.299> too
