00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
good TV so far but this one thing with

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.030 
good TV so far but this one thing with
is<00:00:29.760> really<00:00:29.970> annoying<00:00:30.390> me<00:00:30.740> when<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.800> have<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
is really annoying me when you have the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.610 
is really annoying me when you have the
smart<00:00:32.340> dimming<00:00:32.669> enabled<00:00:33.120> which<00:00:33.450> gives<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.590> a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
smart dimming enabled which gives you a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.920 
smart dimming enabled which gives you a
lot<00:00:34.920> better<00:00:35.160> black<00:00:35.880> levels<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.780> off

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
lot better black levels and with it off

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.110 
lot better black levels and with it off
but<00:00:37.680> unfortunately<00:00:39.020> you<00:00:40.020> want<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.379> cut<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
but unfortunately you want to cut the

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.819 
but unfortunately you want to cut the
backlight<00:00:42.120> completely<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> picture<00:00:43.620> gets

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
backlight completely if the picture gets

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.490 
backlight completely if the picture gets

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
you can see is now completely out and

you can see is now completely out and
that<00:01:24.060> light<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:24.960> there<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> reflection

that light you see there is a reflection

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.580 
that light you see there is a reflection
of<00:01:26.189> my<00:01:26.310> computer<00:01:27.000> screen<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:30.560> yeah

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
of my computer screen so yeah

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.550 
of my computer screen so yeah
essentially<00:01:32.070> what<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.400> TV<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.869> doing<00:01:34.259> is

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
essentially what this TV is doing is

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.819 
essentially what this TV is doing is
it's<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.820> wants<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.329> cut<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.540> backlight<00:01:37.170> if

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
it's it wants to cut the backlight if

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.550 
it's it wants to cut the backlight if
the<00:01:38.340> picture<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.670> dark<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:40.020> should<00:01:40.380> not<00:01:40.500> be

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the picture is dark and it should not be

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.580 
the picture is dark and it should not be
doing<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.780> turn<00:01:42.780> my<00:01:42.990> players<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.560> screen

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
you can see your green band fading up

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.969 
you can see your green band fading up
there<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:51.409> turn<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.530> off

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979

and<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:53.909> gone<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:56.299> player<00:01:57.299> out<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.719> TV

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and it's gone and I player out the TV

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.679 
and it's gone and I player out the TV
controls<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.460> found<00:01:59.939> out<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:01.890> can

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
controls and I found out that you can

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.780 
controls and I found out that you can
sort<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.810> defeat<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.350> by<00:02:04.740> turning<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
sort of defeat this by turning the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.389 
sort of defeat this by turning the
brightness<00:02:06.240> up<00:02:06.829> it's<00:02:07.829> actually<00:02:08.160> set<00:02:08.369> up

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
brightness up it's actually set up

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.300 
brightness up it's actually set up
higher<00:02:08.729> than<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.090> should<00:02:09.119> be<00:02:09.420> right<00:02:09.660> now<00:02:09.690> but

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
higher than it should be right now but

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.370 
higher than it should be right now but
it's<00:02:11.310> at<00:02:11.459> 70<00:02:11.910> let's<00:02:12.180> crank<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.480> up<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.690> 71

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
it's at 70 let's crank it up to 71

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.930 
it's at 70 let's crank it up to 71
and<00:02:13.760> see<00:02:14.760> there<00:02:15.030> now<00:02:15.300> it's<00:02:15.840> date<00:02:16.130> so<00:02:17.130> I<00:02:17.550> can

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
and see there now it's date so I can

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.120 
and see there now it's date so I can
keep<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.210> brightness<00:02:18.540> at<00:02:18.630> 71<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.500> have<00:02:20.010> it

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
keep the brightness at 71 and have it

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.870 
keep the brightness at 71 and have it
not<00:02:20.250> do<00:02:20.490> that<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:22.680> picture<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.040> really<00:02:23.580> a

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
not do that but the picture is really a

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.370 
not do that but the picture is really a
brighter<00:02:24.690> than<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.050> should<00:02:25.230> be<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:27.380> turning

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
brighter than it should be so turning

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.240

finally get this problem fixed and it's
just<00:03:33.120> really<00:03:33.300> really<00:03:33.750> annoying<00:03:33.960> and

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
just really really annoying and

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.430 
just really really annoying and
especially<00:03:34.590> movies<00:03:35.570> that<00:03:36.570> have<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.230> lot<00:03:37.410> of

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
especially movies that have a lot of

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.570 
especially movies that have a lot of
fade-outs<00:03:37.920> in<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.160> middle<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.430> them

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
fade-outs in the middle of them

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.850 
fade-outs in the middle of them
basically<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.450> fade<00:03:39.690> out<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:39.990> dark<00:03:40.260> scene<00:03:40.530> and

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
basically you fade out to dark scene and

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.560 
basically you fade out to dark scene and
then<00:03:42.500> then<00:03:43.500> BAM<00:03:43.860> like<00:03:44.130> that<00:03:44.400> it's<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.910> it

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
then then BAM like that it's a it

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.660 
then then BAM like that it's a it
doesn't<00:03:45.840> look<00:03:46.080> like<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.320> screen<00:03:47.220> going<00:03:47.490> black

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
doesn't look like a screen going black

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.320 
doesn't look like a screen going black
it<00:03:47.820> looks<00:03:47.850> like<00:03:48.060> your<00:03:48.209> TV<00:03:48.510> is<00:03:48.750> powering<00:03:49.410> off

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
it looks like your TV is powering off

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.550 
it looks like your TV is powering off
even<00:03:51.330> when<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.690> picture<00:03:51.990> is<00:03:52.110> completely

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
even when the picture is completely

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.970 
even when the picture is completely
black<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:53.330> LEDs<00:03:54.330> should<00:03:54.810> remain<00:03:55.260> on<00:03:55.560> because

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
black the LEDs should remain on because

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.140 
black the LEDs should remain on because
there's<00:03:56.280> always<00:03:56.400> going<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.640> be<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.790> little<00:03:56.970> bit

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
there's always going to be a little bit

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.870 
there's always going to be a little bit
of<00:03:57.270> film<00:03:58.050> grain<00:03:58.350> or<00:03:58.590> what-have-you<00:03:58.770> in<00:03:59.520> the

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
of film grain or what-have-you in the

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.320 
of film grain or what-have-you in the
picture

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
picture

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.210 
picture
so<00:04:00.780> it's<00:04:01.110> essentially<00:04:01.740> it's<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:01.950> audio

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
so it's essentially it's the audio

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.890 
so it's essentially it's the audio
equivalent<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.440> if<00:04:04.550> say<00:04:05.550> if<00:04:05.850> you<00:04:06.030> were<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.600> mute

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
equivalent of if say if you were to mute

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.280 
equivalent of if say if you were to mute
your<00:04:06.930> audio<00:04:08.030> during<00:04:09.030> any<00:04:09.390> quiet<00:04:09.780> parts<00:04:10.110> in<00:04:10.200> the

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
your audio during any quiet parts in the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.030 
your audio during any quiet parts in the
soundtrack<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:11.250> mean<00:04:11.790> obviously<00:04:11.970> that's

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
soundtrack I mean obviously that's

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.699 
soundtrack I mean obviously that's
that's<00:04:14.040> going<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.340> be<00:04:15.230> more<00:04:16.230> annoying<00:04:16.500> than

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
that's going to be more annoying than

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.030 
that's going to be more annoying than
just<00:04:16.890> leaving<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.160> as<00:04:17.370> it<00:04:17.520> is<00:04:17.640> so<00:04:18.650> okay<00:04:19.650> I

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
just leaving it as it is so okay I

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.210 
just leaving it as it is so okay I
assume<00:04:20.850> you<00:04:21.270> you<00:04:21.570> have<00:04:21.750> you've<00:04:22.140> seen<00:04:22.710> enough

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
assume you you have you've seen enough
