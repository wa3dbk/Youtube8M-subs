and then bring it back up and put a

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.719 
and then bring it back up and put a
slight<00:01:18.890> thread<00:01:19.280> ball<00:01:21.069> just<00:01:22.069> where<00:01:22.280> it<00:01:22.369> starts

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
slight thread ball just where it starts

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.010 
slight thread ball just where it starts
to<00:01:22.789> bend<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.300> that's<00:01:23.420> going<00:01:23.599> to<00:01:23.660> help<00:01:23.810> me

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
to bend and that's going to help me

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.309 
to bend and that's going to help me
separate<00:01:24.560> my<00:01:25.250> goose<00:01:25.489> Bayat<00:01:25.940> tails<00:01:26.360> and<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:27.140> the

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
back so that they'll create that natural

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.270 
back so that they'll create that natural
v-shape<00:02:02.239> that<00:02:02.780> we<00:02:02.929> were<00:02:03.530> looking<00:02:03.830> for<00:02:04.069> in<00:02:04.160> our

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
v-shape that we were looking for in our

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:16.460 
v-shape that we were looking for in our
tails

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.830
