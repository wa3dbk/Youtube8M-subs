00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.830 
define this territory example I can put
words<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:02.100> make<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.310> territory<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.240> trying<00:02:03.539> to

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
words to make a territory and trying to

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.889 
words to make a territory and trying to
get<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.679> majority<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.780> closing<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
get the majority and closing the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.050 
get the majority and closing the
territory<00:02:07.350> with<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.920> man<00:02:08.099> inside<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:09.030> that

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
territory with the man inside so that

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.509 
territory with the man inside so that
only<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:10.049> yeah<00:02:10.590> but<00:02:10.769> only<00:02:10.920> me<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.280> rare

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
only you can yeah but only me it's rare

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.030 
only you can yeah but only me it's rare
because<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.209> know<00:02:12.390> how<00:02:13.349> we<00:02:13.410> fight<00:02:13.739> a<00:02:13.769> lot<00:02:14.010> and

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
because you know how we fight a lot and

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.979 
because you know how we fight a lot and
other<00:02:14.370> people<00:02:14.730> are<00:02:14.849> always<00:02:15.090> directly<00:02:15.750> there

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
other people are always directly there

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.369 
other people are always directly there
when<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.290> try<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.540> important

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
when you try to get and the important

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.080 
when you try to get and the important
thing<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.680> like<00:02:19.830> we<00:02:19.980> cannot<00:02:20.340> close<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.849> area

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
thing is like we cannot close in area

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.350 
thing is like we cannot close in area
and<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.750> four<00:02:22.049> squares<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.760> has<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.180> be<00:02:24.269> at

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
and the four squares so it has to be at

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.479 
and the four squares so it has to be at
least<00:02:24.599> four<00:02:25.049> squares<00:02:25.380> okay<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.430> you

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
least four squares okay so you

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.550 
least four squares okay so you
understand<00:02:27.000> verify<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.810> seven<00:02:28.290> square

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
understand verify that a seven square

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.009 
understand verify that a seven square
area<00:02:28.920> can<00:02:29.280> never<00:02:29.519> be<00:02:30.829> apart<00:02:31.829> into<00:02:32.250> two<00:02:32.910> anymore

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
area can never be apart into two anymore

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.270 
area can never be apart into two anymore
because<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.260> couldn't<00:02:34.590> make<00:02:34.739> it<00:02:34.799> we<00:02:35.040> make<00:02:35.190> it

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
because I couldn't make it we make it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.300 
because I couldn't make it we make it
three<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:35.730> four<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.060> it's<00:02:36.180> not<00:02:36.299> possible<00:02:37.310> so

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
three and a four so it's not possible so

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.770 
three and a four so it's not possible so
every<00:02:38.610> player<00:02:38.790> will<00:02:39.000> play<00:02:39.030> after<00:02:39.510> each<00:02:39.629> other

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
every player will play after each other

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.800 
every player will play after each other
so<00:02:40.560> trying<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:42.150> choose<00:02:42.329> which<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.690> best

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
so trying to to choose which is the best

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.789 
so trying to to choose which is the best
either<00:02:43.230> add<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:44.099> warrior<00:02:44.459> or<00:02:45.299> try<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.290> define

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
either add a warrior or try to define

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.670 
either add a warrior or try to define
and<00:02:47.099> close<00:02:47.489> an<00:02:47.640> area<00:02:47.879> or<00:02:48.239> reopen<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.319> because

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
and close an area or reopen it because

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.289 
and close an area or reopen it because
it<00:02:49.799> becomes<00:02:49.950> dangerous<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.760> then<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.030> next

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
it becomes dangerous that then the next

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.880 
it becomes dangerous that then the next
turn<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.599> next<00:02:51.840> player<00:02:51.989> can<00:02:52.260> close<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.709> and

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
turn the next player can close it and

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.309 
turn the next player can close it and
I'm<00:02:53.010> not<00:02:53.250> sure<00:02:53.310> because<00:02:53.639> I<00:02:53.910> put<00:02:54.120> only<00:02:54.269> one<00:02:54.420> and

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
I'm not sure because I put only one and

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.340 
I'm not sure because I put only one and
maybe<00:02:55.769> equals<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.790> history<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.750> want<00:02:58.049> to<00:02:58.109> add

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
maybe equals to history so I want to add

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.590 
maybe equals to history so I want to add
one<00:02:58.560> more<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.489> it's<00:02:59.609> so<00:02:59.880> basically<00:03:00.209> on<00:03:00.420> your

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
one more so it's so basically on your

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.990 
one more so it's so basically on your
turn<00:03:00.870> your<00:03:01.079> guys<00:03:01.200> are<00:03:01.410> going<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.680> place<00:03:01.859> a

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
turn your guys are going to place a

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.640 
turn your guys are going to place a
character<00:03:03.000> facedown<00:03:03.450> somewhere<00:03:03.989> or<00:03:04.380> you

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
character facedown somewhere or you

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.940 
character facedown somewhere or you
actually<00:03:04.829> blew<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.430> wall<00:03:05.690> exactly<00:03:06.720> oh<00:03:06.810> no<00:03:07.319> not

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
actually blew the wall exactly oh no not

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.500 
actually blew the wall exactly oh no not
you<00:03:08.130> cannot<00:03:08.430> move<00:03:08.609> in<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.910> world<00:03:09.269> which<00:03:09.480> is

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
you cannot move in a world which is

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.599 
you cannot move in a world which is
already<00:03:09.930> under<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.380> book<00:03:10.680> now<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:11.069> can<00:03:11.400> only

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
already under a book now we can only

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.259 
already under a book now we can only
take<00:03:11.940> what<00:03:12.680> anyone<00:03:13.680> up<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.310> two<00:03:14.489> against<00:03:15.120> with

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
take what anyone up to two against with

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.270 
take what anyone up to two against with
Jonas<00:03:15.720> exactly<00:03:16.410> exactly

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
Jonas exactly exactly

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.400 
Jonas exactly exactly
so<00:03:17.910> this<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.359> barrier<00:03:18.630> to<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:19.109> basic

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
so this is the barrier to the basic

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.740 
so this is the barrier to the basic
rules<00:03:19.620> if<00:03:19.829> we<00:03:19.980> play<00:03:20.160> four<00:03:20.430> players<00:03:20.700> we<00:03:21.510> play

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
rules if we play four players we play

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.530 
rules if we play four players we play
with<00:03:22.530> my<00:03:22.769> teens<00:03:23.040> come<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.970> family<00:03:24.150> space

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
with my teens come to family space

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.409 
with my teens come to family space
together<00:03:24.750> facing<00:03:25.560> each<00:03:25.680> other<00:03:25.829> but<00:03:26.639> the<00:03:27.180> thing

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
together facing each other but the thing

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:28.970 
together facing each other but the thing
of<00:03:27.569> this<00:03:27.690> game<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.049> psychological<00:03:28.650> part<00:03:28.799> of

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
of this game the psychological part of

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.559 
of this game the psychological part of
this<00:03:29.099> thing<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.579> like<00:03:29.760> we<00:03:29.880> cannot<00:03:30.269> communicate

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
this thing is like we cannot communicate

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.449 
this thing is like we cannot communicate
what<00:03:31.169> our<00:03:31.290> strategy

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
what our strategy

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.459 
what our strategy
so<00:03:32.640> you<00:03:32.760> have<00:03:32.909> to<00:03:33.090> try<00:03:33.359> to<00:03:33.420> guess<00:03:33.930> what's<00:03:34.260> the

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:34.469 
so you have to try to guess what's the

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:36.530 
so you have to try to guess what's the
other<00:03:34.560> trying<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.219> do<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.670> defend<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.299> I<00:03:36.359> have

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
other trying to do to defend and I have

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.970 
other trying to do to defend and I have
to<00:03:36.719> her<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.079> I<00:03:37.170> heard<00:03:37.409> that<00:03:37.560> I'm<00:03:37.680> going<00:03:37.920> to

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
to her and I heard that I'm going to

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.599 
to her and I heard that I'm going to
support<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:38.730> not<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.269> do<00:03:39.390> against<00:03:39.840> Italy

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
support this and not to do against Italy

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.729 
support this and not to do against Italy
this<00:03:41.609> is<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.909> basic<00:03:42.269> of<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.170> game<00:03:43.349> but

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
this is the basic of the of the game but

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.410 
this is the basic of the of the game but
the<00:03:43.920> thing<00:03:44.099> will<00:03:44.250> interesting<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:44.730> well<00:03:44.879> there

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
the thing will interesting is well there

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.220 
the thing will interesting is well there
is<00:03:46.219> advanced<00:03:47.219> rules<00:03:47.459> which<00:03:48.239> gives<00:03:48.510> way<00:03:48.959> more

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
is advanced rules which gives way more

but he has it only works so he has only
one<00:06:12.410> power<00:06:12.710> because<00:06:12.980> it's<00:06:13.100> too<00:06:13.280> strong<00:06:13.520> he<00:06:13.700> can

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
one power because it's too strong he can

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.240 
one power because it's too strong he can
make<00:06:14.060> a<00:06:14.090> very<00:06:14.390> big<00:06:14.510> deal<00:06:14.770> so<00:06:15.770> you<00:06:15.800> have<00:06:15.950> to<00:06:16.100> use

make a very big deal so you have to use

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.670 
make a very big deal so you have to use
it<00:06:16.400> to<00:06:16.520> the<00:06:16.640> right<00:06:16.850> moment<00:06:17.270> of<00:06:17.360> the<00:06:17.480> right<00:06:17.630> in<00:06:18.500> a

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
it to the right moment of the right in a

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.130 
it to the right moment of the right in a
government<00:06:19.070> and<00:06:19.250> the<00:06:19.280> government<00:06:19.490> he<00:06:20.090> can<00:06:21.020> you
