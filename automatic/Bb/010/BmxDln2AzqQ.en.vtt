00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
be a slave to the kitchen so I had to

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.690 
be a slave to the kitchen so I had to
add<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.320> batch<00:02:43.620> check<00:02:43.860> everything<00:02:44.220> on<00:02:44.310> Sunday<00:02:44.670> I

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
add a batch check everything on Sunday I

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.970 
add a batch check everything on Sunday I
had<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.120> kind<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.720> spend<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.590> couple<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.860> hours

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
had to kind of spend a couple of hours

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.470 
had to kind of spend a couple of hours
getting<00:02:47.610> everything<00:02:47.790> sorted<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.390> then

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
getting everything sorted and then

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.210 
getting everything sorted and then
freeze<00:02:48.720> off<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.140> be<00:02:49.500> able<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.680> defrost<00:02:49.830> at

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
freeze off and be able to defrost at

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.420 
freeze off and be able to defrost at
work<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.989> guess<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.290> negative<00:02:52.470> moments<00:02:53.190> were

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
work I guess the negative moments were

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.670 
work I guess the negative moments were
because<00:02:54.239> he<00:02:54.330> has<00:02:54.480> fit<00:02:54.720> so<00:02:54.840> many<00:02:54.959> meals<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.410> one

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
because he has fit so many meals in one

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.310 
because he has fit so many meals in one
day<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.790> when<00:02:57.420> we'd<00:02:57.540> have<00:02:57.570> our<00:02:57.720> evening<00:02:58.110> meal

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
and I'll get ready for bed then he'll be

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.620

the time in he committed himself to this
10-week<00:04:09.730> process<00:04:10.230> from<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:11.380> off<00:04:11.470> he<00:04:12.400> did

Adam he still got his quote done for the

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.080 
Adam he still got his quote done for the
magazine<00:04:17.019> which<00:04:17.440> is<00:04:17.769> pretty<00:04:18.760> impressive

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
magazine which is pretty impressive

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.670

stuff<00:04:19.329> considering<00:04:19.870> all<00:04:20.140> the<00:04:20.260> other<00:04:20.290> things

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
stuff considering all the other things

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.860 
stuff considering all the other things
he<00:04:20.799> had<00:04:20.919> to<00:04:20.950> do<00:04:21.160> with<00:04:21.310> his<00:04:21.400> days<00:04:21.609> and<00:04:21.910> I<00:04:22.810> think

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
he had to do with his days and I think

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.570 
he had to do with his days and I think
the<00:04:23.080> results<00:04:23.440> really<00:04:23.620> will<00:04:23.979> show<00:04:24.190> on<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.340> page

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
the results really will show on the page

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.820 
the results really will show on the page
and<00:04:24.790> it<00:04:24.910> looks<00:04:25.060> great<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:26.110> next<00:04:26.290> step<00:04:26.680> I'd

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
and it looks great the next step I'd

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.100 
and it looks great the next step I'd
recommend<00:04:27.160> Sam<00:04:27.700> is<00:04:27.970> of<00:04:28.479> course<00:04:28.780> its<00:04:28.960> goal

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
recommend Sam is of course its goal

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.140 
recommend Sam is of course its goal
dependent<00:04:29.680> but<00:04:29.950> I<00:04:30.220> think<00:04:30.610> that<00:04:30.820> he<00:04:31.000> can

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
dependent but I think that he can

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.180 
dependent but I think that he can
continue<00:04:31.479> to<00:04:31.660> progress<00:04:31.930> at<00:04:32.380> a<00:04:32.410> quite<00:04:32.890> fast

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
continue to progress at a quite fast

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.400 
continue to progress at a quite fast
rate<00:04:33.460> I<00:04:33.610> don't<00:04:34.180> think<00:04:34.270> he's<00:04:34.600> hit<00:04:34.840> warmer<00:04:35.290> yet

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
rate I don't think he's hit warmer yet

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.409 
rate I don't think he's hit warmer yet
at<00:04:35.500> all<00:04:35.710> what<00:04:36.100> I<00:04:36.130> would<00:04:36.250> say<00:04:36.669> because<00:04:36.940> he's<00:04:37.270> not

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
at all what I would say because he's not

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.260

taking us forward I'm certainly going to

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.980 
taking us forward I'm certainly going to
try<00:05:00.770> and<00:05:01.070> maintain<00:05:01.220> kind<00:05:02.180> of<00:05:02.270> a<00:05:02.300> good<00:05:02.690> diet

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
try and maintain kind of a good diet

up to the four gym sessions and make

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.520 
up to the four gym sessions and make
sure<00:05:11.240> that<00:05:11.420> when<00:05:11.600> I'm<00:05:11.690> in<00:05:11.840> the<00:05:11.900> gym<00:05:11.930> I'm<00:05:12.320> not

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
wasting any time I'm completely on it I

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.200 
wasting any time I'm completely on it I
think<00:05:15.320> this<00:05:15.440> kind<00:05:15.620> of<00:05:15.770> plan<00:05:16.010> takes<00:05:16.850> a<00:05:16.970> little

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
think this kind of plan takes a little

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.150 
think this kind of plan takes a little
bit<00:05:17.300> of<00:05:17.390> discipline<00:05:17.900> and<00:05:18.080> forward<00:05:18.830> planning

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
bit of discipline and forward planning

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.010 
bit of discipline and forward planning
really<00:05:19.310> to<00:05:19.580> get<00:05:19.730> involved<00:05:20.180> with<00:05:20.330> I<00:05:20.540> certainly

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
really to get involved with I certainly

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.660 
really to get involved with I certainly
think<00:05:21.230> that<00:05:21.320> nutrition<00:05:21.920> is<00:05:22.010> more<00:05:22.220> important

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
think that nutrition is more important

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.190 
think that nutrition is more important
than<00:05:22.790> anything<00:05:23.030> else<00:05:23.270> it<00:05:23.660> wasn't<00:05:23.930> doing

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
than anything else it wasn't doing

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.990 
than anything else it wasn't doing
