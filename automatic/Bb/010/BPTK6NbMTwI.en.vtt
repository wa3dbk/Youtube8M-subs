00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.210 
the air you shoot them so he takes off
and<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:04.270> can<00:02:04.479> keep<00:02:04.930> doing<00:02:05.259> that<00:02:05.440> keeping<00:02:06.100> him

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
and you can keep doing that keeping him

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.840 
and you can keep doing that keeping him
off<00:02:06.460> ground<00:02:07.830> they<00:02:08.830> are<00:02:08.950> being<00:02:09.310> parted<00:02:09.759> you

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
off ground they are being parted you

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:19.040 
off ground they are being parted you
want<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.119> use<00:02:10.330> it<00:02:10.509> for<00:02:10.690> his<00:02:11.130> stunts

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.710 

I<00:02:19.610> like<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.760> lift<00:02:20.880> vehicles<00:02:21.480> with<00:02:21.690> a

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
I like to lift vehicles with a

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.030 
I like to lift vehicles with a
helicopter<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.320> actually<00:02:22.650> using<00:02:23.010> that

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
helicopter and actually using that

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.040 
helicopter and actually using that
vehicle<00:02:23.580> as<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.700> wrecking<00:02:24.120> ball<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.960> it's

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
vehicle as a wrecking ball so it's

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.300 
vehicle as a wrecking ball so it's
really<00:02:25.200> useful<00:02:25.620> if<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:25.800> don't<00:02:25.890> want<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.130> waste

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
really useful if you don't want to waste

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.220 
really useful if you don't want to waste
ammo<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.910> we're<00:02:27.120> good

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.280 

it's<00:02:30.620> really<00:02:30.920> very<00:02:31.610> very<00:02:31.790> few<00:02:32.390> limitations<00:02:32.690> so

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
it's really very very few limitations so

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.000 
it's really very very few limitations so
what<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.560> can<00:02:33.680> do<00:02:33.800> with<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.040> grappling<00:02:34.340> hook

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.059 

I<00:02:37.099> think<00:02:38.000> players<00:02:38.239> are<00:02:38.720> going<00:02:38.989> to<00:02:39.080> invent<00:02:39.769> new

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
I think players are going to invent new

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:59.750 
I think players are going to invent new
ways<00:02:40.580> of<00:02:40.760> using<00:02:40.819> the<00:02:41.150> grappling<00:02:41.390> hook

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.270 

yes
