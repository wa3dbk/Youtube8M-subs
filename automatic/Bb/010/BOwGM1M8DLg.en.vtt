it up until a dough forms to a

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.850 
it up until a dough forms to a
consistency<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.149> about<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.440> where

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
consistency just about like this where

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.630 
consistency just about like this where
it's<00:00:44.040> workable<00:00:45.770> then<00:00:46.770> what<00:00:47.010> I'm<00:00:47.129> going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.399> do
