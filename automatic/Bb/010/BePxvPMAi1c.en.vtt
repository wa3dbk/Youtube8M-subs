00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.500
 15h20 women and latinos eyes we are 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.400
 twin brothers but there we are two 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.960
 twin brothers 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.849
 besides two twins it's a 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.320
 pleonasm of twins yes you see this 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.880
 that it's a pleonasm and yes it's 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.700
 like when we say a little dwarf 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.730
 where a big giant for love t on 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.730
 go downstairs a housekeeper 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.060
 the madiot blazers these moments because 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.540
 you were going to be fatal is weak it takes 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.760
 traumato states that you saw 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.870
 some but get a nose up 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.920
 yes it's true we rarely get wet 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.420
 the shots all the same time and so two 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.980
 twins but it's very interesting to 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.450
 to say because we are brothers 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.550
 twins we are often asked 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.360
 very weird questions that's right and I 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.680
 you swear it's true it's a 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.910
 true story still two weeks 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.170
 there is the northern voice that is the 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.970
 daily northerner because we come from 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.050
 Lille must know that the costs of 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.420
 guys are going out of luck and I 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.980
 Fuck you 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.740
 but it's a language it's true it says 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.850
 that everywhere then the mecca of two 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.200
 lines the reporter and I swear to you 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:12.610
 that's true the first question he has 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:15.479
 does then then so then you yourself 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.479
 are encountered common 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.790
 that's the kind of question for us 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.200
 ask another question that we are asked 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.520
 quite often it happens to us when we 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.750
 is not together to love each other again 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.830
 awake about three to four months 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.690
 I was doing some shopping 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.979
 it's true to a girl is advancing 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.509
 to me a girl I knew a 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.700
 little bit there for the shot she moves forward 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.440
 to me to give me a salute to 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.440
 wait there it's you or it's your brother 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.549
 in general it's me 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.119
 thankfully happily ask us 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.740
 smarter questions yes the 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.009
 question that comes up very often it's 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.509
 what you get along well yes yes 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.440
 yes that's okay it means we're 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.360
 identical twins 1 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.560
 we are monozygotic twins that's 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.420
 like that we say scientifically 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.940
 means that if you go back then 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.100
 was one and the same sperm or 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.539
 two it's true that at the time we had 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.539
 one and the same flagellum for two 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.110
 today we have two 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.550
 at the time that's where we met 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.410
 our magazine finally you are 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.160

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.400
 in a 60 cubic centimeters it creates 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.290
 connections 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.370

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.370
 mouth in mom's belly 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:43.800
 abbas was pool every day the 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.740
 philosophical conversations debates 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.180
 policies all stretched anyway 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.840
 does not always agree at was 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.970
 small 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.170
 still had my arguments dream 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.100

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.870
 the Mitterrand's policy of no 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.380

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.250
 currently is a little bit early 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.650
 must say but we knew how to have fun 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.310
