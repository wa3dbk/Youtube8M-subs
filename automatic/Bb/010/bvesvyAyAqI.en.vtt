roll<00:01:57.810> here<00:01:57.840> are<00:01:58.140> going<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.350> try<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.469> hide<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.799> a

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
roll here are going to try to hide it a

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.149 
roll here are going to try to hide it a
little<00:01:59.009> bit<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.670> you're<00:02:00.479> gonna<00:02:00.540> pin<00:02:00.869> that

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
little bit and you're gonna pin that

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.859 
little bit and you're gonna pin that
against<00:02:02.159> your<00:02:02.369> head<00:02:02.549> about<00:02:02.820> two<00:02:03.180> inches<00:02:03.630> up

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
against your head about two inches up

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.130 
against your head about two inches up
from<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.619> hairline<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.630> for<00:02:06.630> me<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.840> helps<00:02:07.049> a

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
from the hairline and for me it helps a

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.869 
from the hairline and for me it helps a
crisscross<00:02:07.380> my<00:02:07.680> bobby<00:02:07.860> pins<00:02:08.160> with<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.670> there

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
crisscross my bobby pins with in there

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.190 
crisscross my bobby pins with in there
because<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.360> way<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.539> hold<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.899> little<00:02:10.020> bit

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
because that way it hold it a little bit

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.529 
because that way it hold it a little bit
better

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
better

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.030 
better
then<00:02:11.140> you're<00:02:11.230> going<00:02:11.319> to<00:02:11.379> let<00:02:11.469> the<00:02:11.650> rest<00:02:11.799> of<00:02:11.950> the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
then you're going to let the rest of the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.459 
then you're going to let the rest of the
hair<00:02:12.159> down<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.810> start<00:02:13.810> wrapping<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:14.230> at<00:02:14.349> about

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:14.469 
hair down and start wrapping it at about

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.220 
hair down and start wrapping it at about
the<00:02:14.769> height<00:02:14.950> where<00:02:15.129> that<00:02:15.219> first<00:02:15.459> role<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:15.939> just

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
the height where that first role is just

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.569 
the height where that first role is just
the<00:02:17.230> exact<00:02:17.500> same<00:02:17.680> ways<00:02:17.829> we<00:02:18.069> after<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.340> first

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
the exact same ways we after the first

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.190 
the exact same ways we after the first
time<00:02:18.790> you're<00:02:19.510> going<00:02:19.629> to<00:02:19.689> pull<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.049> right

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
time you're going to pull that right

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.280 
time you're going to pull that right
underneath<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.859> first<00:02:21.129> one<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.989> pin<00:02:22.989> it<00:02:23.079> in

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
underneath that first one and pin it in

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.720 
underneath that first one and pin it in
place<00:02:23.319> again<00:02:23.859> crisscross<00:02:24.310> your<00:02:24.489> bobby<00:02:24.640> pins

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
place again crisscross your bobby pins

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.809 
place again crisscross your bobby pins
it<00:02:25.000> makes<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.329> so<00:02:25.689> so<00:02:26.109> much<00:02:26.290> better<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.819> it

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
it makes it so so much better and it

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.300 
it makes it so so much better and it
just<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:28.390> holds<00:02:28.720> amazingly<00:02:29.170> well<00:02:29.319> then<00:02:29.980> take

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
just is holds amazingly well then take

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.580 
just is holds amazingly well then take
the<00:02:30.459> clips<00:02:30.700> out<00:02:30.909> of<00:02:31.180> your<00:02:31.569> raid<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.049> go<00:02:32.409> ahead

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
the clips out of your raid and go ahead

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.899 
the clips out of your raid and go ahead
and<00:02:32.709> pin<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:32.980> braids<00:02:33.159> in<00:02:33.280> place<00:02:33.519> before<00:02:33.700> you

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
and pin the braids in place before you

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.910 
and pin the braids in place before you
start<00:02:34.180> playing<00:02:34.269> around<00:02:34.510> with<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:34.810> then<00:02:35.769> you

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
start playing around with it then you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.589 
start playing around with it then you
can<00:02:36.069> create<00:02:36.310> little<00:02:36.639> loops<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.239> create<00:02:37.510> the

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
can create little loops to create the

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.000 
can create little loops to create the
shape<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:38.019> want<00:02:38.139> on<00:02:38.500> this<00:02:38.739> side<00:02:38.980> I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
shape that you want on this side I

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.550 
shape that you want on this side I
wanted<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.519> create<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.879> really<00:02:40.359> loose<00:02:40.629> shape<00:02:40.989> so

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
wanted to create a really loose shape so

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.770 
wanted to create a really loose shape so
I<00:02:41.590> made<00:02:41.829> a<00:02:41.859> lot<00:02:42.099> of<00:02:42.129> really<00:02:42.670> loose<00:02:42.939> loops<00:02:43.359> and<00:02:43.689> I

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
I made a lot of really loose loops and I

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.559 
I made a lot of really loose loops and I
kept<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.109> hair<00:02:44.290> really<00:02:44.909> natural<00:02:45.909> and<00:02:46.180> flowy

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
kept the hair really natural and flowy

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.300 
kept the hair really natural and flowy
and<00:02:46.900> you'll<00:02:47.379> see<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.560> difference<00:02:48.010> on<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.189> other

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
and you'll see a difference on the other

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.409 
and you'll see a difference on the other
side<00:02:48.549> because<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.790> actually<00:02:48.849> made<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.209> side<00:02:49.389> a

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:49.419 
side because I actually made that side a

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.089 
side because I actually made that side a
little<00:02:49.569> tighter<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.470> reason<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:50.769> did<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:50.980> was

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
little tighter the reason I did that was

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.830 
little tighter the reason I did that was
because<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.459> wanted<00:02:51.609> more<00:02:51.909> drama<00:02:52.239> on<00:02:52.450> one<00:02:52.659> side

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
because I wanted more drama on one side

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.360 
because I wanted more drama on one side
than<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:52.989> other<00:02:53.109> but<00:02:53.769> if<00:02:53.889> you<00:02:53.980> want<00:02:54.159> you<00:02:54.250> can

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
than the other but if you want you can

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.920 
than the other but if you want you can
make<00:02:54.519> them<00:02:54.669> symmetrical<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.299> do<00:02:55.450> really<00:02:55.720> nice

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
make them symmetrical and do really nice

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.479 
make them symmetrical and do really nice
big<00:02:56.560> natural<00:02:57.189> loops<00:02:57.400> on<00:02:57.579> both<00:02:57.730> sides<00:02:59.489> alright

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
big natural loops on both sides alright

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.740 
big natural loops on both sides alright
so<00:03:00.609> on<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.909> side<00:03:01.150> i'm<00:03:01.389> going<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.599> show<00:03:01.720> you
