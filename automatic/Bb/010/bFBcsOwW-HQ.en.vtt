00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello today we are going to make a colorful 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.990
 eva rubber bracelet 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.480
 [Music] 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.210
 materials that we're going to need a 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.690
 piercing 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.020
 an eva rubber strip 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.800
 a piece of eva rubber of different color 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.710
 scissors marker and glue 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.689
 we start 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.090
 we take the strip that we're going to have to 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.330
 divide in three for that let's mark 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:38.710
 two division points 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:41.290
 [Music] 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:48.700
 with the scissors we cut along 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:52.710
 [Music] 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.710
 trying to cut even 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.250
 and before reaching the end more or less 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.160
 two and a half centimeters we stop 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.129
 cut 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.170
 the last cut 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.780
 [Music] 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.780
 to the same point of the previous cut 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.289
 we have three strips left now let's 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.560
 make a hole with the darkness 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.560
 now 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:29.840
 [Music] 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.840
 in this way 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.440
 and we are going to start making the braid 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:42.399
 it is important to continue with the movement 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.399
 of the strips so that they are matched 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:02:06.140
 all along 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:02:08.569
 [Music] 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.870
 once the braid is finished 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.980
 important to verify the size so that 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.980
 do not be big or small 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.330
 [Music] 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.020
 Now let's stick with two drops of 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.350
 glue 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.990
 the middle strip as to seal and that 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.370
 do not open 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.370
 only with a droplet 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.280
 [Music] 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.030
 and on the other side we seal the same 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.510
 way to ensure that the 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.510
 strips 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.720
 in this way 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:03.940
 [Music] 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.270
 once it's stuck what we're going to 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.420
 do is the center strip 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.870
 cut the bracelet can be 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.170
 just like that or we can add 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.170
 some ornament 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.980
 for the ornament we take a piece of rubber 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.950
 eva of another color and we will double by 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.520
 the center along 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.599
 and we are going to make perpendicular cuts 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.150
 without reaching the end of course 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:36.350
 thus the two ends 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.860
 [Music] 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.190
 A) Yes 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.640
 we are going to try to locate this in the 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.040
 center of the bracelet 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.469
 [Music] 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.540
 slowly so that the rubber does not break 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:51.440
 Eve 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.050
 [Music] 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.770
 first on one side and before reaching the 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.020
 center 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.950
 [Music] 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.950
 the other side 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.669
 ah 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.669
 [Music] 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.210
 in this way 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.670
 Now what we are going to do is cut back 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.260
 the edges to make it a little bit more 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.260
 pretty showed the son 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.560
 always trying not to cut close to 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.669
 the cuts that are already made so that 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.669
 do not break 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.150
 and now what we have left is to write 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.879
 some message or decorate with some 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:50.150
 drawing be for the day of the friend of the 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:53.220
 mother of the father or lovers 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.220
 [Music] 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:56.849
 As you can see, it can be done with 

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:58.739
 many color combinations or without 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.449
 ornaments that is also very beautiful I hope 

00:04:58.739 --> 00:05:02.570
 that you liked it and see you in the 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:05.769
 next tutorial 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.769
