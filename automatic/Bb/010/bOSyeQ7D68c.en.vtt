00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.590
 yes 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.470
 do not 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.460
 ah 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.460
 to 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.770
 hello, people, I'm a clipper and I get a 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.680
 little trick for the 1.8 and it's about 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.290
 a kind of trap is worth it is 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.510
 quite curious that I had idea of ​​this 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.939
 a long time ago but good is enough 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.039
 simple then I'm going to teach you see 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.990
 that chest that there is not the typical chest that 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.400
 you have to go there because this is the view and 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.860
 it seems that there is something important good 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.989
 so let's get closer slowly and 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.640
 let's see what or my god that exists 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.739
 a burrow of little rabbits 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.390
 jumping cocoons that kill us good 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.820
 they are minecraft killer rabbits that already 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.850
 you know in 1.85 I do not know if they see us duckling 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.920
 to kill him there and in the chest there is no 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.140
 nothing and here a burrow we're going to 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.440
 enter and they looked and there is a banjo here 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.860
 that cocoon to kill in austria killed me 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.150
 good macho is a pretty simple trick 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.370
 nothing that I had an idea the other day and of 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.860
 a burrow then let's kill him 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.550
 there and here is the burrow with 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.320
 the head if such 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.810
 and well, it 's quite simple to do the 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.980
 truth, the only thing I want to teach you is 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.860
 let's do this so let's do like this 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.930
 and we are going to do well 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.570
 what I want to teach is the following 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.280
 notice when I approach that the block 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.920
 which is right next to the one that is 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.910
 stuck to the ground it breaks and no two 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.520
 fix rabbits 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.260
 the rabbits and closes again the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.910
 egg is worth then the concept is 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.210
 pretty simple but what I want 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.330
 teach them is the motive the motion that 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.760
 are when I had already taught you 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.190
 see I have it here here the motion bar 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.580
 in the motion it's worth for the mods 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.860
 when they appear they appear jumping not 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.030
 well but here I put here to see 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.970
 I put one you are going to see that it appears 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.520
 jumping like crazy so up 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.380
 then this one appears then jumping 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.899
 much less but good but they appear 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.390
 jumping that's what cool of the motion 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.740
 because we can do as animations 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.630
 then notice here they appear jumping 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.819
 so for the corners it's worth then 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.580
 let's cover is 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.210
 schalke 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.270
 we are going to eliminate them here 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.920
 and when I approach it seems to jump towards 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.960
 this side and towards the other I put two 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.820
 different and the truth is it is a detail 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.020
 to put in a make-up that they serve 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.620
 so that the map has a little more 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.630
 lifetime 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.280
 the theme is to make it more realistic and how 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.110
 they are how realistic it becomes 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.150
 they appear with exposing put 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.180
 that appear from a burrow, not that 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.460
 is an example for good so that you 66 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.710
 that you can do good things can be done 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.320
 he grows me a little more creative more 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.990
 original doing that kind of thing and 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.640
 that's doing another good invention of this 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.950
 style is ok but then I will inform you 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.170
 Ok guys so nothing this is all is 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.000
 a pretty short video of this example 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.550
 ok and nothing I hope you liked and 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.120
 these little girls joined 20 games and 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.640
 added so guys writes and rabbit type 99 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.110
 and we were assuming a good rabbit coming 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.000
 by default this name then I will 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.390
 I changed the name I put a point if you 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.220
 you check here to see if now when I go down 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.510
 there appears a point because I do not 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.300
 I liked that the whole name will appear 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.460
 but hey that is the express loquillo 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.190
 liked guys because nothing guys do not know 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.950
 the cinema 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.310
 and to catch rabbits that always 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.640
 we come here do not look guys it's a mini 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.640
 rabbit
