00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.620
Hi guys, it's Amber.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.500
Yes, I'm laying on the floor.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.090
I had a really long day.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.720
But I'm here to give you my
comments on YouTube's DanceOn

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.730
competition and the
12 contestants.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.940
I'm doing this American
Beauty style with a

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.630
flower in my hair.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.865
I'm weird.

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:19.110
JLovesMac--

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.920
so I thought she did
really good.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.990
She looked really great.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.400
Her makeup was spectacular.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.240
And her outfit was
really cool.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.490
But I think she should have
rocked some really sick high

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.500
heels because that was kind
of like the song name.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.035
And the song was about shoes.

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:36.500
And the lyrics were
about hot shoes.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.430
So I feel like she should
have rocked those heels.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.200
SeaNanners, I thought his
choreography was really cool,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.390
and he had lot of fun with it.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.600
WoodysGamerTag, not too much
dancing, but overall the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.910
acting in his routine
was pretty on point.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.430
And his Running Man
was priceless.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.180
XJawz, I thought that they
did some cool stunts.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.340
It didn't seem like they were
too much in sync throughout

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.950
the whole performance, but
overall I thought he did good.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.570
And it was definitely
an honest effort.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.800
Lana McKissack, she
rocked the boots.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.690
Ah girl, it's not
that easy, huh?

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.675
It's not that easy.

00:01:12.675 --> 00:01:15.230
See, all you people were like,
ah, you didn't dance very

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.500
much-- it's hard to dance in
heels, I'm telling you,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.440
especially if you're
not used to it.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.740
Kingsley bitch, I thought
he did pretty good.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.610
WhatsUpElle, her choreography
was the most choreography I've

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.920
seen in any of the routines.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.030
So overall, I thought she had
a great performance with her

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.660
clones and then Brian being
cloned, that just made for a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.820
really big, great performance.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.690
It was fast, she had
sneakers on.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.300
There was just a lot of moves
in it, a fast Dubstep song.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.620
So overall, I thought
it was really good.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.720
HotForWords--

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.360
balloons, holy crap.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.510
Good Neighbor, I think
that they did great.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.930
Again, the performance was the
group, and I think that just

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.710
makes it so much more
a wow factor.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.490
Plus they had the Dubstep
spotlight.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.120
Ah, that was awesome.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.114
Hannah Hart, again, her song was
called "Stilettos," so I

00:02:06.114 --> 00:02:08.910
think she should have
rocked stilettos.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.090
I don't know, that's
just my opinion.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.860
And then Tay Zonday, I
think his method to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.930
dancing is super funny.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.730
But I have to give him
an E for effort.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.800
My dance, I had a lot
of fun with it.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.720
I remember being in rehearsal
and feeling like it was really

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.270
fast and there was
a lot going on.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.240
And then, I don't know.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.900
I feel like when I got the heels
on, I kind of slowed it

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.380
down just because of my unsure
feeling about dancing in them

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.380
and feeling wobbly, like
I was going to fall

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.480
over, slip and slide.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.510
I had just bought those
shoes the day before.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.390
I want to make it to round two
because next time, I want a

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.690
really fast song.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.550
I want sneakers on, and I'm
going to rock the [BLEEP]

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.550
out of it, I promise you.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.030
So if you didn't go vote, you
guys can vote every day now

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.430
until the 25.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.400
Thumbs up, thumbs down.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.630
And don't forget, it's the
thumbs up on top of the video

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.170
that counts.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.410
Thanks so much for
watching, guys.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.270
Thank you to everyone who's
supporting me so far and

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.320
throughout this whole process.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.070
And I'm honestly going to think
about making it to round

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.700
two and hope that I get the
chance to show you guys

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.280
another routine because this was
super awesome to do, and I

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.440
want to do it again.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.690
Love you guys, bye.
