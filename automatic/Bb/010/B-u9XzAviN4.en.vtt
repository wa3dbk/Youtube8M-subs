00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.960
 go Go 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.650
 markariÃ¡n 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.150
 we are here in this 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.910
 establishment of the manager of 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.700
 establishment that is 8 years old 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.220
 that we are always here since childhood 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.070
 I longed to work as a field hand 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.090
 and when I had the opportunity it was what 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.090
 I started doing it 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.910
 is what it is to do and I like it 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.050
 the field for us all we do not like 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.870
 more than anything I say the activities of 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.270
 field 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.250
 it's the passion one has to live in 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.250
 the field of tranquility 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.040
 bryant had a problemita be born that had 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.310
 a heart attack and had seizures 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.130
 and because of that cells died from it 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.650
 in the brain and then it affected him all 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.100
 the right part the foot and the hand 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.100
 right 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.400
 this does not have 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:48.810
 it does not no lie 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.810
 this so this has a 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.220
 well I took the milk says that if not the 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.270
 school 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.270
 as well 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.040
 of the mine wine 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.040
 if she has been 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.710
 had the little hand then to have the 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.260
 little hand if he could not do many things 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.220
 I could do while he was 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.670
 accommodate the but could not and the skin 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.080
 the little finger in and the and the fist 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.300
 well closed always 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.700
 it was difficult to think of this 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.630
 what he could do when 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.630
 be a little more gral 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.430
 I can not at random there can not be a 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:47.489
 sheep 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.489
 they can not make a cow either 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.780
 and it was growing with that and always with 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.750
 treatment we take it to do 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.330
 physiotherapy come at the time they said 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.480
 that you had to do an operation that 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.849
 they made transposition of tendons 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.650
 after bryant was operated we were called 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.140
 of telethon to go to do the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.569
 rehabilitation and they made us a 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.940
 two-week program in the center 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.030
 telethon of Montevideo and it was a job 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.230
 very good a very nice experience 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.319
 doing the rehabilitation of the 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.800
 operation there until he arrived on the 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:29.360
 center telethon of fray bentos 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.360
 that is where we are going now 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.130
 and telethon in fray bentos favors us 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.080
 a lot because montevideo is pretty 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.870
 much more complicated withdrawal for 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.800
 travel by bus because we had to go 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:55.150
 to stay at the house of neighbors of 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:58.150
 some friends to be able to leave the next day 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.150
 early 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.520
 nevertheless I say being in fray bentos 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.280
 In the car you drive, you drive a lot more 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.730
 easy because it goes well goes and comes one does not 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.430
 He knows a lot, not even then 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.710
 find like half lost in the in 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.560
 montevideo since we are from 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.989
 inside and like the city is not not 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.660
 for us we are used to 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.470
 another kind of life inside in the 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.290
 field more than anything 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.600
 the going to fray bentos becomes more united 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.890
 we enjoy it more we are more 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.890
 calm and go the 3 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.840
 in the tendon 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.410
 of the foot and of the hand all 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.410
 3 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:00.310
 one helps me refers to light 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:05.860
 buttons are small details but that 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:08.650
 could not be helped much and apart 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.970
 what they have taught us to 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.970
 follow it rehabilitating 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:18.099
 they taught us to do exercises for 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:20.409
 so that he could follow this his 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.020
 rehabilitation at home also doing 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:25.009
 exercise 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.430
 all the tasks that we can 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:30.639
 give him to make use of his hand 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.639
 we give 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.820
 but work 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:45.350
 that more influences well put the hand and 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.350
 waters of the little 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.680
 and can perform a lot of work 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:53.600
 like the subject of cutting grass with the 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.990
 pastera those are things that make them very 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.140
 all right 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.390
 and it was noticeable what he what he could 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.520
 enhance and restore the hand after 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.330
 operation and rehabilitation that 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.759
 he gave a telethon 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.350
 that on horseback I could not give how it goes 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:11.730
 now 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.730
 and it 's the most you like 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:18.870
 I would like you to bryant to study that 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:22.930
 he could continue working in the field 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:26.380
 engineering or administrator or things like that 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.970
 that he likes the field when he was a 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.600
 little bit more, I told you it was going to be 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:34.900
 truck driver after change he wanted to be 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.570
 as dad in charge of stay that 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.449
 I have to study hard to follow 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.300
 ahead 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:45.330
 if he wants to study he has to do 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.880
 all those things because I'm not going to go 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.600
 with the 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:54.020
 telethon and has taught us to do the 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.770
 brian life easier 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.270
 The only thing that remains for me is to thank them 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.400
 grateful telethon what he has done for 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.270
 They were there for us 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.810
 and I want you can reach many 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.810
 yes 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.780
 or not 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.130
 and good 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.130
 Clear
