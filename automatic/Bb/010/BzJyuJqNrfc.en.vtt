the backcountry cruise through the park

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.309 
the backcountry cruise through the park
do<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.189> about<00:00:23.400> everything<00:00:23.759> this<00:00:24.480> board<00:00:24.839> will

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:25.319 
do just about everything this board will

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:29.389 
do just about everything this board will
handle<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.829> it's<00:00:26.189> got<00:00:26.689> c2<00:00:27.689> BTX<00:00:28.079> so<00:00:28.979> that<00:00:29.189> is

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:29.399 
handle it it's got c2 BTX so that is

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.339 
handle it it's got c2 BTX so that is
banana<00:00:29.909> between<00:00:30.449> your<00:00:30.569> feet<00:00:30.749> so<00:00:30.989> you've<00:00:31.140> got

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
banana between your feet so you've got

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.710 
banana between your feet so you've got
rocker<00:00:31.919> between<00:00:32.160> your<00:00:32.520> feet<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.820> then<00:00:33.239> camber

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
rocker between your feet and then camber

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.660 
rocker between your feet and then camber
underneath<00:00:34.110> your<00:00:34.350> feet<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:35.160> out<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.580> your

underneath your feet going out to your
contact<00:00:36.240> point<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.200> gonna<00:00:37.320> create<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
contact point this is gonna create a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.740 
contact point this is gonna create a
playful<00:00:38.250> board<00:00:38.430> really<00:00:39.180> easy<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.570> turn

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
playful board really easy to turn

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.120 
playful board really easy to turn
because<00:00:40.200> you've<00:00:40.380> got<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> pressure<00:00:40.860> between

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
because you've got the pressure between

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.580 
because you've got the pressure between
your<00:00:41.460> feet<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:42.090> you've<00:00:42.270> also<00:00:42.480> got<00:00:42.630> tip<00:00:43.110> to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
your feet but you've also got tip to

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.910 
your feet but you've also got tip to
tail<00:00:44.250> stability<00:00:45.030> because<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.020> c2<00:00:46.590> camber

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
tail stability because of that c2 camber

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.270 
tail stability because of that c2 camber
profile<00:00:47.850> you've<00:00:48.360> got<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> hpop<00:00:49.320> camel<00:00:50.040> core

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
profile you've got a hpop camel core

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.690 
profile you've got a hpop camel core
with<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> basalt<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.500> fiberglass<00:00:52.500> combo<00:00:53.400> I

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
with a basalt and fiberglass combo I

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.450 
with a basalt and fiberglass combo I
guess<00:00:54.180> sandwiching<00:00:55.110> inside<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.710> core<00:00:55.890> it's

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
guess sandwiching inside the core it's

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.310 
guess sandwiching inside the core it's
got<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> flex<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.240> about<00:00:57.450> five<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.990> half<00:00:58.050> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
got a flex of about five and a half to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.319 
got a flex of about five and a half to
six<00:00:58.470> and<00:00:58.650> a<00:00:58.680> half<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:58.980> just<00:00:59.130> medium<00:01:00.030> flex

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
six and a half so just medium flex

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.210 
six and a half so just medium flex
depending<00:01:00.540> on<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.260> size<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.650> board<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.100> are

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
depending on the size of board you are

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.780 
depending on the size of board you are
riding<00:01:02.579> couple<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.360> cool<00:01:03.510> things<00:01:03.750> top<00:01:04.170> sheet

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790

riding couple of cool things top sheet
bioplastic<00:01:05.790> beans<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.689> you've<00:01:06.990> got<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> top

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:07.469 
bioplastic beans so you've got a top

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:09.020 
bioplastic beans so you've got a top
sheet<00:01:07.710> plastic<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.609> actually<00:01:08.880> made<00:01:08.999> from

with libtech boards really cool all made

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.300 
with libtech boards really cool all made
in<00:01:21.229> Washington<00:01:22.229> state<00:01:22.469> so<00:01:22.679> just<00:01:22.950> north<00:01:23.159> of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
in Washington state so just north of

eugenia where tactics is and a couple

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.770 
eugenia where tactics is and a couple
other<00:01:25.920> things<00:01:26.210> one<00:01:27.210> thing<00:01:27.329> you'll<00:01:27.420> notice<00:01:27.509> as

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
other things one thing you'll notice as

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.809 
other things one thing you'll notice as
your<00:01:28.200> edge<00:01:28.350> comes<00:01:28.710> up<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.100> lot<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.490> boards<00:01:29.700> will

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
your edge comes up a lot of boards will

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:31.999 
your edge comes up a lot of boards will
have<00:01:29.939> full<00:01:30.179> wrap<00:01:30.389> edges<00:01:30.810> these<00:01:31.439> edges<00:01:31.920> are

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
have full wrap edges these edges are

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.739 
have full wrap edges these edges are
actually<00:01:32.369> tucked<00:01:32.609> in<00:01:32.759> snipped<00:01:33.240> off<00:01:33.389> and<00:01:33.659> it

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:33.749 
actually tucked in snipped off and it

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:36.020 
actually tucked in snipped off and it
reduces<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.319> swing<00:01:34.740> weight<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.310> board<00:01:35.549> so

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
reduces the swing weight of the board so

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.279 
reduces the swing weight of the board so
when<00:01:36.149> you're<00:01:36.270> going<00:01:36.389> to<00:01:36.780> spin<00:01:37.020> off<00:01:37.109> those

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
when you're going to spin off those

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:38.959 
when you're going to spin off those
jumps<00:01:37.590> tips<00:01:38.219> and<00:01:38.399> Tails<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.700> little<00:01:38.880> bit

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
jumps tips and Tails a little bit

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.090 
jumps tips and Tails a little bit
lighter<00:01:39.149> a<00:01:39.270> little<00:01:39.450> bit<00:01:39.659> easier<00:01:39.959> to<00:01:40.259> spin<00:01:40.920> and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
lighter a little bit easier to spin and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.510 
lighter a little bit easier to spin and
then<00:01:41.459> the<00:01:41.520> bottom<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.060> libtech's<00:01:42.990> tnt<00:01:43.950> base

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
then the bottom is libtech's tnt base

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.069 
then the bottom is libtech's tnt base
you're<00:01:44.729> gonna<00:01:44.819> want<00:01:44.999> to<00:01:45.030> keep<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.240> waxed<00:01:45.359> every

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
you're gonna want to keep it waxed every

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.779 
you're gonna want to keep it waxed every
couple<00:01:46.560> times<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.189> what<00:01:47.279> you<00:01:47.369> do<00:01:47.490> with<00:01:47.670> those

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
couple times so what you do with those

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.419 
couple times so what you do with those
kind<00:01:48.029> of<00:01:48.090> bases<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:48.869> it'll<00:01:49.020> be<00:01:49.109> fun<00:01:49.319> and<00:01:49.560> fast

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
kind of bases but it'll be fun and fast

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.690 
kind of bases but it'll be fun and fast
and<00:01:50.789> that<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.719> the<00:01:52.079> Phoenix<00:01:52.469> Jamie<00:01:52.740> c2<00:01:53.490> BTX
