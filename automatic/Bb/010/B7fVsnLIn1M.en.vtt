now<00:01:26.790> I'm<00:01:26.880> what<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> Gold<00:01:27.299> Cups<00:01:27.509> all<00:01:27.689> around

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
now I'm what the Gold Cups all around

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.260 
now I'm what the Gold Cups all around
and<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.320> think<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> lot<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.700> us<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:29.970> believe

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
and I think like a lot of us we believe

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
and I think like a lot of us we believe
that<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> Gold<00:01:30.750> Cup<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.290> decent<00:01:32.070> place<00:01:32.250> isn't

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
that the Gold Cup a decent place isn't

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.160 
that the Gold Cup a decent place isn't
really<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> 3-mile<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.360> race<00:01:33.540> at<00:01:33.720> all<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.020> more

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
really a 3-mile to race at all it's more

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.569 
really a 3-mile to race at all it's more
like<00:01:34.320> three<00:01:34.500> mile<00:01:34.770> three<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> quarter<00:01:35.310> at

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
like three mile three and a quarter at

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.679 
like three mile three and a quarter at
least<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.200> if<00:01:37.200> Kato<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.860> truly<00:01:38.070> stay<00:01:38.369> that

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
least and if Kato can truly stay that

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.660 
least and if Kato can truly stay that
then<00:01:39.689> he's<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.770> best<00:01:40.950> I've<00:01:41.100> ever<00:01:41.159> seen<00:01:41.460> so

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
then he's the best I've ever seen so

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.880 
then he's the best I've ever seen so
really<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.659> no-lose<00:01:42.840> situation<00:01:43.049> for<00:01:43.799> me

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
really it's a no-lose situation for me

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.289 
really it's a no-lose situation for me
whereas<00:01:44.130> last<00:01:44.310> year<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.700> Sun<00:01:44.880> Alliance<00:01:45.090> of

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
whereas last year in the Sun Alliance of

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.429 
whereas last year in the Sun Alliance of
course<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.630> was<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.780> lot<00:01:45.869> more<00:01:45.930> pressure<00:01:46.290> and

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
course it was a lot more pressure and

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.520 
course it was a lot more pressure and
and<00:01:46.759> I<00:01:47.759> didn't<00:01:48.360> really<00:01:48.509> enjoy<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.780> think<00:01:49.439> I'll

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
and I didn't really enjoy I think I'll

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.929 
and I didn't really enjoy I think I'll
enjoy<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.829> more<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.130> year<00:01:50.189> all<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.729> want<00:01:50.880> to

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.389 
we're about a week away now from the big
race<00:01:54.450> how<00:01:55.079> will<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> nerves<00:01:55.710> sketchy<00:01:56.100> do<00:01:56.340> you

think<00:01:56.579> oh<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.850> obviously<00:01:57.090> it's<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> question

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
think oh and obviously it's a question

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.670 
think oh and obviously it's a question
you<00:01:57.689> probably<00:01:57.869> can't<00:01:58.259> answer<00:01:58.350> because<00:01:58.530> you

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
you probably can't answer because you

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.289 
you probably can't answer because you

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
we get a good view out of the longbow a

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.850 
we get a good view out of the longbow a
bit<00:02:14.510> wide<00:02:14.690> this<00:02:14.870> ship<00:02:15.050> is<00:02:15.170> gonna<00:02:15.350> be<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:15.680> many

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
bit wide this ship is gonna be so many

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.990 
bit wide this ship is gonna be so many
people<00:02:15.920> then<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.520> know<00:02:16.610> what<00:02:16.700> it's<00:02:16.820> like<00:02:16.880> on

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
people then you know what it's like on

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.400 
people then you know what it's like on
the<00:02:17.150> Friday<00:02:17.420> when<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:17.690> gets<00:02:17.840> really<00:02:17.990> packed<00:02:18.290> in

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
the Friday when it gets really packed in

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.770 
the Friday when it gets really packed in
the<00:02:18.470> Gold<00:02:18.680> Cup<00:02:19.330> hoping<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.390> get<00:02:20.510> advantage

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
the Gold Cup hoping to get advantage

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.940 
the Gold Cup hoping to get advantage
pulling<00:02:21.140> out<00:02:21.230> there<00:02:21.380> I'll<00:02:21.440> definitely<00:02:21.830> won't

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
pulling out there I'll definitely won't

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.070 
pulling out there I'll definitely won't
watch<00:02:22.070> it<00:02:22.100> beyond<00:02:22.460> glass<00:02:22.700> anywhere<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.990> will

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
watch it beyond glass anywhere it will

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.460 
watch it beyond glass anywhere it will
be<00:02:24.140> on<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.980> eye<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.720> it's<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.810> good<00:02:26.960> big<00:02:27.140> screen

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
be on the eye and it's a good big screen

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.800 
be on the eye and it's a good big screen
I<00:02:27.940> think<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.000> race<00:02:29.150> will<00:02:29.270> be<00:02:29.330> quite<00:02:29.540> easy<00:02:29.720> to

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
I think the race will be quite easy to

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.850 
I think the race will be quite easy to
follow<00:02:30.050> though<00:02:30.260> because<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.530> think<00:02:30.590> well<00:02:30.830> you

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
follow though because I think well you

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.560 
follow though because I think well you
know<00:02:30.920> they'll<00:02:31.250> be<00:02:31.280> they'll<00:02:31.940> be<00:02:32.120> easy<00:02:32.240> to<00:02:32.390> track

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
know they'll be they'll be easy to track

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.470 
know they'll be they'll be easy to track
the<00:02:32.690> pair<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:33.050> them<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:34.120> yeah<00:02:35.120> that's<00:02:35.330> what<00:02:35.450> I

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
the pair of them and yeah that's what I

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.940 
the pair of them and yeah that's what I
hope<00:02:35.660> out<00:02:35.900> for<00:02:36.110> hopefully<00:02:36.470> out<00:02:36.590> on<00:02:36.710> the<00:02:36.800> lawn

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
hope out for hopefully out on the lawn

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.130 
hope out for hopefully out on the lawn
but<00:02:37.640> Milo<00:02:38.300> imagine<00:02:38.630> they'll<00:02:38.750> be<00:02:38.780> pressed

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
but Milo imagine they'll be pressed

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.400 
but Milo imagine they'll be pressed
there<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:39.620> might<00:02:39.860> say<00:02:40.840> I'm<00:02:41.840> certainly<00:02:42.230> play

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
there and might say I'm certainly play

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.340 
there and might say I'm certainly play
for<00:02:42.700> pi<00:02:43.700> X<00:02:43.880> that<00:02:44.030> have<00:02:44.120> been<00:02:44.240> a<00:02:44.270> good<00:02:44.480> but<00:02:44.660> in<00:02:45.200> my

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
for pi X that have been a good but in my

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.810 
for pi X that have been a good but in my
own<00:02:45.380> little<00:02:45.590> pitch<00:02:46.070> they<00:02:46.250> know<00:02:46.490> where<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:46.700> was

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
own little pitch they know where I was

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.460 
own little pitch they know where I was
but<00:02:47.090> it'll<00:02:47.570> be<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:47.690> scrum<00:02:47.960> he's<00:02:48.110> like<00:02:48.200> everyone

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.480 
well I think I don't think it's I don't
think<00:03:00.260> either<00:03:00.410> way<00:03:00.710> it's<00:03:00.860> great<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:01.220> running

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.860 
think either way it's great and running
play<00:03:01.670> because<00:03:01.880> I<00:03:01.940> think<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.270> race<00:03:02.420> all<00:03:02.630> comes

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
play because I think the race all comes

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.810 
play because I think the race all comes
down<00:03:02.930> at<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:03.260> one<00:03:03.440> second<00:03:03.950> often<00:03:04.670> there'll

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
down at that one second often there'll

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.100 
down at that one second often there'll
be<00:03:04.850> some<00:03:05.120> stage<00:03:05.390> from<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.750> top<00:03:05.930> of<00:03:06.050> the

alderman who come down it in front and

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.570 
alderman who come down it in front and

Cato will come at him at some stage you

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.710 
Cato will come at him at some stage you
know<00:03:11.030> between<00:03:13.060> halfway<00:03:14.060> between<00:03:14.210> the<00:03:14.510> third

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
know between halfway between the third

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.010 
last in the second last and the last I

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
believe that's where it will challenge

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.360 
believe that's where it will challenge
he<00:03:18.020> could<00:03:18.200> wait<00:03:18.380> longer<00:03:18.620> Ruby<00:03:18.950> but<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.160> think

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
he could wait longer Ruby but I think

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.420 
he could wait longer Ruby but I think
Ruby<00:03:19.610> will<00:03:20.390> probably<00:03:20.710> be<00:03:21.710> closer<00:03:21.980> than<00:03:22.130> people

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
Ruby will probably be closer than people

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.800 
Ruby will probably be closer than people
think<00:03:22.610> early<00:03:22.940> on<00:03:22.970> in<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.180> race<00:03:23.300> I<00:03:23.540> believe

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
think early on in the race I believe

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.230 
think early on in the race I believe
whatever<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.800> pace<00:03:24.980> turns<00:03:25.280> out<00:03:25.550> but<00:03:26.060> that's

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
whatever the pace turns out but that's

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.220 
whatever the pace turns out but that's
what<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.480> whole<00:03:26.600> thing<00:03:26.840> whatever<00:03:26.990> he

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
what the whole thing whatever he

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.110 
what the whole thing whatever he
challenges<00:03:27.770> him<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:28.070> think<00:03:28.670> we'll<00:03:28.760> all<00:03:28.850> know<00:03:29.000> in

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
challenges him I think we'll all know in

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.730 
challenges him I think we'll all know in
a<00:03:29.210> split<00:03:29.450> second<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:29.870> winner<00:03:30.110> I<00:03:30.260> think<00:03:30.530> plates

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
a split second the winner I think plates

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.210 
a split second the winner I think plates
are<00:03:30.890> either<00:03:31.100> out<00:03:31.670> speed<00:03:32.090> him<00:03:32.270> and<00:03:32.390> stay<00:03:32.630> or<00:03:33.220> get

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
are either out speed him and stay or get

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.470 
are either out speed him and stay or get
in<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.370> battle<00:03:34.580> and<00:03:34.820> I<00:03:34.880> think<00:03:35.090> Denman<00:03:35.390> will

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
in the battle and I think Denman will

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.360 
in the battle and I think Denman will
automatically<00:03:36.050> win<00:03:36.200> it<00:03:36.590> comes<00:03:36.770> to<00:03:36.920> a<00:03:36.950> battle

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
automatically win it comes to a battle

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.160 
automatically win it comes to a battle

favorites in the big race no I think

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.330 
favorites in the big race no I think
I'll<00:04:56.780> have<00:04:56.870> to<00:04:56.990> pretend<00:04:57.410> to<00:04:57.710> be<00:04:57.860> favorite

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
enough to become really really really

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.900 
enough to become really really really
soft<00:05:00.920> I<00:05:01.100> think<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.430> I<00:05:01.460> don't<00:05:01.520> think<00:05:01.730> that<00:05:01.820> will

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
soft I think and I don't think that will

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.060 
soft I think and I don't think that will
happen<00:05:01.970> I<00:05:02.240> think<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:03.380> weather<00:05:03.560> forecast<00:05:03.950> is

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
happen I think the weather forecast is

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.620 
happen I think the weather forecast is
changeable<00:05:04.490> but<00:05:04.700> the<00:05:04.790> drainage<00:05:05.150> is<00:05:05.270> so<00:05:05.450> good

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
changeable but the drainage is so good

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.910 
changeable but the drainage is so good
at<00:05:05.720> show<00:05:05.870> and<00:05:06.080> I'll<00:05:06.170> see<00:05:06.380> the<00:05:06.410> ground<00:05:06.710> being

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
at show and I'll see the ground being

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.320 
at show and I'll see the ground being
good<00:05:07.220> good<00:05:07.430> you<00:05:07.640> know<00:05:07.730> good<00:05:07.760> too<00:05:08.120> soft
