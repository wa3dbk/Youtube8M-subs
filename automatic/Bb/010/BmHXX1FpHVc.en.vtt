mean this is my favorite ball because in

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.330 
mean this is my favorite ball because in
college<00:02:00.420> when<00:02:00.720> I<00:02:00.750> used<00:02:01.050> to<00:02:01.170> here<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.530> hit<00:02:02.310> it

and bounce it over the court back again

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.810 
and bounce it over the court back again
because<00:02:04.800> you<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.040> bounce<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.490> ball<00:02:05.550> like
