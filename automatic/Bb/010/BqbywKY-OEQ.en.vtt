navigation<00:02:33.519> so<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.360> Romo<00:02:34.660> can<00:02:34.870> get<00:02:35.049> around

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
navigation so the Romo can get around

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.050 
navigation so the Romo can get around
the<00:02:35.440> house<00:02:35.650> by<00:02:36.099> himself<00:02:36.489> without<00:02:36.700> bumping

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
the house by himself without bumping

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.240 
the house by himself without bumping
into<00:02:37.360> things<00:02:37.450> face<00:02:38.230> recognition<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:39.220> that

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
into things face recognition so that

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.740 
into things face recognition so that
Romo<00:02:39.580> can<00:02:39.730> have<00:02:39.819> a<00:02:39.879> different<00:02:40.269> relationship

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
Romo can have a different relationship

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.780 
Romo can have a different relationship
with<00:02:41.260> each<00:02:41.410> person<00:02:41.860> in<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.130> house<00:02:42.310> and

with each person in the house and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.729 
with each person in the house and
graphical<00:02:43.330> programming<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.049> people<00:02:44.380> with<00:02:44.560> no

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
graphical programming so people with no

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.470 
graphical programming so people with no
technical<00:02:45.099> background<00:02:45.220> can<00:02:46.090> create<00:02:46.360> their

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
technical background can create their

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.390 
technical background can create their
own<00:02:46.510> custom<00:02:46.930> behaviors<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.860> personalities

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
put into a $150 robot even cooler we're

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.580 
put into a $150 robot even cooler we're
building<00:02:55.209> an<00:02:55.269> API<00:02:55.420> around<00:02:56.140> each<00:02:56.319> of<00:02:56.470> those

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
building an API around each of those

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.289 
building an API around each of those
functionalities<00:02:57.069> so<00:02:57.489> that<00:02:57.610> any<00:02:57.849> developer
