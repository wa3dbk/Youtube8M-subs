00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.280 
creepy is de phrasing the tree was
created<00:02:26.350> because<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.490> CGI<00:02:28.000> just<00:02:28.750> didn't<00:02:29.050> give

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
created because the CGI just didn't give

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.620 
created because the CGI just didn't give
it<00:02:29.410> enough<00:02:29.650> realism<00:02:30.460> and<00:02:30.610> by<00:02:31.060> having<00:02:31.330> those

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
it enough realism and by having those

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.260 
it enough realism and by having those
dead<00:02:31.990> bodies<00:02:32.230> strewn<00:02:33.100> on<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.670> tree<00:02:33.970> the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
dead bodies strewn on the tree the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.450 
dead bodies strewn on the tree the
impact<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.140> audience<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:35.980> something<00:02:36.370> that

impact of the audience is something that

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.730 
impact of the audience is something that

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
pieces and I think this might be a good

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.719 
pieces and I think this might be a good
opportunity<00:04:26.260> to<00:04:26.740> get<00:04:26.860> in<00:04:26.979> to<00:04:27.070> consign<00:04:27.400> some

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
opportunity to get in to consign some

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.460 
opportunity to get in to consign some
things<00:04:27.940> because<00:04:28.150> he's<00:04:28.419> got<00:04:28.449> so<00:04:28.930> much<00:04:29.139> great

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
things because he's got so much great

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.820 
things because he's got so much great
stuff<00:04:29.500> but<00:04:30.430> will<00:04:31.300> he<00:04:31.419> sell<00:04:31.660> something<00:04:32.199> I<00:04:32.410> think

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
stuff but will he sell something I think

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.170 
stuff but will he sell something I think
this<00:04:32.979> could<00:04:33.100> easily<00:04:33.340> do<00:04:33.610> four<00:04:33.880> to<00:04:33.970> six

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
this could easily do four to six

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.939 
this could easily do four to six
thousand<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:34.900> maybe<00:04:35.080> more<00:04:35.380> I<00:04:35.440> mean<00:04:35.650> this<00:04:35.740> is

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
thousand and maybe more I mean this is

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.629 
thousand and maybe more I mean this is

a lot of Dark Crystal stuff we have a

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.609 
a lot of Dark Crystal stuff we have a
lot<00:04:51.789> of<00:04:51.819> collectors<00:04:52.389> that<00:04:52.569> would<00:04:52.629> definitely

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:53.619 
lot of collectors that would definitely

00:04:53.619 --> 00:05:00.260 
lot of collectors that would definitely
go<00:04:53.830> after<00:04:54.189> it<00:04:54.309> right

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.850

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
be that's a that's a tough one so

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.150 
be that's a that's a tough one so
recognizable<00:05:08.080> right

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
recognizable right

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.780 
recognizable right
