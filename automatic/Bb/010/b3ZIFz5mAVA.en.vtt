commentary and generally a lot of
complaining<00:00:36.630> about<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.860> areas<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.790> game

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
complaining about the areas in the game

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.690 
complaining about the areas in the game
that<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.570> are<00:00:39.690> currently<00:00:39.870> exploring<00:00:40.700> anyway

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
that we are currently exploring anyway

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.380 
that we are currently exploring anyway
this<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.940> an<00:00:42.149> early<00:00:42.809> early<00:00:43.620> game<00:00:43.920> area<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.090> I

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
this is an early early game area so I I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.180 
this is an early early game area so I I
can't<00:00:45.719> really<00:00:45.899> fault<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.379> too<00:00:46.590> much<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:47.039> being

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
can't really fault it too much for being

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.340 
can't really fault it too much for being
somewhat<00:00:47.520> generic<00:00:47.750> they<00:00:48.750> don't<00:00:48.899> want<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.110> pull

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
somewhat generic they don't want to pull

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.700 
somewhat generic they don't want to pull
out<00:00:49.469> all<00:00:49.620> their<00:00:49.770> big<00:00:49.950> guns<00:00:50.160> at<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.550> beginning

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
out all their big guns at the beginning

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.740 
out all their big guns at the beginning
but<00:00:52.710> basically<00:00:53.430> there<00:00:53.610> are<00:00:53.640> two<00:00:53.789> main<00:00:54.390> routes

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
but basically there are two main routes

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.500 
but basically there are two main routes
to<00:00:55.079> go<00:00:55.199> through<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.770> route<00:00:56.120> there<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
to go through in this route there is the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.420 
to go through in this route there is the
grassy<00:00:58.260> route<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.739> then<00:00:58.890> there's<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
grassy route and then there's the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.990 
grassy route and then there's the
boardwalk<00:01:00.090> route<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:01.609> you<00:01:02.609> can<00:01:02.640> either<00:01:02.789> go

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
boardwalk route and you can either go

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.609 
boardwalk route and you can either go
the<00:01:03.120> grassy<00:01:03.420> right<00:01:03.629> run<00:01:03.780> into<00:01:03.960> wild<00:01:04.199> Pokemon

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
the grassy right run into wild Pokemon

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.350 
the grassy right run into wild Pokemon
maybe<00:01:05.159> get<00:01:05.309> some<00:01:05.460> experience<00:01:05.880> maybe<00:01:06.000> catch<00:01:06.270> a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
maybe get some experience maybe catch a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.420 
maybe get some experience maybe catch a
few<00:01:06.570> or<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.650> go<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> boardwalk<00:01:08.159> route

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
few or you can go the boardwalk route

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.399 
few or you can go the boardwalk route
and<00:01:08.700> basically<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.270> run<00:01:09.510> into<00:01:09.659> anything<00:01:10.140> if

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
and basically not run into anything if

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.440 
and basically not run into anything if
you<00:01:10.619> are<00:01:10.799> timid<00:01:11.369> or<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:12.150> don't<00:01:12.210> want<00:01:12.390> to

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
you are timid or just don't want to

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.440 
you are timid or just don't want to
waste<00:01:12.600> your<00:01:12.659> time<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.729> I<00:01:14.729> kind<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.299> that

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
waste your time and I kind of like that

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.950 
waste your time and I kind of like that
and<00:01:16.820> it's<00:01:17.820> kind<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.090> an<00:01:18.210> idea<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.630> they<00:01:18.720> used

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
and it's kind of an idea that they used

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.440 
and it's kind of an idea that they used
in<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.470> rather<00:01:20.220> similar<00:01:20.610> route<00:01:20.759> route<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.270> think

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
in a rather similar route route I think

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.080 
in a rather similar route route I think
-<00:01:21.570> -<00:01:21.750> -<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.830> demonym<00:01:23.189> pearl<00:01:23.369> which<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:23.939> should

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
- - - in demonym pearl which I should

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.179 
- - - in demonym pearl which I should
remember<00:01:24.270> more<00:01:24.540> clearly<00:01:24.780> than<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.619> because

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
remember more clearly than I do because

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.539 
remember more clearly than I do because
I<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.640> did<00:01:26.790> commentary<00:01:27.210> for<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:28.460> but<00:01:29.460> yeah

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
I just did commentary for it but yeah

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.010 
I just did commentary for it but yeah
two<00:01:29.790> different<00:01:30.060> routes<00:01:30.180> two<00:01:30.720> different

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
two different routes two different

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.039 
two different routes two different
opportunities<00:01:31.860> possibilities<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.900> can

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
opportunities possibilities and you can

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.450 
opportunities possibilities and you can
do<00:01:34.560> both<00:01:34.590> routes<00:01:34.950> if<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.189> want<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
do both routes if you want the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.910 
do both routes if you want the
experience<00:01:35.970> or<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.270> one<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:37.439> completely

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
experience or just one it's completely

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.749 
experience or just one it's completely
up<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:39.799> other<00:01:40.799> than<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.340> kind<00:01:41.670> of

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
up to you and other than that is kind of

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.940

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
I'm not putting in the original music

I'm not putting in the original music
from<00:02:31.350> gold<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:31.920> silver<00:02:32.220> I'm<00:02:32.310> actually

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
from gold and silver I'm actually

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.450 
from gold and silver I'm actually
putting<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.810> remixes<00:02:34.560> from<00:02:35.190> their

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
putting in the remixes from their

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.040 
putting in the remixes from their
remakes<00:02:35.790> art<00:02:36.030> golden<00:02:36.300> soul<00:02:36.450> silver<00:02:36.630> which<00:02:36.900> I

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
remakes art golden soul silver which I

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.440 
remakes art golden soul silver which I
was<00:02:37.200> not<00:02:37.350> aware<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.970> at<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.090> time<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.390> this

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
was not aware of at the time of this

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.610 
was not aware of at the time of this
series<00:02:39.750> because<00:02:39.900> they<00:02:40.200> had<00:02:40.320> not<00:02:40.440> been

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
series because they had not been

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.290 
series because they had not been
announced<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:41.040> think<00:02:41.220> this<00:02:41.370> is<00:02:41.520> still<00:02:42.060> before

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
announced I think this is still before

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.080 
announced I think this is still before
platinum<00:02:42.780> was<00:02:42.900> even<00:02:43.110> announced<00:02:43.610> so<00:02:44.610> maybe<00:02:45.030> I

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
platinum was even announced so maybe I

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.660 
platinum was even announced so maybe I
can<00:02:45.300> shed<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.080> little<00:02:46.290> insight<00:02:46.680> about<00:02:46.860> how<00:02:47.280> they

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
can shed a little insight about how they

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.580 
can shed a little insight about how they
updated<00:02:48.060> or<00:02:48.270> did<00:02:48.480> not<00:02:48.630> update<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.200> games<00:02:49.380> for

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
updated or did not update the games for

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.930 
updated or did not update the games for
our<00:02:49.740> golden<00:02:50.040> sands<00:02:50.190> ever<00:02:51.380> for<00:02:52.380> these<00:02:52.500> routes

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
our golden sands ever for these routes

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.850 
our golden sands ever for these routes
other<00:02:53.940> than<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.300> remix<00:02:54.540> is<00:02:54.780> not<00:02:55.350> much<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.830> be

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
other than the remix is not much to be

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.200 
other than the remix is not much to be
honest<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:57.000> believe<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.350> Indian<00:02:58.560> cave<00:02:59.210> changed

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
honest I believe the Indian cave changed

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.210 
honest I believe the Indian cave changed
this<00:03:00.300> layout<00:03:00.720> slightly<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.650> think<00:03:01.950> there's<00:03:02.160> a

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
this layout slightly I think there's a

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.080 
this layout slightly I think there's a
little<00:03:02.340> bit<00:03:02.550> up<00:03:02.910> north<00:03:03.860> or<00:03:04.860> up<00:03:05.490> on<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.820> screen

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
little bit up north or up on the screen

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.250 
little bit up north or up on the screen
I<00:03:06.240> don't<00:03:06.360> know<00:03:06.450> if<00:03:06.510> it's<00:03:06.630> actually<00:03:06.990> north

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
I don't know if it's actually north

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.630 
I don't know if it's actually north
inside<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.710> cave<00:03:09.350> but<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.560> get<00:03:11.160> down<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.550> the

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
inside the cave but you get down to the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.290 
inside the cave but you get down to the
lower<00:03:11.790> levels<00:03:12.270> of<00:03:12.480> Union<00:03:12.900> cave<00:03:13.110> from

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
lower levels of Union cave from

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.750 
lower levels of Union cave from
different<00:03:15.300> areas<00:03:15.630> on<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.260> floor<00:03:16.580> but<00:03:17.580> it's

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
different areas on the floor but it's

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.900 
different areas on the floor but it's
still<00:03:18.060> relatively<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.930> same<00:03:19.110> cave<00:03:19.790> what<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:20.820> do

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
still relatively the same cave what I do

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.180 
still relatively the same cave what I do
it<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.209> do<00:03:21.270> like<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:21.660> there's<00:03:22.080> updating<00:03:22.950> sides

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
it I do like that there's updating sides

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.190 
it I do like that there's updating sides
even<00:03:23.520> if<00:03:23.610> they<00:03:23.700> didn't<00:03:23.940> really<00:03:24.510> need<00:03:24.840> to

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
even if they didn't really need to

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.509 
even if they didn't really need to
that<00:03:26.830> great<00:03:27.040> ball<00:03:27.220> plenty<00:03:28.180> of<00:03:28.239> items<00:03:28.569> I<00:03:29.400> mean<00:03:30.400> I

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
that great ball plenty of items I mean I

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.190 
that great ball plenty of items I mean I
like<00:03:30.879> this<00:03:31.000> cave<00:03:31.239> because<00:03:31.690> it<00:03:31.930> is<00:03:32.019> fairly

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
like this cave because it is fairly

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.930 
like this cave because it is fairly
leaner<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.769> get<00:03:32.920> through<00:03:33.190> but<00:03:33.430> there<00:03:33.760> plenty

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
leaner to get through but there plenty

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.330 
leaner to get through but there plenty
of<00:03:34.090> branching<00:03:34.480> paths<00:03:34.720> that<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.680> can<00:03:35.860> get

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
of branching paths that you can get

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.369 
of branching paths that you can get
items<00:03:36.640> on<00:03:38.849> that's<00:03:39.849> I<00:03:40.060> think<00:03:40.629> that's<00:03:40.840> decent

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
items on that's I think that's decent

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.220 
items on that's I think that's decent
design<00:03:42.239> again<00:03:43.239> if<00:03:43.390> you<00:03:43.480> if<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:43.750> want<00:03:43.989> to<00:03:44.110> go

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
design again if you if you want to go

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.839 
design again if you if you want to go
and<00:03:44.410> get<00:03:44.530> something<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:44.890> were<00:03:45.130> free<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.459> do<00:03:45.610> so

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
and get something you were free to do so

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.940 
and get something you were free to do so
but<00:03:46.090> it's<00:03:46.870> neither<00:03:47.050> too<00:03:47.349> much<00:03:47.380> of<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.680> pain<00:03:47.830> in

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
but it's neither too much of a pain in

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.800 
but it's neither too much of a pain in
the<00:03:47.980> ass<00:03:48.160> but<00:03:48.880> they<00:03:49.300> don't<00:03:49.480> just<00:03:49.630> throw

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
the ass but they don't just throw

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.960 
the ass but they don't just throw
everything<00:03:50.050> at<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:50.730> from<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.790> very

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
everything at you from the very

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.110 
everything at you from the very
