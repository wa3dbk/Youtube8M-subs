00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
because when I'm doing

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.650 
because when I'm doing
is<00:00:18.680> trying<00:00:19.460> to<00:00:19.580> figure<00:00:19.910> out<00:00:19.970> we've<00:00:20.449> been

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
is trying to figure out we've been

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.720 
is trying to figure out we've been
looking<00:00:21.170> at<00:00:21.260> a<00:00:21.289> lot<00:00:21.380> of<00:00:21.529> our<00:00:21.740> coffee<00:00:21.980> under<00:00:22.369> UV

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
looking at a lot of our coffee under UV

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.570 
looking at a lot of our coffee under UV
a<00:00:23.029> lot<00:00:23.390> of<00:00:23.480> people<00:00:23.750> do<00:00:23.900> that<00:00:24.400> then<00:00:25.400> we've<00:00:25.550> been

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
a lot of people do that then we've been

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.210 
a lot of people do that then we've been
trying<00:00:25.880> to<00:00:25.970> determine<00:00:26.710> why<00:00:27.710> we<00:00:27.980> have

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
trying to determine why we have

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.240 
trying to determine why we have
luminescence<00:00:29.029> coffee<00:00:29.960> beans<00:00:30.289> and<00:00:30.590> we<00:00:30.980> know<00:00:31.099> it

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
luminescence coffee beans and we know it

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.400 
luminescence coffee beans and we know it
has<00:00:31.400> to<00:00:31.640> do<00:00:31.759> is<00:00:31.939> bad<00:00:32.239> fermentation<00:00:33.110> and

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
has to do is bad fermentation and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.369 
has to do is bad fermentation and
possibly<00:00:33.920> with<00:00:34.160> bacteria<00:00:34.879> it<00:00:35.720> does<00:00:35.960> not<00:00:36.110> have

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
possibly with bacteria it does not have

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.829 
possibly with bacteria it does not have
to<00:00:36.530> do<00:00:36.710> with<00:00:36.980> ripeness<00:00:37.430> it<00:00:38.089> does<00:00:38.269> not<00:00:38.449> have<00:00:38.660> to

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:38.839 
to do with ripeness it does not have to

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.160 
to do with ripeness it does not have to
do<00:00:39.019> with<00:00:39.550> a<00:00:40.550> lot<00:00:41.000> of<00:00:41.089> other<00:00:41.239> physical<00:00:41.629> defects

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
do with a lot of other physical defects

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.700 
do with a lot of other physical defects
like<00:00:42.260> black<00:00:42.589> beans<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.250> stuff<00:00:43.430> but<00:00:44.500> so<00:00:45.500> what

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
like black beans and stuff but so what

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.470 
like black beans and stuff but so what
I've<00:00:45.829> done<00:00:46.010> here<00:00:46.339> is<00:00:46.489> I<00:00:46.610> found<00:00:46.850> this<00:00:47.000> sample<00:00:47.390> of

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
I've done here is I found this sample of

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.420 
I've done here is I found this sample of
Brazil<00:00:47.870> hold<00:00:48.260> on<00:00:48.409> I'm<00:00:48.620> gonna<00:00:48.739> turn<00:00:49.250> on<00:00:49.339> my

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
Brazil hold on I'm gonna turn on my

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.090 
Brazil hold on I'm gonna turn on my
light<00:00:49.579> so<00:00:49.760> this<00:00:49.909> is<00:00:50.089> my<00:00:50.239> UV<00:00:50.629> flashlight<00:00:51.199> mmm

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
light so this is my UV flashlight mmm

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.760 
light so this is my UV flashlight mmm
you<00:00:52.640> can<00:00:52.670> get<00:00:52.820> these<00:00:52.969> really<00:00:53.180> cheap<00:00:53.559> let's<00:00:54.559> try

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
you can get these really cheap let's try

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.680 
you can get these really cheap let's try
to<00:00:54.829> dim<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.100> lights<00:00:55.430> a<00:00:55.610> little<00:00:55.640> and<00:00:56.359> look<00:00:56.539> at

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
to dim the lights a little and look at

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.069 
to dim the lights a little and look at
this<00:00:56.899> I<00:00:57.670> got<00:00:58.670> a<00:00:58.699> sample<00:00:59.000> of<00:00:59.300> a<00:00:59.420> Brazil<00:00:59.840> coffee

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
this I got a sample of a Brazil coffee

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.540 
this I got a sample of a Brazil coffee
and<00:01:00.320> it<00:01:00.379> won't<00:01:00.530> tell<00:01:00.739> you<00:01:00.890> who<00:01:01.070> it's<00:01:01.219> from

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
and it won't tell you who it's from

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.060 
and it won't tell you who it's from
but

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
but

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.240 
but
this<00:01:04.640> sample<00:01:05.000> here<00:01:05.570> I've<00:01:05.810> sorted<00:01:06.470> out<00:01:06.620> and<00:01:07.040> it

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
this sample here I've sorted out and it

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.280 
this sample here I've sorted out and it
should<00:01:07.490> represent<00:01:07.729> good<00:01:08.420> coffee<00:01:08.750> more<00:01:09.200> or

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
should represent good coffee more or

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.520 
should represent good coffee more or
less<00:01:09.550> this<00:01:10.550> sample<00:01:11.060> here<00:01:11.479> I've<00:01:11.720> stacked<00:01:12.200> it

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
less this sample here I've stacked it

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.740 
less this sample here I've stacked it
with<00:01:12.680> everything<00:01:13.100> that<00:01:13.340> glowed<00:01:13.940> in<00:01:14.510> the

with everything that glowed in the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.140 
with everything that glowed in the
sample<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:15.440> knew<00:01:16.100> I<00:01:16.130> wasn't<00:01:16.430> gonna<00:01:16.580> touch<00:01:16.910> this

a little UV flashlight nonetheless you
know<00:01:23.570> we're<00:01:23.869> seeing<00:01:24.140> physical<00:01:24.800> defects<00:01:25.430> under

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
know we're seeing physical defects under

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.730 
know we're seeing physical defects under
UV<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:26.780> we're<00:01:26.869> trying<00:01:27.080> to<00:01:27.170> determine<00:01:27.440> what

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
UV and we're trying to determine what

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.570 
UV and we're trying to determine what
they<00:01:27.860> are<00:01:29.380> like<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.560> said<00:01:30.770> it<00:01:30.950> has<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.130> do<00:01:31.400> with

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
they are like I said it has to do with

normal<00:01:34.220> light<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:34.670> there

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540

difficult to tell apart I mean we know

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.430 
difficult to tell apart I mean we know
it<00:01:38.330> has<00:01:38.480> I<00:01:38.690> know<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:38.990> has<00:01:39.110> to<00:01:39.260> do<00:01:39.380> with

there<00:02:04.729> were<00:02:04.880> probably<00:02:05.119> more<00:02:05.509> poorest<00:02:06.079> I<00:02:06.439> doubt

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
there were probably more poorest I doubt

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.219 
there were probably more poorest I doubt
these<00:02:07.280> copies<00:02:07.729> will<00:02:07.909> last<00:02:08.149> as<00:02:08.450> long<00:02:08.690> I<00:02:08.959> thought

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
these copies will last as long I thought

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.170 
these copies will last as long I thought
they<00:02:09.349> will<00:02:09.470> probably<00:02:09.860> fade<00:02:10.459> and<00:02:10.759> changing

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
they will probably fade and changing

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.240 
they will probably fade and changing
characters<00:02:11.630> so<00:02:11.870> there's<00:02:12.050> reasons<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.680> be

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
characters so there's reasons to be

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.470 
characters so there's reasons to be
concerned<00:02:13.580> about<00:02:13.700> UV<00:02:14.200> but<00:02:16.090> but<00:02:17.090> what<00:02:17.360> it

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
concerned about UV but but what it

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.210 
concerned about UV but but what it
actually<00:02:17.630> means<00:02:17.959> in<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.230> taste<00:02:18.470> of<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.680> cup<00:02:18.920> I

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
actually means in the taste of the cup I

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.220 
actually means in the taste of the cup I
haven't<00:02:19.849> really<00:02:20.030> tried<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.569> much<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.080> I<00:02:21.110> was

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
haven't really tried it much so I was

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.559 
haven't really tried it much so I was
suddenly<00:02:21.459> thinking<00:02:22.459> well<00:02:22.790> when<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.060> get<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.239> good

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
suddenly thinking well when I get a good

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.960 
suddenly thinking well when I get a good
sample<00:02:23.810> where<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:24.769> appears<00:02:25.099> that<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.580> entire

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
sample where it appears that the entire

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.790 
sample where it appears that the entire
sample<00:02:26.239> is<00:02:26.450> not<00:02:26.540> tainted<00:02:27.019> with<00:02:27.200> these<00:02:27.380> UV

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
sample is not tainted with these UV

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.120 
sample is not tainted with these UV
glowing<00:02:28.790> luminescent<00:02:29.510> beings<00:02:29.840> but

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
glowing luminescent beings but

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.490 
glowing luminescent beings but
percentage<00:02:31.130> is<00:02:31.840> implying<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:32.959> something<00:02:33.380> in

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
percentage is implying that something in

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.520 
percentage is implying that something in
the<00:02:33.620> quality<00:02:34.340> chain<00:02:34.760> was<00:02:35.360> broken

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
the quality chain was broken

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.009 
the quality chain was broken
why<00:02:37.190> not<00:02:37.370> separate<00:02:37.819> them<00:02:38.000> out<00:02:38.180> that's<00:02:38.870> what

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
why not separate them out that's what

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.500 
why not separate them out that's what
we're<00:02:39.110> going<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.260> do<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:39.680> this<00:02:39.830> is<00:02:40.010> part<00:02:40.310> 1<00:02:40.519> part

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
we're going to do so this is part 1 part

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.539 
we're going to do so this is part 1 part
2<00:02:41.630> of<00:02:41.810> this<00:02:42.049> video<00:02:42.260> is<00:02:42.620> going<00:02:42.769> to<00:02:42.860> be<00:02:42.920> cupping

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
2 of this video is going to be cupping

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.490 
2 of this video is going to be cupping
and<00:02:43.730> trying<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.180> find<00:02:44.690> out<00:02:44.840> what's<00:02:45.110> wrong<00:02:45.380> with

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
and trying to find out what's wrong with

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:55.190 
and trying to find out what's wrong with
it<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.980> have<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.519> watch<00:02:47.330> my

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.649 

so<00:02:56.200> move<00:02:57.040> on<00:02:57.159> to<00:02:57.310> part<00:02:57.519> two<00:02:57.700> after<00:02:58.000> this<00:02:58.150> all

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
so move on to part two after this all

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.750 
so move on to part two after this all
right
