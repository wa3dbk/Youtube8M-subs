00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.630 

this<00:00:03.300> is<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.689> ribbing<00:00:04.110> of<00:00:04.380> two<00:00:04.770> in<00:00:05.009> one<00:00:05.250> socks

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
this is the ribbing of two in one socks

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.350 
this is the ribbing of two in one socks
I<00:00:06.470> have<00:00:07.470> two<00:00:08.099> different<00:00:08.309> colored<00:00:08.790> yards<00:00:09.179> to

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
I have two different colored yards to

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.169 
I have two different colored yards to
make<00:00:09.570> it<00:00:09.719> easy<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.260> see<00:00:10.559> what<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.580> two<00:00:11.790> socks

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
make it easy to see what the two socks

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.709 
make it easy to see what the two socks
separated<00:00:13.049> would<00:00:13.259> be<00:00:13.610> so<00:00:14.610> I'm<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.480> middle

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
separated would be so I'm in the middle

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.340 
separated would be so I'm in the middle
of<00:00:16.049> my<00:00:16.109> ribbing<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.300> we<00:00:18.300> want<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.630> see<00:00:18.869> how<00:00:19.320> I

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
of my ribbing and we want to see how I

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.890 
of my ribbing and we want to see how I
actually<00:00:19.859> do<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.990> so<00:00:22.789> when<00:00:23.789> I'm<00:00:24.000> pearly<00:00:24.689> I

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
actually do this so when I'm pearly I

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.109 
actually do this so when I'm pearly I
can<00:00:25.289> bring<00:00:26.119> both<00:00:27.260> yarns<00:00:28.260> forward<00:00:29.010> but<00:00:29.970> I'm

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
can bring both yarns forward but I'm

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.440 
can bring both yarns forward but I'm
only<00:00:30.390> purling<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:32.130> back<00:00:32.399> one<00:00:32.730> first<00:00:33.120> which<00:00:33.390> is

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
only purling the back one first which is

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.430 
only purling the back one first which is
the<00:00:33.719> dark<00:00:33.989> one<00:00:36.739> then<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.770> must<00:00:37.980> split<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:40.110> yarn

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
the dark one then I must split the yarn

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.350 
the dark one then I must split the yarn
so<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.790> pearl<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.300> white<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.620> front<00:00:44.360> so

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
so I can pearl the white in the front so

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.540 
so I can pearl the white in the front so
we<00:00:45.390> don't<00:00:45.690> cross<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.200> stitches<00:00:49.160> it's<00:00:50.160> already

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
we don't cross the stitches it's already

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.869 
we don't cross the stitches it's already
split<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.750> now<00:00:51.930> i<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.620> knit<00:00:52.920> over<00:00:53.610> the

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
backyard which happens to be my dark one

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.960 
backyard which happens to be my dark one
to<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.810> pearl<00:01:28.080> then<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.610> split

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
to do the pearl then you have to split

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.289 
to do the pearl then you have to split
it<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:31.159> then<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.460> continue<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.030> pearl

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
it and then you can continue to pearl

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.260 
it and then you can continue to pearl
the<00:01:33.509> white<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> front<00:01:34.409> whoops<00:01:35.270> the

it's<00:01:44.770> important<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.370> split<00:01:45.850> that<00:01:46.030> yarn<00:01:46.360> with

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
it's important to split that yarn with

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.060 
it's important to split that yarn with
your<00:01:46.750> fingers<00:01:47.160> I'll<00:01:48.160> finish<00:01:48.430> that<00:01:48.730> pearl<00:01:50.070> now
