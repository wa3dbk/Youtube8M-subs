first<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.750> all<00:00:09.809> ask<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.170> questions<00:00:10.530> well<00:00:11.340> what

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
first of all ask the questions well what

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.280 
first of all ask the questions well what
do<00:00:11.880> we<00:00:11.940> need<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.180> skin<00:00:12.390> of<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.540> car<00:00:12.750> for<00:00:12.930> anyway

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
do we need the skin of a car for anyway

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.690 
do we need the skin of a car for anyway
what's<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:13.980> therefore<00:00:14.130> does<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.460> have<00:00:14.550> to<00:00:14.670> be

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
what's it therefore does it have to be

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.400 
what's it therefore does it have to be
made<00:00:14.910> out<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.059> metal<00:00:15.300> we<00:00:15.960> have<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.170> make<00:00:16.320> it

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
made out of metal we have to make it

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.740 
made out of metal we have to make it
always<00:00:16.619> in<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.800> same<00:00:16.980> manner<00:00:17.190> or<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.480> there

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
always in the same manner or is it there

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.180 
always in the same manner or is it there
for<00:00:18.780> different<00:00:19.260> purposes<00:00:19.380> than<00:00:19.860> we<00:00:19.980> thought

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.190 
for different purposes than we thought

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.120 
for different purposes than we thought
in<00:00:21.060> reality<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.720> aspects<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.650> crash<00:00:23.100> and

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
in reality the aspects of crash and

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.060 
in reality the aspects of crash and
stiffness<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.630> ride<00:00:24.900> handling<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.920> be

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
stiffness and ride handling can be

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.769 
stiffness and ride handling can be
handled<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.520> a<00:00:26.609> space<00:00:26.970> frame<00:00:27.180> type<00:00:27.359> vehicle

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
handled in a space frame type vehicle

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.019 
handled in a space frame type vehicle
entirely<00:00:28.410> without<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.770> skin<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.220> therefore

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
entirely without the skin and therefore

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.659 
entirely without the skin and therefore
to<00:00:30.330> go<00:00:30.480> away<00:00:30.689> from<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.990> metal<00:00:31.260> skin<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:32.099> have<00:00:32.309> a

skin it became about a real thinking
process<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> philosophy<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.020> said<00:01:19.380> let's<00:01:19.740> do

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:19.889 
process a philosophy that said let's do

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:21.679 
process a philosophy that said let's do
things<00:01:20.099> differently<00:01:20.459> let's<00:01:20.999> let<00:01:21.209> materials

things differently let's let materials

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.690 
things differently let's let materials
talk<00:01:21.929> in<00:01:22.079> a<00:01:22.139> different<00:01:22.439> manner<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.950> let's<00:01:23.459> let

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
talk in a different manner and let's let

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.080 
talk in a different manner and let's let
tooling<00:01:24.179> be<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.200> different<00:01:25.740> issue<00:01:25.939> instead<00:01:26.939> of

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
tooling be a different issue instead of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.920 
tooling be a different issue instead of
just<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> way<00:01:27.539> to<00:01:27.599> give<00:01:27.749> us<00:01:27.869> form

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
just the way to give us form

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.680 
just the way to give us form
well<00:01:29.860> one<00:01:30.010> nice<00:01:30.370> thing<00:01:30.400> about<00:01:30.670> Gina<00:01:31.090> is<00:01:31.300> the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
well one nice thing about Gina is the

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.750 
well one nice thing about Gina is the
materials<00:01:32.140> kind<00:01:32.320> of<00:01:32.410> lead<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.070> way<00:01:33.340> it

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
materials kind of lead the way it

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.040 
materials kind of lead the way it
doesn't<00:01:33.970> take<00:01:34.150> very<00:01:34.180> much<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:34.840> get<00:01:34.960> an

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
doesn't take very much and you get an

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.630 
doesn't take very much and you get an
idea<00:01:35.410> exactly<00:01:35.680> what<00:01:35.950> this<00:01:36.040> car<00:01:36.250> is<00:01:36.370> going<00:01:36.520> to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
idea exactly what this car is going to

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.790 
idea exactly what this car is going to
be<00:01:36.730> like<00:01:36.880> for<00:01:37.150> instance<00:01:37.900> to<00:01:38.260> get<00:01:38.380> an<00:01:38.470> idea<00:01:38.500> with

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
be like for instance to get an idea with

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.620 
be like for instance to get an idea with
the<00:01:38.920> sculptural<00:01:39.340> form<00:01:39.670> is<00:01:39.820> between<00:01:40.120> a<00:01:40.180> fender

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
the sculptural form is between a fender

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.630 
the sculptural form is between a fender
and<00:01:40.780> let's<00:01:41.350> say<00:01:41.470> a<00:01:41.500> wheel<00:01:41.770> arch<00:01:42.010> you<00:01:42.430> really

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
and let's say a wheel arch you really

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.160 
and let's say a wheel arch you really
only<00:01:42.670> need<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:43.030> line<00:01:43.300> around<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.660> wheels<00:01:43.900> and

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
only need a line around the wheels and

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.600 
only need a line around the wheels and
align<00:01:44.710> more<00:01:44.920> or<00:01:45.010> less<00:01:45.130> where<00:01:45.280> you<00:01:45.370> want<00:01:45.520> the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
align more or less where you want the

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.250 
align more or less where you want the
fender<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:45.970> be<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.270> you<00:01:46.570> let<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.810> material<00:01:47.170> do

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
fender to be and you let the material do

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.070 
fender to be and you let the material do
the<00:01:47.350> talking<00:01:47.680> in<00:01:47.800> between<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.869> then<00:01:49.869> just

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
the talking in between and then just

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.120 
the talking in between and then just
like<00:01:50.260> you<00:01:50.410> would<00:01:50.530> if<00:01:50.680> you<00:01:50.710> were<00:01:50.830> getting<00:01:51.070> a

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
like you would if you were getting a

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.650 
like you would if you were getting a
suit<00:01:51.310> made<00:01:51.340> you<00:01:51.670> made<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:51.910> first<00:01:52.119> mock-up<00:01:52.479> you

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
the added value to this I mean one what

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.109 
the added value to this I mean one what
way<00:02:08.350> is<00:02:08.500> saying<00:02:08.739> you<00:02:09.070> get<00:02:09.190> better<00:02:09.369> function<00:02:09.940> or

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
way is saying you get better function or

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.699 
way is saying you get better function or
you<00:02:10.209> get<00:02:10.330> better<00:02:10.509> alternative<00:02:11.170> ways<00:02:11.350> of<00:02:11.470> doing

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
you get better alternative ways of doing

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.260 
you get better alternative ways of doing
things<00:02:11.830> really<00:02:12.640> we<00:02:12.760> want<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.030> achieve<00:02:13.090> a

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
things really we want to achieve a

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.910 
things really we want to achieve a
higher<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.690> emotional<00:02:14.230> plane<00:02:14.470> out<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.709> this

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
higher and emotional plane out of this

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.800 
higher and emotional plane out of this
and<00:02:15.130> then<00:02:15.670> finally<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.239> think<00:02:16.450> this<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.600> to

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
and then finally and I think this is to

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.720 
and then finally and I think this is to
be<00:02:16.930> one<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.200> most<00:02:17.290> importantly<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.220> then

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
be one of the most importantly and then

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.080 
be one of the most importantly and then
it's<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.239> level<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:20.020> humanistic<00:02:21.090> content

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
it's the level of a humanistic content

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.940 
it's the level of a humanistic content
that<00:02:22.600> we<00:02:22.690> can<00:02:22.840> bring<00:02:22.959> with<00:02:23.200> Jeanne<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.680> Gina

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
that we can bring with Jeanne and Gina

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.560 
that we can bring with Jeanne and Gina
should<00:02:24.190> be<00:02:24.340> about<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:25.000> human<00:02:25.300> in<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.540> loop

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
should be about the human in the loop

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.270 
should be about the human in the loop
the<00:02:26.200> human<00:02:26.620> way<00:02:27.550> of<00:02:27.580> doing<00:02:28.060> things<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.980> Gina

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
the human way of doing things the Gina

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.240 
the human way of doing things the Gina
philosophy<00:02:30.850> in<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.300> short<00:02:31.600> form<00:02:32.100> it's<00:02:33.100> about

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
philosophy in a short form it's about

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.000 
philosophy in a short form it's about
being<00:02:33.430> flexible<00:02:34.080> thinking<00:02:35.080> flexible<00:02:35.530> backed
