00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.390
 years and in the tours there are 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.040
 great moments 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.050
 there are some very good memories and 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.239
 and sometimes small problems we 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.580
 doubt one musicians the artists 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.440

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.640
 forgotten things things on the go 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.230
 forget then in general it's a 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.060
 projector that stays in a room 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.200
