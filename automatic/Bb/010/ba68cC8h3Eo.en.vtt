00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.240 

so<00:00:00.690> in<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:00.989> video<00:00:01.199> I<00:00:01.410> want<00:00:01.709> to<00:00:01.800> talk<00:00:02.070> about

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
so in this video I want to talk about

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.570 
so in this video I want to talk about
two<00:00:02.659> processes<00:00:03.659> that<00:00:04.110> make<00:00:04.410> changes<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.250> the

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
two processes that make changes to the

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.509 
two processes that make changes to the
antibody<00:00:06.120> genes<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.779> they<00:00:07.319> take<00:00:07.680> those<00:00:08.010> place

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
antibody genes and they take those place

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.060 
antibody genes and they take those place
in<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.450> germinal<00:00:09.840> Center<00:00:10.320> during<00:00:10.500> visa

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
in the germinal Center during visa

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.999 
in the germinal Center during visa
maturation<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.990> number<00:00:13.290> one<00:00:13.320> process

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
maturation and so the number one process

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.099 
maturation and so the number one process
somatic<00:00:14.700> hypermutation<00:00:14.839> that<00:00:15.839> i'm<00:00:15.929> going<00:00:16.020> to

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
somatic hypermutation that i'm going to

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.779 
somatic hypermutation that i'm going to
talk<00:00:16.289> about<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.830> then<00:00:17.250> we're<00:00:17.430> also<00:00:17.580> going<00:00:17.730> to

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
talk about and then we're also going to

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.779 
talk about and then we're also going to
talk<00:00:18.029> about<00:00:18.210> class<00:00:18.690> switch<00:00:19.050> recombination<00:00:19.789> so

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
talk about class switch recombination so

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.480 
talk about class switch recombination so
here<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.689> can<00:00:21.869> recognize<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.710> Y<00:00:23.010> shaped

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
here you can recognize this Y shaped

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.450 
here you can recognize this Y shaped
antibody<00:00:24.300> molecule<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.619> consists<00:00:26.279> out<00:00:26.400> of

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
antibody molecule and it consists out of

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.910 
antibody molecule and it consists out of
an<00:00:26.670> heavy<00:00:27.029> chain<00:00:27.420> which<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.170> drawn<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:28.830> in

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
an heavy chain which is drawn here in

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.400 
an heavy chain which is drawn here in
dark<00:00:29.250> blue<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:30.210> light<00:00:30.449> chain<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:31.019> light

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
dark blue and a light chain in light

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.880 
dark blue and a light chain in light
blue<00:00:32.239> so<00:00:33.239> you're<00:00:33.420> also<00:00:33.630> gonna<00:00:33.899> recognize<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
blue so you're also gonna recognize the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.889 
blue so you're also gonna recognize the
variable<00:00:35.520> region<00:00:35.940> which<00:00:36.090> I've<00:00:36.300> drawn<00:00:36.540> here<00:00:36.570> in

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
variable region which I've drawn here in

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.740 
variable region which I've drawn here in
purple<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.620> then<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.460> constant<00:00:39.239> region<00:00:39.450> in

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
purple and then the constant region in

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.500 
purple and then the constant region in
yellow<00:00:40.190> so<00:00:41.190> let's<00:00:41.640> start<00:00:41.910> talking<00:00:42.329> first

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
yellow so let's start talking first

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.279 
yellow so let's start talking first
about<00:00:42.690> somatic<00:00:43.410> hypermutation<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.840> as<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
about somatic hypermutation so as the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.990 
about somatic hypermutation so as the
name<00:00:46.440> already<00:00:46.469> implies<00:00:47.219> we're<00:00:47.550> talking<00:00:47.879> here

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
name already implies we're talking here

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.660 
name already implies we're talking here
about<00:00:48.079> mutations<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.739> there<00:00:49.980> are<00:00:50.100> rapid

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
about mutations so there are rapid

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.689 
about mutations so there are rapid
single<00:00:51.570> base<00:00:51.780> pair<00:00:51.809> changes<00:00:52.530> introduced<00:00:53.309> into

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
single base pair changes introduced into

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.290 
single base pair changes introduced into
the<00:00:53.850> variable<00:00:54.629> region<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> antibody<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
the variable region of the antibody and

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.660 
the variable region of the antibody and
that<00:00:57.300> means<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.899> affects<00:00:58.289> both<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:59.370> heavy

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
that means that affects both the heavy

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.970 
that means that affects both the heavy
chain<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.809> light<00:01:00.989> chain<00:01:01.020> because<00:01:01.620> both

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
chain and the light chain because both

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.310 
chain and the light chain because both
make<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.460> variable<00:01:03.090> region<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
make this variable region so the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.149 
make this variable region so the
consequence<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:06.180> hyper<00:01:06.890> mutations<00:01:07.890> is

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
consequence of this hyper mutations is

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.969 
consequence of this hyper mutations is
that<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.000> makes<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.390> change<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> affinity

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
that it makes a change in the affinity

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.920 
that it makes a change in the affinity
of<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.250> antibody<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.720> very

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
of the antibody and this is very

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.920 
of the antibody and this is very
important<00:01:13.650> because<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:15.000> wanna<00:01:15.210> make<00:01:15.780> an

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
important because you wanna make an

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.370 
important because you wanna make an
antibody<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.920> holds<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.700> strong<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:19.259> an

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
antibody that holds on strong to an

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.469 
antibody that holds on strong to an
antigen<00:01:19.770> otherwise<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.729> gonna<00:01:20.820> fall<00:01:21.210> off

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
antigen otherwise it's gonna fall off

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.219 
antigen otherwise it's gonna fall off
and<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.780> cannot<00:01:22.290> exert<00:01:22.770> its<00:01:23.009> function<00:01:23.900> so<00:01:24.900> what

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
and it cannot exert its function so what

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.609 
and it cannot exert its function so what
does<00:01:25.470> class<00:01:25.979> switch<00:01:26.460> recombination<00:01:27.210> due<00:01:27.960> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
does class switch recombination due to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.550 
does class switch recombination due to
the<00:01:28.740> antibody<00:01:29.310> as<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.600> name<00:01:30.780> implies<00:01:31.229> to

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the antibody as the name implies to

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.030 
the antibody as the name implies to
switch<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.250> antibody<00:01:32.970> class<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:34.350> antibody

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
switch the antibody class the antibody

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.999 
switch the antibody class the antibody
class<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.640> defined<00:01:36.079> by<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.140> heavy<00:01:37.680> chain

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
class is defined by the heavy chain

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.490 
class is defined by the heavy chain
right<00:01:38.250> attack<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.299> has<00:01:39.570> nothing<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.140> do

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
right attack so this has nothing to do

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.590 
right attack so this has nothing to do
with<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.920> light<00:01:41.130> chain<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.270> only

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
with the light chain so this only

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.249 
with the light chain so this only
affects<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.290> heavy<00:01:43.560> chain<00:01:44.689> because<00:01:45.689> only<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
affects you heavy chain because only the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.620 
affects you heavy chain because only the
heavy<00:01:46.649> chain<00:01:47.040> determines<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.149> antibody

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
heavy chain determines the antibody

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.940 
heavy chain determines the antibody
class<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> virgin<00:01:51.240> B<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:52.049> gonna<00:01:52.560> just

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
class so a virgin B so is gonna just

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.639 
class so a virgin B so is gonna just
make<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.460> antibody<00:01:54.090> class<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.079> first<00:01:55.409> in

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
make the antibody class that is first in

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.130 
make the antibody class that is first in
line<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.189> here<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.119> can<00:01:57.299> see<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.719> gene<00:01:57.990> of

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
line and here you can see that gene of

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.109 
line and here you can see that gene of
the<00:01:58.259> variable<00:01:58.829> region<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.850> heavy<00:02:00.030> chain

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
the variable region of the heavy chain

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.350 
the variable region of the heavy chain
and<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.869> first<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.409> line<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.700> moon<00:02:03.119> and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
and the first in line is the moon and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.990 
and the first in line is the moon and
the<00:02:03.540> Delta<00:02:04.020> chain<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:04.890> gonna<00:02:05.009> make<00:02:05.280> AGM

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
the Delta chain so it's gonna make AGM

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.830 
the Delta chain so it's gonna make AGM
and<00:02:06.210> IgG<00:02:06.719> first<00:02:07.489> so<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.910> class<00:02:09.300> switch

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
and IgG first so the class switch

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.470 
and IgG first so the class switch
recombination<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.979> driven<00:02:11.520> by<00:02:11.700> an<00:02:11.760> enzyme

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
recombination is driven by an enzyme

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.420 
recombination is driven by an enzyme
complex<00:02:12.989> which<00:02:13.590> mediates<00:02:14.190> this

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
complex which mediates this

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.119 
complex which mediates this
recombination<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.129> recombinase

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
recombination and this is a recombinase

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.970 
recombination and this is a recombinase
and<00:02:17.519> this<00:02:18.209> recombinase<00:02:19.080> is<00:02:19.319> always<00:02:19.769> gonna

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
and this recombinase is always gonna

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.180 
and this recombinase is always gonna
make<00:02:20.780> two<00:02:21.780> cuts<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.590> then<00:02:23.299> recombine<00:02:24.299> the<00:02:24.480> DNA

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
make two cuts and then recombine the DNA

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.759 
make two cuts and then recombine the DNA
so<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.370> first<00:02:26.700> cut<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.330> fixed<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.470> first

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
so the first cut is fixed and the first

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.509 
so the first cut is fixed and the first
cut<00:02:29.129> always<00:02:29.910> happens<00:02:30.540> right<00:02:30.629> before<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:32.220> moon

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
cut always happens right before the moon

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.699 
cut always happens right before the moon
Delta<00:02:33.060> G<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:34.790> second<00:02:35.790> cut<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.620> dependent<00:02:37.620> on

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
Delta G the second cut is dependent on

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.400 
Delta G the second cut is dependent on
the<00:02:37.890> cytokines<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:39.060> are<00:02:39.420> around<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.319> the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
the cytokines that are around in the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.259 
the cytokines that are around in the
germinal<00:02:40.769> Center<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.310> are<00:02:41.430> produced<00:02:42.000> from

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
germinal Center and are produced from

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.839 
germinal Center and are produced from
the<00:02:42.450> T<00:02:42.659> follicular<00:02:43.260> help<00:02:43.470> us<00:02:43.650> on<00:02:43.829> the<00:02:44.340> second

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
the T follicular help us on the second

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.930 
the T follicular help us on the second
cut<00:02:45.060> can<00:02:45.390> occur<00:02:45.810> either<00:02:46.079> right<00:02:46.829> before<00:02:47.400> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
cut can occur either right before the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.660 
cut can occur either right before the
gamma<00:02:48.150> chain<00:02:48.480> right<00:02:49.290> before<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.920> epsilon<00:02:50.459> G

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
gamma chain right before the epsilon G

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.380 
gamma chain right before the epsilon G
or<00:02:50.879> right<00:02:51.420> before<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.959> Alpha<00:02:52.379> gene<00:02:53.209> so<00:02:54.209> let's

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
or right before the Alpha gene so let's

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.520 
or right before the Alpha gene so let's
suppose<00:02:54.510> you're<00:02:54.930> gonna<00:02:55.019> have<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.319> lot<00:02:55.500> of

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
suppose you're gonna have a lot of

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.800 
suppose you're gonna have a lot of
interferon<00:02:56.310> gamma<00:02:56.519> around<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:57.629> the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
interferon gamma around so the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.780 
interferon gamma around so the
recombination<00:02:58.440> enzyme<00:02:58.950> will<00:02:59.129> always<00:02:59.519> cut

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
recombination enzyme will always cut

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.789 
recombination enzyme will always cut
here<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:00.420> if<00:03:00.900> there's<00:03:01.109> interferon<00:03:01.590> gamma

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
here and if there's interferon gamma

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.160 
here and if there's interferon gamma
around<00:03:02.220> it's<00:03:02.430> gonna<00:03:02.609> make<00:03:02.849> a<00:03:02.879> cut<00:03:03.180> here<00:03:03.209> then

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
around it's gonna make a cut here then

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.410 
around it's gonna make a cut here then
these<00:03:04.560> two<00:03:04.829> spots<00:03:05.069> are<00:03:05.280> gonna<00:03:05.370> recombine<00:03:06.180> and

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
these two spots are gonna recombine and

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.229 
these two spots are gonna recombine and
so<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.709> gene<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.160> gonna<00:03:08.370> exist<00:03:08.819> out<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.120> the

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
so the gene is gonna exist out of the

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.420 
so the gene is gonna exist out of the
variable<00:03:09.840> region<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.349> then<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.950> next<00:03:11.310> in

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
variable region and then the next in

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.490 
variable region and then the next in
line<00:03:11.670> would<00:03:12.060> be<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.359> gamma<00:03:12.629> chain<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.410> you're

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
line would be the gamma chain so you're

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.180 
line would be the gamma chain so you're
gonna<00:03:13.650> get<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.129> IgG<00:03:14.840> isotype<00:03:15.840> if<00:03:16.470> there's<00:03:17.069> a

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
gonna get the IgG isotype if there's a

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.339 
gonna get the IgG isotype if there's a
lot<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.430> teaching<00:03:17.609> beds<00:03:18.150> around<00:03:18.359> for<00:03:18.900> example

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
lot of teaching beds around for example

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.379 
lot of teaching beds around for example
you're<00:03:19.769> gonna<00:03:19.980> get<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.459> first<00:03:20.730> cut<00:03:21.030> again

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
you're gonna get the first cut again

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.870 
you're gonna get the first cut again
here<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.019> then<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.739> second<00:03:23.130> cut<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.459> gonna<00:03:23.669> be

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
here and then the second cut is gonna be

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.750 
here and then the second cut is gonna be
here<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:24.989> there's<00:03:25.519> recombination<00:03:26.519> and<00:03:26.609> you're

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
here so there's recombination and you're

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.569 
here so there's recombination and you're
gonna<00:03:26.880> cut<00:03:27.299> out<00:03:27.569> all<00:03:27.870> this<00:03:28.290> chunk<00:03:28.650> here<00:03:29.370> in

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
gonna cut out all this chunk here in

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.000 
gonna cut out all this chunk here in
between<00:03:29.970> these<00:03:30.120> two<00:03:30.389> spots<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:31.019> so<00:03:31.680> you're

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
between these two spots and so you're

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.979 
between these two spots and so you're
gonna<00:03:32.130> read<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.549> variable<00:03:33.060> region<00:03:33.389> and<00:03:33.540> then

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
gonna read the variable region and then

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.650 
gonna read the variable region and then
the<00:03:34.139> next<00:03:34.700> constant<00:03:35.700> region<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.209> is<00:03:36.329> in<00:03:36.450> line

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
the next constant region that is in line

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.659 
the next constant region that is in line
would<00:03:37.139> be<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.440> Alpha<00:03:37.799> chain<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.430> you're<00:03:38.549> gonna

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
would be the Alpha chain so you're gonna

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.339 
would be the Alpha chain so you're gonna
get<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.060> iga<00:03:39.709> isotype<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.609> means<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:41.940> this

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
get the iga isotype so the means of this

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.530 
get the iga isotype so the means of this
cytokines<00:03:43.349> that<00:03:43.680> are<00:03:44.069> produced<00:03:44.609> by<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.150> chief

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
cytokines that are produced by the chief

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.539 
cytokines that are produced by the chief
friendly<00:03:46.019> helper<00:03:46.410> cell<00:03:46.680> are<00:03:47.040> going<00:03:47.489> to

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
friendly helper cell are going to

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.449 
friendly helper cell are going to
determine<00:03:47.700> which<00:03:48.569> kind<00:03:49.230> of<00:03:49.470> ISO<00:03:49.889> table<00:03:50.280> you're

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
determine which kind of ISO table you're

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.199 
determine which kind of ISO table you're
gonna<00:03:50.579> get<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:51.829> the<00:03:52.829> t4<00:03:53.280> little<00:03:53.489> helper<00:03:53.970> cell

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
gonna get and the t4 little helper cell

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.020 
gonna get and the t4 little helper cell
produces<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.810> cytokine<00:03:55.440> depending<00:03:56.400> on<00:03:56.519> where

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.530 
produces the cytokine depending on where
the<00:03:57.510> pathogen<00:03:58.200> was<00:03:58.349> found<00:03:58.879> so<00:03:59.879> obviously<00:04:00.359> we

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
the pathogen was found so obviously we

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.330 
the pathogen was found so obviously we
want<00:04:00.569> to<00:04:00.750> make<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:01.049> antibody<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:01.680> fat<00:04:01.919> best

want to make the antibody that fat best

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.569 
want to make the antibody that fat best
fits<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:03.060> get<00:04:03.209> rid<00:04:03.419> of<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.629> pathogen<00:04:04.400> so<00:04:05.400> if

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
fits to get rid of the pathogen so if

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.360 
fits to get rid of the pathogen so if
the<00:04:05.790> pathogen<00:04:06.419> was<00:04:06.540> detected<00:04:07.379> in<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:08.010> spleen
