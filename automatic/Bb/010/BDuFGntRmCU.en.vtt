00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.410
 well we know that every game 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.340
 It's different and I think it's good 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.360
 Saturday we had to lose but good 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.010
 we try to forget as soon as 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.610
 possible and now we are working 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:33.150
 thinking in Puebla we know that it is a 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.150
 very complicated rival 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.020
 we have worked very well 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.820
 during the week so let's hope 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.390
 to be able to go there and do a good job and 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.350
 bring us the three points 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.690
 good afternoon, this is not the best 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.970
 funny desperate already so that you who 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.260
 you goal from the beginning play the 90 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.239
 minutes are or how you feel 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:03.129
 Well, I 've taken it easy not 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.010
 I have tried to take advantage of working at 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.720
 maximum to get physically well 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.630
 Now I feel much better 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.720
 now it's waiting for my chance I think 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.460
 I'm going to have it on Saturday and well 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.740
 as I said this here to succeed for 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.220
 help the team and that is what I will try 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.990
 to do it 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:29.020
 good afternoon on your right here is 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.090
 this as you saw the team starting 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.860
 Monday still the day yesterday after 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.470
 the defeat against the america 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.360
 emotionally after losing at home 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.180
 against the super leader how was the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.890
 group 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.300
 and so 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.750
 as always nobody wants to lose that 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.230
 type of party so not 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.900
 I believe that 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.120
 the america wine made a good match the 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.680
 team did not play bad tigers did not play badly 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.930
 but around there the america was a little more 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.110
 more practical no and that cost us to 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.750
 us but well I think it's already happened 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.030
 this is from match to match all 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.510
 party is different now it's coming from 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.370
 town that is a difficult opponent as I say 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.770
 and hopefully we can go there 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.620
 and do a good job and win not 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.140
 they travel with thirst for revenge for the three 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.140
 points also sure that if we the 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.330
 Our illusion is of every party able 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.580
 add up like this is that we work thinking about 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.420
 that and hopefully things do not go away 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.420
 very good on Saturday 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.240
 ready 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.250
 good this 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.840
 I do not speak much 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:01.910
 because a lot I have not seen but but what 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.910
 little that I know is that a team what 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.829
 he has his of his good things like 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.829
 also its shortcomings then 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:12.290
 we are working thinking about 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:16.040
 that and hopefully on Saturday 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.689
 let's be with the desire with the 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.960
 necessary forces to take the 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:23.130
 party ahead 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.130
 thank you very much suffering
