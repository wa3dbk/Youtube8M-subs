and you might notice that it is sunny
however<00:00:17.840> the<00:00:18.840> best<00:00:19.289> practice<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.980> do<00:00:20.130> in

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
however the best practice is to do in

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.349 
however the best practice is to do in
the<00:00:20.369> shade<00:00:20.609> yeah<00:00:20.820> that's<00:00:21.029> true

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
the shade yeah that's true

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
but it is around 60 degrees right now so

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.109 
but it is around 60 degrees right now so
it's<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.779> wheels<00:00:25.260> are<00:00:25.529> completely<00:00:26.160> cool<00:00:26.519> to

can see the flake okay and it is a
pretty<00:03:16.500> incredible<00:03:16.710> job<00:03:19.490> very<00:03:20.490> embedded

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
pretty incredible job very embedded

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:28.780 
pretty incredible job very embedded
break<00:03:21.300> does<00:03:25.760> any<00:03:26.760> kind<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.420> color<00:03:28.020> shine

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
break does any kind of color shine

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.060 
break does any kind of color shine
plates<00:03:29.790> like<00:03:30.630> nothing<00:03:31.050> in<00:03:31.200> that<00:03:31.230> in<00:03:31.590> there<00:03:31.770> in

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
plates like nothing in that in there in

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.430 
plates like nothing in that in there in
that<00:03:32.160> wheel<00:03:32.520> and<00:03:32.850> after<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:33.870> were<00:03:33.990> able<00:03:34.410> to

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
that wheel and after you were able to

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.890 
that wheel and after you were able to
see<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.830> flakes<00:03:35.070> in<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:36.090> spoke<00:03:36.390> of<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.720> wheel

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
see the flakes in the spoke of the wheel

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.310 
see the flakes in the spoke of the wheel
which<00:03:37.380> i<00:03:37.620> think<00:03:37.740> is<00:03:38.040> pretty<00:03:38.280> incredible<00:03:38.510> so<00:03:39.510> in

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
which i think is pretty incredible so in

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.620 
which i think is pretty incredible so in
terms<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.890> cleaning<00:03:41.160> power<00:03:41.460> it's<00:03:41.820> pretty

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
terms of cleaning power it's pretty

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.630 
terms of cleaning power it's pretty
pretty<00:03:43.020> good<00:03:43.260> i<00:03:43.530> used<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:44.040> straight<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.580> i

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
pretty good i used it straight and i

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.970 
pretty good i used it straight and i
have<00:03:44.820> no<00:03:45.090> problem<00:03:45.510> believing<00:03:46.080> that<00:03:46.620> if<00:03:46.830> you

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
have no problem believing that if you

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.410 
have no problem believing that if you
use<00:03:47.160> as<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.400> maintenance<00:03:47.760> wheel<00:03:48.150> cleaner

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
use as a maintenance wheel cleaner

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.020 
use as a maintenance wheel cleaner
you'll<00:03:48.660> be<00:03:48.810> able<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.170> dilute<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:50.030> probably

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
you'll be able to dilute it probably

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.700 
you'll be able to dilute it probably
they<00:03:51.510> say<00:03:51.720> one<00:03:51.990> two<00:03:52.170> three

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
they say one two three

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.100 
they say one two three
but<00:03:53.250> i<00:03:53.520> think<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.150> could<00:03:54.330> probably<00:03:54.510> use<00:03:54.900> it

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
but i think you could probably use it

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.620 
but i think you could probably use it
more<00:03:55.380> than<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:55.680> one<00:03:55.860> two<00:03:55.950> four<00:03:56.100> one<00:03:56.130> two<00:03:56.370> five

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
more than that one two four one two five

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.360 
more than that one two four one two five
in<00:03:57.630> terms<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:58.110> dilution<00:03:58.410> because<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:58.980> eight<00:03:59.160> it

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
in terms of dilution because it eight it

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.950 
in terms of dilution because it eight it
cut<00:03:59.550> through<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.850> brake<00:04:00.270> dust<00:04:00.480> pretty

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
cut through the brake dust pretty

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.770 
cut through the brake dust pretty
quickly<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:02.130> pretty<00:04:02.520> amazingly<00:04:03.090> so<00:04:03.450> it<00:04:03.660> was<00:04:03.750> a

quickly and pretty amazingly so it was a

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.740 
quickly and pretty amazingly so it was a
fantastic<00:04:04.530> it's<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.100> great<00:04:05.130> wheel<00:04:06.090> cleaner<00:04:06.420> i

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
fantastic it's a great wheel cleaner i

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.710 
fantastic it's a great wheel cleaner i
like<00:04:07.710> it<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:07.920> lot<00:04:08.160> however<00:04:08.880> here's<00:04:09.300> here's

where<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.960> issue<00:04:10.080> comes<00:04:10.410> it's<00:04:10.950> $29<00:04:11.820> per

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
where the issue comes it's $29 per

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.870 
where the issue comes it's $29 per
gallon<00:04:12.450> for<00:04:13.020> a<00:04:13.050> wheel<00:04:13.530> cleaner<00:04:13.830> that's<00:04:14.220> pretty

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
gallon for a wheel cleaner that's pretty

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.200 
gallon for a wheel cleaner that's pretty
expensive<00:04:15.300> when<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:15.900> are<00:04:16.380> like<00:04:17.280> me<00:04:17.430> you<00:04:17.700> soap

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.210 
expensive when you are like me you soap

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.510 
expensive when you are like me you soap

and water or you use something like an

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.790 
and water or you use something like an
all-purpose<00:04:20.970> cleaner<00:04:21.120> both<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:22.049> those<00:04:22.200> don't

all-purpose cleaner both of those don't

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.320 
all-purpose cleaner both of those don't
run<00:04:23.100> as<00:04:23.310> much<00:04:23.850> as<00:04:24.030> this<00:04:24.420> stuff<00:04:24.720> does<00:04:25.020> so<00:04:26.330> in

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
run as much as this stuff does so in

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.480 
run as much as this stuff does so in
terms<00:04:27.600> of<00:04:27.750> price<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:28.260> view<00:04:28.830> that<00:04:29.040> as<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.310> negative

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490

I<00:04:29.730> think<00:04:29.910> it's<00:04:30.030> too<00:04:30.180> expensive

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
I think it's too expensive

of it's just $29 and you gotta pay

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.140 
of it's just $29 and you gotta pay
shipping<00:04:40.810> for<00:04:41.200> a<00:04:41.230> gallon<00:04:41.620> so<00:04:42.280> in<00:04:42.730> terms<00:04:43.000> of

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
shipping for a gallon so in terms of

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.720 
shipping for a gallon so in terms of
price<00:04:43.330> it's<00:04:43.840> I<00:04:44.740> don't<00:04:44.800> think<00:04:44.980> it's<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.340> best<00:04:45.550> I

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
price it's I don't think it's the best I

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.560 
price it's I don't think it's the best I
would<00:04:45.790> definitely<00:04:46.330> consider<00:04:46.810> it<00:04:47.050> a<00:04:47.200> con<00:04:47.490> and

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
would definitely consider it a con and

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.540 
would definitely consider it a con and
in<00:04:49.570> terms<00:04:49.780> of<00:04:49.930> cleaning<00:04:50.200> power<00:04:50.470> it's<00:04:50.920> well

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
in terms of cleaning power it's well

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.090 
in terms of cleaning power it's well
above<00:04:51.730> the<00:04:52.240> ability<00:04:53.050> of<00:04:53.260> all-purpose<00:04:53.830> cleaner

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
above the ability of all-purpose cleaner

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.820 
above the ability of all-purpose cleaner
and<00:04:54.340> soap<00:04:54.580> and<00:04:54.730> water<00:04:55.030> and<00:04:55.600> I<00:04:56.050> would<00:04:56.230> say<00:04:56.470> it's

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
and soap and water and I would say it's

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.340 
and soap and water and I would say it's
on<00:04:56.980> a<00:04:57.010> similar<00:04:57.640> level<00:04:57.880> to<00:04:58.300> McGuire's<00:04:58.960> wheel

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
on a similar level to McGuire's wheel

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.680 
on a similar level to McGuire's wheel
brightener<00:04:59.860> in<00:05:00.730> terms<00:05:01.000> of<00:05:01.180> cleaning<00:05:01.480> power

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
brightener in terms of cleaning power

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.720 
brightener in terms of cleaning power
now<00:05:01.900> why<00:05:02.230> does<00:05:02.380> wheel<00:05:02.590> brightener<00:05:03.010> is<00:05:03.130> an<00:05:03.250> acid

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
now why does wheel brightener is an acid

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.660 
now why does wheel brightener is an acid
and<00:05:03.910> brown<00:05:04.630> royal<00:05:04.990> is<00:05:05.350> the<00:05:05.620> non<00:05:05.860> acid<00:05:06.430> so<00:05:06.550> I'm

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
and brown royal is the non acid so I'm

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.930 
and brown royal is the non acid so I'm
assuming<00:05:07.090> it<00:05:07.480> has<00:05:07.540> a<00:05:07.660> pretty<00:05:08.110> high<00:05:08.320> pH<00:05:08.940> which

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
assuming it has a pretty high pH which

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.600 
assuming it has a pretty high pH which
means<00:05:10.180> that<00:05:10.450> it's<00:05:10.630> a<00:05:10.810> it's<00:05:11.110> a<00:05:11.200> basic<00:05:11.650> now<00:05:12.160> basic

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
means that it's a it's a basic now basic

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.000 
means that it's a it's a basic now basic
and<00:05:12.760> acid<00:05:13.120> I<00:05:13.360> don't<00:05:14.020> wanna<00:05:14.140> get<00:05:14.230> in<00:05:14.380> step<00:05:14.680> but

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
and acid I don't wanna get in step but

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.370 
and acid I don't wanna get in step but
the<00:05:15.550> more<00:05:15.790> you<00:05:15.970> become<00:05:16.270> a<00:05:16.300> cynic<00:05:16.840> or<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.230> more

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
the more you become a cynic or the more

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.670 
the more you become a cynic or the more
UVM<00:05:17.710> basic<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.670> more<00:05:18.990> reactive<00:05:19.990> it<00:05:20.110> is<00:05:20.230> and<00:05:20.470> I

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
UVM basic the more reactive it is and I

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.180 
UVM basic the more reactive it is and I
guess<00:05:20.890> more<00:05:21.310> competing<00:05:21.700> power<00:05:22.090> attack<00:05:23.190> so

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
guess more competing power attack so

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
guess more competing power attack so
with<00:05:25.180> that<00:05:25.360> said<00:05:27.990> I<00:05:28.990> put<00:05:29.950> on<00:05:30.610> a<00:05:30.670> very<00:05:30.880> similar

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
with that said I put on a very similar

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.440 
with that said I put on a very similar
level<00:05:31.660> to<00:05:31.690> my<00:05:31.870> wires<00:05:32.140> wheel<00:05:32.440> brain<00:05:32.770> there<00:05:33.450> it

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
level to my wires wheel brain there it

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.390 
level to my wires wheel brain there it
does<00:05:34.780> have<00:05:35.080> some<00:05:35.110> precautions<00:05:35.830> need<00:05:36.070> to<00:05:36.100> take

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
does have some precautions need to take

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.670 
does have some precautions need to take
with<00:05:36.550> like<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:36.910> mask<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.570> I<00:05:38.050> wear<00:05:38.410> in<00:05:38.560> the

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
with like the mask the I wear in the

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.160 
with like the mask the I wear in the
gloves<00:05:39.090> and<00:05:40.090> you<00:05:40.240> don't<00:05:40.480> like<00:05:40.600> it<00:05:40.810> on<00:05:40.990> your

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
gloves and you don't like it on your

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.840 
gloves and you don't like it on your
skin<00:05:41.410> or<00:05:41.560> anything<00:05:41.740> like<00:05:42.010> that<00:05:42.070> so<00:05:42.310> it<00:05:42.670> does

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
skin or anything like that so it does

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.810 
skin or anything like that so it does
have<00:05:43.060> some<00:05:43.090> precautions<00:05:43.780> you<00:05:43.840> need<00:05:43.900> to<00:05:44.050> take

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
have some precautions you need to take

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.640 
have some precautions you need to take
so<00:05:45.820> with<00:05:46.000> all<00:05:46.210> of<00:05:46.240> that<00:05:46.420> in<00:05:46.690> mind<00:05:46.930> would<00:05:47.350> it<00:05:47.500> be

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
so with all of that in mind would it be

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.340 
so with all of that in mind would it be
good<00:05:47.890> for<00:05:48.130> your<00:05:48.220> arsenal<00:05:48.730> that's<00:05:48.910> kind<00:05:49.210> of<00:05:49.390> a

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
good for your arsenal that's kind of a

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.390 
good for your arsenal that's kind of a
personal<00:05:51.100> question<00:05:52.380> you<00:05:53.380> asked<00:05:53.890> because<00:05:54.040> what

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
personal question you asked because what

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.040 
personal question you asked because what
you<00:05:54.580> have<00:05:54.820> in<00:05:55.060> your<00:05:55.090> arsenal<00:05:55.210> do<00:05:55.750> you<00:05:55.840> have

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
you have in your arsenal do you have

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.640 
you have in your arsenal do you have
McGuire's<00:05:56.440> wheel<00:05:56.800> brightener<00:05:57.540> it<00:05:58.540> is<00:05:58.990> are<00:05:59.530> you

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
McGuire's wheel brightener it is are you

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.470 
McGuire's wheel brightener it is are you
looking<00:05:59.980> for<00:06:00.160> the<00:06:00.280> most<00:06:00.430> cost-effective<00:06:01.090> way

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
looking for the most cost-effective way

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.510 
looking for the most cost-effective way
how<00:06:01.990> clean<00:06:02.350> are<00:06:02.560> your<00:06:02.680> wheels<00:06:02.920> are<00:06:03.220> you<00:06:03.310> just

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
how clean are your wheels are you just

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.280 
how clean are your wheels are you just
maintaining<00:06:03.970> them<00:06:04.240> or<00:06:04.420> are<00:06:04.540> you<00:06:04.720> trying<00:06:05.260> to

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
maintaining them or are you trying to

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.840 
maintaining them or are you trying to
bring<00:06:05.470> back<00:06:05.500> wheels<00:06:06.070> from<00:06:06.250> the<00:06:06.280> dead<00:06:06.550> I<00:06:06.760> mean

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
bring back wheels from the dead I mean

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.670 
bring back wheels from the dead I mean
that's<00:06:07.270> what<00:06:07.450> I<00:06:07.480> was<00:06:07.690> trying<00:06:07.930> to<00:06:07.990> do<00:06:08.140> today<00:06:08.350> and

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
that's what I was trying to do today and

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.950 
that's what I was trying to do today and
I<00:06:09.160> think<00:06:09.220> in<00:06:09.850> terms<00:06:10.120> of<00:06:10.270> doing<00:06:10.510> back<00:06:10.720> wheels

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
I think in terms of doing back wheels

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.780 
I think in terms of doing back wheels
from<00:06:11.170> the<00:06:11.260> dead<00:06:11.500> McGuire's<00:06:12.160> wheel<00:06:12.460> brightener

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
from the dead McGuire's wheel brightener

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.360 
from the dead McGuire's wheel brightener
and<00:06:13.030> brown<00:06:13.270> royal<00:06:13.540> are<00:06:13.870> the<00:06:13.990> way<00:06:14.110> to<00:06:14.140> go<00:06:14.410> so<00:06:14.620> I

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
and brown royal are the way to go so I

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.640 
and brown royal are the way to go so I
mean<00:06:15.760> one<00:06:16.000> of<00:06:16.030> these<00:06:16.240> two<00:06:16.450> are<00:06:16.720> probably<00:06:17.350> going

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
mean one of these two are probably going

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.140 
mean one of these two are probably going
to<00:06:17.710> be<00:06:17.770> necessary<00:06:18.310> to<00:06:18.400> bring<00:06:18.640> back<00:06:18.880> wheels

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
to be necessary to bring back wheels

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.180 
to be necessary to bring back wheels
that<00:06:19.360> haven't<00:06:19.570> been<00:06:19.660> cleaned

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
that haven't been cleaned

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.820 
that haven't been cleaned
in<00:06:20.250> like<00:06:20.460> a<00:06:20.490> year<00:06:20.790> or<00:06:21.000> over<00:06:21.210> so<00:06:22.080> that's<00:06:22.500> pretty

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
in like a year or over so that's pretty

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.160 
in like a year or over so that's pretty
much<00:06:22.950> my<00:06:23.070> review<00:06:23.580> I<00:06:23.760> like<00:06:24.150> the<00:06:24.330> product<00:06:24.780> but<00:06:24.960> I

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.170 
much my review I like the product but I

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.320 
much my review I like the product but I
don't<00:06:25.560> think<00:06:25.920> I'm<00:06:26.220> gonna<00:06:26.340> continue<00:06:26.880> buying<00:06:27.090> it

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
don't think I'm gonna continue buying it

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.790 
don't think I'm gonna continue buying it
because<00:06:27.750> I<00:06:27.990> have<00:06:28.200> McGuire's<00:06:28.530> wheel

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
because I have McGuire's wheel

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.860 
because I have McGuire's wheel
brightener<00:06:29.310> and<00:06:29.550> because<00:06:30.330> of<00:06:30.480> the<00:06:30.600> price

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
brightener and because of the price

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.350 
brightener and because of the price
however<00:06:31.530> if<00:06:32.040> you<00:06:32.370> don't<00:06:32.610> have<00:06:32.760> enquires<00:06:33.090> wheel

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
however if you don't have enquires wheel

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.630 
however if you don't have enquires wheel
brightener<00:06:33.840> and<00:06:34.020> you<00:06:34.350> are<00:06:34.560> not<00:06:34.710> daunted<00:06:35.370> by

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
brightener and you are not daunted by

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.960 
brightener and you are not daunted by
the<00:06:35.880> $29<00:06:36.660> plus<00:06:36.960> the<00:06:37.650> shipping<00:06:37.710> price<00:06:38.250> I<00:06:38.610> think

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
the $29 plus the shipping price I think

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.470 
the $29 plus the shipping price I think
it<00:06:39.420> might<00:06:39.630> be<00:06:39.660> a<00:06:39.840> right<00:06:40.140> option<00:06:40.880> in<00:06:41.880> terms<00:06:42.240> of

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
it might be a right option in terms of

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.930 
it might be a right option in terms of
maintenance<00:06:42.810> though<00:06:43.230> soap<00:06:44.040> and<00:06:44.280> water<00:06:44.460> is<00:06:44.790> the
