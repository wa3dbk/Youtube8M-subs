00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:08.450
 I will explain the sewing machine for leather 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:12.920
 3 c for injury will be a single thread winding 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.470
 First of all the motor 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:21.490
 This yourself 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:24.160
 In this about the speed to take the free-to-use 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.220
 This kind of gone slowly 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.360
 Not 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.110
 I need depression 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.110
 Let's sing 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.550
 But it is anyone is early early distribution r 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.510
 Because here is it is strong over there and because the handle brake even if A Sokotchi 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:53.590
 The high needle moves up and down and the thread winds up like this 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.380
 And this put here during this 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.760
 People Tei wound in Kofu 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:03.120
 When this line 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.200
 If it is not straight 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.229
 I went to here or I went to here I went here 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.180
 For example, here is 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.930
 When the finish is made so that people do not get entangled, the thread is broken and the needle is broken 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.140
 To do 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.540
 This is for example 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.470
 When this happens 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.470
 Let's get 2 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.560
 One it's delicate 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:45.680
 At first this is this this 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:50.300
 As that said jar, for example, a little while ago and please refer to the practice straight sew this is good here 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.180
 After that will come off sometimes of this kind of phenomenon is large went to do this straight squid, such say 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.100
 Here's how to make it go 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.130
 When the Koraku to entering with me 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:04.620
 The end is bent like this 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:07.180
 Even really thought I can but they can also be in the Noto-up that will be able to substitute 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.420
 There are many people who are straight 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:17.500
 It's not straight a little straight 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:19.650
 The Nde direction to WatariEtsu on here like a this direction is ideal and that it could be the next 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.170
 Japanese things 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:32.700
 Now it's 2 pieces The same child slowly like this 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:36.740
 Even if the height is the same for square steel, it is no good and let it go straight 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.130
 The same as 5 minutes collective katana 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:43.850
 Hmm 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.850
 For example, while adjusting Toka or raised here while sewing a bike that this happens 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:57.830
 I wonder to be taken Ntte the care Nde unexpected things here are hairy After this time this is possible 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:03:03.240
 This is after all Te also Paz the other side of the hair you Kokoya' 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:07.160
 There is do here is put the Piroko-chan, such as those through here this doing 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.160
 I thought this did not come out 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.470
 Papan 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.120
 This is before 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:31.980
 Will be 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.980
 I think that because it is all the Tokkei is included It 's a system that Suzuyama comes out I'll eat type
