00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.700
 Welcome to the new patented system 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.649
 of construction block fast this system 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.690
 dry construction simplifies the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.400
 constructive technique by using 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.349
 simple and easy components 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.990
 installation as are the blocks of 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.260
 concrete the block fast connectors and 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.730
 Galvanized steel pipes in this video 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.500
 one of the different 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.960
 constructive applications of the system 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.689
 block past the assembly of a housing 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.210
 an easy economic way safe and 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.769
 especially fast will start the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.050
 construction of housing by 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.030
 foundations so first of all it 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.560
 proceed to the realization of the slab of 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.870
 concrete in which the 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.430
 housing for a better optimization of 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.200
 time will proceed to distribute 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.060
 efficiently block pallets of 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.130
 concrete and the boxes of connectors block 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.730
 past along the site of the 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.830
 building 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.870
 then the 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.700
 stakeout floor of the house on 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.740
 the concrete slab defining itself 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.050
 both the perimeter of the house and the 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.150
 distribution once the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.070
 stake out construction will begin 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.960
 of housing through the placement of 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.090
 two block fest connectors 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.520
 on these connectors will be treated a 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.470
 concrete technical block starting this way 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.510
 the construction of the facade through 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.310
 a snap-fit system that 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.500
 this simple process will be done 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.330
 successive form for the first course of 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.310
 concrete blocks of the rest of the faÃ§ade 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.120
 of housing as well as divisions 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.890
 interiors of it 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.570
 the second row of blocks is 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.400
 will perform in the same way but 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.770
 paying attention to the gaps for 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.040
 doors since they will be used for these 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.330
 metal profiles in the shape of 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.940
 these profiles will be installed in a 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.830
 vertical in the aforementioned holes being 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.540
 duly underpinned to overcome the 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.020
 horizontal forces that produce the 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.070
 blocks in the construction process 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.140
 subsequently and once the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.910
 height of one meter will be introduced 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.260
 Galvanized steel pipes that will form 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.870
 part of the structure of the housing 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.360
 as well as those that will give a rigidity 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.770
 additional to the system just as it has 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.170
 made the construction of the holes 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.810
 for doors and gaps of steps 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.460
 will make the window openings the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.320
 tube introduction process 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.330
 metal profiles for holes and 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.460
 profiles for lintel is will be repeated 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.890
 until reaching the height of 26 meters 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.750
 At this point you should start 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.720
 the placement of the special pieces 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.700
 of wall and cover placed all 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.740
 the concrete pieces will be installed 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.260
 metal profiles type zeta 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.820
 which will be linked as appropriate to 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.040
 the steel tubes that make up the 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.990
 structure of the house in this way 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.580
 the metal structure placed inside 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.560
 the concrete blocks would be 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.060
 composed on one side by tubes 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.280
 structures for the union of 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.770
 foundations the facade the divisions 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.870
 interiors and the deck and on the other hand 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.110
 non-structural tubes to provide 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.370
 rigidity complementary to construction 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.560
 once the part of the 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.240
 cover comes the time to introduce 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.430
 the plumbing facilities and 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.660
 electricity as well as those others 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.600
 necessary for the correct 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.860
 housing conditioning 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.780
 introduced the facilities are 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.790
 will easily and simply place the 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.100
 cover of the house as it is 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.750
 can observe to finalize 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.550
 simply subtract making the 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.500
 placement of sills in the 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.970
 holes in the windows finishing the 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.620
 construction of housing with the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.620
 installation of doors and windows 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.860
