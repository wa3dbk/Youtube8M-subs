00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
first green star in the supermassive

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.340 
first green star in the supermassive
galaxies<00:00:05.640> after<00:00:06.600> watching<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.200> opening

galaxies after watching the opening
video<00:00:07.799> we've<00:00:08.280> seen<00:00:08.550> about<00:00:08.820> 50<00:00:09.330> times<00:00:09.679> our

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 
video we've seen about 50 times our

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:19.240 
video we've seen about 50 times our
prankster<00:00:13.469> comet<00:00:14.009> detected

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
later now I'm just going to go off to

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.950 
later now I'm just going to go off to
that<00:00:45.410> green<00:00:45.739> star<00:00:46.100> it's<00:00:47.030> very<00:00:47.239> easy<00:00:47.510> to<00:00:47.660> find

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
that green star it's very easy to find

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.500 
that green star it's very easy to find
but<00:00:48.290> very<00:00:48.590> hard<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:49.040> get<00:00:49.190> you<00:00:50.059> have<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:50.360> do<00:00:50.480> a

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
but very hard to get you have to do a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.290 
but very hard to get you have to do a
triple<00:00:50.960> jump<00:00:51.290> and<00:00:51.500> a<00:00:51.739> spin<00:00:52.040> on<00:00:52.309> top<00:00:53.030> of<00:00:53.180> this

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
triple jump and a spin on top of this

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.899 
triple jump and a spin on top of this
giant<00:00:53.809> coin<00:00:56.680> okay<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:57.739> I<00:00:57.920> line<00:00:58.190> myself<00:00:58.430> up

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
giant coin okay so I line myself up

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.600 
giant coin okay so I line myself up
perfectly<00:00:59.659> with<00:00:59.780> the<00:00:59.989> green<00:01:00.199> star<00:01:00.530> then<00:01:01.460> I'd

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
perfectly with the green star then I'd

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.969 
perfectly with the green star then I'd
really<00:01:01.850> a<00:01:01.879> triple<00:01:02.239> jump<00:01:02.479> and<00:01:02.629> spin<00:01:03.080> and<00:01:03.379> I'm

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
really a triple jump and spin and I'm

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.640 
really a triple jump and spin and I'm
nowhere<00:01:04.250> near<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.879> green<00:01:05.120> star<00:01:05.479> let<00:01:06.320> me<00:01:06.409> try

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
nowhere near the green star let me try

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:14.890 
nowhere near the green star let me try
again<00:01:11.920> alrighty<00:01:12.970> come<00:01:13.970> on<00:01:14.150> Mauro<00:01:14.360> you<00:01:14.630> can<00:01:14.780> do

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.670 

no<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:30.050> wasn't<00:01:30.260> good<00:01:30.560> either<00:01:32.320> as<00:01:33.320> you<00:01:33.560> can

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
see it is going to take several tries

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.960 
see it is going to take several tries
before<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:36.470> can<00:01:36.650> actually<00:01:36.890> do<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:37.580> triple

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
before you can actually do the triple

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:45.010 
before you can actually do the triple
jump<00:01:38.330> correctly<00:01:39.110> oh<00:01:42.850> that<00:01:43.850> was<00:01:44.030> really<00:01:44.630> close

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
jump correctly oh that was really close

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.170 
jump correctly oh that was really close
I<00:01:47.230> can't<00:01:48.230> believe<00:01:48.380> I'm<00:01:48.590> missing<00:01:48.800> these<00:01:49.220> I'm
