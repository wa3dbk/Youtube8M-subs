there<00:02:59.640> we<00:02:59.790> go<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.269> is<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:01.049> definitely<00:03:01.410> the

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
there we go that is that definitely the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.319 
there we go that is that definitely the
most<00:03:01.620> secretive<00:03:02.220> minikit<00:03:02.790> in<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:03.090> level

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
most secretive minikit in this level

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.479 
most secretive minikit in this level
next<00:03:04.200> one<00:03:04.440> we're<00:03:04.620> going<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.829> be<00:03:05.010> doing<00:03:05.160> is<00:03:05.340> back

in the same room in the prison that we
were<00:03:07.260> just<00:03:07.440> at<00:03:08.000> all<00:03:09.000> these<00:03:09.239> lamps<00:03:09.720> here<00:03:09.840> we

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
were just at all these lamps here we

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.600 
were just at all these lamps here we
have<00:03:10.079> to<00:03:10.170> jump<00:03:10.410> up<00:03:10.560> with<00:03:10.680> them<00:03:10.829> and<00:03:11.099> you<00:03:11.459> can

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
have to jump up with them and you can

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.729 
have to jump up with them and you can
see<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.819> goes<00:03:11.970> 2<00:03:12.150> out<00:03:12.299> of<00:03:12.329> 7<00:03:12.540> 3<00:03:12.840> out<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:12.989> 7<00:03:13.290> that

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
see it goes 2 out of 7 3 out of 7 that

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:14.960 
see it goes 2 out of 7 3 out of 7 that
kind<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:13.950> thing<00:03:14.069> we're<00:03:14.160> gonna<00:03:14.250> get<00:03:14.610> all<00:03:14.819> of

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
kind of thing we're gonna get all of

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.300 
kind of thing we're gonna get all of
them<00:03:15.120> jump<00:03:15.900> up<00:03:16.200> top<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.590> them<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.860> just<00:03:17.010> hold

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
them jump up top of them and just hold

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.259 
them jump up top of them and just hold
onto<00:03:17.459> them<00:03:17.610> for<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.819> second<00:03:18.150> you're

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
onto them for a second you're

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.610 
onto them for a second you're
automatically<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.840> little<00:03:19.079> coin<00:03:19.319> will<00:03:19.470> fall

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
automatically a little coin will fall

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.840 
automatically a little coin will fall
down<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:19.859> you'll<00:03:20.069> see<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.519> says<00:03:20.609> four

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
down and you'll see that it says four

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.740 
down and you'll see that it says four
out<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.000> seven<00:03:21.180> five<00:03:22.079> out<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.319> seven<00:03:23.600> six<00:03:24.600> out

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.970 
of seven and seven out of seven very
easy<00:03:27.480> one<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.840> get<00:03:28.019> just<00:03:28.350> obviously<00:03:28.799> it's<00:03:28.950> a

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
easy one to get just obviously it's a

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.740 
easy one to get just obviously it's a
little<00:03:29.130> difficult<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.519> notice<00:03:30.329> it<00:03:30.630> at<00:03:30.720> first

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
little difficult to notice it at first

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.349 
little difficult to notice it at first
that<00:03:31.200> there<00:03:31.380> will<00:03:31.500> be<00:03:31.650> anything<00:03:32.010> there<00:03:32.359> next

do is come all the way over to this blue

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.840 
do is come all the way over to this blue
one<00:03:48.150> over<00:03:48.299> here<00:03:49.130> what<00:03:50.130> we're<00:03:50.310> calling<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.549> in<00:03:50.760> a

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
one over here what we're calling to in a

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.920 
one over here what we're calling to in a
second<00:03:51.269> right<00:03:51.510> there

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
second right there

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.809 
second right there
smack<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.709> run<00:03:52.859> into<00:03:53.069> it<00:03:53.190> whatever<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.760> you

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
smack it run into it whatever and you

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.460 
smack it run into it whatever and you
can<00:03:53.970> see<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.359> it<00:03:54.569> raises<00:03:54.840> up<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.230> then<00:03:55.350> it

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
can see that it raises up and then it

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.710 
can see that it raises up and then it
says<00:03:55.590> one<00:03:55.859> out<00:03:55.889> of<00:03:56.040> three<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:56.940> that's<00:03:57.090> part<00:03:57.599> of

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
says one out of three so that's part of

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.930 
says one out of three so that's part of
the<00:03:57.780> first<00:03:58.109> one<00:03:58.290> part<00:03:59.250> of<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.370> fifth<00:03:59.579> make<00:03:59.760> it

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
the first one part of the fifth make it

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.640 
the first one part of the fifth make it
next<00:04:00.480> we're<00:04:00.660> doing<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:00.930> minikit<00:04:01.319> number<00:04:01.500> two

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
next we're doing is minikit number two

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.930 
next we're doing is minikit number two
and<00:04:01.859> I'm<00:04:01.920> fast-forwarding<00:04:02.400> this<00:04:02.760> one<00:04:02.910> a

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
and I'm fast-forwarding this one a

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.370 
and I'm fast-forwarding this one a
little<00:04:03.329> bit<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:03.630> that<00:04:03.660> it<00:04:03.900> doesn't<00:04:04.139> take<00:04:04.200> up

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
little bit so that it doesn't take up

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.360 
little bit so that it doesn't take up
years<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.799> years<00:04:04.920> of<00:04:04.980> your<00:04:05.099> time

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
years and years of your time

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.960 
years and years of your time
there's<00:04:06.120> compass<00:04:06.450> number<00:04:06.690> two<00:04:06.870> right<00:04:07.079> there

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
there's compass number two right there

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.580 
there's compass number two right there
here's<00:04:08.970> compass<00:04:09.510> number<00:04:09.900> three<00:04:10.139> go<00:04:10.349> back<00:04:10.500> to

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
here's compass number three go back to

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.759 
here's compass number three go back to
the<00:04:10.680> same<00:04:10.889> spot<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.430> look<00:04:11.639> for<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.060> pile<00:04:12.660> of

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
the same spot and look for the pile of

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.069 
the same spot and look for the pile of
sticks<00:04:13.769> which<00:04:14.669> is<00:04:14.849> you<00:04:15.209> need<00:04:15.389> this<00:04:15.510> thing<00:04:15.930> to

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
sticks which is you need this thing to

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.900 
sticks which is you need this thing to
get<00:04:16.229> past<00:04:16.500> this<00:04:16.650> part<00:04:16.829> again<00:04:17.010> in<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.459> regular

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
get past this part again in the regular

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.520 
get past this part again in the regular
level<00:04:18.180> anyway<00:04:18.479> so<00:04:18.539> you<00:04:18.780> actually<00:04:19.200> need<00:04:19.349> to<00:04:19.380> do

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
level anyway so you actually need to do

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.529 
level anyway so you actually need to do
this<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.889> then<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.729> fourth<00:04:21.000> compass<00:04:21.389> is

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
this and then the fourth compass is

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.350 
this and then the fourth compass is
right<00:04:21.720> here<00:04:22.370> and<00:04:23.370> it<00:04:23.490> raises<00:04:23.700> this<00:04:24.000> thing<00:04:24.240> up

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
right here and it raises this thing up

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.270 
right here and it raises this thing up
and<00:04:24.539> once<00:04:24.750> we<00:04:24.840> raise<00:04:25.020> it<00:04:25.169> up<00:04:25.260> once<00:04:25.380> we<00:04:25.440> dig<00:04:26.159> it

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
and once we raise it up once we dig it

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.560 
and once we raise it up once we dig it
out<00:04:26.340> with<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.610> dog<00:04:26.789> hop

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570

on top of this which is actually much

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.470 
on top of this which is actually much
more<00:04:29.130> difficult<00:04:29.550> than<00:04:29.580> it<00:04:29.700> looks<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.180> there's

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
more difficult than it looks and there's

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.620 
more difficult than it looks and there's
minikit<00:04:31.050> number<00:04:31.350> six<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:32.090> then<00:04:33.090> we're<00:04:33.360> moving

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
minikit number six and then we're moving

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.750 
minikit number six and then we're moving
on<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.930> next<00:04:34.140> thing<00:04:34.260> which<00:04:34.410> is<00:04:34.760> minikit

walk all the way over like this and it

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.650 
walk all the way over like this and it
is<00:06:03.150> right<00:06:03.510> here<00:06:04.280> just<00:06:05.280> like<00:06:05.400> that<00:06:05.460> and<00:06:05.880> then

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
is right here just like that and then

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.610 
is right here just like that and then
compass<00:06:07.500> number<00:06:07.800> seven<00:06:08.840> he's<00:06:09.840> also<00:06:10.080> in<00:06:10.440> this

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
compass number seven he's also in this

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.320 
compass number seven he's also in this
same<00:06:10.830> area<00:06:10.890> after<00:06:11.400> we<00:06:11.610> pick<00:06:11.760> up<00:06:11.820> the<00:06:11.970> sword<00:06:12.210> and

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
same area after we pick up the sword and

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.970 
same area after we pick up the sword and
slice<00:06:12.510> around<00:06:12.690> couples<00:06:13.470> number<00:06:13.650> seven<00:06:13.920> is

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:13.980 
slice around couples number seven is

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.920 
slice around couples number seven is
also<00:06:14.220> in<00:06:14.310> the<00:06:14.370> same<00:06:14.580> area<00:06:14.910> it's<00:06:15.090> the<00:06:15.150> fish<00:06:15.540> and

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
also in the same area it's the fish and

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.660 
also in the same area it's the fish and
it<00:06:16.380> is<00:06:16.530> all<00:06:16.710> the<00:06:16.800> way<00:06:16.890> on<00:06:17.130> the<00:06:17.250> top<00:06:17.430> of<00:06:17.610> the

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
it is all the way on the top of the

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:18.080 
it is all the way on the top of the
steps

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
steps

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.990 
steps
so<00:06:18.570> just<00:06:19.040> looks<00:06:20.040> at<00:06:20.160> the<00:06:20.220> compass<00:06:20.520> look<00:06:20.730> to<00:06:20.850> the

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
so just looks at the compass look to the

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.760 
so just looks at the compass look to the
fish<00:06:21.390> and<00:06:21.660> then<00:06:21.870> follow<00:06:22.260> it<00:06:22.410> all<00:06:22.530> the<00:06:22.680> way<00:06:22.740> up

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
fish and then follow it all the way up

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.120 
fish and then follow it all the way up
here<00:06:23.750> right<00:06:24.750> there's<00:06:25.020> compass<00:06:25.470> number<00:06:25.740> seven

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
here right there's compass number seven

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.950 
here right there's compass number seven
so<00:06:26.640> we<00:06:26.730> have<00:06:26.820> one<00:06:27.090> more<00:06:27.210> compass<00:06:27.570> to<00:06:27.660> go<00:06:27.780> there

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
so we have one more compass to go there

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.330 
so we have one more compass to go there
are<00:06:28.050> ten<00:06:28.290> mini<00:06:28.470> kits<00:06:28.680> in<00:06:28.800> every<00:06:28.950> single<00:06:29.100> one

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
are ten mini kits in every single one

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.640 
are ten mini kits in every single one
and<00:06:29.550> there<00:06:29.730> are<00:06:29.880> eight<00:06:30.180> compasses<00:06:30.990> or<00:06:31.440> eight

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
and there are eight compasses or eight

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.050 
and there are eight compasses or eight
things<00:06:31.860> you<00:06:32.010> need<00:06:32.130> to<00:06:32.160> find<00:06:32.490> with<00:06:32.640> the<00:06:32.730> compass

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
things you need to find with the compass

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.690 
things you need to find with the compass
hidden<00:06:33.840> items<00:06:34.140> in<00:06:34.320> each<00:06:34.440> one<00:06:34.650> this<00:06:35.280> is<00:06:35.460> meeting

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 
hidden items in each one this is meeting

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.490 
hidden items in each one this is meeting
at<00:06:35.790> number<00:06:36.000> nine<00:06:36.210> now<00:06:36.540> we<00:06:36.870> take<00:06:37.020> this<00:06:37.140> barrel

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
at number nine now we take this barrel

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.840 
at number nine now we take this barrel
all<00:06:37.620> the<00:06:37.710> way<00:06:37.800> across<00:06:38.010> but<00:06:38.400> don't<00:06:38.550> put<00:06:38.700> it<00:06:38.790> on

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
all the way across but don't put it on

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.450 
all the way across but don't put it on
that<00:06:38.970> switch<00:06:39.210> pray<00:06:39.480> yet<00:06:39.720> we<00:06:39.960> can<00:06:40.080> jump<00:06:40.320> up<00:06:40.500> here

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
that switch pray yet we can jump up here

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.100 
that switch pray yet we can jump up here
with<00:06:41.819> a<00:06:41.910> female<00:06:42.300> character<00:06:42.479> you<00:06:42.780> might<00:06:42.900> not<00:06:43.050> be

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
with a female character you might not be

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
with a female character you might not be
able<00:06:43.169> make<00:06:43.350> the<00:06:43.440> jump<00:06:43.620> without<00:06:43.740> female

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
able make the jump without female

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.050 
able make the jump without female
character<00:06:44.370> because<00:06:44.550> they<00:06:44.610> can<00:06:44.759> jump<00:06:44.910> a<00:06:44.970> little

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 
character because they can jump a little

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.680 
character because they can jump a little
bit<00:06:45.210> higher

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
bit higher

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.020 
bit higher
that's<00:06:46.199> where<00:06:46.530> mini<00:06:47.009> kick<00:06:47.160> number<00:06:47.370> 9<00:06:47.580> is<00:06:47.789> so

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
that's where mini kick number 9 is so

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.870 
that's where mini kick number 9 is so
now<00:06:48.240> we<00:06:48.300> only<00:06:48.509> need<00:06:48.720> one<00:06:48.750> more<00:06:49.169> mini<00:06:49.350> kit

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
now we only need one more mini kit

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.059 
now we only need one more mini kit

here<00:07:08.849> and<00:07:08.910> I<00:07:09.000> hate<00:07:09.300> the<00:07:09.449> fact<00:07:09.630> that<00:07:10.319> going<00:07:10.919> to<00:07:11.160> a

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.190 
here and I hate the fact that going to a

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.589 
here and I hate the fact that going to a
barrel<00:07:11.610> is<00:07:11.729> the<00:07:11.819> same<00:07:12.030> thing<00:07:12.180> as<00:07:12.330> some

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:12.599 
barrel is the same thing as some

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.600 
barrel is the same thing as some
objective<00:07:13.590> or<00:07:13.710> something<00:07:13.919> cuz<00:07:14.070> I<00:07:14.130> always<00:07:14.430> go

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
objective or something cuz I always go

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.249 
objective or something cuz I always go
to<00:07:14.639> the<00:07:14.820> the<00:07:15.150> barrels<00:07:15.509> when<00:07:15.660> I'm<00:07:15.750> trying<00:07:16.020> to<00:07:16.110> do
