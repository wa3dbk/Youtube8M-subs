innovations<00:00:03.159> again<00:00:03.490> and<00:00:03.760> I<00:00:04.270> have<00:00:04.450> broken<00:00:04.750> in

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:04.960 
innovations again and I have broken in

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.530 
innovations again and I have broken in
the<00:00:05.050> motors<00:00:05.380> now<00:00:05.680> and<00:00:06.070> we<00:00:06.910> are<00:00:06.940> ready<00:00:07.240> to<00:00:07.300> do

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
the motors now and we are ready to do

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.699 
the motors now and we are ready to do
the<00:00:07.660> maiden<00:00:07.990> flight<00:00:08.290> here<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:11.080> i<00:00:11.110> want<00:00:11.499> to<00:00:11.589> show

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:11.709 
the maiden flight here so i want to show

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.610 
the maiden flight here so i want to show
you<00:00:11.740> real<00:00:11.980> quick<00:00:12.009> how<00:00:12.219> this<00:00:12.519> folding<00:00:13.620> deal

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.620 
you real quick how this folding deal

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.160 
you real quick how this folding deal
works<00:00:14.950> and<00:00:15.429> how<00:00:15.910> i<00:00:15.940> have<00:00:16.180> it<00:00:16.360> set<00:00:16.390> up<00:00:16.600> to<00:00:16.930> fold

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
works and how i have it set up to fold

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.470 
works and how i have it set up to fold
the<00:00:17.320> antennas<00:00:17.770> down<00:00:18.010> and<00:00:18.250> stuff<00:00:18.490> too<00:00:18.760> so

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
the antennas down and stuff too so

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.300 
the antennas down and stuff too so
basically<00:00:19.960> you<00:00:20.050> got<00:00:20.170> your<00:00:20.350> velcro<00:00:20.530> strap<00:00:21.040> here

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
basically you got your velcro strap here

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.640 
basically you got your velcro strap here
for<00:00:21.490> the<00:00:21.580> battery<00:00:22.000> and<00:00:22.120> that<00:00:22.330> also<00:00:22.650> will

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
for the battery and that also will

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.410 
for the battery and that also will
retain<00:00:24.100> your<00:00:24.280> antennas<00:00:24.850> for<00:00:24.880> when<00:00:25.210> you<00:00:25.300> have

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
retain your antennas for when you have

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.300 
retain your antennas for when you have
it<00:00:25.540> in<00:00:25.570> your<00:00:25.690> pocket<00:00:25.900> and<00:00:26.320> then<00:00:26.890> you<00:00:27.010> can<00:00:27.160> just

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
it in your pocket and then you can just

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.910 
it in your pocket and then you can just
clip<00:00:27.550> these<00:00:27.730> suckers<00:00:28.060> up<00:00:28.240> like<00:00:28.810> this<00:00:29.080> and<00:00:29.410> take

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
clip these suckers up like this and take

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.920 
clip these suckers up like this and take
the<00:00:30.070> pressure<00:00:30.280> off<00:00:30.460> the<00:00:30.760> solder<00:00:31.030> joints<00:00:31.630> for

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
the pressure off the solder joints for

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.540 
the pressure off the solder joints for
the<00:00:31.990> antennas<00:00:32.529> i<00:00:32.679> have<00:00:32.800> a<00:00:32.859> little<00:00:33.070> zip<00:00:33.339> tie

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
the antennas i have a little zip tie

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.029 
the antennas i have a little zip tie
here<00:00:33.879> to<00:00:33.999> hold<00:00:34.179> the<00:00:34.359> antenna<00:00:34.629> there<00:00:35.469> and<00:00:35.890> then

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
here to hold the antenna there and then

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:38.610 
here to hold the antenna there and then
this<00:00:36.219> side<00:00:36.489> has<00:00:36.760> some<00:00:37.539> cutouts<00:00:37.780> and<00:00:38.199> the<00:00:38.260> frame

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
this side has some cutouts and the frame

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.560 
this side has some cutouts and the frame
here<00:00:38.949> where<00:00:39.159> the<00:00:39.640> antenna<00:00:39.909> snaps<00:00:40.239> into<00:00:40.480> place

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
here where the antenna snaps into place

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.250 
here where the antenna snaps into place
and<00:00:41.289> that's<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:41.949> receiver<00:00:42.719> dipole<00:00:43.719> there<00:00:44.019> and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
and that's the receiver dipole there and

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.000 
and that's the receiver dipole there and
this<00:00:45.069> is<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.370> vtx<00:00:46.120> dipole<00:00:46.899> here<00:00:47.140> and<00:00:47.350> then<00:00:47.890> the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
this is the vtx dipole here and then the

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.389 
this is the vtx dipole here and then the
folding<00:00:48.339> mechanism<00:00:48.489> is<00:00:49.059> dead<00:00:49.269> simple

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
folding mechanism is dead simple

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.399 
folding mechanism is dead simple
basically<00:00:51.399> folds<00:00:52.149> up<00:00:52.269> nice<00:00:52.449> and<00:00:52.510> compact<00:00:53.079> like

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
basically folds up nice and compact like

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.630 
basically folds up nice and compact like
that<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:55.329> then<00:00:55.629> you<00:00:56.019> just<00:00:56.170> fold<00:00:56.409> it<00:00:56.530> out<00:00:56.710> like

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
that and then you just fold it out like

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.629 
that and then you just fold it out like
this<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.149> the<00:00:58.929> neodymium<00:00:59.379> magnets<00:01:00.280> lock

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:00.639 
this and the neodymium magnets lock

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:03.350 
this and the neodymium magnets lock
right<00:01:00.909> into<00:01:01.179> place<00:01:01.389> every<00:01:01.780> time<00:01:01.989> boom<00:01:02.499> and

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
right into place every time boom and

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.810 
right into place every time boom and
boom<00:01:04.360> and<00:01:04.770> it's<00:01:05.770> as<00:01:05.950> simple<00:01:06.100> as<00:01:06.399> can<00:01:06.610> be

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
boom and it's as simple as can be

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.389 
boom and it's as simple as can be
there's<00:01:07.450> nothing<00:01:07.689> else<00:01:08.020> to<00:01:08.229> it<00:01:08.350> that's<00:01:08.979> it<00:01:09.189> and

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
there's nothing else to it that's it and

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.580 
there's nothing else to it that's it and
then<00:01:09.909> you<00:01:10.180> can<00:01:10.329> see<00:01:10.570> I<00:01:10.600> mean<00:01:10.930> it's<00:01:11.170> plenty

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
then you can see I mean it's plenty

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.999 
then you can see I mean it's plenty
strong<00:01:11.829> they're<00:01:12.520> not<00:01:12.700> going<00:01:12.969> anywhere<00:01:14.009> and

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
strong they're not going anywhere and

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.950 
strong they're not going anywhere and
then<00:01:15.130> if<00:01:15.250> you<00:01:15.369> rack<00:01:15.640> hit<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.299> ground<00:01:16.479> boom

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
then if you rack hit the ground boom

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.209 
then if you rack hit the ground boom
folds<00:01:17.500> back<00:01:17.710> save<00:01:18.579> your<00:01:18.759> motors<00:01:19.920> there<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:21.070> go

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
folds back save your motors there you go

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.810 
folds back save your motors there you go
so<00:01:21.939> I<00:01:21.969> think<00:01:22.210> it's<00:01:22.450> pretty<00:01:22.600> cool<00:01:22.840> design<00:01:23.820> took

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
so I think it's pretty cool design took

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.849 
so I think it's pretty cool design took
me<00:01:25.000> a<00:01:25.270> lot<00:01:26.079> hours<00:01:26.680> of<00:01:27.090> R&amp;D<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.710> figure<00:01:29.710> this

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
me a lot hours of R&amp;D to figure this

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:33.090 
me a lot hours of R&amp;D to figure this
whole<00:01:29.920> thing<00:01:30.130> out<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.960> I<00:01:32.259> hope<00:01:32.530> you<00:01:32.680> guys<00:01:32.829> like

removed from it say

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.570 
removed from it say
a<00:01:53.570> little<00:01:53.840> bit<00:01:53.990> of<00:01:54.080> weight<00:01:54.200> in<00:01:54.350> there<00:01:54.580> so

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
a little bit of weight in there so

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.810 
a little bit of weight in there so
basically<00:01:56.150> procedure<00:01:57.250> for<00:01:58.250> starting<00:01:58.730> this

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
basically procedure for starting this

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.790 
basically procedure for starting this
puppy<00:01:59.240> out<00:01:59.270> is<00:01:59.690> you<00:01:59.900> turn<00:02:00.110> on<00:02:00.290> your<00:02:01.150> controller

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
puppy out is you turn on your controller

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.490 
puppy out is you turn on your controller
plug<00:02:03.800> it<00:02:03.950> in<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.780> should<00:02:05.990> see<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.290> light

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
plug it in and you should see the light

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.550 
plug it in and you should see the light
in<00:02:06.710> there<00:02:08.440> it's<00:02:09.440> binding<00:02:11.200> weight<00:02:12.200> forward<00:02:12.500> to

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
in there it's binding weight forward to

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.850 
in there it's binding weight forward to
finish<00:02:12.800> finding<00:02:13.040> you'll<00:02:13.250> hear<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.430> click<00:02:14.860> the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
finish finding you'll hear a click the

here a little breezy today so fighting

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.130 
here a little breezy today so fighting
the<00:04:21.700> wind<00:04:21.910> we've<00:04:22.330> got<00:04:22.450> a<00:04:22.480> lake<00:04:22.720> right<00:04:22.750> on<00:04:23.050> the

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
the wind we've got a lake right on the

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.080 
the wind we've got a lake right on the
other<00:04:23.170> side<00:04:23.320> of<00:04:23.530> these<00:04:23.710> trees<00:04:23.770> over<00:04:24.490> here<00:04:24.700> a

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
other side of these trees over here a

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.460 
other side of these trees over here a
huge<00:04:25.870> lake<00:04:26.140> in<00:04:26.320> fact<00:04:27.300> so<00:04:28.300> we<00:04:28.900> definitely<00:04:29.110> are

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
huge lake in fact so we definitely are

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.190 
huge lake in fact so we definitely are
going<00:04:29.590> to<00:04:29.650> catch<00:04:29.830> some<00:04:30.390> gusts<00:04:31.919> no<00:04:32.919> here<00:04:34.080> but<00:04:35.080> it

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
going to catch some gusts no here but it

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.860 
going to catch some gusts no here but it
seems<00:04:35.410> to<00:04:35.560> be<00:04:35.680> handling<00:04:35.860> pretty<00:04:36.340> well

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.620 

I<00:04:39.960> should<00:04:40.590> have<00:04:40.680> probably<00:04:40.920> reset<00:04:41.700> the<00:04:41.880> gyro<00:04:42.390> on

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
I should have probably reset the gyro on

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.510 
I should have probably reset the gyro on
this<00:04:42.810> board<00:04:43.140> before<00:04:43.350> doing<00:04:43.770> this<00:04:44.130> but<00:04:44.400> I

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
this board before doing this but I

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.960 
this board before doing this but I
haven't<00:04:44.730> have<00:04:45.450> been<00:04:45.600> so<00:04:45.810> pressed<00:04:46.140> for<00:04:46.260> time

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
haven't have been so pressed for time

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.160 
haven't have been so pressed for time
anyway<00:04:47.970> I<00:04:48.000> haven't<00:04:48.300> had<00:04:48.390> a<00:04:48.450> chance<00:04:48.480> to<00:04:48.780> do<00:04:49.020> that

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
anyway I haven't had a chance to do that

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.160 
anyway I haven't had a chance to do that
yet<00:04:49.850> so<00:04:50.850> i'll<00:04:50.910> probably<00:04:51.120> do<00:04:51.360> that<00:04:51.510> later<00:04:51.810> and

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
yet so i'll probably do that later and

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.170 
yet so i'll probably do that later and
then<00:04:52.320> give<00:04:52.500> it<00:04:52.530> another<00:04:52.770> flight<00:04:53.160> see<00:04:53.880> how<00:04:54.030> it

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
then give it another flight see how it

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:03.110 
then give it another flight see how it
does<00:04:54.360> but<00:04:54.690> so<00:04:54.840> far<00:04:55.550> it's<00:04:56.550> pretty<00:04:56.700> good<00:05:02.120> blown

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
does but so far it's pretty good blown

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.460 
does but so far it's pretty good blown
over<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.450> check<00:05:03.630> out<00:05:03.780> these<00:05:03.930> people<00:05:04.350> over

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
over and check out these people over

00:05:04.470 --> 00:06:04.740 
over and check out these people over
here

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.810 

I'm<00:06:05.410> just<00:06:05.800> going<00:06:05.920> to<00:06:05.950> bring<00:06:06.100> it<00:06:06.220> back<00:06:06.340> in<00:06:06.580> now

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
I'm just going to bring it back in now

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.550 
I'm just going to bring it back in now
so<00:06:07.150> that<00:06:07.330> I<00:06:07.420> can<00:06:09.420> you<00:06:10.420> know<00:06:10.690> testing<00:06:11.200> with<00:06:11.350> it

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
so that I can you know testing with it

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.500 
so that I can you know testing with it
and<00:06:11.710> stuff<00:06:11.980> but<00:06:12.760> it<00:06:12.880> seems<00:06:13.030> like<00:06:13.090> it<00:06:13.270> playing

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
and stuff but it seems like it playing

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:25.430 
and stuff but it seems like it playing
really<00:06:13.810> really<00:06:14.200> well

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.720 

again<00:06:26.440> I'm<00:06:26.590> going<00:06:26.680> to<00:06:26.740> reactive<00:06:27.280> mode<00:06:27.490> right

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:27.730 
again I'm going to reactive mode right

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:33.180 
again I'm going to reactive mode right
now<00:06:27.790> so<00:06:28.350> many<00:06:29.350> accelerometers<00:06:31.800> fit<00:06:32.800> the<00:06:32.980> side

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
now so many accelerometers fit the side

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.860 
now so many accelerometers fit the side
of<00:06:33.220> the<00:06:33.400> thing<00:06:33.610> their<00:06:33.790> self<00:06:34.060> is<00:06:34.390> not<00:06:34.420> fighting

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
of the thing their self is not fighting

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.140 
of the thing their self is not fighting
the<00:06:35.050> wind<00:06:35.230> so<00:06:35.620> but<00:06:36.550> there<00:06:37.060> we<00:06:37.150> go<00:06:38.790> bent<00:06:39.790> the<00:06:39.880> tip

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
the wind so but there we go bent the tip

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.390 
the wind so but there we go bent the tip
of<00:06:40.330> my<00:06:40.390> blade<00:06:41.260> here<00:06:41.650> but<00:06:41.800> I<00:06:41.860> doubt<00:06:41.920> that<00:06:42.250> will

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
of my blade here but I doubt that will

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:49.830 
of my blade here but I doubt that will
really<00:06:42.580> affect<00:06:42.730> much<00:06:46.560> it's<00:06:47.560> good<00:06:47.910> so<00:06:48.910> there's

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
really affect much it's good so there's

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.650 
really affect much it's good so there's
the<00:06:50.170> maiden<00:06:50.530> flight<00:06:50.830> just<00:06:51.730> a<00:06:51.910> short<00:06:52.210> but<00:06:52.510> sweet

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660 
the maiden flight just a short but sweet

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.370 
the maiden flight just a short but sweet
one<00:06:53.020> and<00:06:53.880> later<00:06:54.880> on<00:06:55.120> we'll<00:06:55.360> will<00:06:55.840> test<00:06:56.140> the

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
one and later on we'll will test the

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.680 
one and later on we'll will test the
flight<00:06:57.190> longevity<00:06:57.670> here<00:06:58.180> and<00:06:58.330> see<00:06:58.480> how<00:06:58.630> long

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
flight longevity here and see how long

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.540 
flight longevity here and see how long
she<00:06:58.930> flies<00:06:59.380> for<00:07:01.140> once<00:07:02.140> I<00:07:02.350> adjust<00:07:03.130> the<00:07:03.250> battery

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.550 
she flies for once I adjust the battery

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.950 
she flies for once I adjust the battery
placement<00:07:04.150> and<00:07:04.330> do<00:07:04.420> a<00:07:04.450> couple<00:07:04.780> other<00:07:04.870> things

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
placement and do a couple other things

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.740 
placement and do a couple other things
reset<00:07:05.500> the<00:07:05.620> gyro<00:07:06.010> and<00:07:06.040> stuff<00:07:06.430> but<00:07:07.090> so<00:07:07.270> far<00:07:07.540> it's

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:07.750 
reset the gyro and stuff but so far it's

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.460 
reset the gyro and stuff but so far it's
uh<00:07:08.040> looking<00:07:09.040> pretty<00:07:09.250> nice<00:07:09.460> so<00:07:10.390> there<00:07:10.750> it<00:07:10.900> is<00:07:11.020> I

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:11.470 
uh looking pretty nice so there it is I

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:18.660 
uh looking pretty nice so there it is I
