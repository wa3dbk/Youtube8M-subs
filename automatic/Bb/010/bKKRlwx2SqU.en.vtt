 but it is 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:36.890

 350 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.000

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.650
 I'll keep you 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.570
 and is also stored one 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.570
 the song is really a milk 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.730
 we will keep everything we will keep 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.770
 in it it is silly because it is worth 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.540
 nothing once again we with nothing but 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.610
 well I will teach the template after 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.190
 from yesterday's video where it happens 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.450
 I know I was going to change him I have already changed 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.680
 since the truth does not take long but 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.950
 good as soon as the match ends 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.540
 of signing and good I have goalkeeper 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.610
 so that I give lopez the delights for 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.530
 that entered godín central and martín the 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.550
 right side then change 3 carvajal 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.440
 and they pretty much swear the truth and then the 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.020
 of vanity I have giovanni who takes it 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.030
 quite by the natural as it is here 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.980
 the midfielders are ander herrera and 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.980
 gabi and here I have signed Carlos carlo 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.360
 because bully that is better and from above 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.760
 for a style has the same and in the 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.620
 bench as I said Tuesday 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.420
 that oppose the midfielder from lateral 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.860
 I change it for carvajal the turn that I 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.960
 against since from the time the sports 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.790
 Saprissa deserve some forward 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.500
 study by giovanni morata in case 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.660
 I have to argue before mad and others 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.830
 and paolo the truth I do not use it and now 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.530
 came the eggs because it was already 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.140
 minister the injury to put 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.940
 from Marcos 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.550
 and then here I have Felix being 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.320
 summoned 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.970
 that the kid is not going to be 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.190

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.500
 evil and I did not do anything like that either 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.600

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.310
 the one that does not with magics tokens so 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.470
 nothing once again we are left with nothing 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.880
 interesting in the envelopes but good not 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.560
 I expected a lot either nor wait for me 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.180

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.770
