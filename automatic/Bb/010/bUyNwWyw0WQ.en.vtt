00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
so what are the common problems you

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.070 
so what are the common problems you

at the start line they should go stand

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.190 
at the start line they should go stand
somewhere<00:04:29.760> in<00:04:30.060> between<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.480> curves<00:04:30.780> or<00:04:31.020> in

between the short stretches where the

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.090 
between the short stretches where the
you<00:04:33.390> can<00:04:33.570> see<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.780> car<00:04:34.080> carry<00:04:34.320> more<00:04:34.560> speed<00:04:34.770> and

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
you can see the car carry more speed and

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.400 
you can see the car carry more speed and
the<00:04:35.280> small<00:04:35.580> kink<00:04:35.970> there<00:04:36.180> on<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.570> corner<00:04:37.200> that

the small kink there on the corner that

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.110 
the small kink there on the corner that

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
to see the hill climbers have to go

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.700

standing on the start line wasting time

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.600 
standing on the start line wasting time
or<00:04:48.600> probably<00:04:49.140> see<00:04:49.530> some<00:04:49.710> days<00:04:49.890> not<00:04:50.040> no<00:04:50.250> action

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
or probably see some days not no action

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
somewhere in between and they could see

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.700 
somewhere in between and they could see
if<00:04:54.180> you<00:04:54.360> see<00:04:54.630> now<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:54.840> curve<00:04:55.200> there<00:04:55.410> you<00:04:55.530> can

if you see now the curve there you can

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.580 
if you see now the curve there you can
see<00:04:55.890> about<00:04:56.130> three<00:04:56.730> corners<00:04:57.150> easily<00:04:57.720> so<00:04:58.410> that

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
see about three corners easily so that

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.700 
see about three corners easily so that
would<00:04:58.740> be<00:04:58.890> a<00:04:58.920> very<00:04:59.100> nice<00:04:59.310> spot<00:04:59.610> to<00:04:59.640> watch
