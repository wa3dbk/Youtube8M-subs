00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
switch Easy's website was that it

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.810 
switch Easy's website was that it
doesn't<00:03:14.180> have<00:03:14.330> a<00:03:15.010> there's<00:03:16.010> not<00:03:16.160> a<00:03:16.190> hole<00:03:16.490> here

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
that hole right here where they usually

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.350 
that hole right here where they usually
are<00:05:29.599> cut<00:05:29.780> out<00:05:30.580> so<00:05:31.580> I'd<00:05:32.120> feel<00:05:32.300> pretty

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360

shock<00:05:37.250> absorption<00:05:37.699> absorption<00:05:38.650> and<00:05:41.979> but<00:05:42.979> for

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
shock absorption absorption and but for

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:44.879 
shock absorption absorption and but for
the<00:05:43.159> most<00:05:43.310> part<00:05:43.430> there's<00:05:44.000> your<00:05:44.120> camera<00:05:44.419> hole

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:21.399 

okay<00:06:18.949> so<00:06:19.879> then<00:06:19.999> it's<00:06:20.149> just<00:06:20.330> one<00:06:20.779> solid<00:06:21.379> piece

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:21.409
