00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:09.670
 this day this has been proposed to 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:13.900
 make new corn toast you can 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.989
 see the machine that I built here is 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.480
 works perfectly well built 

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:21.640
 go to explode 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.390
 designed so that the revolutions of 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.090
 mill and the screw this one have a 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.939
 revolution in which it does not turn very fast 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.949
 nor turn very slow since the 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.250
 spin very quickly the mass burns when 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.560
 come out there we see 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.310
 the mass there in the background that has already been 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.420
 ground and here on the other side we have then 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.420
 that we are suffering 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:52.699

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:57.559
