00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.159
 aimed at enhancing a white base in 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.030
 so as to bring out the colors that later 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.030

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.480

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.869
 applied a bit of scotch in

 so that the other beautiful shade 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.709
