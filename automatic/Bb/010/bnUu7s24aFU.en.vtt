00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.190 
we start out visiting the bud flats
these<00:00:23.700> are<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> flats<00:00:24.270> where<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.810> neighbors

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
these are the flats where the neighbors

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.490 
these are the flats where the neighbors
say<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.830> they've<00:00:26.010> seen<00:00:26.510> human-like<00:00:27.510> figures

say that they've seen human-like figures
crossing<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.400> flats<00:00:30.740> while<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:31.980> were<00:00:32.189> telling

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
crossing the flats while we were telling

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.270 
crossing the flats while we were telling
campfire<00:00:33.629> stories<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.500> neighbor<00:00:34.739> did<00:00:35.040> come

campfire stories the neighbor did come

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.000

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.549 

this<00:00:57.670> is<00:00:57.910> what

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
this is what

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:07.090 
this is what
well<00:00:59.949> this<00:01:00.129> is<00:01:00.340> Lindy

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:15.680 

where<00:01:07.640> to<00:01:07.880> put<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:09.100> meteors<00:01:10.100> now

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.289 

squatchy<00:01:16.470> places<00:01:17.280> footprints<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.360> snow

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
squatchy places footprints in the snow

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:27.350 
squatchy places footprints in the snow
they<00:01:20.930> were<00:01:21.109> here

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:43.830 

France<00:01:28.050> too

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:03:26.690 

seems<00:01:44.840> like<00:01:45.080> a<00:01:45.230> real<00:01:45.440> nice<00:01:45.770> squatchy<00:01:46.430> spot

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:04:09.220 

okay<00:03:29.030> followed<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.540> tracks<00:03:30.840> down<00:03:31.080> in<00:03:31.290> there

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.020 

well<00:04:10.230> we<00:04:10.380> did<00:04:10.590> track<00:04:10.920> them<00:04:11.190> for<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.519> while<00:04:11.730> and

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
well we did track them for a while and

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.150 
well we did track them for a while and
as<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.180> can<00:04:12.510> see<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.959> snow<00:04:13.260> got<00:04:13.560> lighter<00:04:13.920> and

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
as you can see the snow got lighter and

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.979 
as you can see the snow got lighter and
lighters<00:04:14.579> they<00:04:14.849> dropped<00:04:15.239> down<00:04:15.450> out<00:04:15.720> of<00:04:15.870> the

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
lighters they dropped down out of the

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.710 
lighters they dropped down out of the
altitude<00:04:16.430> it's<00:04:17.430> harder<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:17.880> harder<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.419> track

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
altitude it's harder and harder to track

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.060 
altitude it's harder and harder to track
him<00:04:18.959> we<00:04:19.680> finally<00:04:20.130> gave<00:04:20.340> it<00:04:20.549> up<00:04:20.729> but<00:04:21.770> it<00:04:22.770> looks

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
him we finally gave it up but it looks

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.000 
him we finally gave it up but it looks
like<00:04:23.190> there<00:04:24.090> are<00:04:24.330> at<00:04:25.020> least<00:04:25.169> two<00:04:25.530> hunting

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
like there are at least two hunting

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.620 
like there are at least two hunting
parties<00:04:26.520> that<00:04:26.850> are<00:04:27.000> working<00:04:27.240> in<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.600> area

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
parties that are working in the area

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.950 
parties that are working in the area
that<00:04:28.229> we<00:04:28.410> ran<00:04:28.680> across<00:04:29.389> and<00:04:30.389> they<00:04:30.540> were<00:04:30.600> using

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
that we ran across and they were using

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.710 
that we ran across and they were using
basically<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.889> same<00:04:32.639> tactics<00:04:33.389> they<00:04:33.660> were

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
basically the same tactics they were

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.750 
basically the same tactics they were
picking<00:04:34.110> out<00:04:34.470> an<00:04:34.650> elk<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.510> following<00:04:36.510> it<00:04:36.780> and

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
picking out an elk and following it and

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.350 
picking out an elk and following it and
as<00:04:38.760> they<00:04:39.180> follow<00:04:39.479> it<00:04:39.750> they<00:04:39.930> fan<00:04:40.350> out<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:41.360> kind

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
as they follow it they fan out and kind

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.969 
as they follow it they fan out and kind
of<00:04:42.539> form<00:04:43.050> a<00:04:43.520> u-shaped

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
of form a u-shaped

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.790 
of form a u-shaped
pattern<00:04:46.979> as<00:04:47.280> they're<00:04:47.550> tracking<00:04:48.539> the<00:04:49.050> elk<00:04:49.260> and

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
pattern as they're tracking the elk and

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.700 
pattern as they're tracking the elk and
I<00:04:49.950> think<00:04:50.250> that's<00:04:50.630> so<00:04:51.630> that<00:04:51.840> if<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.139> out<00:04:52.289> turns

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
I think that's so that if the out turns

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.940 
I think that's so that if the out turns
from<00:04:53.010> one<00:04:53.280> side<00:04:53.550> or<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:54.000> other<00:04:54.560> they<00:04:55.560> will<00:04:55.740> be

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
from one side or the other they will be

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.200 
from one side or the other they will be
able<00:04:56.039> to<00:04:56.330> see<00:04:57.330> it<00:04:57.510> before<00:04:58.080> it<00:04:59.090> circles<00:05:00.090> around

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
able to see it before it circles around

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.850 
able to see it before it circles around
and<00:05:00.539> gets<00:05:00.690> away<00:05:00.900> from<00:05:01.169> them<00:05:01.320> and<00:05:02.930> so<00:05:03.930> they're

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
and gets away from them and so they're

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.279 
and gets away from them and so they're
very<00:05:05.160> active<00:05:05.460> and<00:05:05.940> this<00:05:06.479> is<00:05:06.750> one<00:05:07.020> of<00:05:07.169> the

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
very active and this is one of the

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.860 
very active and this is one of the
reasons<00:05:07.740> why<00:05:08.010> I<00:05:08.039> called<00:05:08.789> this<00:05:09.120> group<00:05:09.510> the

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
reasons why I called this group the

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.409 
reasons why I called this group the
meteors<00:05:10.880> because<00:05:11.880> there's<00:05:12.660> not<00:05:12.930> that<00:05:12.990> much

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
meteors because there's not that much

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.360 
meteors because there's not that much
berries<00:05:15.419> and<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:16.110> apples<00:05:16.530> and<00:05:16.740> fruits<00:05:17.099> in

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
berries and and apples and fruits in

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.529 
berries and and apples and fruits in
this<00:05:17.550> particular<00:05:18.210> area

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
this particular area

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:23.300 
this particular area
not<00:05:19.200> as<00:05:19.410> much<00:05:20.300> vegetation<00:05:21.300> to<00:05:22.110> eat<00:05:22.289> so<00:05:23.039> their

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
not as much vegetation to eat so their

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.839 
not as much vegetation to eat so their
diet<00:05:23.789> is<00:05:24.330> very<00:05:24.840> heavily<00:05:25.320> or<00:05:25.919> relies<00:05:26.639> very

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
diet is very heavily or relies very

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:32.960 
diet is very heavily or relies very
heavily<00:05:27.150> on<00:05:27.750> meat<00:05:29.510> so<00:05:31.099> and<00:05:32.099> we<00:05:32.400> have<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.580> lot<00:05:32.940> of

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
heavily on meat so and we have a lot of

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.960 
heavily on meat so and we have a lot of
distance<00:05:33.510> to<00:05:33.930> carry<00:05:34.229> as<00:05:34.410> you<00:05:34.620> go<00:05:35.340> as<00:05:35.640> you<00:05:35.940> can
