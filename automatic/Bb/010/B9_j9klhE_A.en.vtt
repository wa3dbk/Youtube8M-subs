blown<00:01:33.509> up<00:01:33.689> one<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> actual<00:01:34.560> like<00:01:34.950> tubes

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
blown up one of the actual like tubes

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.969 
blown up one of the actual like tubes
becomes<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.479> actual<00:01:36.840> tunnel<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.680> map<00:01:37.860> is

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
becomes the actual tunnel in the map is

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.410 
becomes the actual tunnel in the map is
kinda<00:01:38.159> hard<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.369> explain<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:39.119> one<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
kinda hard to explain but one of the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.899 
kinda hard to explain but one of the
pieces<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> rocket<00:01:40.680> becomes<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.430> part<00:01:41.850> of

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
pieces of the rocket becomes a part of

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.490 
pieces of the rocket becomes a part of
the<00:01:42.000> map<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.390> makes<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.840> tunnel<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.200> we

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
the map and it makes the tunnel that we

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.160 
the map and it makes the tunnel that we
saw<00:01:43.740> before<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.270> how<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.570> happens

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
saw before so that is how that happens

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.929 
saw before so that is how that happens
another<00:01:46.439> thing<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.979> as<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.460> see<00:01:47.670> here

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
another thing is as you can see here

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.240 
another thing is as you can see here
there's<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.689> be<00:01:49.110> flag<00:01:49.470> there's<00:01:49.799> actually<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
there's on be flag there's actually a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.100 
there's on be flag there's actually a
rocket<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:51.060> turn<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.810> see<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
rocket you can turn on you can see the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.530 
rocket you can turn on you can see the
screenshot<00:01:52.649> there<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.310> computer<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.060> if

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
screenshot there is a computer and if

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.090 
screenshot there is a computer and if
you<00:01:54.630> hit<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> button<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.380> turn<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.920> can

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
you hit the button and turn on you can

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.859 
you hit the button and turn on you can
turn<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.670> rocket<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.299> will<00:01:57.479> blast

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
turn on a rocket that will blast

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.319 
turn on a rocket that will blast
anything<00:01:58.469> on<00:01:58.649> being<00:01:59.009> destroy<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.700> that's

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
anything on being destroy it and that's

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.999 
anything on being destroy it and that's
very<00:02:00.509> interesting<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.930> hold<00:02:01.049> off<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.560> then

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
very interesting to hold off be and then

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.620 
very interesting to hold off be and then
the<00:02:02.159> third<00:02:02.189> thing<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:03.270> there's<00:02:03.450> actually

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
the third thing is that there's actually

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.600 
the third thing is that there's actually
like<00:02:03.960> an<00:02:04.079> extinction<00:02:04.710> easter<00:02:05.100> egg<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.369> this

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
like an extinction easter egg on this

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.249 
like an extinction easter egg on this
map<00:02:05.820> which<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.210> see<00:02:06.240> here<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:06.960> kinda

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
map which you can see here it's kinda

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.930 
map which you can see here it's kinda
like<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> high<00:02:07.890> which<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.640> would<00:02:08.729> see

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
like a like a high which you would see

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.969 
like a like a high which you would see
in<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.270> extinction<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.840> definitely<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.770> same

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
in the extinction is definitely the same

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.290 
in the extinction is definitely the same
thing<00:02:11.280> as<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.550> would<00:02:11.700> see<00:02:11.940> it's<00:02:12.120> kind<00:02:12.180> of

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
thing as you would see it's kind of

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.559 
thing as you would see it's kind of
growing<00:02:12.660> out<00:02:12.959> from<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
growing out from the

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.809 
growing out from the
of<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.140> kind<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.680> underground<00:02:15.010> tunnel<00:02:15.640> here

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
of the kind of underground tunnel here

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.030 
of the kind of underground tunnel here
and<00:02:15.999> don't<00:02:16.689> know<00:02:16.810> why<00:02:16.989> it's<00:02:17.200> there<00:02:17.379> maybe<00:02:17.709> it's

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
and don't know why it's there maybe it's

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.190 
and don't know why it's there maybe it's
some<00:02:18.249> kind<00:02:18.489> of<00:02:18.519> relation<00:02:19.090> but<00:02:19.329> to<00:02:19.749> me<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:19.930> looks

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
some kind of relation but to me it looks

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.989 
some kind of relation but to me it looks
like<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.379> fun<00:02:20.680> little<00:02:20.829> easter<00:02:21.249> egg<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.730> can<00:02:21.849> see

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:21.999 
like a fun little easter egg you can see

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.670 
like a fun little easter egg you can see
a<00:02:22.030> bit<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.269> extinction<00:02:22.959> some<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.349> hives

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
a bit of extinction some of the hives

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.920 
a bit of extinction some of the hives
and<00:02:23.950> maybe<00:02:24.819> it's<00:02:25.030> going<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.209> be<00:02:25.329> related<00:02:25.569> maybe

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
and maybe it's going to be related maybe

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.819 
and maybe it's going to be related maybe
we'll<00:02:26.049> find<00:02:26.290> out<00:02:26.469> some<00:02:26.680> more<00:02:26.709> information

we'll find out some more information
with<00:02:27.579> the<00:02:27.700> extinction<00:02:28.269> but<00:02:28.689> I've<00:02:28.900> got

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
with the extinction but I've got

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.690

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
gun dlc into the game so i doubt the

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.390 
gun dlc into the game so i doubt the
maverick<00:04:07.479> is<00:04:07.569> a<00:04:07.629> one-off<00:04:07.989> like<00:04:08.439> black<00:04:08.739> ops<00:04:08.919> 2<00:04:09.189> i

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
maverick is a one-off like black ops 2 i

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.550 
maverick is a one-off like black ops 2 i
think<00:04:09.969> there's<00:04:10.150> going<00:04:10.299> to<00:04:10.389> be<00:04:10.419> more<00:04:10.750> DLC<00:04:11.259> packs

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
think there's going to be more DLC packs

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.990 
think there's going to be more DLC packs
where<00:04:11.859> there's<00:04:12.039> going<00:04:12.159> to<00:04:12.219> be<00:04:12.250> weapons<00:04:12.789> as

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
where there's going to be weapons as

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.869 
where there's going to be weapons as
kind<00:04:13.930> of<00:04:13.959> like<00:04:14.019> an<00:04:14.169> extra<00:04:14.409> feature<00:04:14.799> arte<00:04:15.669> yeah
