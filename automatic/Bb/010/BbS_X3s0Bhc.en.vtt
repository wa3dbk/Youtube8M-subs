00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.120
 of trail running review dotcom today 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.680
 let's analyze the new adidas 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.590
 xd 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.590
 four pages you have the adidas 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.289
 with very Olympic colors this is this 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.110
 color combination has been the one 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.460
 adidas has chosen for the Olympics of 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:35.579
 london lassad and 0 x 4 with colors 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.130
 olympic as it is a very slipper 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.040
 slight 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:43.670
 and marked especially by this super 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.980
 floor of the continental house that you saw 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.880
 the shoe from top to bottom not only the 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.790
 piece where the studs are part 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.950
 of the sole is not that they are embedded 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.190
 but it is a whole piece of the house 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.680
 continental to give greater security to 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.140
 these tacos as you see some super tacos 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.530
 prominent here you see in the 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.590
 Taco relief 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.289
 how it goes around the edges of the sole 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.689
 to give some stability even 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.329
 come out a little more from the sole I do not know if 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.720
 you get to appreciate here how they are like 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.850
 a little open 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.320
 and in the central part oriented tacos 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.020
 especially to the scream to the grip in 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.110
 traction in this sense as you see tacos 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.740
 arranged horizontally while 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.050
 the sides that favor the 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.100
 lateral stability fixes up here and 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.490
 half to the party 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.220
 more from the heel where you can take advantage of 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.380
 a reception area and the tacos are 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.720
 multidirectional to avoid the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.750
 skid when we hit with him with 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.270
 the heel also the studs come out a 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.369
 little more than the average sole towards the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.920
 sides what is going to give certain a 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.770
 small gain of stability so 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.979
 so much continental sole super hyper mega 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.890
 resistant to abrasion and theoretically 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.620
 ensure good grip on terrains 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.300
 wet this all this will logically be 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.430
 have to check it for what it does 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.890
 reference to the midsole as you see a 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.890
 Very small profile with a very low drop 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.540
 a heel fall 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:32.690
 towards the toe very low bending something 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.930
 strange at least it costs us 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.640
 flexible and fixed that does not have an area 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.400
 concrete bending more or less stress 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.700
 the whole shoe itself more a little 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.860
 about this part 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.849
 and material here a new pretty hard 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.629
 even in the inner part we can 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:55.569
 say that this orange part is harder 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.730
 appears as a bit softer so 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.819
 so much is a sneaker that can go well 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.959
 especially 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:06.239
 given his lightness his suit and his sole 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.969
 half sole for for example tests of 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.489
 vertical kilometer for very 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:14.730
 very muddy grass grass very happy 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:20.040
 running but you do not go very well especially 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:22.889
 for terrains with more more more compact 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.170
 as for example it can be land 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.659
 more compact and especially in distances 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.939
 long will not go very well either because 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.549
 they do not have much cushioning either 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:35.099
 I see a little hard for him for these 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.329
 longer distances also dedicated 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:41.669
 for lightweight runners or weight 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.760
 a little light medium but about 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:47.460
 all light 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.970
 let's see the upper now 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.580
 as you see superminimalist tongue 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.770
 look here, it comes out very little already 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.170
 adidas sometimes does this as you can see 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.930
 practically a piece of cloth in the 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.130
 pearl part of here front with a 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.250
 technology that adidas calls web sprint 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.350
 and it's all this / mesh that gives you a lot 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.840
 consistency to the per 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.600
 without any stitching it's like a plastic 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.150
 that perfectly unites all these areas 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.760
 and it gives a lot of consistency to all this 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.810
 part without any seam as we say 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.419
 so as not to disturb the fingers 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.930
 also here adidas has gotten technology 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.810
 culÃ© see what you want are materials that 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.810
 they dry more much faster or faster 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.940
 the regular polyester thus 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.249
 as you see here the upper superminimalist 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.949
 it has nothing 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:45.459
 not even here has a little chassis 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:48.369
 but little notice here a little chassis in 

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:52.059
 all this part of the heel to give a lot 

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:54.969
 lightness a lot of ease of drying a 

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:59.020
 most dedicated shoe practically to 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:05:01.949
 the competition or in very fast terrain 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.400
 let's open it fix the laces that 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:07.740
 they do not run too well 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.950
 and what it is said, notice this plant 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.840
 this template 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.930
 that is nothing 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.800
 Holed to facilitate perspiration 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.020
 but no it 's not quite minimalist 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.270
 and look here in the interior very well 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.970
 finished from this posture towards 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.080
 in front there is no more stitching 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.080
 that this protection here 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.670
 and as you see very little padding also 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.160
 in the heel 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:40.210
 quite like 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.960
 more than comfortable without seams but a 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.690
 dog 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.710
 what do you see is a fabric and little 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.139
 plus 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.259
 here already directly is my finger 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:53.009
 has absolutely nothing else here a 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:55.860
 tape 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:59.150
 to give a bit of consistency to all 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:02.110
 this area here but neither 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.110
 much more 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.880
 let's put the template again 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:14.310
 and here you have friends basically me 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:17.180
 I would say it is 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.280
 and a sole 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.129
 with a small apple we could 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.569
 name it if you're adidas adizero 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:29.740
 x of 4 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:31.809
 to bring the new adidas bets 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:35.189
 in this in this range 

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:35.189
 therefore friends 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:42.090
 mostly very important sole based 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.610
 practically this shoe is based on 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:47.910
 this school and a super person 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.560
 minimalist adidas adizero x of 4 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.150
 analyzed by trail running review 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.419
 puntocom see you in the next
