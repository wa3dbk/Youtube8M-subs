00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
the Zeiss T star UV filters so this is a

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.580 
the Zeiss T star UV filters so this is a
67<00:00:26.349> millimeter<00:00:27.349> filter<00:00:27.859> comes<00:00:28.430> in<00:00:28.580> this<00:00:28.699> box

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
67 millimeter filter comes in this box

just<00:00:31.000> to<00:00:32.000> compare<00:00:32.449> this<00:00:32.900> is<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.320> size<00:00:33.590> of<00:00:33.920> a

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
just to compare this is the size of a

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.930 
just to compare this is the size of a
filter<00:00:35.660> this<00:00:36.140> is<00:00:36.320> a<00:00:36.430> freighter<00:00:37.430> compared<00:00:37.790> to

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
filter this is a freighter compared to

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.450 
filter this is a freighter compared to
this<00:00:38.059> one<00:00:38.300> but<00:00:38.449> this<00:00:38.540> is<00:00:38.600> a<00:00:38.860> holy<00:00:39.860> up<00:00:40.040> Pro

one-digit over so this as far as I
understand<00:00:44.120> is<00:00:44.409> one<00:00:45.409> of<00:00:45.470> the<00:00:45.530> best<00:00:45.739> ones<00:00:46.129> out

there as far as UV filters goes he's the

00:00:50.570 --> 00:01:03.479 
there as far as UV filters goes he's the
one<00:00:50.720> to<00:00:50.809> be<00:00:50.900> affecting<00:00:51.379> image<00:00:51.650> quality

necessarily killer in the filter in here

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.109 
necessarily killer in the filter in here
because<00:01:41.600> it's<00:01:41.749> way<00:01:42.289> over<00:01:42.740> sized<00:01:42.979> for<00:01:43.399> this

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
because it's way over sized for this

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.929 
because it's way over sized for this
filter<00:01:44.679> they<00:01:45.679> could<00:01:45.829> probably<00:01:45.979> fit<00:01:46.280> some<00:01:46.429> 95

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939

use in all their lenses and supposedly

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.770 
use in all their lenses and supposedly
they<00:02:02.179> say<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:02.719> it's<00:02:03.469> matched<00:02:03.859> to<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.780> Zeiss

UV<00:02:11.300> filters

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
UV filters

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.640 
UV filters
you<00:02:13.310> know<00:02:13.400> these<00:02:13.910> these<00:02:14.390> lenses<00:02:14.750> of<00:02:14.810> expense<00:02:15.470> I

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
you know these these lenses of expense I

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.210 
you know these these lenses of expense I
saw<00:02:15.950> its<00:02:17.020> if<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.200> doesn't<00:02:18.530> affect<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.920> picture

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
saw its if it doesn't affect the picture

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.460 
saw its if it doesn't affect the picture
quality<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.970> figured<00:02:20.600> it<00:02:20.720> wouldn't<00:02:20.900> be<00:02:21.290> worth

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470

quality I figured it wouldn't be worth
your<00:02:21.650> trying<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.910> here's<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.300> filter<00:02:23.510> itself

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
like the way to the white filter feels

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.740 
like the way to the white filter feels
like<00:03:05.120> it's<00:03:06.010> this<00:03:07.010> nice<00:03:07.280> texture<00:03:07.940> on<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.510> side

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.200 
as far as the image quality no I mean
it's<00:03:13.850> just<00:03:13.910> hard<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.450> tell

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
it's just hard to tell

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.780 
it's just hard to tell
so<00:03:17.210> those<00:03:17.360> nice<00:03:17.540> is<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.780> little<00:03:18.050> bit<00:03:18.140> slicker

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
so those nice is a little bit slicker

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.930 
so those nice is a little bit slicker
because<00:03:19.790> of<00:03:19.910> that<00:03:20.000> coating<00:03:20.450> on<00:03:20.600> there<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.940> so

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
because of that coating on there and so

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.780 
because of that coating on there and so
as<00:03:23.420> you<00:03:23.630> can<00:03:23.750> see<00:03:23.990> the<00:03:24.110> reflection<00:03:24.830> of<00:03:25.160> the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
as you can see the reflection of the

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.560 
as you can see the reflection of the
light<00:03:26.090> above<00:03:26.960> me<00:03:27.170> it's<00:03:27.650> nice<00:03:28.490> tone<00:03:29.090> of<00:03:29.300> green

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
light above me it's nice tone of green

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.530 
light above me it's nice tone of green
which<00:03:29.930> usually<00:03:30.920> means<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:31.610> this<00:03:32.000> filter<00:03:32.420> has

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
which usually means that this filter has

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.460 
which usually means that this filter has
a<00:03:32.600> nice<00:03:33.700> anti-glare<00:03:34.700> coating<00:03:34.760> on<00:03:35.390> it<00:03:35.470> the

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
a nice anti-glare coating on it the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.460 
a nice anti-glare coating on it the
other<00:03:36.680> side<00:03:37.390> has<00:03:38.390> a<00:03:38.450> very<00:03:38.780> similar<00:03:39.080> reflection

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
other side has a very similar reflection

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:50.800 
other side has a very similar reflection
the<00:03:42.760> one<00:03:44.530> has<00:03:46.660> also<00:03:47.660> a<00:03:47.690> green<00:03:49.060> green<00:03:50.060> orange

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
the one has also a green green orange

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.300 
the one has also a green green orange
and<00:03:50.990> blue<00:03:51.230> type<00:03:51.440> of<00:03:51.620> reflection<00:03:51.980> it's<00:03:52.250> a

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
and blue type of reflection it's a

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:05.440 
and blue type of reflection it's a
little<00:03:52.580> bit<00:03:52.700> lighter<00:03:55.660> is<00:03:56.660> better<00:04:04.240> now<00:04:05.240> one

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
little bit lighter is better now one

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.990 
little bit lighter is better now one
thing<00:04:05.630> that<00:04:05.690> I<00:04:05.900> noticed<00:04:06.320> is<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:08.200> nice<00:04:09.200> filter

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
thing that I noticed is the nice filter

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.020 
thing that I noticed is the nice filter
seems<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.420> have<00:04:12.459> a<00:04:13.459> very<00:04:14.530> deep<00:04:15.530> rim<00:04:16.430> on<00:04:16.700> it<00:04:16.730> you

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
seems to have a very deep rim on it you

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.050 
seems to have a very deep rim on it you
can<00:04:17.150> see<00:04:17.330> the<00:04:17.450> glass<00:04:17.720> oil<00:04:18.549> goes<00:04:19.549> all<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:19.970> way

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
can see the glass oil goes all the way

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.340 
can see the glass oil goes all the way
to<00:04:20.210> the<00:04:20.419> edge

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
to the edge

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.620 
to the edge
to<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.650> edges<00:04:23.010> he<00:04:23.160> would<00:04:23.400> imagine<00:04:24.120> you've<00:04:24.450> got

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
to the edges he would imagine you've got

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.500 
to the edges he would imagine you've got
to<00:04:24.720> go<00:04:24.840> without<00:04:25.700> with<00:04:26.700> the<00:04:26.820> glass<00:04:27.000> thing<00:04:27.270> down

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
to go without with the glass thing down

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.050 
to go without with the glass thing down
there<00:04:29.330> others<00:04:30.330> eyes<00:04:30.510> you<00:04:30.780> see<00:04:30.990> how<00:04:31.050> it<00:04:31.290> has<00:04:32.060> the

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
there others eyes you see how it has the

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.390 
there others eyes you see how it has the
middle<00:04:33.360> goes<00:04:33.510> out<00:04:33.720> much<00:04:34.350> further<00:04:34.620> into<00:04:35.130> the

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
middle goes out much further into the

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.070 
middle goes out much further into the
lungs<00:04:35.580> so<00:04:35.820> that<00:04:35.850> it<00:04:36.030> seems<00:04:36.390> like<00:04:36.690> this<00:04:36.900> one

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
lungs so that it seems like this one

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.900 
lungs so that it seems like this one
would<00:04:37.260> have<00:04:37.350> a<00:04:37.410> little<00:04:37.590> bit<00:04:37.770> smaller<00:04:38.190> piece<00:04:38.760> of

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
would have a little bit smaller piece of

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.710 
would have a little bit smaller piece of
glass<00:04:39.120> on<00:04:39.330> it<00:04:39.360> and<00:04:39.990> I<00:04:40.560> guess<00:04:41.430> as<00:04:41.730> far<00:04:41.760> it's<00:04:42.360> if

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
glass on it and I guess as far it's if

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.100 
glass on it and I guess as far it's if
it<00:04:42.870> doesn't<00:04:44.000> get<00:04:45.000> into<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.420> way<00:04:45.570> of<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.750> lungs

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
it doesn't get into the way of the lungs

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:54.740 
it doesn't get into the way of the lungs
I<00:04:46.470> guess<00:04:46.860> that's<00:04:47.190> not<00:04:47.550> a<00:04:48.060> bad<00:04:48.330> thing<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:53.750> can

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
I guess that's not a bad thing you can

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.180 
I guess that's not a bad thing you can
kind<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.110> see<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.380> difference<00:04:55.410> right<00:04:55.950> there

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
kind of see the difference right there

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.680 
kind of see the difference right there
and<00:04:56.790> you<00:04:57.000> can<00:04:57.060> kind<00:04:57.360> of<00:04:57.390> see<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:57.660> difference

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
and you can kind of see the difference

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.410 
and you can kind of see the difference
in<00:04:58.350> reflection<00:04:59.190> I<00:04:59.280> hope<00:04:59.520> you<00:05:00.000> can<00:05:00.150> see<00:05:00.270> that

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
in reflection I hope you can see that

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.470 
in reflection I hope you can see that
this<00:05:00.540> one<00:05:00.840> is<00:05:00.870> a<00:05:00.990> little<00:05:01.080> bit<00:05:01.290> bluer<00:05:02.060> so<00:05:03.060> the

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
this one is a little bit bluer so the

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.590 
this one is a little bit bluer so the
green<00:05:03.780> it's<00:05:04.380> a<00:05:04.440> little<00:05:04.710> bit<00:05:04.830> more<00:05:05.580> obvious<00:05:06.120> in

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
green it's a little bit more obvious in

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:19.490 
green it's a little bit more obvious in
person<00:05:15.440> it's<00:05:16.440> hard<00:05:16.590> to<00:05:16.860> come<00:05:17.040> in<00:05:17.720> but<00:05:18.720> anyway

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
person it's hard to come in but anyway

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.540 
person it's hard to come in but anyway
this<00:05:20.190> is<00:05:20.490> the<00:05:20.690> nice<00:05:23.060> T<00:05:24.060> star<00:05:24.420> UV<00:05:25.080> filter<00:05:25.620> 67

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
this is the nice T star UV filter 67

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.830 
this is the nice T star UV filter 67
millimeters<00:05:27.120> and<00:05:27.390> I<00:05:27.930> think<00:05:28.170> it<00:05:28.560> cost<00:05:28.770> me<00:05:29.840> quite

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
millimeters and I think it cost me quite

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.330 
millimeters and I think it cost me quite
a<00:05:30.870> bit<00:05:30.960> more<00:05:31.350> expensive<00:05:31.650> about<00:05:32.040> twice<00:05:32.310> the

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
a bit more expensive about twice the

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.780 
a bit more expensive about twice the
price<00:05:32.730> of<00:05:33.080> normal<00:05:34.080> filter<00:05:34.400> I'll<00:05:35.400> have<00:05:35.580> to<00:05:35.700> do

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
price of normal filter I'll have to do

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.880 
price of normal filter I'll have to do
some<00:05:35.970> tests<00:05:36.330> later<00:05:36.510> on<00:05:36.720> as<00:05:36.840> far<00:05:37.050> as<00:05:37.110> image

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
some tests later on as far as image

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.840 
some tests later on as far as image
quality<00:05:38.070> goes<00:05:38.520> and<00:05:40.100> my<00:05:41.100> guess<00:05:41.340> is<00:05:41.370> that<00:05:41.670> it's

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
quality goes and my guess is that it's

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.670 
quality goes and my guess is that it's
not<00:05:42.120> going<00:05:42.150> to<00:05:42.330> be<00:05:42.420> very<00:05:42.630> easy<00:05:42.720> to<00:05:43.020> see<00:05:43.200> a

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
not going to be very easy to see a

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:56.270 
not going to be very easy to see a
difference<00:05:44.250> between<00:05:45.380> the<00:05:46.380> Zeiss<00:05:46.620> and<00:05:55.280> well

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
difference between the Zeiss and well

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:05.380 
difference between the Zeiss and well
thanks<00:05:56.610> for<00:05:56.730> watching

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.450 

you
