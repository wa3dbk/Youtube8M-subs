wasn't forced everything they've done on

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.640 
wasn't forced everything they've done on
TV<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:20.159> Hogan<00:01:20.760> and<00:01:20.880> Brooke<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.470> TNA<00:01:22.470> has

TV with Hogan and Brooke and TNA has

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.980 
TV with Hogan and Brooke and TNA has
been<00:01:22.890> garbage<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.760> I<00:01:23.790> think<00:01:23.880> they<00:01:24.570> need<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.870> get

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
been garbage so I think they need to get

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.110 
been garbage so I think they need to get
rid<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.380> as<00:01:25.770> far<00:01:26.010> as<00:01:26.070> Hogan<00:01:26.370> as<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> general

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
rid of that as far as Hogan as a general

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.450 
rid of that as far as Hogan as a general
manager<00:01:27.300> they're<00:01:28.200> paying<00:01:28.470> him<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> lot<00:01:29.010> of

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.429 
comes off as a little too rehearsed and
not<00:03:56.009> organic<00:03:56.459> enough<00:03:56.909> and<00:03:57.209> pro<00:03:57.959> wrestling

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 
not organic enough and pro wrestling

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.490 
not organic enough and pro wrestling
fans<00:03:58.739> I<00:03:59.250> mean<00:03:59.569> everybody<00:04:00.569> knows<00:04:00.659> it's<00:04:01.169> it's

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
fans I mean everybody knows it's it's

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.249 
fans I mean everybody knows it's it's
acting<00:04:02.189> but<00:04:02.519> um<00:04:02.790> some<00:04:03.659> people<00:04:03.930> want<00:04:04.049> to<00:04:04.169> be

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:04.259 
acting but um some people want to be

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:06.020 
acting but um some people want to be
able<00:04:04.319> to<00:04:04.469> suspend<00:04:04.799> their<00:04:05.129> disbelief<00:04:05.159> and<00:04:05.939> I

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
able to suspend their disbelief and I

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.240 
able to suspend their disbelief and I
just<00:04:06.239> don't<00:04:06.419> know<00:04:06.629> if<00:04:06.780> Hogan<00:04:07.019> is<00:04:07.439> really

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
just don't know if Hogan is really

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.490 
just don't know if Hogan is really
achieving<00:04:08.849> that<00:04:09.030> his<00:04:09.299> promos<00:04:09.810> at<00:04:09.989> this<00:04:10.139> point

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
achieving that his promos at this point

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.740 
achieving that his promos at this point
so<00:04:10.769> I<00:04:10.979> think<00:04:11.459> one<00:04:11.609> of<00:04:11.639> the<00:04:11.789> criticisms<00:04:12.090> i<00:04:12.569> would

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
so I think one of the criticisms i would

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.709 
so I think one of the criticisms i would
i<00:04:12.900> would<00:04:12.930> say<00:04:13.259> is<00:04:13.439> Hulk<00:04:14.159> needs<00:04:14.489> to<00:04:14.759> to<00:04:15.329> just<00:04:15.569> be

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:15.719 
i would say is Hulk needs to to just be

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:18.560 
i would say is Hulk needs to to just be
more<00:04:15.930> organic<00:04:16.620> in<00:04:16.829> his<00:04:17.430> promos<00:04:17.940> rather<00:04:18.329> than

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
more organic in his promos rather than

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.790 
more organic in his promos rather than
so<00:04:18.870> antiseptic<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:20.930> just<00:04:21.930> overly<00:04:22.409> rehearsed

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
so antiseptic and just overly rehearsed

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.550 
so antiseptic and just overly rehearsed
but<00:04:23.250> um<00:04:23.520> no<00:04:24.449> I'm<00:04:24.870> fine<00:04:25.229> with<00:04:25.349> him<00:04:25.500> being

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
but um no I'm fine with him being

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.100 
but um no I'm fine with him being
general<00:04:26.099> manager<00:04:26.639> and<00:04:26.669> even<00:04:27.029> if<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.300> offer<00:04:27.659> up

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
general manager and even if I offer up

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.700 
general manager and even if I offer up
another

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
another

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.730 
another
I<00:04:28.770> mean<00:04:29.490> who<00:04:29.610> would<00:04:29.760> I<00:04:29.790> put<00:04:30.090> in<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.360> spot<00:04:33.740> TNA

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
I mean who would I put in that spot TNA

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.000 
I mean who would I put in that spot TNA
doesn't<00:04:35.070> have<00:04:35.280> that<00:04:35.730> type<00:04:36.150> of<00:04:37.010> personalities

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
doesn't have that type of personalities

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.160 
doesn't have that type of personalities
on<00:04:38.220> their<00:04:38.370> roster<00:04:38.610> I<00:04:39.210> think<00:04:39.690> Hogan<00:04:40.080> is

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
on their roster I think Hogan is

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.930 
on their roster I think Hogan is
actually<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.710> best<00:04:40.860> fit<00:04:41.220> unless<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.790> went

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
actually the best fit unless you went

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.400 
actually the best fit unless you went
with<00:04:42.060> someone<00:04:42.330> like<00:04:42.450> sting<00:04:42.840> but<00:04:43.110> he's<00:04:43.290> doing

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
with someone like sting but he's doing

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.550 
with someone like sting but he's doing
the<00:04:43.590> main<00:04:43.740> event<00:04:43.860> mafia<00:04:44.130> thing<00:04:44.610> now<00:04:44.820> um

the main event mafia thing now um

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.830 
the main event mafia thing now um

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
castings believable on the mic but um

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.050 
castings believable on the mic but um
he's<00:04:49.530> not<00:04:49.710> going<00:04:49.950> to<00:04:49.980> be<00:04:50.070> removed<00:04:50.400> as<00:04:50.640> general

he's not going to be removed as general

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.550 
he's not going to be removed as general
