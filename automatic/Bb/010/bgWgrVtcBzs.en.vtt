going to use a tabletop system because
the<00:00:22.650> connections<00:00:23.010> are<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.279> back<00:00:23.430> and

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the connections are on the back and

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.720 
the connections are on the back and
easier<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.910> get<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.300> we'll<00:00:24.990> start<00:00:25.260> by

now<00:01:29.229> that<00:01:29.409> you<00:01:29.500> have<00:01:29.530> your<00:01:29.619> CD<00:01:29.950> players

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
now that you have your CD players

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.590 
now that you have your CD players
connected<00:01:30.549> let's<00:01:30.820> connect<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.180> amplifier

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
connected let's connect the amplifier

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.240 
connected let's connect the amplifier
since<00:01:32.380> we're<00:01:32.530> using<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:32.799> professional-grade

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
since we're using a professional-grade

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.499 
since we're using a professional-grade
amplifier<00:01:33.790> we're<00:01:34.000> going<00:01:34.119> to<00:01:34.180> use<00:01:34.330> the

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
amplifier we're going to use the

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.280 
amplifier we're going to use the
balanced<00:01:34.869> XLR<00:01:35.049> output<00:01:36.690> I'm<00:01:37.690> only<00:01:37.930> using<00:01:38.080> one

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
balanced XLR output I'm only using one

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.270 
balanced XLR output I'm only using one
channel<00:01:38.740> because<00:01:38.890> we're<00:01:38.979> going<00:01:39.070> to<00:01:39.130> be

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
channel because we're going to be

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.880 
channel because we're going to be
running<00:01:39.400> in<00:01:39.610> mono<00:01:39.820> if<00:01:40.150> you're<00:01:40.899> using<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.440> home

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890

stereo or consumer amplifier you may

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.469 
stereo or consumer amplifier you may
want<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.170> use<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.500> RCA<00:01:44.860> outputs<00:01:45.310> now<00:01:46.240> let's

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
want to use the RCA outputs now let's

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.649 
want to use the RCA outputs now let's
connect<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.020> mixer<00:01:47.440> to<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.740> amplifier<00:01:48.659> you

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
connect the mixer to the amplifier you

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:50.880 
connect the mixer to the amplifier you
want<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:49.930> make<00:01:50.049> sure<00:01:50.080> before<00:01:50.409> you<00:01:50.649> make<00:01:50.860> your

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
want to make sure before you make your

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.430 
want to make sure before you make your
connections<00:01:51.430> that<00:01:52.210> your<00:01:52.479> gains<00:01:52.840> are<00:01:53.020> down<00:01:53.200> and

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
connections that your gains are down and

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.440 
connections that your gains are down and
the<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.490> Paris<00:01:54.729> which<00:01:54.909> is<00:01:55.030> off<00:01:55.180> on<00:01:55.210> the

the to Paris which is off on the

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.760 
the to Paris which is off on the
amplifier<00:02:00.330> since<00:02:01.330> we<00:02:01.450> use<00:02:01.600> XLR<00:02:02.170> output<00:02:02.590> from

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
amplifier since we use XLR output from

amplifier since we use XLR output from
the<00:02:02.890> mixer<00:02:03.220> we're<00:02:03.729> going<00:02:03.819> to<00:02:03.909> use<00:02:04.030> XLR<00:02:04.450> input

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
the mixer we're going to use XLR input

the mixer we're going to use XLR input
on<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.110> amplifier<00:02:06.030> now<00:02:07.030> we're<00:02:07.179> going<00:02:07.270> to

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
on the amplifier now we're going to

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.449 
on the amplifier now we're going to
connect<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.630> speaker<00:02:07.990> this<00:02:08.619> amplifier<00:02:09.100> uses

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
connect the speaker this amplifier uses

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.430 
connect the speaker this amplifier uses
