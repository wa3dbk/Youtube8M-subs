00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
it was so popular everyone started to

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.570 
it was so popular everyone started to

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
breathe the morph and it's thought to be

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.240 
breathe the morph and it's thought to be

mixed with almost all other morphs so to

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.220 
mixed with almost all other morphs so to
pinpoint<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.850> moment<00:03:18.300> they<00:03:18.540> started<00:03:19.110> to

pinpoint the moment they started to

pinpoint the moment they started to
