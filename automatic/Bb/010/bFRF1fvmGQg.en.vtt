you can put your Waypoint here it's on a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.530 
you can put your Waypoint here it's on a

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
dirt road so um yeah I actually came and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.860 
dirt road so um yeah I actually came and
look<00:00:54.170> for<00:00:54.410> these<00:00:54.730> three<00:00:55.730> times<00:00:56.000> one<00:00:56.510> at<00:00:56.660> night

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
look for these three times one at night

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.200 
look for these three times one at night
in<00:00:57.020> like<00:00:57.140> two<00:00:57.350> one<00:00:57.469> day<00:00:57.649> in<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.550> daytime<00:00:58.910> and

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
in like two one day in the daytime and

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.709 
in like two one day in the daytime and
could<00:00:59.840> not<00:00:59.989> find<00:01:00.350> them<00:01:00.500> it<00:01:00.710> was<00:01:00.800> just<00:01:00.980> empty

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
could not find them it was just empty

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.689 
could not find them it was just empty
but<00:01:02.719> um<00:01:02.989> I<00:01:03.320> guess<00:01:03.559> just<00:01:03.950> stick<00:01:04.190> around<00:01:04.309> and

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
but um I guess just stick around and

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.520 
but um I guess just stick around and
sandy<00:01:05.089> shores<00:01:05.330> for<00:01:05.540> a<00:01:05.600> while<00:01:05.810> you<00:01:06.140> know<00:01:06.259> play

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
sandy shores for a while you know play

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.469 
sandy shores for a while you know play
around<00:01:06.740> there<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:07.220> then<00:01:07.729> just<00:01:07.910> come<00:01:08.090> back<00:01:08.119> and

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
around there and then just come back and

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:09.940 
around there and then just come back and
look<00:01:08.570> right<00:01:08.750> they<00:01:08.899> should<00:01:09.110> they<00:01:09.470> should<00:01:09.500> spawn

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
look right they should they should spawn

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.480 
look right they should they should spawn
there<00:01:10.479> but<00:01:11.479> I'm<00:01:11.690> pretty<00:01:11.899> much<00:01:11.990> what<00:01:12.170> it<00:01:12.259> is

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490
