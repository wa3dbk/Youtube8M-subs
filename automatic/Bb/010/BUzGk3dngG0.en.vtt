00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.469
 25 years indeed , 26 in these 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.059
 days the quarter of a century he has not 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.890
 taken away from the formula that made the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.869
 lx5 a worldwide success 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.670
 so here we are with the new one 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.220
 brand new Japanese spider series 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.810
 which updates fine but not better 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.269
 change the usual recipe 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.550
 two dry seats compact size 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.869
 great driving pleasure enough for 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.700
 make it more Japanese 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.440
 Anglo-Saxon as always also for this 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.120
 fourth generation in fact the formula is 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.230
 that of the classic English spiderina 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.300
 of past decades 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.760
 and if you have ever driven a mx 5 one 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.559
 any of these 25 years you already have 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.000
 understood what we are talking about 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.469
 amazing ability to render 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.910
 intriguing even the most gray of the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.379
 roads 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.270
 a magic that starts from the place of 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.340
 the lever with the vertical steering wheel 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.050
 high gearbox on the tunnel and a pedal board 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.090
 really well thought out 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.859
 and that's not all there is another secret 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.629
 seat position set back to the point 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.609
 just to make it intense and tasty 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.920
 the driving experience and indeed to the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.909
 steering wheel of the new mx 5 is found again 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.460
 all that made her famous 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.409
 through the decades he responds in a manner 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.979
 immediate without filters to requests 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.170
 of the pilot 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.000
 there are more effective sporting assets 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.009
 more extreme but this does not remove that the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.600
 little mazda be pure joy for those who love 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.280
 the guide and if you want to believe the words 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.770
 of the designers the merit and also of the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.570
 style the design of the door panels for 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.400
 example wants to give the feeling that 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.540
 body plates slide up 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.159
 in the passenger compartment eliminating the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.380
 contrast between exterior and interior 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.119
 the kodo style that distinguishes le 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.979
 masses of these years has put aside 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.540
 the insistent references to the past of the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.310
 previous mx 5 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.600
 this fourth generation and more modern 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.759
 but fans can stay 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.439
 quiet settings and proportions 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.750
 they are the ones always inside the bonnet 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.640
 there is a four-cylinder 1500 from 130 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.320
 horses are not many but the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.390
 lightness of the car body helps them to 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.640
 make a good impression in years of downsizing 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.020
 reigning turbo is a pleasure to find a 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.420
 aspirated able to stretch with 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.340
 enthusiasm up to 7000 is not a 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.869
 lightning no but it makes you want to 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.030
 hold down the foot to play with the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.619
 red tachometer line the feeling 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.990
 that horses grow proportionately 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.700
 at laps and clear as well as very pleasant 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.310
 double automatic electro-actuated 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.989
 No clutch at all this but a 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.370
 healthy very healthy manual than for 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.709
 respect tradition has grafts 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.120
 short and very defined a command like that 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.739
 well managed to shake the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.239
 certainties of those who think that by now the 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.330
 manual transmission would no longer be right 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.470
 to exist 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.900
 all that made her famous in 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.160
 decades is still here is fast and easy 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.349
 funny 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.670
 in short, very little is needed to enter 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.230
 in harmony with the mx 5 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.239
 faster machines exist more 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.680
 sharp but few are so engaging 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.690
 especially when traveling with the 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.760
 hood lowered and demonstration that the 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.160
 mx 5 is always the same 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.069
 there is something that never changes here 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.590
 here the manual top for everything else 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.940
 think of rear-wheel drive with 130 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.069
 horses do not have to think about 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.120
 wild drifting but never mind because 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.799
 the general balance that makes 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.000
 fun this spain e 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.680
 the accelerator becomes the instrument 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.540
 prince with whom to refine 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.370
 front and rear axle trajectories 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.230
 they look like one thing so much is perfect 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.190
 their dialogue and the steering to all that 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.500
 what it takes to really make it 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.150
 protagonist to the pilot who perhaps 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.739
 could only wish for a steering wheel 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.000
 slightly smaller diameter 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.709
 the appointment is for the summer to a 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.579
 price that has not yet been fixed but 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.590
 that should be pretty 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.340
 on the other hand this is also affordable 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.340
 it is part of tradition 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.170
 today we face one of the most important issues 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.230
 debated since the car 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.569
 sport has set its own fees for 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.110
 a sports car is better than the 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.300
 rear or front wheel drive 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.550
 a party not only for artists but 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.980
 for all car enthusiasts one 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.980
 new 4c sport alpha
