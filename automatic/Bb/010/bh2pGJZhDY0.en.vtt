less<00:01:24.930> than<00:01:25.080> two<00:01:25.500> servings<00:01:25.860> that'll<00:01:26.520> be<00:01:26.580> really

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
less than two servings that'll be really

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.819 
less than two servings that'll be really

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
it's still clear then that means it's

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.190

not<00:04:03.430> cooked<00:04:03.700> all<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.939> way<00:04:03.970> through<00:04:04.200> another
