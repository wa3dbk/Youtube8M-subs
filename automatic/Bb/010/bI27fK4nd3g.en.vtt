00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.710
 Well yes, my love, I tell you that the other day 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.000
 that it was light I was like as 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.530
 scared 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.190
 good if scared but more than anything 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.500
 I was like intrigued intrigued you know 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.990
 why why then a solar dryness 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.510
 and at any time a 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.380
 thief 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:30.260
 if a thief but but apart can 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.680
 get the light but in that short time of 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:38.309
 clear anguish good yes yes clear but 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.660
 rather in that little bit of loneliness so 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.500
 wonderful I started to see how not to give 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.850
 screams like crazy about despair 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.730
 well yes also but but I started 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.130
 reflect on the reflection about 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.000
 that life is dangerous 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.000
 you are not exactly right 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:05.780
 although not so much that but life is 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.810
 it's wonderful wonderful and you have to 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.530
 learn to have to have to have guarura 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.530
 24 hours 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.390
 well not exactly guaruras but to 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.340
 have love every second of life in 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.660
 that instant of darkness I put on 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.660
 check the fuses 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.350
 notice that not as many as possible 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.170
 that I started to review my past life my 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.000
 past life and I felt paranoid 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.860
 paranoid crazy of feelings 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.619
 disgusting towards the human race 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.909
 if there is not with all reason and love of mine I 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.970
 I understand you perfectly 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.800
 I guess you felt like I was 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.170
 liberated 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.440
 but feel like you went crazy 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:03.800

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:07.190

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.470
 They are so furious and so impotent that 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.500

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.500

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.920
