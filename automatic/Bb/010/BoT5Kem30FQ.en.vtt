what

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.010 

today<00:00:18.070> I'm<00:00:18.189> going<00:00:18.310> to<00:00:18.400> show<00:00:18.580> you<00:00:18.640> how<00:00:19.330> complex

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
today I'm going to show you how complex

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.200 
today I'm going to show you how complex
it<00:00:20.260> can<00:00:20.410> be<00:00:20.560> to<00:00:20.740> fix<00:00:20.949> modern<00:00:21.430> air<00:00:21.670> conditioning

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
it can be to fix modern air conditioning

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.929 
it can be to fix modern air conditioning
systems<00:00:22.630> in<00:00:22.779> your<00:00:22.869> car<00:00:23.110> now<00:00:24.099> this<00:00:24.279> vehicle<00:00:24.520> is

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
systems in your car now this vehicle is

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.380 
systems in your car now this vehicle is
the<00:00:25.119> 2002<00:00:25.960> Lexus<00:00:26.200> so<00:00:27.009> it's<00:00:27.220> 11<00:00:27.640> years<00:00:27.669> old<00:00:28.119> but

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
the 2002 Lexus so it's 11 years old but

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.109 
the 2002 Lexus so it's 11 years old but
it's<00:00:28.570> still<00:00:28.840> really<00:00:29.289> complicated<00:00:30.279> and

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
it's still really complicated and

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.110 
it's still really complicated and
unfortunately<00:00:31.930> most<00:00:32.680> modern<00:00:33.130> cars<00:00:33.399> are<00:00:33.730> just

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
unfortunately most modern cars are just

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.880 
unfortunately most modern cars are just
as<00:00:34.300> complicated<00:00:34.660> as<00:00:35.140> this<00:00:35.290> when<00:00:35.469> it<00:00:35.559> comes<00:00:35.739> to

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
as complicated as this when it comes to

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.990 
as complicated as this when it comes to
running<00:00:36.070> heating<00:00:36.579> and<00:00:36.760> air<00:00:36.850> conditioning

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
running heating and air conditioning

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.049 
running heating and air conditioning
systems<00:00:37.780> so<00:00:38.680> they<00:00:38.860> require<00:00:39.190> a<00:00:39.219> fancy<00:00:39.790> scan

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
systems so they require a fancy scan

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.330 
systems so they require a fancy scan
tool<00:00:40.300> like<00:00:40.540> this<00:00:40.750> just<00:00:41.440> to<00:00:41.559> analyze<00:00:41.829> what<00:00:42.250> the

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
tool like this just to analyze what the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.430 
tool like this just to analyze what the
problem<00:00:42.730> is<00:00:42.910> so<00:00:43.750> we'll<00:00:43.960> pick<00:00:44.200> air

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
problem is so we'll pick air

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.190 
problem is so we'll pick air
conditioning<00:00:45.070> system<00:00:45.520> and<00:00:46.440> then<00:00:47.440> active<00:00:47.890> test

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
conditioning system and then active test

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.110 
conditioning system and then active test
and<00:00:50.200> up<00:00:50.530> comes<00:00:50.800> a<00:00:50.920> whole<00:00:51.100> list<00:00:51.520> of<00:00:51.700> things<00:00:51.760> you

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
and up comes a whole list of things you

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.120 
and up comes a whole list of things you
could<00:00:52.239> actively<00:00:52.720> check<00:00:53.110> on<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:53.410> vehicles<00:00:53.890> air

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
could actively check on the vehicles air

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.370 
could actively check on the vehicles air
conditioning<00:00:54.160> system<00:00:54.970> you<00:00:55.840> can<00:00:55.960> check<00:00:56.170> all

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
conditioning system you can check all

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.440 
conditioning system you can check all
kinds<00:00:56.770> of<00:00:56.829> sensors<00:00:57.190> with<00:00:57.400> these<00:00:57.520> machines<00:00:57.700> you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
kinds of sensors with these machines you

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.910 
kinds of sensors with these machines you
can<00:00:58.600> activate<00:00:59.079> them<00:00:59.290> and<00:00:59.320> then<00:00:59.500> see<00:00:59.680> if<00:00:59.800> they

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
can activate them and then see if they

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.550 
can activate them and then see if they
respond<00:01:00.370> on<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.700> actual<00:01:01.030> car<00:01:01.329> and<00:01:02.170> as<00:01:02.320> you<00:01:02.440> can

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 
respond on the actual car and as you can

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.799 
respond on the actual car and as you can
see<00:01:02.620> as<00:01:02.920> I<00:01:03.040> scroll<00:01:03.370> down<00:01:03.430> there<00:01:03.760> are<00:01:04.149> all<00:01:04.360> kinds

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
see as I scroll down there are all kinds

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.780 
see as I scroll down there are all kinds
of<00:01:04.869> things<00:01:05.110> to<00:01:05.290> check<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:06.280> it's<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.579> good<00:01:06.729> thing

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
of things to check and it's a good thing

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.240 
of things to check and it's a good thing
they<00:01:07.600> also<00:01:07.810> show<00:01:08.140> trouble<00:01:08.590> codes<00:01:08.799> for<00:01:09.009> the<00:01:09.130> air

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
they also show trouble codes for the air

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.460 
they also show trouble codes for the air
conditioning<00:01:09.790> system<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.390> this<00:01:11.110> is<00:01:11.170> well

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
conditioning system and this is well

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.170 
conditioning system and this is well
beyond<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:11.979> simple<00:01:12.189> trouble<00:01:12.670> code<00:01:12.850> you<00:01:13.000> get

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
beyond the simple trouble code you get

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.420 
beyond the simple trouble code you get
from<00:01:13.360> a<00:01:13.420> cheap<00:01:13.630> scan<00:01:13.930> tool<00:01:14.200> they<00:01:14.799> don't<00:01:15.009> access

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
from a cheap scan tool they don't access

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.190 
from a cheap scan tool they don't access
any<00:01:15.610> of<00:01:15.729> these<00:01:15.850> codes<00:01:16.149> you<00:01:16.270> need<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.450> fancy<00:01:16.780> scan

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
any of these codes you need a fancy scan

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.170 
any of these codes you need a fancy scan
tool<00:01:17.409> like<00:01:17.619> this<00:01:17.829> in<00:01:18.250> order<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.610> access<00:01:18.760> the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
tool like this in order to access the

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.539 
tool like this in order to access the
air<00:01:19.330> conditioning<00:01:19.960> trouble<00:01:20.290> codes<00:01:20.470> and<00:01:21.370> in

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
air conditioning trouble codes and in

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.490 
air conditioning trouble codes and in
this<00:01:21.700> case<00:01:21.970> it's<00:01:22.510> the<00:01:22.690> code<00:01:22.870> for<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.200> solar

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
this case it's the code for the solar

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.830 
this case it's the code for the solar
sensor<00:01:24.130> circuit<00:01:24.400> on<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.790> passenger<00:01:25.299> side

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
sensor circuit on the passenger side

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.660 
sensor circuit on the passenger side
yeah<00:01:26.380> I'm<00:01:26.560> not<00:01:26.680> making<00:01:27.100> it<00:01:27.190> up<00:01:27.310> there<00:01:27.520> that

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
yeah I'm not making it up there that

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.039 
yeah I'm not making it up there that
complicated<00:01:28.360> they<00:01:28.600> measured<00:01:28.930> the

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
complicated they measured the

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.510 
complicated they measured the
temperature<00:01:29.200> of<00:01:29.650> the<00:01:29.740> heat<00:01:29.920> coming<00:01:30.250> from<00:01:30.280> the

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
temperature of the heat coming from the

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.910 
temperature of the heat coming from the
Sun<00:01:30.760> and<00:01:30.900> without<00:01:31.900> a<00:01:31.930> machine<00:01:32.320> like<00:01:32.470> this<00:01:32.530> to

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
Sun and without a machine like this to

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.330 
Sun and without a machine like this to
analyze<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.580> you<00:01:34.060> got<00:01:34.240> pot<00:01:34.540> luck<00:01:34.869> guessing<00:01:35.440> now

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
analyze it you got pot luck guessing now

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.190 
analyze it you got pot luck guessing now
personally<00:01:36.610> I<00:01:37.000> find<00:01:37.210> it<00:01:37.360> absurd<00:01:37.750> that<00:01:38.049> they

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
personally I find it absurd that they

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.500 
personally I find it absurd that they
have<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.470> make<00:01:38.619> cars<00:01:38.890> this<00:01:39.250> complicated<00:01:39.909> but

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
have to make cars this complicated but

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.960 
have to make cars this complicated but
they<00:01:40.690> do<00:01:40.750> so<00:01:41.560> when<00:01:41.740> you<00:01:41.860> want<00:01:42.040> to<00:01:42.130> fix<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:42.580> you

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
they do so when you want to fix it you

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.700 
they do so when you want to fix it you
have<00:01:43.119> to<00:01:43.330> deal<00:01:43.540> with<00:01:43.570> this<00:01:43.869> complexity<00:01:44.439> with

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
have to deal with this complexity with

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.920 
have to deal with this complexity with
such<00:01:44.860> a<00:01:44.890> stand<00:01:45.280> tool<00:01:45.549> now<00:01:46.210> many<00:01:46.420> times<00:01:46.659> when<00:01:46.840> I

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
such a stand tool now many times when I

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.899 
such a stand tool now many times when I
use<00:01:47.110> a<00:01:47.140> scan<00:01:47.530> tool<00:01:47.770> I<00:01:47.979> find<00:01:48.460> out<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:48.760> it's

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
use a scan tool I find out that it's

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.700 
use a scan tool I find out that it's
gonna<00:01:49.030> cost<00:01:49.299> eleven<00:01:49.840> twelve<00:01:50.110> hundred<00:01:50.320> dollars

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
gonna cost eleven twelve hundred dollars

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.649 
gonna cost eleven twelve hundred dollars
to<00:01:50.890> fix<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.250> customer's<00:01:51.760> car<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.270> way<00:01:52.390> it<00:01:52.510> was

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
to fix the customer's car the way it was

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.630 
to fix the customer's car the way it was
designed<00:01:52.840> now<00:01:53.770> if<00:01:53.890> you<00:01:54.040> find<00:01:54.340> you<00:01:54.430> have<00:01:54.460> to

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
designed now if you find you have to

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.670 
designed now if you find you have to
take<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:54.939> whole<00:01:55.090> -<00:01:55.420> apart<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.020> replace<00:01:56.200> very

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
take the whole - apart and replace very

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.740
