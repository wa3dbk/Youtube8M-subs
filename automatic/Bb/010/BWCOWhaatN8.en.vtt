00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello is they from the site jeuxvideo.com 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.799
 today the test of the wheel and 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.210
 harkaitz from black protein to 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.280
 the agreement that the commercial arguments 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.200
 for that only for this product 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.030
 Well, listen, we see them there 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.100
 directly on the box to know that 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.109
 you have 86 g of protein per 100 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.350
 grams of powder 18 26 grams of bca 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.390
 there are 5 vitamins 5 minerals 101 this 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.720
 portable is finally it contains the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.220
 creatine alkaline and so we have 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.220
 wanted to test this 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.000
 so at the level of the ingredients one 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.559
 notes that we have isolates from 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.329
 whey protein is a 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.460
 protein that is no longer filtering and so 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.230
 which is particularly interesting for those 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.660
 who are lactose intolerant or those 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.070
 who are also in phase of diet at 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.449
 since it contains less spikes 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.930
 the exact in general - the concentration 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.629
 is around 90% it's a 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.640
 average 1,1 contrario dewey who are 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.170
 rather around 80 % we also 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.850
 so an emulsifier lecithin of soy 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.470
 miss it that can be a problem for 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.940
 those who are afraid of the ogm award to 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.729
 inside or not at the level of 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.140
 constructions 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.360
 we obviously appreciate a minot gramat 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.390
 who is here good it gives small 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.729
 euros indications for 100 grams of 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.789
 powder so here we have 86 g of protein 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.100
 so if you have different flavors I 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.920
 precise to know that you have so 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.320
 deposit of 750 grams had up to 3 kg 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.179
 you have different flavors obviously 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.890
 will be the aromas the construction will be 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.159
 weaker I think the lowest 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.350
 was at 82% so it seems to me so 82 gram 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.840
 of protein is here at 86 g of protein 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.000
 so it's rather average 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.750
 we're going to say one did not do it 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.160
 rather mean to neeser here and then 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.130
 afterwards we obviously see that there is no 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.349
 almost no carbohydrates and 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.090
 ski ski lipids put forward it's the 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:57.739
 creatine created alkaline 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.479
 we all know creatine my hydrate 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:01.819
 at the moment science has demonstrated 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.369
 its efficiency and its 1 many 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.170
 of articles on it so its reputation 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.270
 is no longer to be done and now to the 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.429
 creatine created alkaline among other things a 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.680
 to others then this new form of 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.569
 creatine would have the advantage on the upstream 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.099
 hydrate not to turn into 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.849
 creatinine to creatinine this is a 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.160
 waste 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:23.319
 so obviously less waste more 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.819
 interesting gold especially julien besson 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.620
 recalls quite rightly that the studies 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.480
 are quite contradictory about him 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.230
 and so at the moment we can not 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.690
 not really affirmed the effectiveness of this 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.819
 product compared to live bomb 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.650
 similarly others argue that there 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.239
 would need less creative karine creation 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.069
 compared to Drac town hall to have 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.730
 the same effects so here we remember 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.980
 that for five years 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.599
 3 g of creatine to create alcaine so there 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.730
 again we prefer to have some 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.069
 independent studies the several 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.680
 studies from elsewhere and that could 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.049
 justify or not that point there so at 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.790
 final we have a product that can do that 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.190
 may seem innovative why 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.140
 talk but contradictory studies 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.980
 which exists at the moment and for my 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.680
 share the precautionary principle 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.269
 applies we do not know the effects 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.120
 are in the long run on the needs 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.340
 of the human body so here but good to 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.280
 relativize anyway as 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.459
 I wanted 10 3 g / 100 g of powder 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.510
 it's not huge in also has to 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.940
 presence of vitamins and minerals 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.430
 but - and concentration are pretty enough 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.120
 low so the demonstration for 100 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.709
 grams of powder 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.359
 so I do not imagine you take a 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.060
 gram of co2 more hours per day 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.099
 a year hence here they advise of 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.980
 mix a pod with about 200 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.170
 milliliters of water or good milk 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.819
 obviously if you have so isolate 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.549
 you do not have fun putting on 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.989
 milk inside since it's not going 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.489
 you still go all the profits 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.169
 so I advise you to take 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:57.919
 water of mineral water and so mee 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:59.510
 200 milliliters of water so a pod 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:05.720
 efforts and inside and here's the 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:10.190
 powder then we have a good level of the pout 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.810
 it's very very very light so that's it 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.109
 problem 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.760
 we have some small deposits on the wall 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:20.810
 so all i wanna be civilities to the like 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:26.780
 the presence of lumps we saw here 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:29.060
 a special meaning but good with the hall to 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.010
 willing did his work hours then the 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.490
 highlights of this product we have 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.139
 so isola so that's interesting for 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.479
 the lactose intolerant and that is 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.010
 low in carbohydrates and lipids 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.710
 low concentration level 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.320
 which is rather average for an isola 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.180
 especially will be certain aromas so at 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.340
 see 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.900
 after level visibility in the 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.940
 presence of chrome bones so that's not it 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.810
 top either I do not know that's it 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.610
 with all the perfumes 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.030
 Feel free to give us your opinion 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.310
 it can play in fact and finally 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.670
 for some the presence of creatine 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.840
 will create cuddly who is rather we want 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.730
 say do not adapt this kind of products 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.470
 so level of my personal opinion it is 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.870
 a product that I appreciated 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.860
 especially about the taste I liked 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.960
 so I was a little embarrassed sometimes 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.060
 who can by the office presence at 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.010
 therefore end at the creatine 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.890
 crÃ©ac'h idron we do not know too much 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.960
 because here we have a lot we have one 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.050
 little so we put forward some 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.250
 things but hey the concentrations that to 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.860
 inside a taste of the world including 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.280
 at the level of vitamins and minerals 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.420
 so give your opinion on your site and 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.550
 I'll see you soon for others 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.630
 tests and where where and arquennes those of 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.690
 in black proteins 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.030
 so it's a product that's pretty 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.340
 so then reputedly the arguments 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.210
 of this product so it's not 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.110
 could hide since it's exactly 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.110
 known
