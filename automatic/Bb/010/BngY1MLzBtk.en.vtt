on that slot but it go what those are
literally<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> only<00:01:24.240> weapons<00:01:24.690> you<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:24.930> get

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
literally the only weapons you can get

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.720 
literally the only weapons you can get
you<00:01:25.350> can't<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.740> any<00:01:25.920> power-ups<00:01:26.400> or<00:01:26.520> anything

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
you can't get any power-ups or anything

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.940 
you can't get any power-ups or anything
you<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.450> dodge<00:01:27.900> left<00:01:28.260> to<00:01:28.380> right<00:01:28.590> by

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
you can dodge left to right by

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.530 
you can dodge left to right by
double-tapping<00:01:29.370> along

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
double-tapping along

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.149 
double-tapping along
so<00:01:30.720> obviously<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.410> top<00:01:31.650> right<00:01:31.860> you'll<00:01:32.040> dodge

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
so obviously the top right you'll dodge

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.980 
so obviously the top right you'll dodge
right<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.580> lights<00:01:32.730> though<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> way<00:01:33.930> to

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
right in the lights though a way to

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.690 
right in the lights though a way to
control<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.500> scheme<00:01:34.770> are<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.400> analog

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
control the scheme are the analog

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.899 
control the scheme are the analog
underneath<00:01:36.510> has<00:01:36.720> basically<00:01:37.710> 450<00:01:38.310> analogs<00:01:38.700> are

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
underneath has basically 450 analogs are

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.910 
underneath has basically 450 analogs are
your<00:01:39.180> target<00:01:39.540> cursus<00:01:39.990> or<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.650> can<00:01:40.770> use

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
your target cursus or you can use

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.230 
your target cursus or you can use
whichever<00:01:41.159> one<00:01:41.370> you're<00:01:41.490> most<00:01:41.580> come<00:01:41.850> forward

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
whichever one you're most come forward

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.330 
whichever one you're most come forward
and<00:01:42.720> if<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.170> d-pad<00:01:43.650> is<00:01:43.860> actually<00:01:44.190> how<00:01:44.310> you

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and if the d-pad is actually how you

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.010 
and if the d-pad is actually how you
move

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
move

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.289 
move
there<00:01:45.770> is<00:01:45.920> important<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.340> do<00:01:46.460> a<00:01:46.490> lock<00:01:46.729> on<00:01:46.939> which

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
there is important to do a lock on which

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.510 
there is important to do a lock on which
as<00:01:47.570> you<00:01:47.659> can<00:01:47.720> see<00:01:47.840> here<00:01:48.259> all<00:01:48.979> you<00:01:49.009> need<00:01:49.159> to<00:01:49.369> do

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
as you can see here all you need to do

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.580 
as you can see here all you need to do
really<00:01:49.729> is<00:01:50.060> just<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.360> top<00:01:50.540> left<00:01:50.840> or<00:01:51.020> right<00:01:51.229> so

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
really is just the top left or right so

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.260 
really is just the top left or right so
where<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.890> enemy<00:01:52.189> is<00:01:52.220> and<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:52.729> can<00:01:52.909> recycle

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
where the enemy is and you can recycle

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.600 
where the enemy is and you can recycle
through<00:01:53.630> all<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.930> different<00:01:54.110> cursors<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:55.460> if

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
through all the different cursors so if

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.950 
through all the different cursors so if
you<00:01:55.759> wanted<00:01:55.970> to<00:01:56.060> be<00:01:56.149> a<00:01:56.180> bit<00:01:56.360> lazy<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:56.780> could

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
you wanted to be a bit lazy you could

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.620 
you wanted to be a bit lazy you could
use<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:57.229> but<00:01:57.909> really<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.030> best<00:01:59.180> way<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.420> do

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
use that but really the best way to do

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.179 
use that but really the best way to do
it<00:01:59.750> is<00:01:59.869> to<00:01:59.990> just<00:02:00.020> have<00:02:00.409> a<00:02:00.439> bit<00:02:00.649> of<00:02:00.680> a<00:02:00.770> 3m

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
it is to just have a bit of a 3m

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.399 
it is to just have a bit of a 3m
especially<00:02:02.060> on<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.210> bit<00:02:02.720> larger<00:02:03.200> faster

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
especially on a bit larger faster

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.380 
especially on a bit larger faster
enemies<00:02:03.920> because<00:02:04.310> sometimes<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:04.789> lock-on<00:02:05.149> just

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
enemies because sometimes a lock-on just

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.930 
enemies because sometimes a lock-on just
can't<00:02:05.600> keep<00:02:05.750> up<00:02:06.039> so<00:02:07.509> there's<00:02:09.519> not<00:02:10.519> a<00:02:10.580> huge

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
can't keep up so there's not a huge

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.000 
can't keep up so there's not a huge
amount<00:02:11.120> of<00:02:11.360> gameplay<00:02:11.599> to<00:02:12.140> be<00:02:12.230> totally<00:02:12.739> honest

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
amount of gameplay to be totally honest

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.160 
amount of gameplay to be totally honest
with<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.280> there's<00:02:13.940> quite<00:02:14.269> a<00:02:14.300> few<00:02:14.420> levels<00:02:14.810> lots

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
with you there's quite a few levels lots

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.570 
with you there's quite a few levels lots
of<00:02:15.260> different<00:02:15.560> set<00:02:15.739> pieces<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.370> likes

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
of different set pieces and the likes

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.490 
of different set pieces and the likes
and<00:02:16.849> at<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.540> end<00:02:17.660> of<00:02:17.720> every<00:02:17.930> level<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:18.350> will

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
and at the end of every level you will

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.300 
and at the end of every level you will
face<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:18.920> boss<00:02:19.450> however<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:21.680> can't<00:02:22.010> quickly

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
face a boss however you can't quickly

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.920 
face a boss however you can't quickly
much<00:02:22.519> beat<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.880> game<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.060> about<00:02:23.269> an<00:02:23.480> hour<00:02:23.569> hour

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
much beat the game in about an hour hour

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.570 
much beat the game in about an hour hour
and<00:02:24.019> a<00:02:24.140> half<00:02:24.319> if<00:02:24.739> you're<00:02:25.130> not<00:02:25.250> particularly

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
and a half if you're not particularly

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.809 
and a half if you're not particularly
that<00:02:25.850> good<00:02:26.090> it's<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:27.470> not<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.680> huge<00:02:27.950> game<00:02:28.459> it's

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
that good it's so not a huge game it's

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.370 
that good it's so not a huge game it's
one<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.150> those<00:02:29.299> games<00:02:29.630> that<00:02:29.750> depends<00:02:30.319> greatly

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
one of those games that depends greatly

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.580 
one of those games that depends greatly
on<00:02:30.860> high<00:02:31.280> scores<00:02:31.670> for<00:02:31.970> replayability<00:02:32.590> because

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
on high scores for replayability because

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.650 
on high scores for replayability because
while<00:02:34.220> there<00:02:34.340> is<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.459> two-player<00:02:34.970> co-op<00:02:35.330> mode

while there is a two-player co-op mode

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.550 
while there is a two-player co-op mode
it's<00:02:36.230> not<00:02:36.590> probably<00:02:37.220> what<00:02:37.430> you'd<00:02:37.580> expect

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
it's not probably what you'd expect

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.259 
it's not probably what you'd expect
instead<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.709> both<00:02:40.640> of<00:02:40.819> you<00:02:40.910> being<00:02:41.120> on<00:02:41.209> the

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
was another great treasure pier and you

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.920 
was another great treasure pier and you

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
instance I would be moving about now

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.520 
instance I would be moving about now
without<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.090> ability<00:02:53.239> to<00:02:53.390> fire<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:54.200> my

without the ability to fire and my

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.319 
without the ability to fire and my
friend<00:02:54.829> would<00:02:55.070> have<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.370> move<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.700> cursor<00:02:56.120> and

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
friend would have to move the cursor and

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.640 
friend would have to move the cursor and
firebombing<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:57.829> not<00:02:58.400> exactly<00:02:59.260> read<00:03:00.260> on<00:03:00.560> the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
firebombing so not exactly read on the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.720 
firebombing so not exactly read on the
co-op<00:03:00.859> skills

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
co-op skills

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.550 
co-op skills
there<00:03:02.270> will<00:03:02.420> be<00:03:02.450> sections<00:03:03.020> as<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.230> could<00:03:03.410> say

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
there will be sections as you could say

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.440 
there will be sections as you could say
in<00:03:03.620> that<00:03:03.770> way<00:03:03.920> laughter<00:03:04.280> jump<00:03:04.520> so<00:03:04.849> there<00:03:05.330> is<00:03:05.420> a

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
in that way laughter jump so there is a

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.300 
in that way laughter jump so there is a
jump<00:03:05.660> acknowledge<00:03:06.170> which<00:03:06.319> is<00:03:06.470> quite<00:03:06.680> good<00:03:06.709> so

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
jump acknowledge which is quite good so

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.979 
jump acknowledge which is quite good so
if<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.120> want<00:03:08.269> to<00:03:08.360> tell<00:03:08.540> you<00:03:08.660> to<00:03:08.780> just

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
if you want to tell you to just

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.410 
if you want to tell you to just
constantly<00:03:09.440> jump<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.890> lot<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.790> character<00:03:11.209> says

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
constantly jump a lot the character says

exactly anything at all

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.280 
exactly anything at all
challenging<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.280> you<00:03:37.730> just<00:03:38.000> pound<00:03:38.810> into<00:03:39.110> them

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
challenging and you just pound into them

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.390 
challenging and you just pound into them
and<00:03:39.560> nothing<00:03:39.739> you<00:03:39.920> really<00:03:40.160> have<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.370> think

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
and nothing you really have to think

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.670 
and nothing you really have to think
about<00:03:40.670> so<00:03:41.540> it's<00:03:41.840> just<00:03:41.959> something<00:03:42.230> that<00:03:42.410> breaks

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
about so it's just something that breaks

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.410 
about so it's just something that breaks
of<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:42.950> gameplay<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:43.370> bit<00:03:43.400> where<00:03:44.120> is<00:03:44.299> the

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
of the gameplay a bit where is the

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.569 
of the gameplay a bit where is the
actual<00:03:44.750> boss<00:03:44.989> to<00:03:45.200> a<00:03:45.290> level<00:03:45.500> sometimes<00:03:46.069> can

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
actual boss to a level sometimes can

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.150 
actual boss to a level sometimes can
vary<00:03:46.880> between<00:03:47.180> having<00:03:48.019> to<00:03:48.200> actually<00:03:48.620> really

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
vary between having to actually really

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.009 
vary between having to actually really
think<00:03:49.610> about<00:03:49.849> the<00:03:49.970> attacks<00:03:50.299> or<00:03:50.599> timeyou

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
think about the attacks or timeyou

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.240 
think about the attacks or timeyou
attacks<00:03:51.349> well<00:03:51.590> so<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:53.420> actual<00:03:53.989> bosses<00:03:54.680> do

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
attacks well so the actual bosses do

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.740 
attacks well so the actual bosses do
provide<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.670> bit<00:03:55.849> of<00:03:55.910> a<00:03:55.970> challenge<00:03:56.150> however<00:03:56.510> the

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
provide a bit of a challenge however the

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.990 
provide a bit of a challenge however the
sub<00:03:56.930> bosses<00:03:57.200> don't<00:03:57.380> in<00:03:58.130> between<00:03:58.579> the<00:03:58.760> things

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
sub bosses don't in between the things

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.550 
sub bosses don't in between the things
you<00:03:59.209> get<00:03:59.360> these<00:03:59.510> little<00:03:59.780> story<00:03:59.989> sections

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
you get these little story sections

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.190 
you get these little story sections
which<00:04:00.799> the<00:04:01.760> game<00:04:01.970> is<00:04:02.150> actually<00:04:02.329> famous<00:04:02.810> for

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
which the game is actually famous for

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.470 
which the game is actually famous for
having<00:04:03.549> atrocious<00:04:04.549> voice<00:04:04.730> acting<00:04:05.209> it's<00:04:05.390> a

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
having atrocious voice acting it's a

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.879 
having atrocious voice acting it's a
same<00:04:05.660> as<00:04:05.840> Castlevania<00:04:06.380> Symphony<00:04:06.530> of<00:04:06.769> the

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
same as Castlevania Symphony of the

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:13.120 
same as Castlevania Symphony of the
Night<00:04:06.950> really<00:04:10.840> probably<00:04:11.840> here<00:04:12.049> there<00:04:12.380> so

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
Night really probably here there so

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.750 
Night really probably here there so
let's<00:04:13.549> just<00:04:13.819> skip<00:04:13.910> up<00:04:15.130> every<00:04:16.130> hundred<00:04:16.519> kills

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
let's just skip up every hundred kills

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.640 
let's just skip up every hundred kills
you<00:04:17.030> do<00:04:17.150> actually<00:04:17.450> get<00:04:17.600> an<00:04:17.690> extra<00:04:18.019> life<00:04:18.350> or

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
you do actually get an extra life or

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.150 
you do actually get an extra life or
credit<00:04:19.039> whatever<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:19.430> want<00:04:19.669> to<00:04:19.760> call<00:04:19.910> it<00:04:20.120> so

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
credit whatever you want to call it so

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.830 
credit whatever you want to call it so
in<00:04:21.310> certain<00:04:21.880> levels<00:04:22.120> you<00:04:22.420> can't<00:04:22.660> actually

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
in certain levels you can't actually

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.410 
in certain levels you can't actually
just<00:04:23.220> stockpile<00:04:24.220> you<00:04:24.430> extra<00:04:24.760> lives<00:04:24.970> really

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
just stockpile you extra lives really

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.460 
just stockpile you extra lives really
badly

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
badly

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.010 
badly
I<00:04:26.500> fear<00:04:27.250> that<00:04:27.280> because<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:28.180> gimm<00:04:28.390> ends<00:04:28.930> up

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
I fear that because the gimm ends up

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.780 
I fear that because the gimm ends up
becoming<00:04:29.200> too<00:04:29.620> easy<00:04:29.830> difference<00:04:30.430> whereas

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
becoming too easy difference whereas

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.510 
becoming too easy difference whereas
therefore<00:04:31.660> lives<00:04:31.900> would<00:04:32.140> probably<00:04:32.620> be<00:04:33.220> all

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
therefore lives would probably be all

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.250 
therefore lives would probably be all
you'd<00:04:33.760> lose<00:04:33.970> your<00:04:34.300> there<00:04:34.570> not<00:04:34.750> having<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:35.110> look

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
you'd lose your there not having a look

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.680 
you'd lose your there not having a look
and<00:04:35.650> seeing<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:36.310> you've<00:04:36.490> talked<00:04:36.760> about<00:04:36.790> 55

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
and seeing that you've talked about 55

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.640 
and seeing that you've talked about 55
stockpiles<00:04:38.590> because<00:04:39.340> of<00:04:39.430> a<00:04:39.490> certain<00:04:39.670> level<00:04:40.150> so

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
stockpiles because of a certain level so

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.930 
stockpiles because of a certain level so
it<00:04:41.650> as<00:04:42.010> I<00:04:42.130> said<00:04:42.310> it's<00:04:42.460> not<00:04:42.580> tough<00:04:42.820> to<00:04:42.850> the

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
it as I said it's not tough to the

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.700 
it as I said it's not tough to the
hardest<00:04:43.390> game<00:04:43.570> although<00:04:43.930> you<00:04:44.230> can<00:04:44.440> unlock

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
hardest game although you can unlock

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.240 
hardest game although you can unlock
part<00:04:44.980> of<00:04:45.100> difficulties<00:04:45.610> so<00:04:46.300> if<00:04:47.260> you<00:04:47.650> actually

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
part of difficulties so if you actually

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.710 
part of difficulties so if you actually
challenge<00:04:48.730> charging<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.090> start<00:04:49.360> so<00:04:49.570> this

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
challenge charging the start so this

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.560 
challenge charging the start so this
isn't<00:04:49.930> really<00:04:50.110> something<00:04:50.550> that<00:04:51.550> well<00:04:52.180> it's

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
isn't really something that well it's

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.600 
isn't really something that well it's
really<00:04:52.750> simple<00:04:52.960> I<00:04:53.200> can<00:04:53.230> recommend<00:04:54.190> to<00:04:54.340> anyone

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
really simple I can recommend to anyone

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.880 
really simple I can recommend to anyone
however<00:04:55.330> it<00:04:55.750> is<00:04:55.900> actually<00:04:56.320> a<00:04:56.380> varies<00:04:56.710> from

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
however it is actually a varies from

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.950 
however it is actually a varies from
here<00:04:57.190> when<00:04:57.640> I<00:04:57.670> first<00:04:57.970> got<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.270> game<00:04:58.300> i<00:04:58.630> beat<00:04:58.900> it

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
here when I first got the game i beat it

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.380 
here when I first got the game i beat it
several<00:04:59.410> times<00:04:59.650> in<00:04:59.890> succession<00:05:00.130> I<00:05:00.670> had<00:05:01.090> huge

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
several times in succession I had huge

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.000 
several times in succession I had huge
fun<00:05:01.690> with<00:05:01.870> it<00:05:02.020> and<00:05:02.260> it's<00:05:02.500> something<00:05:02.620> that<00:05:02.890> I'll

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
fun with it and it's something that I'll

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.570
