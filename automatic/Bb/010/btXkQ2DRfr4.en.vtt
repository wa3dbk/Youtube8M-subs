00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:03.489
 So now the second part of this work magazine scratching bread to bread 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.299
 Drobny has his own configuration-true 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:10.299
 So program for both Windows and Mac 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:14.419
 with which operating systems Jena is furnished him basically does not matter 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.590
 Nevertheless, he is a lot of attention 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.900
 the top match of the premier 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.359
 The Drobo comes with a CD 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.399
 he places these and installs the ban on sports 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.560
 after accepting the license terms as usual 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.239
 you have to give your administrator enough to install 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.060
 in between, the Mac OS x keeps intervening and interfering 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.200
 Initialize unknown medium 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.530
 ignore this request by the eco and again and again 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.630
 depending on the number of hard drives printer comes this message Mr. Streupflicht 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.070
 At the end of the installation, you exit the installation program and throw the CD 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.460
 out again 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.210
 should you have drawn your child Drobo connected at this time 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.050
 just unplug the plug again 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.710
 and now launch the product of the sport from your programs folder 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.660
 Drobny connects again with your way and the sports park checks out at Opel 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.080
 Internet connection is the first thing a new leadership is that is Brink 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.180
 so to speak the operating system a connected hardware 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.180
 is available and installs it if necessary 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.130
 In doing so, it is important that neither the drug be upgraded to process 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.609
 his connections to MechWarrior tip still the Mac at work 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:33.699
 for example, by Geely Greul condition is interrupted 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.030
 after rebooting the robo the hard disks can be set up 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.430
 the sport shows you 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.010
 how many disks were detected 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.340
 behind the counter aquaris Controls hide in a new window 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.260
 meaningful information about use and state of health 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.280
 the installed hard disks 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.990
 Tools to set up here under the tab Tunis 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.130
 There you can also format the plates 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.070
 All data is lost but nobody can see it at this time 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.119
 Picture EA this hard plus 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.119
 is the disk exclusively on a Mac to operate 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:14.589
 Windows does not pass this format 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:18.369
 but you can use drugs with both systems under Havels Plus 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:20.680
 Need it a trick 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.919
 APA the tournament in another episode 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:26.969
 the second option is warped 30 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.899
 MCE understands this as well as Windows, but is subject to this format 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:32.419
 many limitations 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.600
 for example, in fact a big one 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.900
 or condition of files or folders and really should only be applied then 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.520
 Want to use only a windows computer drug 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:49.019
 in the next window the controller left and today 16 days work that 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.650
 over 16 thousand are there 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.760
 even if he has not installed so many or large plates in the Drobo 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.990
 the little robot simply provides these data to the operating systems 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.109
 available and if the place on one of the plaques 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.329
 should not be enough I'll keep it with you 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.370
 first you have to buy a larger hard drive 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.399
 last reigned the name for the drug that will be on the 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:16.489
 Desk later 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.900
 check once again your settings for the setup of the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.650
 Drobo 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.650
 and then tipped from the 8 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.049
 Months for a cup of coffee or your lunch break 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.400
 formatting is really unique and yet had to be done again 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.109
 even if you later die and formatted a new hard drive 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.459
 inserts or exchanges 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.289
 Incidentally, in India, too, could be provided at closed sports fans and 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:46.809
 impressed and later how much space he still has 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:50.149
 has several days 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:53.719
 The sport also shows you how much capacity to play 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:54.660
 available 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.690
 and whether you ever see yourself after nine bankruptcies 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.529
 a tip in the end 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:04.069
 Partitioning a Bobo is possible 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.060
 however, the size of the partition is fixed and can not be increased later 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.059
 to change 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:13.709
 if there is not enough space left in a partition 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.699
 to pick up this tan 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:20.280
 to do this you first have to copy all the data first, even the little robot he does 

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.969
 not at all 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:26.680
 So it's best to leave it at a partition and work with it 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.680
 These then grow along with the storage requirements 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.340
 and now you still owe the answers to the questions from the beginning 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:39.810
 accidentally deleted data 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.600
 are also on the mirror not to pick up again the threat for the 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.600
 System only one drive a disk 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:50.620
 and that is the answer to the other question 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.500
 That's why, despite Spiegel, we still see one and Jung
