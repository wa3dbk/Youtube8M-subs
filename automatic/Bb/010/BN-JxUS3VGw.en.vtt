I<00:00:11.030> showed<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.210> while<00:00:12.480> ago<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.809> did<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.170> wave

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
I showed this a while ago I did the wave

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.010 
I showed this a while ago I did the wave
mod<00:00:13.620> on<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.179> this<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> first<00:00:15.599> one<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.900> ever

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
mod on it this is the first one I ever

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.580 
mod on it this is the first one I ever
did<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.740> it's<00:00:17.340> pretty<00:00:17.640> messy<00:00:18.590> basically

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
did and it's pretty messy basically

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.730 
did and it's pretty messy basically
because<00:00:20.390> it<00:00:21.390> was<00:00:21.539> my<00:00:21.689> first<00:00:21.930> one<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.230> was<00:00:22.470> trying

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
because it was my first one I was trying

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.830 
because it was my first one I was trying
out<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.039> few<00:00:23.220> different<00:00:23.519> ways<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.730> doing<00:00:24.689> it

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
out a few different ways that doing it

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.480 
out a few different ways that doing it
and<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.050> wasn't<00:00:25.199> sure<00:00:25.470> exactly<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:26.099> size<00:00:26.279> or

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
and it wasn't sure exactly what size or

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.640 
and it wasn't sure exactly what size or
shape<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.849> needed<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:28.500> really

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
shape it needed to be so it's really

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.130 
shape it needed to be so it's really
rough<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:28.980> there<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.640> yeah<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.510> did<00:00:30.840> just<00:00:31.019> put

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
rough in there and yeah I did just put

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.290 
rough in there and yeah I did just put
some<00:00:31.349> jimping<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.980> don't<00:00:32.550> ask<00:00:32.790> me<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.120> do

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
some jimping on it don't ask me to do

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.459 
some jimping on it don't ask me to do
jimping<00:00:33.719> at<00:00:33.870> least<00:00:34.020> not<00:00:34.170> yet

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
jimping at least not yet

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.889 
jimping at least not yet
I'm<00:00:34.649> absolutely<00:00:35.010> terrible<00:00:35.579> looks<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> cat

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
I'm absolutely terrible looks like a cat

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.510 
I'm absolutely terrible looks like a cat
used<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.410> for<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> scratching<00:00:37.950> post<00:00:38.129> or

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
used it for a scratching post or

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.650 
used it for a scratching post or
something<00:00:39.590> but<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:41.820> wave<00:00:41.969> works<00:00:42.180> really<00:00:42.390> good

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
something but the wave works really good

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.610 
something but the wave works really good
and<00:00:45.140> do<00:00:46.140> them<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.320> lot<00:00:46.440> more

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
and do them a lot more

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.069 
and do them a lot more
professional-looking<00:00:47.340> now<00:00:47.930> here's<00:00:48.930> when<00:00:49.050> I

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
professional-looking now here's when I

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.639 
professional-looking now here's when I
just<00:00:49.289> finished<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:49.770> someone<00:00:51.199> if<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.289> ask<00:00:52.410> me

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
just finished for someone if you ask me

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.010 
just finished for someone if you ask me
that<00:00:52.800> looks<00:00:52.980> pretty<00:00:53.129> much<00:00:53.250> factory<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:54.809> a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
that looks pretty much factory just a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.760 
that looks pretty much factory just a
neat<00:00:55.289> little<00:00:55.440> semicircle<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:57.500> there<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.620> make

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
neat little semicircle in there to make

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:07.100 
neat little semicircle in there to make
the<00:00:58.890> hook

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.470 

and<00:01:08.480> you<00:01:09.480> know<00:01:09.570> show<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.870> up<00:01:10.050> before<00:01:10.260> thing

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
and you know show you up before thing

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.390 
and you know show you up before thing
actually<00:01:12.480> this<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.900> slightly<00:01:13.080> different<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.770> do

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
actually this is slightly different I do

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.110 
actually this is slightly different I do
have<00:01:14.610> some<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.880> these<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:16.320> l01<00:01:16.890> be<00:01:17.400> all

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
have some of these now the l01 be all

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.660 
have some of these now the l01 be all
blacked<00:01:18.780> out<00:01:19.760> might<00:01:20.760> look<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.000> little<00:01:21.030> weird<00:01:21.240> um

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
blacked out might look a little weird um

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.010 
blacked out might look a little weird um
to<00:01:23.670> mod<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.360> obviously<00:01:24.510> we<00:01:24.870> go

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
to mod this because obviously we go

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.570 
to mod this because obviously we go
through<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> coding<00:01:25.620> there<00:01:25.800> but<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.280> guess<00:01:26.430> I

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
through the coding there but I guess I

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.910 
through the coding there but I guess I
could<00:01:27.260> there<00:01:28.260> anyway<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.860> uh<00:01:29.010> show<00:01:30.920> you

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
could there anyway just to uh show you

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.500 
could there anyway just to uh show you
know<00:01:32.510> see<00:01:33.510> that's<00:01:33.690> how<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:35.000> up<00:01:36.000> there<00:01:36.270> and

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
know see that's how it is up there and

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.320 
know see that's how it is up there and
that's<00:01:37.380> modded<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:38.550> can<00:01:38.760> sort<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.120> get<00:01:39.240> them

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
that's modded you can sort of get them

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.260 
that's modded you can sort of get them
to<00:01:39.479> wave<00:01:39.660> without<00:01:40.229> doing<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:41.060> kinda<00:01:42.060> almost

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
to wave without doing this kinda almost

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.600 
to wave without doing this kinda almost
some<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.900> the<00:01:42.990> time<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:44.070> with<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.370> little

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
some of the time but with this little

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.070 
some of the time but with this little
tweak<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.150> brings<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.600> up<00:01:45.690> to<00:01:45.750> something

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
tweak it brings it up to something

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.010 
tweak it brings it up to something
that's<00:01:46.440> pretty<00:01:47.190> close<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.550> 100%<00:01:48.210> reliable

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
that's pretty close to 100% reliable

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.600 
that's pretty close to 100% reliable
rather<00:01:49.800> than<00:01:49.979> something<00:01:50.220> you're<00:01:50.460> gonna

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
rather than something you're gonna

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.140 
rather than something you're gonna
fumble

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
fumble

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.520 
fumble
you<00:01:51.780> know<00:01:51.869> maybe<00:01:52.310> half<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.400> time<00:01:54.410> because<00:01:55.410> you

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
you know maybe half the time because you

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.630 
you know maybe half the time because you
know<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.680> do<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.190> do<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.580> little

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
know you do it you do have that little

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.520 
know you do it you do have that little
shoulder<00:01:57.150> there<00:01:57.300> you're<00:01:57.450> working<00:01:57.780> with<00:01:57.930> with

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
shoulder there you're working with with

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.040 
shoulder there you're working with with
practice<00:01:59.330> you<00:02:00.330> know<00:02:00.420> I've<00:02:00.510> seen<00:02:00.660> a<00:02:00.720> couple<00:02:00.810> of

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
practice you know I've seen a couple of

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.490 
practice you know I've seen a couple of
videos<00:02:02.210> where<00:02:03.210> somebody<00:02:03.630> was<00:02:03.869> waving<00:02:04.260> one<00:02:04.410> of

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
videos where somebody was waving one of

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.980 
videos where somebody was waving one of
these<00:02:04.619> unmodified<00:02:05.340> they<00:02:06.330> flubbed<00:02:06.660> it<00:02:06.750> about

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
these unmodified they flubbed it about

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.410 
these unmodified they flubbed it about
half<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.410> time<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.090> don't<00:02:09.149> think<00:02:09.270> it

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
half of the time and I don't think it

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.969 
half of the time and I don't think it
was<00:02:09.540> their<00:02:09.690> fault<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.500> not<00:02:10.709> designed

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
was their fault just it's not designed

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.699 
was their fault just it's not designed
for<00:02:11.100> that<00:02:11.930> but<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:12.989> put<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.260> little<00:02:13.500> tweak

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
for that but you put this little tweak

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.050 
for that but you put this little tweak
in<00:02:13.860> there<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.280> catches<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.850> room<00:02:14.970> of

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
in there and it catches on the room of

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.560 
in there and it catches on the room of
your<00:02:15.120> pocket<00:02:15.600> works<00:02:16.320> perfect<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:21.360> but

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
your pocket works perfect and the but

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.210 
your pocket works perfect and the but
the<00:02:21.630> other<00:02:21.750> thing<00:02:21.989> there's<00:02:22.410> one<00:02:22.800> being<00:02:23.040> mine

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
the other thing there's one being mine

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.930 
the other thing there's one being mine
is<00:02:23.370> sort<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.700> testbed<00:02:25.610> let's<00:02:26.610> take<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.820> look

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
is sort of the testbed let's take a look

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.500 
is sort of the testbed let's take a look
at<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.090> flippers<00:02:27.800> this<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.250> stock<00:02:30.030> flipper

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
at the flippers this is a stock flipper

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.910 
at the flippers this is a stock flipper
and<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:32.160> noticed<00:02:32.519> on<00:02:32.610> some<00:02:32.880> knives<00:02:33.680> they'd<00:02:34.680> make

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
and I noticed on some knives they'd make

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.340 
and I noticed on some knives they'd make
the<00:02:35.070> flipper<00:02:35.340> sort<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.820> concave<00:02:36.330> where<00:02:37.200> your

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
the flipper sort of concave where your

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.150 
the flipper sort of concave where your
finger<00:02:37.650> touched<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:39.260> just<00:02:40.260> does<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:40.980> get

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
finger touched it just does so you get

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.030 
finger touched it just does so you get
more<00:02:41.310> grip<00:02:42.050> you<00:02:43.050> know<00:02:43.170> mechanically<00:02:43.830> there's

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
more grip you know mechanically there's

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.130 
more grip you know mechanically there's
something<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.940> way<00:02:45.090> there<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.600> resists

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
something in the way there that resists

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.840 
something in the way there that resists
your<00:02:46.260> fingers<00:02:46.590> sliding<00:02:46.890> off<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.340> whereas<00:02:47.640> this

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
your fingers sliding off it whereas this

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.970 
your fingers sliding off it whereas this
sort<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.120> rounded<00:02:48.630> little<00:02:48.870> hump<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.410> mean<00:02:49.860> it

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
sort of rounded little hump I mean it

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.620 
sort of rounded little hump I mean it
works<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.640> works<00:02:50.730> fine<00:02:51.060> don't<00:02:51.360> get<00:02:51.480> me<00:02:51.570> wrong

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
works it works fine don't get me wrong

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.710 
works it works fine don't get me wrong
but<00:02:52.550> I'm<00:02:53.550> just<00:02:53.730> seeing<00:02:53.970> if<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.150> can<00:02:54.209> improve<00:02:54.570> it

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
but I'm just seeing if I can improve it

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.100 
but I'm just seeing if I can improve it
a<00:02:54.780> little<00:02:54.930> bit<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:56.660> this<00:02:57.660> came<00:02:57.870> out<00:02:57.930> pretty

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
a little bit and this came out pretty

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.380 
a little bit and this came out pretty
good<00:02:58.230> for<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.560> first<00:02:58.590> try

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
good for a first try

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.340 
good for a first try
it<00:03:00.390> definitely<00:03:00.570> grabs<00:03:01.019> your<00:03:01.200> finger<00:03:01.530> more

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.560 

might<00:03:05.190> be<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.370> little<00:03:05.490> easier<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:06.090> get<00:03:06.210> it<00:03:06.300> flick

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
might be a little easier to get it flick

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.550 
might be a little easier to get it flick
out<00:03:06.720> there<00:03:08.360> so<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.420> was<00:03:09.510> kind<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.750> fun<00:03:09.990> let<00:03:10.500> me

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
out there so it was kind of fun let me

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.020 
out there so it was kind of fun let me
keep<00:03:10.680> experimenting<00:03:11.070> with<00:03:11.520> that<00:03:11.640> see<00:03:11.880> if<00:03:11.970> I

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
keep experimenting with that see if I

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.850 
keep experimenting with that see if I
can<00:03:12.150> get<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.360> geometry<00:03:12.570> just<00:03:13.020> right<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.870> this

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
can get the geometry just right and this

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.360 
can get the geometry just right and this
over<00:03:17.100> here<00:03:17.450> yell<00:03:18.450> zero<00:03:18.810> two<00:03:21.590> this<00:03:22.590> has<00:03:22.800> a<00:03:22.830> gap

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
over here yell zero two this has a gap

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.920 
over here yell zero two this has a gap
Coast<00:03:23.670> Isle<00:03:24.440> wave<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.710> it<00:03:26.330> because<00:03:27.330> I<00:03:27.480> well

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
Coast Isle wave to it because I well

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.150 
Coast Isle wave to it because I well
that's<00:03:28.110> originally<00:03:28.530> what<00:03:28.620> inspired<00:03:28.980> me<00:03:29.130> to

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
that's originally what inspired me to

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.000 
that's originally what inspired me to
try<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.490> with<00:03:29.700> zero<00:03:30.000> one<00:03:30.270> but<00:03:30.600> if<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.560> look<00:03:31.890> at

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
try it with zero one but if you look at

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.600 
try it with zero one but if you look at
his<00:03:32.190> paramilitary<00:03:32.940> -<00:03:33.320> he<00:03:34.320> just<00:03:34.530> has<00:03:34.770> a<00:03:35.190> little

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
his paramilitary - he just has a little

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.930 
his paramilitary - he just has a little
notch<00:03:36.620> you<00:03:37.620> know<00:03:37.740> maybe<00:03:38.070> like<00:03:38.220> half<00:03:38.610> an<00:03:38.790> inch

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
notch you know maybe like half an inch

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.240 
notch you know maybe like half an inch
in<00:03:39.150> front<00:03:39.330> of<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.480> spidey<00:03:39.750> hole<00:03:39.990> and<00:03:40.250> that's

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
in front of the spidey hole and that's

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.800 
in front of the spidey hole and that's
pretty<00:03:41.400> much<00:03:41.520> it<00:03:41.850> and<00:03:42.030> that's<00:03:42.300> really<00:03:42.480> all<00:03:42.690> you

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
pretty much it and that's really all you

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.190 
pretty much it and that's really all you
need<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.090> zero<00:03:45.330> two<00:03:45.540> here<00:03:45.870> works

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
need and so the zero two here works

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.230 
need and so the zero two here works
waves<00:03:46.590> just<00:03:46.890> fine<00:03:49.640> this<00:03:50.640> is<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.850> first<00:03:51.060> one<00:03:51.210> I

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
waves just fine this is the first one I

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.860 
waves just fine this is the first one I
done<00:03:51.540> I<00:03:51.840> don't<00:03:52.260> know<00:03:52.520> if<00:03:53.520> maybe<00:03:54.270> I'd<00:03:54.510> have<00:03:54.690> to

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
done I don't know if maybe I'd have to

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.050 
done I don't know if maybe I'd have to
increase<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.410> size<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.620> little<00:03:55.800> bit<00:03:56.190> just<00:03:56.520> just

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
increase the size a little bit just just

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.030 
increase the size a little bit just just
to<00:03:57.210> increase<00:03:57.540> reliability<00:03:57.930> maybe<00:03:58.710> you<00:03:58.860> know

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
to increase reliability maybe you know

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.010 
to increase reliability maybe you know
on<00:04:00.380> thicker<00:04:01.380> pants<00:04:01.770> material<00:04:02.190> or<00:04:02.340> something

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
on thicker pants material or something

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.960 
on thicker pants material or something
but<00:04:04.020> this<00:04:04.200> this<00:04:04.560> works<00:04:04.830> just<00:04:05.130> fine<00:04:05.370> on<00:04:05.670> the

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
but this this works just fine on the

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.730 
but this this works just fine on the
cargo<00:04:06.570> pants<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:06.930> was<00:04:07.020> wearing<00:04:07.320> when<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.470> made<00:04:07.710> it

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
cargo pants I was wearing when I made it

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.720 
cargo pants I was wearing when I made it
so<00:04:08.690> pretty<00:04:09.690> happy<00:04:09.900> with<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.550> doesn't<00:04:11.550> change

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
so pretty happy with that doesn't change

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.550 
so pretty happy with that doesn't change
the<00:04:11.970> look<00:04:12.570> of<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.750> knife<00:04:12.900> of<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.170> whole<00:04:13.320> ton

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
the look of the knife of the whole ton

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.950 
the look of the knife of the whole ton
but<00:04:14.550> it<00:04:14.700> does<00:04:14.850> give<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.210> the<00:04:15.390> option<00:04:15.750> of<00:04:15.810> that

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
but it does give you the option of that

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.039 
but it does give you the option of that
fast<00:04:16.200> deployment

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.350 

so<00:04:22.039> those<00:04:22.400> are<00:04:22.490> my<00:04:22.550> little<00:04:22.759> projects<00:04:25.360> thanks

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
so those are my little projects thanks

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.969 
so those are my little projects thanks
for<00:04:26.479> watching<00:04:26.900> and<00:04:27.080> I'm<00:04:27.440> gonna<00:04:27.560> close<00:04:27.830> out

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
for watching and I'm gonna close out

00:04:27.979 --> 00:05:07.100 
for watching and I'm gonna close out
here<00:04:28.280> with<00:04:28.550> a<00:04:28.580> little<00:04:29.030> demo
