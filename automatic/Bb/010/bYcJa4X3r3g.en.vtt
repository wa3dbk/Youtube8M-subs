00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.880
 give up or 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.880
 Hello, today we have 8 lessons and 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.890
 we will talk about cheating this is the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.630
 common commercial work with 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.790
 which we face practically 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.680
 every day and today we talk about 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.200
 cheat on the iron 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.520
 in my hands curling iron is that 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.880
 almost everybody probably has 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.239
 masters today we will look at one of 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.500
 technician cheat iron and how 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.290
 post finish 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.760
 how to disassemble this strand for 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.890
 that she looked not just 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.300
 wrung curls and was beautiful 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.300
 spectacular edge 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.790
 in order to conveniently easy 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.730
 to cheat on the iron 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.339
 we need prepared hair we are all 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.860
 we understand that just the hair on which 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.870
 there is no drug and we work 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.480
 ironing it is not very comfortable it is not 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.520
 protects the hair of our client therefore 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.040
 item number one we use 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.810
 thermal protection item number 2 we use 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.240
 hair styling lotion 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.090
 the fact is that foam and musa at 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.310
 the effects of hot oik change their 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.800
 quality on the hair and they glue 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.290
 hair here sometimes when we twist on 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.240
 iron we get our stopper 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.280
 the shelf does not pass through the hair and 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.320
 accordingly, we are uncomfortable hair 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.400
 stick together and we don't get nice 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.440
 light curl 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.090
 so here are these two points 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.720
 heat protection hair styling lotion 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.000
 hair dryer 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.430
 these are the most convenient preparations for 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.620
 to cheat now we take 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.460
 small strand 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.650
 Must be good hair 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.980
 combed set iron 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:54.630
 we do not need to spin very much 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.520
 tightly close the iron and stretch it 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.250
 literally covering only and here is our 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.110
 strand krutch wife we got a curl 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.520
 now we will see how it is correct 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.090
 disassemble to be beautiful 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.849
 bulk texture we all understand that with 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.580
 cheating we often come across in our 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.220
 salons and customers come and light 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.410
 and with dark hair in this case we 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.450
 we divide texture into active and 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.730
 inactive cheating after all this 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.159
 active texture, and it looks good 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.349
 only on blond hair if a client with 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.670
 dark hair of course we must 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.250
 more smooth this texture 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.010
 This break dark hair in such 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.750
 bulging ribs do not recommend now 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.790
 back to our spun hair and 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.220
 let's see how it looks in practice 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.270
 Now we take the drug in which 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.459
 there is brilliance 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.950
 degree of fixation 0 is very important 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.930
 because if we take waxes 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.670
 it's all sticky enough 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.040
 which will not work well 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.530
 on volume on a smooth texture what they want 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.870
 see our customers are voluminous live 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.090
 natural hair so drugs 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.580
 accordingly should be light let 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.180
 preparation will be a lot of glitter but the extent 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.380
 fixings 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.160
 we put it on a lock we set the direction 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.420
 curl 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.630
 and neatly large strands begin 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.209
 get part of the strand and up next 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.450
 part of the strand and wear let such edges 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.260
 you will be a little maximum 3 left 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.760
 lengthened tail we a little 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.069
 raise in order to decrease 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.769
 size strand and now directly 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.410
 from these ribs that we got we 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:40.430
 will create 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:42.920
 naturally lived to create a turn here 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.000
 from such a strand we got beautiful 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.859
 bulk edge working with the second strand 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.590
 shine we turn on 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.350
 curl direction and part of hair up 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.410
 and hold your fingers gently 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.190
 smooth the folds and strands that we 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.890
 got out 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.680
 inside sheer hair 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.299
 gives this 3 live texture which 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.430
 now very modern and very 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.400
 relevant today we looked 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.019
 like from preorder which we screwed on 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.420
 iron can get just such 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.940
 wonderful beautiful texture with you 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.970
