ring<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.130> borrowed<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.610> because<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.000> don't

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
ring I borrowed that because I don't

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.090 
ring I borrowed that because I don't
feel<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.420> spending<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:43.229> don't<00:01:43.740> even<00:01:43.829> know<00:01:43.979> how

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
feel like spending I don't even know how

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.560 
feel like spending I don't even know how
much<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.520> probably<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:44.850> two<00:01:45.030> mil<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.420> one

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
much it's probably like two mil for one

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.700 
much it's probably like two mil for one
and<00:01:47.930> this<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.110> pretty<00:01:49.259> much<00:01:49.350> pointless

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
and this is pretty much pointless

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.990 
and this is pretty much pointless
because<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.220> doesn't<00:01:50.430> give<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.549> any<00:01:50.640> strength

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
because it doesn't give you any strength

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.609 
because it doesn't give you any strength
