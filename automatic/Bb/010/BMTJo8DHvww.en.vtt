00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
feels also a little bit heavy to me

feels also a little bit heavy to me
compared<00:00:41.980> to<00:00:42.039> the<00:00:42.129> other<00:00:42.249> two<00:00:42.489> some<00:00:43.480> differing

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
compared to the other two some differing

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.930 
compared to the other two some differing
opinions<00:00:44.260> here<00:00:44.499> between<00:00:45.280> these<00:00:45.550> three<00:00:45.760> bikes

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
opinions here between these three bikes

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.059 
opinions here between these three bikes
which<00:00:46.149> are<00:00:46.269> actually<00:00:46.679> pretty<00:00:47.679> evenly<00:00:47.979> matched

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:48.069 
which are actually pretty evenly matched

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:51.059 
which are actually pretty evenly matched
in<00:00:48.460> my<00:00:48.550> opinion<00:00:49.440> each<00:00:50.440> one<00:00:50.679> has<00:00:50.949> a<00:00:50.979> little

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:51.069 
in my opinion each one has a little

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:52.559 
in my opinion each one has a little
something<00:00:51.609> that<00:00:51.819> you<00:00:51.940> can<00:00:52.059> like<00:00:52.239> and<00:00:52.389> dislike

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:52.569 
something that you can like and dislike

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:56.279 
something that you can like and dislike
about<00:00:52.809> it<00:00:53.019> I<00:00:53.639> suppose<00:00:54.639> if<00:00:55.030> I<00:00:55.149> were<00:00:55.300> to<00:00:55.510> bias<00:00:55.899> one

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
about it I suppose if I were to bias one

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:57.149 
about it I suppose if I were to bias one
is<00:00:56.469> my<00:00:56.649> favorite

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
is my favorite

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:58.200 
is my favorite
maybe<00:00:57.339> something<00:00:57.699> I<00:00:57.729> was<00:00:57.850> going<00:00:57.969> to<00:00:58.030> purchase

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
maybe something I was going to purchase

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.099 
maybe something I was going to purchase
I<00:00:58.979> might<00:00:59.979> head<00:01:00.309> toward<00:01:00.819> the<00:01:01.149> Aprilia<00:01:01.510> just<00:01:01.960> the

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
I might head toward the Aprilia just the

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.799 
I might head toward the Aprilia just the
most<00:01:02.289> refined<00:01:02.739> in<00:01:02.949> the<00:01:02.979> vol.3<00:01:03.629> best<00:01:04.629> tuned

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
most refined in the vol.3 best tuned

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.219 
most refined in the vol.3 best tuned
suspension

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.469 

TuneIn<00:01:07.920> fix<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.400> out<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.759> box<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.270> really

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
TuneIn fix but out of the box it really

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.730 
TuneIn fix but out of the box it really
seems<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> best<00:01:11.540> great<00:01:12.540> brakes<00:01:12.780> although<00:01:13.710> I

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
seems the best great brakes although I

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.580 
seems the best great brakes although I
think<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:15.170> probably<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.350> say<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
think the probably have to say the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.109 
think the probably have to say the
triumph<00:01:16.890> has<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.130> best<00:01:17.310> feel<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.700> power<00:01:17.850> in

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
triumph has the best feel in power in

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.530 
triumph has the best feel in power in
terms<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.479> brakes<00:01:18.750> engine<00:01:19.619> wise<00:01:20.540> again

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
terms of brakes engine wise again

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.510 
terms of brakes engine wise again
probably<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.960> little<00:01:22.080> more<00:01:22.290> refinement<00:01:22.649> in

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
probably a little more refinement in

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.960 
probably a little more refinement in
Aprilia<00:01:24.229> as<00:01:25.229> Kevin<00:01:25.710> noted<00:01:26.009> not<00:01:26.340> quite<00:01:26.670> as<00:01:26.789> much

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
Aprilia as Kevin noted not quite as much

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.420 
Aprilia as Kevin noted not quite as much
smack<00:01:27.659> off<00:01:27.899> the<00:01:28.110> bottom<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.250> easily

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
smack off the bottom but it's easily

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.410 
smack off the bottom but it's easily
modulated<00:01:30.210> feeling<00:01:31.200> slightly<00:01:32.130> abrupt<00:01:32.610> from

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
modulated feeling slightly abrupt from

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.109 
modulated feeling slightly abrupt from
closed<00:01:33.659> open<00:01:34.020> definitely<00:01:34.649> in<00:01:34.890> my<00:01:34.950> opinion

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
closed open definitely in my opinion

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.760 
closed open definitely in my opinion
same<00:01:36.119> with<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> Buell<00:01:36.570> again<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.409> think<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
same with the Buell again I think the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.350 
same with the Buell again I think the
tribe<00:01:38.009> probably<00:01:38.399> has<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> smoother<00:01:38.909> feeling

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
tribe probably has a smoother feeling

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.270 
tribe probably has a smoother feeling
but<00:01:39.569> here's<00:01:40.409> some<00:01:40.590> areas<00:01:40.800> we're<00:01:40.920> finding

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
but here's some areas we're finding

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.230 
but here's some areas we're finding
differences<00:01:41.789> you're<00:01:42.420> crazy

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
differences you're crazy

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.460 
differences you're crazy
speed<00:01:45.240> triple<00:01:45.630> once<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.869> get<00:01:45.990> off<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.110> Buell

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
speed triple once you get off the Buell

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.039 
speed triple once you get off the Buell
feel<00:01:46.860> soft<00:01:47.280> plush<00:01:47.789> which<00:01:48.509> works<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
feel soft plush which works on the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.690 
feel soft plush which works on the
street<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.830> sure<00:01:50.069> it<00:01:50.190> would<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.399> as<00:01:50.490> good<00:01:50.549> on

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
street not sure it would be as good on

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.490 
street not sure it would be as good on
as<00:01:50.940> a<00:01:50.970> track<00:01:51.270> day<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.509> think<00:01:51.840> for<00:01:51.959> a<00:01:51.990> track<00:01:52.289> day

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
as a track day I think for a track day

as a track day I think for a track day
bike<00:01:53.509> Buell<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.810> be<00:01:54.899> better<00:01:55.049> than

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
bike Buell is going to be better than

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.680 
bike Buell is going to be better than
the<00:01:55.470> Triumph<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:56.340> Triumph<00:01:56.789> also<00:01:57.119> has<00:01:57.330> a
