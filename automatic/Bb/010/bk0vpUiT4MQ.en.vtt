you<00:00:43.440> how<00:00:43.559> long<00:00:43.829> now<00:00:44.129> it's<00:00:44.670> there<00:00:45.270> as<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> guide

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
you how long now it's there as a guide

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.139 
you how long now it's there as a guide
so<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.710> leave<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> little<00:00:47.789> bit<00:00:47.969> longer

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
so you can leave it a little bit longer

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.189 
so you can leave it a little bit longer
you<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.629> leave<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> bit<00:00:49.230> less<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.340> release

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
you can leave it a bit less and release

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.510 
you can leave it a bit less and release
but<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.289> really<00:00:52.440> saves<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.010> from<00:00:53.129> having<00:00:53.370> to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
but it really saves you from having to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.639 
but it really saves you from having to
worry<00:00:54.210> about<00:00:54.300> which<00:00:55.020> way<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.260> hold<00:00:55.469> your

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
worry about which way to hold your

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.959 
worry about which way to hold your
tongue<00:00:55.920> another<00:00:56.190> thing<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.730> doesn't

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
tongue another thing like that doesn't

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.180 
tongue another thing like that doesn't
know<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.390> clamp<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.020> yeah<00:00:59.010> it's

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
know you just clamp it in yeah it's

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.520 
know you just clamp it in yeah it's
really<00:00:59.399> simple<00:00:59.850> if<00:01:00.390> you've<00:01:00.660> got<00:01:00.840> really<00:01:01.320> long

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
really simple if you've got really long

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.100 
really simple if you've got really long
hair<00:01:01.559> what<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.070> would<00:01:02.280> say<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.750> start

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
hair what I would say to do is to start

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.050 
hair what I would say to do is to start
working<00:01:04.530> with<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.799> little<00:01:04.949> bit<00:01:05.100> lower<00:01:05.250> okay

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
working with it a little bit lower okay

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.700 
working with it a little bit lower okay
because<00:01:06.420> again<00:01:06.659> there's<00:01:06.900> only<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.260> much<00:01:07.439> room

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
because again there's only so much room

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.460 
because again there's only so much room
in<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> chamber<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.909> take<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.689> extensive

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
in the chamber to take that extensive

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.070 
in the chamber to take that extensive
after<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> session

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.230 

now<00:01:18.080> with<00:01:18.230> your<00:01:18.410> hair<00:01:18.590> because<00:01:18.620> it's

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
now with your hair because it's

highlighted<00:01:20.240> yeah<00:01:20.810> I've<00:01:21.200> got<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.380> on<00:01:21.530> that<00:01:21.710> low

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
highlighted yeah I've got it on that low

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.510 
highlighted yeah I've got it on that low
setting<00:01:22.400> like<00:01:22.640> I<00:01:22.820> said<00:01:23.090> but<00:01:23.930> I've<00:01:24.050> also

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
setting like I said but I've also

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.610 
setting like I said but I've also
increased<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:26.360> heat<00:01:26.510> slightly<00:01:26.870> as<00:01:27.230> far<00:01:27.470> as

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
increased the heat slightly as far as

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.800 
increased the heat slightly as far as
the<00:01:27.770> length<00:01:28.010> of<00:01:28.250> time<00:01:28.550> so<00:01:29.390> if<00:01:29.450> you<00:01:29.540> take<00:01:29.750> that

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
the length of time so if you take that

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.520 
the length of time so if you take that
okay<00:01:30.800> and<00:01:31.100> remember<00:01:31.940> that<00:01:32.510> that<00:01:32.720> open<00:01:33.140> section
