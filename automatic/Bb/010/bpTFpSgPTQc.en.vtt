00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
here I did the race last year and a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.390 
here I did the race last year and a
whole<00:01:28.020> race<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.530> general<00:01:28.830> is<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.040> really<00:01:29.250> cool

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400

the<00:01:31.259> US<00:01:31.530> now<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:32.240> may<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.420> second<00:01:33.720> biggest

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
the US now I may be the second biggest

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.700 
the US now I may be the second biggest
second-biggest<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.659> not<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.470> not

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
