00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.480 
fiber here my name's Luke and as I was

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
playing through true vault hunter mode

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.880 
playing through true vault hunter mode
here<00:00:05.970> where<00:00:06.390> I<00:00:06.420> got<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.170> boughs<00:00:07.440> in<00:00:07.649> part

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
here where I got to the boughs in part

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.009 
here where I got to the boughs in part
and<00:00:08.099> then<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.340> started<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.880> go<00:00:08.970> towards<00:00:09.450> the

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
and then I started to go towards the

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.690 
and then I started to go towards the
part<00:00:10.290> where<00:00:10.440> we're<00:00:10.559> gonna<00:00:10.620> put<00:00:10.860> felicity<00:00:11.370> /

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
part where we're gonna put felicity /

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.419 
part where we're gonna put felicity /
the<00:00:12.030> skipper<00:00:12.330> into<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.410> constructor<00:00:13.860> bot<00:00:14.160> I

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
the skipper into the constructor bot I

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.570 
the skipper into the constructor bot I
ended<00:00:15.000> up<00:00:15.089> getting<00:00:15.560> two<00:00:16.560> legendary<00:00:17.039> items<00:00:17.430> in

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
ended up getting two legendary items in

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.640 
ended up getting two legendary items in
the<00:00:17.670> span<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:17.940> about<00:00:18.180> 15<00:00:18.840> minutes<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:19.619> I

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
the span of about 15 minutes and so I

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.990 
the span of about 15 minutes and so I
just<00:00:19.920> wanted<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.189> make<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.550> little<00:00:20.789> video

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
just wanted to make a little video

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.929 
just wanted to make a little video
showing<00:00:21.990> these<00:00:22.260> two<00:00:22.500> drops<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.100> think<00:00:23.730> that

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
showing these two drops I think that

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.490 
showing these two drops I think that
Borderlands<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.480> pre-sequel<00:00:24.600> has<00:00:25.199> pretty

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
Borderlands the pre-sequel has pretty

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.800 
Borderlands the pre-sequel has pretty
generous<00:00:26.250> drop<00:00:26.519> rates<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.420> ended<00:00:27.720> up

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
generous drop rates and so I ended up

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.189 
generous drop rates and so I ended up
getting<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.890> cryo<00:00:29.609> phobia<00:00:30.179> from<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.779> bosun

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
getting the cryo phobia from the bosun

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.560 
getting the cryo phobia from the bosun
here<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.250> think<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.850> his<00:00:33.149> assigned

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
here and I think that is his assigned

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.500 
here and I think that is his assigned
drop<00:00:34.020> most<00:00:34.320> likely<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.040> even<00:00:35.969> though<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.180> was

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
drop most likely and even though I was

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.930 
drop most likely and even though I was
to<00:00:36.690> level<00:00:37.050> level<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.559> use<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.980> here<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.430> think<00:00:38.520> we

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
to level level to use it here I think we

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.069 
to level level to use it here I think we
can<00:00:39.090> pretty<00:00:39.239> much<00:00:39.360> assume<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:41.840> the<00:00:42.840> cryo

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
can pretty much assume that the cryo

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.770 
can pretty much assume that the cryo
phobia<00:00:43.559> functions<00:00:44.100> almost<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:45.300> like<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
phobia functions almost just like the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.130 
phobia functions almost just like the
pyro<00:00:46.170> phobia<00:00:46.680> did<00:00:46.980> except<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.610> it's

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
pyro phobia did except that it's

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.420 
pyro phobia did except that it's
strictly<00:00:49.140> ice<00:00:49.469> element<00:00:49.890> as<00:00:50.070> opposed<00:00:50.340> to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
strictly ice element as opposed to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.400 
strictly ice element as opposed to
strictly<00:00:50.850> fire<00:00:51.149> element<00:00:51.629> like<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.930> was<00:00:52.110> in

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
strictly fire element like it was in

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.889 
strictly fire element like it was in
Borderlands<00:00:52.829> 2<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.420> might<00:00:54.629> actually

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
Borderlands 2 and so that might actually

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.930 
Borderlands 2 and so that might actually
be<00:00:55.079> useful<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.680> didn't<00:00:55.949> find<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.280> pyro<00:00:56.489> phobia

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
be useful I didn't find the pyro phobia

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.049 
be useful I didn't find the pyro phobia
too<00:00:57.149> useful<00:00:57.600> or<00:00:57.719> anything<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.850> cryo

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
too useful or anything but the cryo

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.810 
too useful or anything but the cryo
phobia<00:01:00.510> might<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:01.109> some<00:01:01.410> use<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:02.010> obviously

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
phobia might have some use and obviously

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.939 
phobia might have some use and obviously
I'm<00:01:03.449> getting<00:01:03.750> him<00:01:03.840> closer<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.199> level<00:01:04.500> 50<00:01:04.799> now

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
I'm getting him closer to level 50 now

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.160 
I'm getting him closer to level 50 now
and<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.580> begin<00:01:05.729> testing<00:01:06.570> all<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.990> these

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
and so we can begin testing all of these

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.140 
and so we can begin testing all of these
weapons<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.890> stuff<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:08.970> there

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
weapons and stuff like that and so there

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.570 
weapons and stuff like that and so there
you<00:01:09.180> saw<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.780> cryo<00:01:10.110> fovea<00:01:10.590> dropped<00:01:11.010> from<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
you saw the cryo fovea dropped from the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.969 
you saw the cryo fovea dropped from the
bosun<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.080> was<00:01:13.229> pretty<00:01:13.380> cool

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
bosun and so that was pretty cool

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.700 
bosun and so that was pretty cool
and<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.970> pretty<00:01:15.390> soon<00:01:15.720> after<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.200> picked<00:01:16.530> this

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and like pretty soon after I picked this

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.520 
and like pretty soon after I picked this
up<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.189> start<00:01:17.549> heading<00:01:17.700> towards<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:19.200> robot

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
up I start heading towards the robot

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.280 
up I start heading towards the robot
facility<00:01:20.130> or<00:01:20.820> at<00:01:21.299> least<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.689> start<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
facility or at least the start of the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.380 
facility or at least the start of the
robot<00:01:22.619> facility<00:01:23.159> after<00:01:23.369> we<00:01:23.700> ride<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.119> little

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
robot facility after we ride that little

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.990 
robot facility after we ride that little
train<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:25.380> get<00:01:25.530> there<00:01:25.740> pretty<00:01:25.920> quick<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.460> so

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
train you get there pretty quick and so

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.730 
train you get there pretty quick and so
as<00:01:27.150> I'm<00:01:27.360> killing<00:01:27.689> these<00:01:27.810> torques<00:01:28.229> this

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
as I'm killing these torques this

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.069 
as I'm killing these torques this
actually<00:01:29.130> comes<00:01:29.400> from<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.820> non<00:01:30.060> boss<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.049> I

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
actually comes from a non boss and so I

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.600 
actually comes from a non boss and so I
thought<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.710> one<00:01:31.920> was<00:01:32.070> kind<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.369> funny

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
thought that this one was kind of funny

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.149 
thought that this one was kind of funny
what's<00:01:33.390> gonna<00:01:33.509> end<00:01:33.750> up<00:01:33.869> dropping<00:01:34.110> here<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.710> a

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
what's gonna end up dropping here is a

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.090 
what's gonna end up dropping here is a
homing<00:01:36.030> bonus<00:01:36.420> package<00:01:36.869> which<00:01:37.500> i<00:01:37.650> think<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.979> an

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
homing bonus package which i think is an

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.160 
homing bonus package which i think is an

absolutely asinine weapon i'm not a big

grenade<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.320> bonus<00:01:49.710> package<00:01:50.100> i<00:01:50.340> think

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
grenade like the bonus package i think

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.120 
grenade like the bonus package i think
that<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:52.079> homing<00:01:52.380> prefix<00:01:52.770> would<00:01:52.950> be

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
that the homing prefix would be

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.300 
that the homing prefix would be
basically<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:55.590> good<00:01:55.890> way<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.070> kill

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
basically just a good way to kill

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.069 
basically just a good way to kill
yourself<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.850> almost<00:01:57.090> nothing<00:01:57.509> else<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:58.020> it

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
yourself in almost nothing else but it

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.679 
yourself in almost nothing else but it
actually<00:01:58.350> drops<00:01:58.740> from<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.250> torque<00:01:59.689> zapper

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
actually drops from this torque zapper

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.910 
actually drops from this torque zapper
right<00:02:00.930> here<00:02:01.170> which<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.380> kind<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.710> weird

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
right here which is kind of weird

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.380 
right here which is kind of weird
because<00:02:02.130> that's<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> boss<00:02:02.939> or<00:02:03.210> anything

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
because that's not a boss or anything

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.289 
because that's not a boss or anything
just<00:02:03.780> kind<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.770> badass<00:02:05.009> variant<00:02:05.670> enemy<00:02:06.000> item

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
just kind of a badass variant enemy item

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:06.800 
just kind of a badass variant enemy item
