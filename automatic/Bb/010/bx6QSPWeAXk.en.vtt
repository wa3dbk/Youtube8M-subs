 to look at things just tired 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.250
 that you actually don't have to 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.170
 knowing is common 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.180
 I am day new tour but in between 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.520

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.530
 also the most important part 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.270
 of course because fourth base is one 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.830

 this was the craft chicken plays 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.269
 chang's compaxo so computer or the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.690
 cetera et cetera 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.280
 or your minecraft you have other moats 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.930

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.540
 and yes they are actually very simple you can 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.790
 create multiple profiles and you have one 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.440
 very quickly it'ers switch those profiles 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.019
 I only have one so it's always him 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.090
 mountain bob you still have maps then i come 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.930
 not very often but you can too 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.660
 to install 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.280
 if you want to clear that and i will play 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.870
 himself could go on the ordinary minecraft and then 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.459
 can you just chip this councilor or not 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.709
 look at it 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.510
 tasha box tissue box most of you 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.579
 think of being heard and sympathetic late 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.530
 lying just left me because Coming up 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.269
 crash my minecraft or whatever 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.980
 that is no longer the case 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.350
 if you kind of expert for clicks 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.880
 and clicked in real pastries for the 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:42.040
 that sweetie pie is all set 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.480
 and how do you know which suit you need should you 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.190
 just look at your mouth instead like you 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.829
 for this install the top one that is 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.660
 that head because he does not plex the vest 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.660
 it is necessary but now it is automatically 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.049
 kind of witch in the house I often have 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.239
 already done 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.280
 but then you'd just on smell than 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.620
 automatic and ready 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.000
 do you have another options in dust 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.489
 brochure I have a separate brochure 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.989
 made on my d drive because i like 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.549
 want to keep everything on my thigh because 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.900
 as my larger writing than kind 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.670
 computer quickly on the resume of cetera 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.340
 so what i did is just separate 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.780
 folder made somewhere and that according to 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.150
 I selected so install there 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.449
 he then the finals 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.120
 I have my maximum run at two and a half 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.470
 I give my language in English but 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.699
 there is also dutch 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.800
 I let him stay with him because 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.720
 I'm just used to it, I think 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.009
 the wish options is also only there 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.009
 I don't touch anything else 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.820
 so another step is actually 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.710
 not very important I am submerged 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.060
 actually as good as never i get you 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.330
 never actually to so then I would 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.710
 needed so in other words select a place and can 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.270
 Selecting 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.440
 can you have lunch when i now have a texture 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.620
 pack select is all 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.600
 automatically realize on cinch know on 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.669
 two after fly but is a bit on 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.880
 how your computer is composed and what 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.590
 pressure capacity of your computer 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.180
 as you have selected everything and 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.090
 so then you can 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.530
 is the can treat must pack lunch well 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.120
 this takes a while here on it 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.949
 screen on the back of the console see from 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.349
 everything is all done in red letters 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.490
 green letters all much all week 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.080
 colors of the rainbow that passed 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.940
 come 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.800
 so soon there will be one takes one 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.910
 while he may say he is not 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.860
 responds 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.400
 but that is not the case you have to 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.400
 just wait a moment 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.070
 the expectations just briefly 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:30.080
 he says above nothing responds 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.460
 but that is not true that they are waiting for that 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.639
 neither see the console running 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.240
 he lets all things just let him 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.240
 go ahead 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.270
 I have a black bar in axes video 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.770
