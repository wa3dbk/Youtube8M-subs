00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.849
 Hello, the parcel has come now 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:12.179
 the wall means I ordered a clock in the room 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:14.219
 the parcel went a very long time was ordered 18 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.820
 October 19 October means store and 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.850
 sent that is everything is not December 20th 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.220
 eat it turns out you break two days 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:36.899
 Although before this parcels were using 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:40.879
 come let's see with some kind of not 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.879
 Too little Obama anymore 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:01:01.039
 then immediately ordered a month for hours here 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.039
 such a find for this complication 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:12.680
 why because on the clock that means 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.830
 battery work also from yusbi but 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.340
 so that wherever you go 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.070
 scram 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.909
 wear sc processing because he gave 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.060
 adapter let's look at ourselves 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.060
 clock 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.750
 interested in the most usb cable now it 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:45.549
 a joke in the field that he will solder 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:49.030
 immediately for one and actually 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.030
 the parts themselves 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:05.149
 so the clock you know yourself is here 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:12.590
 such here does not mean after all 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:16.550
 such a cube of some defects 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.849
 a small tofik him simulation such 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.930
 type of granite under the stone actually 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:29.540
 this plastic here must be the killer 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:32.989
 fred so let's check how this thing 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:38.269
 will work for what the world is here here 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:42.920
 power cable is such a stuck 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:49.579
 adapter connect to the network 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:53.540
 and here is such a shaitan box with us 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:57.530
 It turns out in the end I want to say the number 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.350
 pretty very bright very 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.590
 what is our interesting reason shows 11 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.489
 degrees and than this will be unclear 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:13.760
 visible read need to tune in now 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:18.290
 camera so try to say here that 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.100
 ready to see better here and so about 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.100
 the whole thing looks like 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:33.120
 prescription interesting watch all his 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.120
 bedroom set up 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.840
 Thank you all
