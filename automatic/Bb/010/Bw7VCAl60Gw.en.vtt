00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.230 

I've<00:00:01.160> been<00:00:01.340> looking<00:00:01.609> at<00:00:01.670> the<00:00:01.760> sky<00:00:01.999> and

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:02.240 
I've been looking at the sky and

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.449 
I've been looking at the sky and
thinking<00:00:03.020> about<00:00:03.230> it<00:00:03.380> and<00:00:03.470> I'm<00:00:03.560> thinking<00:00:03.590> that

00:00:04.449 --> 00:00:04.459 
thinking about it and I'm thinking that

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:06.639 
thinking about it and I'm thinking that
I'm<00:00:04.520> gonna<00:00:04.640> put<00:00:04.910> in<00:00:05.089> a<00:00:05.299> suggestion<00:00:06.109> of<00:00:06.410> some

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
I'm gonna put in a suggestion of some

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.249 
I'm gonna put in a suggestion of some
clouds<00:00:06.890> here<00:00:07.279> and<00:00:07.759> I'm<00:00:08.180> gonna<00:00:08.269> do<00:00:08.509> it<00:00:08.719> in<00:00:08.990> a

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:09.259 
clouds here and I'm gonna do it in a

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:10.749 
clouds here and I'm gonna do it in a
couple<00:00:09.440> of<00:00:09.589> different<00:00:09.889> steps<00:00:10.099> first<00:00:10.580> I'm

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 
couple of different steps first I'm

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.730 
couple of different steps first I'm
going<00:00:10.969> to<00:00:11.320> put<00:00:12.320> in<00:00:12.469> a<00:00:12.879> kind<00:00:13.879> of<00:00:13.969> a<00:00:14.059> shadow<00:00:14.269> color

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
going to put in a kind of a shadow color

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.990 
going to put in a kind of a shadow color
for<00:00:15.740> the<00:00:15.830> under<00:00:16.040> part<00:00:16.190> of<00:00:16.309> the<00:00:16.370> clouds<00:00:16.609> now<00:00:16.939> I'm

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
for the under part of the clouds now I'm

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.750 
for the under part of the clouds now I'm
gonna<00:00:17.150> put<00:00:17.420> in<00:00:17.570> a<00:00:17.840> mid<00:00:18.289> tome<00:00:18.560> and<00:00:18.830> then<00:00:19.730> a

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
gonna put in a mid tome and then a

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.630 
gonna put in a mid tome and then a
highlight<00:00:20.750> on<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:21.260> clouds<00:00:21.500> I'm<00:00:22.279> going<00:00:22.460> to<00:00:22.519> try

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
highlight on the clouds I'm going to try

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.339 
highlight on the clouds I'm going to try
to<00:00:22.670> keep<00:00:22.880> it<00:00:23.029> really<00:00:23.330> subtle<00:00:23.750> and<00:00:23.900> simple

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
to keep it really subtle and simple

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.249 
to keep it really subtle and simple
because<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:24.890> paint<00:00:25.130> is<00:00:25.250> still<00:00:25.279> wet<00:00:25.490> here<00:00:26.259> the

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
because the paint is still wet here the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.140 
because the paint is still wet here the
clouds<00:00:27.560> will<00:00:28.160> probably<00:00:28.519> be<00:00:28.699> more<00:00:29.000> of<00:00:29.090> a

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
clouds will probably be more of a

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.310 
clouds will probably be more of a
suggestion<00:00:29.570> than<00:00:29.839> something<00:00:30.019> really

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
suggestion than something really

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.050 
suggestion than something really
specific<00:00:30.589> at<00:00:31.519> least<00:00:31.670> that's<00:00:31.849> what<00:00:31.970> I'm

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.060 
specific at least that's what I'm

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.700 
specific at least that's what I'm
thinking<00:00:32.390> now<00:00:32.419> we'll<00:00:33.079> see<00:00:33.290> how<00:00:33.379> that<00:00:33.440> turns

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
thinking now we'll see how that turns

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.799 
thinking now we'll see how that turns
out

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
out

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.819 
out
so<00:00:35.809> I'm<00:00:35.870> going<00:00:35.989> to<00:00:36.050> use<00:00:36.140> a<00:00:36.170> combination<00:00:36.440> of

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
so I'm going to use a combination of

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.680 
so I'm going to use a combination of
burnt<00:00:37.010> sienna<00:00:38.200> violet<00:00:39.200> and<00:00:40.450> hydrangea<00:00:41.450> blue

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
burnt sienna violet and hydrangea blue

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.819 
burnt sienna violet and hydrangea blue
and<00:00:43.210> this<00:00:44.210> will<00:00:44.390> give<00:00:44.539> me<00:00:44.750> a<00:00:44.780> kind<00:00:45.710> of<00:00:45.739> a

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
and this will give me a kind of a

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.630 
and this will give me a kind of a
purpley<00:00:46.280> gray<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:47.890> then<00:00:48.890> I<00:00:48.920> can<00:00:49.160> lighten<00:00:49.430> it

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
purpley gray and then I can lighten it

00:00:49.640 --> 00:01:02.150 
purpley gray and then I can lighten it
with<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.570> white<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:50.930> see<00:00:51.140> what<00:00:51.260> I'm<00:00:51.350> getting

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.640 

so<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.060> hydrangea<00:01:03.660> blue<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.020> the<00:01:04.500> most

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
so the hydrangea blue is the most

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.500 
so the hydrangea blue is the most
powerful<00:01:04.950> these<00:01:05.340> pigments<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.060> need<00:01:06.300> to<00:01:06.390> add

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
powerful these pigments so I need to add

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:34.880 
powerful these pigments so I need to add
more<00:01:06.690> purple

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.620 

and<00:01:35.400> I'm<00:01:35.580> going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.730> keep<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.120> same<00:01:36.330> direction

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
and I'm going to keep the same direction

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:55.429 
and I'm going to keep the same direction
of<00:01:37.110> strokes<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.710> I've<00:01:38.010> established<00:01:38.400> here

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.349 

and<00:01:55.649> as<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.520> mentioned<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.939> paint<00:01:57.179> is<00:01:57.329> still

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
and as I mentioned the paint is still

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.349 
and as I mentioned the paint is still
wet<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.229> I'm<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.530> kind<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.920> working<00:01:59.759> it<00:02:00.060> into

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
wet so I'm just kind of working it into

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:04.990 
wet so I'm just kind of working it into
the<00:02:00.479> paint<00:02:00.689> that's<00:02:01.109> already<00:02:01.679> on<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.039> panel

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.930 

and<00:02:06.500> I'll<00:02:07.500> kind<00:02:07.859> of<00:02:07.890> go<00:02:08.039> over<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.610> make<00:02:08.640> it

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
and I'll kind of go over it to make it

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:18.790 
and I'll kind of go over it to make it
soft<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.619> not<00:02:10.769> too<00:02:11.009> obvious

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.610 

so<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.760> light<00:02:20.270> in<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.810> painting<00:02:21.080> is<00:02:21.200> coming

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
so the light in the painting is coming

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.340 
so the light in the painting is coming
from<00:02:21.710> the<00:02:21.860> right-hand<00:02:22.250> side<00:02:22.460> so<00:02:22.490> I'm<00:02:22.820> putting

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
from the right-hand side so I'm putting

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.920 
from the right-hand side so I'm putting
shadows<00:02:24.350> on<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.670> kind<00:02:25.880> of<00:02:25.910> under<00:02:26.270> left-hand

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
shadows on the kind of under left-hand

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.510 
shadows on the kind of under left-hand
side<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.320> these<00:02:27.880> future<00:02:28.880> clouds<00:02:29.090> here
