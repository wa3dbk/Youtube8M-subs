00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.740 
doing so we're gonna need to create two
spline<00:00:29.099> objects<00:00:29.519> I'm<00:00:30.000> gonna<00:00:30.210> go<00:00:30.330> up<00:00:30.449> here<00:00:30.660> to

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
spline objects I'm gonna go up here to

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.170 
spline objects I'm gonna go up here to
my<00:00:30.840> spline<00:00:31.199> objects<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.859> select<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.640> rectangle

and dragging this rectangle down the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.170 
and dragging this rectangle down the
first<00:00:39.780> one<00:00:39.870> I'll<00:00:40.079> name<00:00:40.290> small<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:41.700> second<00:00:42.059> one

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
first one I'll name small the second one

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.020 
first one I'll name small the second one
I'll<00:00:42.300> name<00:00:42.540> big<00:00:43.309> after<00:00:44.309> making<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> changes

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
I'll name big after making the changes

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.369 
I'll name big after making the changes
to<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> name<00:00:45.480> let's<00:00:45.690> make<00:00:45.840> changes<00:00:46.200> through

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
to the name let's make changes through

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.619 
to the name let's make changes through
their<00:00:46.500> sizes<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> small<00:00:48.090> one<00:00:48.300> I'm

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
their sizes so on the small one I'm

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.029 
their sizes so on the small one I'm
gonna<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.110> over<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.710> object

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
gonna go over here to the object

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.240 
gonna go over here to the object
properties<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.410> set<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> 10<00:00:52.860> by<00:00:53.010> 10

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
properties and set it to 10 by 10

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.840 
properties and set it to 10 by 10
centimeters<00:00:54.260> next<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> big<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:55.890> I'll

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
centimeters next on the big one I'll

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.970 
centimeters next on the big one I'll
change<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.570> 2000<00:00:58.530> by<00:00:58.949> 2000<00:01:00.350> after<00:01:01.350> doing<00:01:01.770> so

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
change it to 2000 by 2000 after doing so

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.189 
change it to 2000 by 2000 after doing so
you'll<00:01:02.160> notice<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.579> we<00:01:03.329> cannot<00:01:03.570> see<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you'll notice that we cannot see the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.010 
you'll notice that we cannot see the
whole<00:01:04.640> rectangle<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.060> created<00:01:06.360> we

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
whole rectangle that we just created we

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.230

to<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.780> particular<00:01:10.260> object<00:01:10.619> we<00:01:10.650> have

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
to the particular object we have

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.539 
to the particular object we have
selected<00:01:11.430> or<00:01:11.670> frame<00:01:12.330> all<00:01:12.570> objects<00:01:13.310> next<00:01:14.310> thing

we want to do is we want to make this

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.740 
we want to do is we want to make this
editable<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:16.830> before<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:17.490> do<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.119> we<00:01:18.299> need<00:01:18.630> to

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
editable but before we do so we need to

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.410 
editable but before we do so we need to
round<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.170> corners<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:19.979> spline<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:21.180> with

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
round the corners of this spline so with

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.570 
round the corners of this spline so with
the<00:01:21.540> big<00:01:21.750> rectangle<00:01:22.020> selected<00:01:22.890> I'll<00:01:23.159> come

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
the big rectangle selected I'll come

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.190 
the big rectangle selected I'll come
down<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:23.939> into<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.240> properties<00:01:24.720> click<00:01:24.960> on

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
down here into the properties click on

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.109 
down here into the properties click on
rounding<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.799> I'll<00:01:26.130> change<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.610> radius<00:01:26.970> to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
rounding and I'll change the radius to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.960 
rounding and I'll change the radius to
300<00:01:27.799> you'll<00:01:28.799> notice<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.430> what's<00:01:29.759> going

300 you'll notice this is what's going

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.060 
300 you'll notice this is what's going
to<00:01:30.060> create<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.689> curvature<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.229> our<00:01:31.439> cyclorama

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
to create the curvature of our cyclorama

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.999 
to create the curvature of our cyclorama
right<00:01:33.079> next<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.170> need<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.439> go<00:01:34.560> over<00:01:34.590> here<00:01:34.950> and

right next we need to go over here and

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.520 
right next we need to go over here and
make<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.400> edible<00:01:35.689> when<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:36.810> make<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.020> editable

make it edible when we make it editable

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.740 
make it edible when we make it editable
we<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.310> change<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.790> points<00:01:39.150> sides<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
we can change the points sides and

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.530 
we can change the points sides and
polygons<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.829> particular<00:01:41.310> object<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.939> this

selection well I was gonna draw a

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.749 
selection well I was gonna draw a
selection<00:01:57.899> over<00:01:58.290> these<00:01:58.530> three<00:01:58.799> dots<00:01:59.070> I'll

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
selection over these three dots I'll

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.550

and go down to sweepnurbs basically what

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.520 
and go down to sweepnurbs basically what
sweepnurbs<00:02:26.849> does<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.629> uses<00:02:27.930> two<00:02:28.140> or<00:02:28.260> three

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
sweepnurbs does is it uses two or three

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.640 
sweepnurbs does is it uses two or three
spines<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:30.500> contour<00:02:31.500> an<00:02:31.650> object<00:02:32.129> based<00:02:32.430> on<00:02:33.650> two

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
spines to contour an object based on two

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.229 
spines to contour an object based on two
or<00:02:34.799> three<00:02:34.950> splines<00:02:35.250> right<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.580> first<00:02:35.819> spline

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
or three splines right the first spline

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.780 
or three splines right the first spline
which<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:36.870> gonna<00:02:37.170> be<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.470> small<00:02:37.799> one<00:02:38.040> as<00:02:38.250> we

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
which is gonna be the small one as we

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.690 
which is gonna be the small one as we
drag<00:02:39.120> in<00:02:39.360> we're<00:02:39.870> saying<00:02:40.200> use<00:02:40.739> this<00:02:41.010> first

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
drag in we're saying use this first

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.960 
drag in we're saying use this first
spline<00:02:42.150> or<00:02:42.450> object<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.590> deform<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.580> second

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
spline or object to deform the second

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.220 
spline or object to deform the second
object<00:02:45.360> which<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.599> going<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.780> be<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.049> big

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
object which is going to be the big

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.259 
object which is going to be the big
slide<00:02:46.470> when<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.040> go<00:02:47.280> ahead<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.640> drop<00:02:47.880> this<00:02:48.060> in

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
slide when I go ahead and drop this in

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.089 
slide when I go ahead and drop this in
right<00:02:48.510> here<00:02:48.840> we'll<00:02:49.260> see<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.680> this<00:02:49.829> is<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
right here we'll see that this is the

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.949 
right here we'll see that this is the
proper<00:02:50.489> ordering<00:02:50.940> if<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.630> switch<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
proper ordering if we switch the

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.410 
proper ordering if we switch the
ordering<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.680> will<00:02:52.769> change<00:02:53.130> what<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:54.150> looks

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
ordering it will change what this looks

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.740 
ordering it will change what this looks
like<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:54.660> make<00:02:55.079> sure<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.410> small<00:02:55.530> one<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:55.980> first

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
like so make sure the small one is first

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.300 
like so make sure the small one is first
next<00:02:57.750> thing<00:02:57.930> we're<00:02:58.110> going<00:02:58.349> to<00:02:58.440> adjust<00:02:58.980> the

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
next thing we're going to adjust the

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.460 
next thing we're going to adjust the
properties<00:02:59.849> of<00:02:59.879> the<00:03:00.209> small<00:03:00.510> one<00:03:00.720> when<00:03:01.290> we

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
properties of the small one when we

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.800 
properties of the small one when we
increase<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.099> height<00:03:02.340> you'll<00:03:03.299> notice<00:03:03.690> that

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
increase the height you'll notice that

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.839 
increase the height you'll notice that
we<00:03:03.930> start<00:03:04.170> widening<00:03:04.769> out<00:03:04.980> our<00:03:05.190> cyclorama

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
we start widening out our cyclorama

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.559 
we start widening out our cyclorama
let's<00:03:06.660> put<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.200> three<00:03:07.440> thousand<00:03:08.569> this

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
let's put this to three thousand this

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.470 
let's put this to three thousand this
width<00:03:10.010> property<00:03:11.010> right<00:03:11.519> here<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:11.910> how<00:03:12.120> wide

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
width property right here is how wide

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.479 
width property right here is how wide
the<00:03:12.690> Cyclorama<00:03:13.170> is<00:03:13.379> I'll<00:03:13.560> press<00:03:13.920> three<00:03:14.250> on<00:03:14.370> my

keyboard and left-click with my mouse to
orbit<00:03:17.609> around<00:03:18.150> if<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:19.109> change<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.799> width

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
orbit around if I change the width

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.009 
orbit around if I change the width
property<00:03:20.579> it<00:03:20.730> will<00:03:20.819> change<00:03:21.180> right<00:03:21.510> there<00:03:21.780> so

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
property it will change right there so

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.960 
property it will change right there so
if<00:03:22.139> I<00:03:22.260> change<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.769> one<00:03:23.069> will<00:03:23.579> notice<00:03:23.730> our

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
if I change this to one will notice our

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.809 
if I change this to one will notice our
cyclorama<00:03:24.569> is<00:03:24.810> only<00:03:24.989> one<00:03:25.319> unit<00:03:25.739> in<00:03:25.920> width<00:03:26.220> or

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
cyclorama is only one unit in width or

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.699 
cyclorama is only one unit in width or
one<00:03:27.120> centimeter<00:03:27.660> because<00:03:27.810> centimeter<00:03:28.350> is<00:03:28.530> the

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
one centimeter because centimeter is the

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.729 
one centimeter because centimeter is the
current<00:03:29.099> units<00:03:29.819> that<00:03:30.030> we're<00:03:30.180> using<00:03:30.450> right<00:03:30.750> so

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
current units that we're using right so

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.220 
current units that we're using right so
whether<00:03:32.040> this<00:03:32.250> is<00:03:32.430> set<00:03:32.639> to<00:03:32.670> one<00:03:33.000> or<00:03:33.359> ten<00:03:33.750> it

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
whether this is set to one or ten it

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.229 
whether this is set to one or ten it
really<00:03:34.500> doesn't<00:03:34.799> matter<00:03:34.920> I'll<00:03:35.459> go<00:03:35.639> ahead<00:03:35.970> and

really doesn't matter I'll go ahead and

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.150 
really doesn't matter I'll go ahead and
orbit<00:03:36.569> around<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:37.170> I'll<00:03:37.349> press<00:03:37.590> H<00:03:37.829> on<00:03:38.010> my

orbit around and I'll press H on my
keyboard<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.790> reframe<00:03:40.099> next<00:03:41.099> we<00:03:41.250> can<00:03:41.400> add<00:03:41.609> a

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
keyboard to reframe next we can add a

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.819 
keyboard to reframe next we can add a
material<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.780> sweepnurbs<00:03:43.049> so<00:03:43.590> we<00:03:43.680> can

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
material to the sweepnurbs so we can

real quick let's add a little bit of
interest<00:05:39.560> to<00:05:39.800> our<00:05:39.830> scene<00:05:40.220> I<00:05:40.370> know<00:05:40.490> this<00:05:40.760> is

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
interest to our scene I know this is

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.150 
interest to our scene I know this is
beyond<00:05:41.240> the<00:05:41.420> quick<00:05:41.630> tip<00:05:41.840> of<00:05:42.020> the<00:05:42.140> tutorial<00:05:42.710> but

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
beyond the quick tip of the tutorial but

body on the collider body we want to

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.470 
body on the collider body we want to
make<00:06:00.950> sure<00:06:00.980> that<00:06:01.280> the<00:06:01.430> dynamics<00:06:02.000> are<00:06:02.150> set<00:06:02.360> to

make sure that the dynamics are set to

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.680 
make sure that the dynamics are set to
on<00:06:02.660> and<00:06:03.820> let's<00:06:04.820> see<00:06:05.030> I<00:06:05.060> think<00:06:05.180> on<00:06:05.600> the

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
on and let's see I think on the

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.790 
on and let's see I think on the
rigidbody<00:06:06.050> we<00:06:06.590> need<00:06:06.830> to<00:06:07.070> set<00:06:07.550> our<00:06:08.800> from

rigidbody we need to set our from

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.850 
rigidbody we need to set our from
automatic<00:06:10.220> to<00:06:10.460> static<00:06:11.360> mesh<00:06:11.660> you<00:06:12.260> may<00:06:12.410> not<00:06:12.560> see

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
automatic to static mesh you may not see

automatic to static mesh you may not see
this<00:06:13.070> here<00:06:13.370> in<00:06:13.400> the<00:06:13.760> tutorial<00:06:14.420> but<00:06:14.600> here

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
this here in the tutorial but here

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.200 
this here in the tutorial but here
changing<00:06:15.650> the<00:06:15.740> shape<00:06:15.980> from<00:06:16.250> automatic<00:06:16.640> there

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
changing the shape from automatic there

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.670 
changing the shape from automatic there
is<00:06:17.330> an<00:06:17.480> option<00:06:17.870> the<00:06:17.990> third<00:06:18.170> one<00:06:18.380> from<00:06:18.530> the
