00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:12.510
 the children the pictures because they are theirs 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.759
 own world want to have the 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.030
 characterized history further decisive 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.030
 to write 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.930
 a conflict and that sports 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.199
 inevitably the adults could 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.760
 already the word found product that is 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.650
 not a childhood disease 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.080
 there are always two, sometimes even three 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.809
 generations the legs involved in it 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.450
 are the adult product of your with 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.370
 They try their children and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.649
 adults will slow down 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.239
 that will of course be ridiculous as would 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.000
 you try the rotation of it 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.500
 accelerate or lose 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.379
 the desire of the youth to break out 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.430
 no time to spend with the parents 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.070
 is of course understandable 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.270
 They know that I have been around long enough 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.579
 vigorously and break out 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.239
 the other many interesting people 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.370
 the parents will know the parents 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.170
 By contrast , the Indian continued to run 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.360
 it would look round and about the same 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.869
 The parents add up in the factory 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.729
 small square rooms where you are 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.610
 dearest in the corners sit with it 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.409
 No one talk to him about children 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.090
 can 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.400
 From the square the parents clean up 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.939
 on a round are the children 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.619
 built 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.930
 it is the paradox that produces 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.860
 children walk away and also from 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.439
 often after them 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:39.329
 after two hours at the latest you will get it 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.180
 eat with us or blog of religion 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.180
 stand whole story 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:49.939
 I have it in my new book 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.939
 cool parents live left written 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:15.780
 kennedys there comes out again 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:18.560
 so pouring space leads to and then 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.560
 knock here
