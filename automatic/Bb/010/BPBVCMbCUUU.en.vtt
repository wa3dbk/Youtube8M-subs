00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.140 
they come out of the hole so we know
exactly<00:02:12.530> how<00:02:12.739> long<00:02:12.920> we<00:02:13.160> need<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.430> go<00:02:13.579> this

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
exactly how long we need to go this

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.280 
exactly how long we need to go this
measurement<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:14.690> looks<00:02:14.840> like<00:02:14.959> we're<00:02:15.079> going<00:02:15.200> to

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
measurement it looks like we're going to

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.710 
measurement it looks like we're going to
need<00:02:15.380> an<00:02:15.470> 8<00:02:15.739> inch<00:02:16.040> extension<00:02:16.910> on<00:02:17.000> every<00:02:17.390> single

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
need an 8 inch extension on every single

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.750 
need an 8 inch extension on every single
wire<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.170> goes<00:02:18.380> into<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:18.920> wire<00:02:19.130> harness<00:02:19.370> we

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
wire that goes into this wire harness we

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.309 
wire that goes into this wire harness we
need<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.060> same<00:02:20.269> length<00:02:20.569> for<00:02:20.810> our<00:02:20.900> lines<00:02:21.140> and

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
need the same length for our lines and

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.259 
need the same length for our lines and
cables<00:02:21.739> actually<00:02:22.579> kill<00:02:22.730> their<00:02:22.849> lines<00:02:23.120> and

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
cables actually kill their lines and

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.270 
cables actually kill their lines and
cables<00:02:23.360> don't<00:02:23.720> get<00:02:23.870> run<00:02:24.019> inside<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.709> bar<00:02:24.950> so

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
cables don't get run inside the bar so

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.229 
cables don't get run inside the bar so
that<00:02:25.310> measurement<00:02:25.790> is<00:02:25.970> going<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.150> be

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
that measurement is going to be

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.030 
that measurement is going to be
extremely<00:02:26.569> different<00:02:26.930> come<00:02:27.260> on<00:02:27.380> in<00:02:27.500> close<00:02:27.799> and

extremely different come on in close and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.949 
extremely different come on in close and
take<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.190> look<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:29.209> measurement<00:02:29.630> for<00:02:29.780> lines

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
take a look the measurement for lines

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.420 
take a look the measurement for lines
and<00:02:30.140> cables<00:02:30.530> is<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> little<00:02:30.950> bit<00:02:31.040> different

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430

and<00:04:01.640> cut<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:01.790> I'm<00:04:02.090> then<00:04:02.870> going<00:04:03.019> to<00:04:03.079> move<00:04:03.319> a<00:04:03.620> half

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
and cut it I'm then going to move a half

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.220 
and cut it I'm then going to move a half
inch<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:04.400> an<00:04:04.609> inch<00:04:04.939> farther<00:04:05.540> up<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:05.959> chain

step is to feed the wires through the

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.270 
step is to feed the wires through the
bar<00:05:27.139> by<00:05:27.620> heating<00:05:27.889> this<00:05:28.159> wire<00:05:28.460> through<00:05:28.880> the<00:05:28.970> bar

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
bar by heating this wire through the bar

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.680 
bar by heating this wire through the bar
we're<00:05:31.280> now<00:05:31.400> going<00:05:31.580> to<00:05:31.669> tie<00:05:31.820> our<00:05:31.849> heat<00:05:32.330> to<00:05:32.659> our

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
we're now going to tie our heat to our

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.990 
we're now going to tie our heat to our
pole<00:05:33.020> wire<00:05:33.280> now<00:05:34.280> we<00:05:34.340> have<00:05:34.550> the<00:05:34.639> pole<00:05:34.820> wire

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
pole wire now we have the pole wire

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.850 
pole wire now we have the pole wire
connected<00:05:35.659> I'm<00:05:35.870> going<00:05:36.050> to<00:05:36.110> go<00:05:36.229> ahead<00:05:36.349> and

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
connected I'm going to go ahead and

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.920 
connected I'm going to go ahead and
gently

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
gently

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:48.749 
gently
pull<00:05:46.800> the<00:05:47.800> next<00:05:48.070> step<00:05:48.220> of<00:05:48.280> the<00:05:48.340> operation

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
pull the next step of the operation

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.850 
pull the next step of the operation
we're<00:05:48.850> going<00:05:48.970> to<00:05:49.030> undo<00:05:49.300> the<00:05:49.389> pull<00:05:49.600> wire<00:05:49.860> we're

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
we're going to undo the pull wire we're

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.310 
we're going to undo the pull wire we're
then<00:05:51.039> going<00:05:51.280> to<00:05:51.400> solder<00:05:51.880> on<00:05:52.150> all<00:05:52.419> the<00:05:52.900> rest<00:05:53.139> of

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
then going to solder on all the rest of

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.529 
then going to solder on all the rest of
our<00:05:53.440> original<00:05:54.130> lead<00:05:54.340> to<00:05:54.820> the<00:05:54.940> black<00:05:55.210> wires

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
our original lead to the black wires

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.930 
our original lead to the black wires
that<00:05:55.780> we<00:05:55.870> extended<00:05:56.289> this

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.460
