00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.980
 what I do a lot in practice t compass in advance situation screw turn forest side hi 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.980
 touring 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:19.689
 And so is the hope that the engine 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.849
 the distance drops a tour 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.789
 and then can eventually result in a banned engine 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.829
 the battery is charged overall 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.789
 Because it is better to come on, we advise every time 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.120
 school operation to set the machine and the low revs 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.120
 but more than a screw in 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.400
 then hear that the engine keeps running nicely 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.570
 only at the end when the head reaches it 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.850
 then the engine sagged 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.899
 the intention then is to reduce the demolition link 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.840
 well a certain class that for those muckards 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.790
 so that the slip clutch takes effect were the screw 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.790
 to the material 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.030
 bark it neatly neat with being allowed to make material and a piece 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.910
 clutch is one and they take effect causing the engine 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.890
 from on if remains spared to make the battery last longer 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.890
 it is the agency for maintaining the quality of the machine 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.640
 if we look at small school edits by exactly the same 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.020
 Only that countries slip clutch bearing 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.300
 we are now going to look at a larger operation 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.840
 screw the law for six millimeters as the drone increasing meter 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.220
 and we have set the machine to sharp 16 low speed 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.570
 the holding the engine running well or not being unloaded on the battery 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.500
 charged 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.700
 just the screw 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.940
 Often, the material is not completely recessed because the quick coupling is quick 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.600
 enters into force 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.229
 that now choose to put this mission into the forest then putting it at risk 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.140
 run on the weather to the engines, the battery can be unloaded 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.710
 The best solution is to crack over on a bomb screw or on one now 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.850
 made slave 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.850
 the barriers they were increasingly eager to begin with 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:15.889
 jo tribe and a posco tail from china and soon come along 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:16.879
 each other 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.650
 and you switch the war when the forest commercial with setstand 16 low revs 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.989
 can't finish anymore 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.909
 a lock for a dripping chip card completely from the transfer and to it 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.110
 never promises a motor and the battery when it is screwing and running 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.929
 and you see that as a lacquer shoe on which it withers made 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:43.149
 kept in the material without making grumbling on the overloaded 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:47.089
 so summarizing 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:50.930
 inventing the forest school is that setup position 16 low revs 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.860
 the maximum position moving there were a lot of screwdriver 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.359
 cannot make an operation 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.359
 chess or storage just score 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.189
 when you go out next to the drilling school 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.529
 the best thing for small animals is to use a victim 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:10.210
 the lock premature namely a one like in the coen speed 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.439
 then the forest group machine 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.019
 the top 4 of the contours 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.019
 what is perfect for small animals mertens 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:21.899
 that is, it is quickly a lot faster how angry come up 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.650
 and which ten schools try to grab four millimeters one the case 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.650
 was still sticking out 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.389
 a whole diameter of the bend would become too large 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.980
 and this case a team in the meter you will find that the lock just come in 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:41.299
 to beat 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.639
 and that is not popular among people for the quality of the hole and certainly not for it 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.239
 keep the bend 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.340
 so when the lock come but start beating baby with everything back 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.269
 or also approximated dosko appeared 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.879
 and you can then put that in the convex position 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.200
 circulation or high rpm depending on the bear meter of the bow 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.329
 the benefits bunch for you must stand a piece March 16 by editing this can 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:13.839
 to do 

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:15.599
 then we switch to the battle made
