00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.679
 this propaganda propaganda us not 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.730
 interested in the bare facts interest us 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.190
 cause and effect truth is always the same 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.020
 hello this week exactly 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.000
 six years after the start of the global 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.859
 economic crisis american 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.160
 the Fed decided to cancel 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.420
 quantitative easing programs 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.910
 which, for simplicity, many called 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.740
 money printing cancellation mitigation 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.180
 events as epoch-making as 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.160
 and began to mitigate economic chemist 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.780
 the situation is gradually increasing 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.850
 the labor market has improved somewhat 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.010
 new jobs are being reduced 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.960
 unemployment a whole range of indicators 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.120
 testify not to use 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.960
 manpower is gradually reduced 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.520
 not until the use of resources all this 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.899
 financial terminology with her 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.489
 intricate turns and 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.859
 heaps of mysterious words 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.350
 only need for one purpose powder 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.270
 people do not have brains to use 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.939
 workforce for a specific 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.250
 human means one simple thing 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.840
 place in line at the labor office and also 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.880
 translate fair statement from into language 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.740
 human it sounds like this 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.540
 since we have our choices in 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.799
 congress we stop typing yet 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.110
 dollars at the same rate 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.600
 but at any moment ready to do it 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.430
 again all the signs of a recovery 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.500
 dreamed up to the american authorities in 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.040
 reality is also a manipulation 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.650
 in numbers 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.040
 reducing unemployment to 6 percent in 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.960
 USA 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.520
 due to the fact that corporations 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.780
 everywhere transfer workers to 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.880
 part time 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.979
 and hundreds of thousands of people who did not find work 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.000
 for the time allotted by law just 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.880
 deregistered 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.460
 dissolve disappear from radar no 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.130
 man no problem such a market 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.049
 totalitarianism and that is the only thing 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.270
 explanation emerging in america 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.649
 consumptive growth just american 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.049
 the worker is asked to shrink 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.479
 Now feel the skin of Chinese 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.000
 the paradox is that thanks to the military 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.250
 orders along with this corporation boeing 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.290
 general electric saved and bankrupt 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.100
 general motors shows a record 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.900
 profit 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.569
 but profit is not converted to new 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.459
 production or new jobs behind 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.069
 six years the American authorities have painted 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.380
 almost 4 trillion dollars they all 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.239
 what a surprise surfaced on the stock exchanges 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.239
 on the balance sheets of the largest banks 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.020
 quantitative easing is not reflected 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.090
 on demand for one reason we observe 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.730
 frantic rise in stock price expansion 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.610
 bank liabilities but these are the only ones 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.750
 indicators that grow with this 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.280
 grindstone speaking to an audience 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.220
 New York International Council 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.709
 relationship concluded that the frs is unlikely 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.450
 it will be possible to cancel mitigation so that 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.510
 cause panic in world markets 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.530
 and she has where to take 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.870
 industrial production in Germany from July to 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.670
 August was stained by 4 percent thanks 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.800
 sanctions of course there is not one 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.160
 sanction forecast of the German Chamber of Commerce 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.290
 for GDP growth for the next year 0.8 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.810
 percent if you take 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.480
 average ward temperature in europe 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.980
 here0 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.470
 the economist magazine is dedicated to this topic 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.600
 a separate article with such a cute 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.650
 parrot as an illustration 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.570
 stopping economic growth in 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.579
 Germany threatens to plunge Europe into 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.120
 third consecutive recession in recent 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.489
 six years 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.950
 eurozone debt from waist to 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.959
 Greece grow it will continue to scare 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.760
 investors strengthen populist policies 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.600
 sooner rather than later lead to 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.209
 the collapse of the euro which are afraid of deflation 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.530
 Europe and America are used to us 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.070
 rather to inflation 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.049
 wonder but no less terrible 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.359
 deflation shrinking loan wage prices 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.790
 payments this economic rider 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:48.090
 apocalypse for deflation comes 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.040
 depression what from all this russia how 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.530
 all this corresponds to a dollar of 45 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.470
 euro for 50 with rising prices in 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.760
 Stores with gasoline prices rising for 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.560
 does not correlate in full 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.459
 according to another liberal 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.989
 dogma everyone dies alone this 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.730
 yesterday we could refer to 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.620
 negative external conditions on 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.470
 debt crisis on the machinations of the sages 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.930
 barrel street crisis today there it is only 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.209
 the reason for the conclusions here is the reason to ask 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.380
 questions and change swiftly change 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.290
 economic policy 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.050
 translate it on mobile for 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.570
 he her rails why the interest rate in 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:26.630
 Europe USA Japan is 0 with a penny 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.180
 and we have 8 or even 9 for whom for 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.710
 foreign investors so if they are not 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.040
 go to us now it seems 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.320
 only on the tank why am the cb fed 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.090
 overwhelm your economy and we 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.280
 We are afraid to give the production worker an extra 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.710
 the ruble why we continue open 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.140
 Mouth to listen already a financier already 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.820
 economist already an expert who is not in 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.400
 able to distinguish the rolling mill 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.050
 from the electrolysis bath can be ours 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.450
 long-suffering inflation 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.000
 which europe can only dream of it 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.950
 not a curse about a gift because it entails 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.140
 behind the inflation of liberal thought 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.350
 depreciation of fake economic 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.560
 doctrines such inflation such a devaluation 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.330
 welcome 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.670
 it was agitation and propaganda soon 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.670
 see you in your home
