 the sky is filtered 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:11.139
 and we do not speak to go airs where the ocean is out of focus 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.029
 what she wants 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:17.029
 it's a little out of focus 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:18.769
 more or less 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.439

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:36.889
 more or less to go 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.889
 forgiveness can treat ability that our ballots 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:44.839
 I do not know if it expands these good ballots and they do not know that if you do not brazen 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:45.769

 Yes I think so 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.099
 so that this cairo box comes out 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.890
 and here you can make it a company that is measured so that 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.659
 that this is due to the brush 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.109
 I knew nothing but one way but several 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.699
 as in this case for example 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.409
 if you took also boosted the country 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.409

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.020
 the photo 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.219
 and then 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:40.389
 you put your letters and it's something a very simple way but put for me 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:41.830
