00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
on the back okay so did it sound

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.260 
on the back okay so did it sound
something<00:05:04.870> like<00:05:05.080> this

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.540 

every<00:05:08.960> string<00:05:09.380> needs<00:05:09.680> the<00:05:09.830> sound

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.080 

like<00:05:13.120> that<00:05:13.419> now<00:05:14.410> this<00:05:14.650> the<00:05:15.310> middle<00:05:15.550> finger<00:05:15.910> is

the<00:05:16.419> strongest<00:05:16.960> finger<00:05:17.530> so<00:05:18.449> you<00:05:19.449> can<00:05:19.629> use<00:05:19.900> it

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930
