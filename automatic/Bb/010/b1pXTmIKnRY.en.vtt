in now if you want to make this harder

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.320 
in now if you want to make this harder
in<00:02:25.170> addition<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.280> weight<00:02:26.459> you<00:02:26.910> can<00:02:27.090> start

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
in addition to the weight you can start

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.320 
in addition to the weight you can start
adding<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.690> little<00:02:27.720> twist<00:02:28.940> through<00:02:29.940> your<00:02:30.060> upper

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330

body<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.870> kind<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.110> becomes<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.500> little

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
body so it kind of becomes a little

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.340 
body so it kind of becomes a little
windmill<00:02:32.600> notice<00:02:33.600> I'm<00:02:33.720> not<00:02:33.840> standing<00:02:34.230> all<00:02:34.320> the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
windmill notice I'm not standing all the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.500 
windmill notice I'm not standing all the
way<00:02:34.530> up<00:02:34.650> I'm<00:02:35.220> stepping<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.880> side<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.420> a

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
way up I'm stepping to the side in a

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.960

squat position

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.240 
squat position
so<00:02:38.970> really<00:02:39.360> maximizing<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.739> lower<00:02:40.980> body

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
effort here out and step and out and

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.830 
effort here out and step and out and
step<00:02:45.870> that's<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.290> down<00:02:47.330> so<00:02:48.330> this<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:48.480> interval

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
step that's it down so this is interval

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.250 
step that's it down so this is interval
number<00:02:49.080> three<00:02:49.290> we<00:02:49.410> have<00:02:49.500> two<00:02:49.800> more<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.160> go<00:02:51.260> keep

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
number three we have two more to go keep

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.350
