00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
mostly stock there's been a few

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.340 
mostly stock there's been a few
modifications<00:00:47.629> one<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:48.930> see<00:00:49.140> right<00:00:49.170> off

modifications one you can see right off

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.260 
modifications one you can see right off
the<00:00:49.590> bat<00:00:49.739> here<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> navigation<00:00:50.940> buttons

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the bat here are the navigation buttons

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.790 
the bat here are the navigation buttons
those<00:00:51.539> have<00:00:51.719> been<00:00:51.809> modified<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.469> far<00:00:52.680> as

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
those have been modified as far as

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.500 
those have been modified as far as
theming<00:00:53.250> goes<00:00:53.430> that's<00:00:54.149> really<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> only

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
theming goes that's really the only

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.540 
theming goes that's really the only
theming<00:00:55.079> options<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:55.829> been<00:00:56.070> changed

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
theming options that have been changed

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.180 
theming options that have been changed
there's<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.000> few<00:00:57.210> added<00:00:57.600> applications<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:59.070> do

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
there's a few added applications you do

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.180 
there's a few added applications you do
have<00:00:59.309> Beats<00:00:59.640> control<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> file

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
have Beats control and you have the file

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.070 
have Beats control and you have the file
manager<00:01:02.430> there<00:01:02.820> those<00:01:03.030> come<00:01:03.300> included<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.049> I

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
manager there those come included and I

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.289 
manager there those come included and I
think<00:01:04.320> that's<00:01:04.470> about<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:05.040> as<00:01:05.309> far<00:01:05.880> as

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
think that's about it as far as

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.880 
think that's about it as far as
inclusions<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.080> apps<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.530> get<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.740> updated

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
inclusions and apps you get it updated

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.760 
inclusions and apps you get it updated
super<00:01:08.580> SU<00:01:09.229> application<00:01:10.229> which<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.470> pretty

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
super SU application which is pretty

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.190 
super SU application which is pretty
cool<00:01:11.240> other<00:01:12.240> than<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.780> run<00:01:12.930> into

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
cool other than that we can run into

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.390 
cool other than that we can run into
settings<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.450> we'll<00:01:15.450> go<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.600> about<00:01:15.960> phone<00:01:16.400> and

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
settings and we'll go to about phone and

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.570 
settings and we'll go to about phone and
you<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.259> version<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:20.130> dot<00:01:20.280> one

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
you see that this is version for dot one

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.810 
you see that this is version for dot one
is<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.939> axiom<00:01:21.420> engage<00:01:21.689> version<00:01:22.200> 1<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.820> I

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
is the axiom engage version 1 and I

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.120 
is the axiom engage version 1 and I
think<00:01:24.210> version<00:01:24.509> 2<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.869> out<00:01:25.020> by<00:01:25.200> now<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.979> can

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
think version 2 is out by now so you can

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.499 
think version 2 is out by now so you can
check<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.460> link<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.759> description<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
check the link in the description and

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.179 
check the link in the description and
i'm<00:01:27.930> pretty<00:01:28.110> sure<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.740> updated<00:01:29.159> to

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
i'm pretty sure that it is updated to

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.219 
i'm pretty sure that it is updated to
version<00:01:29.250> two<00:01:29.689> but<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.780> does<00:01:30.900> come<00:01:31.079> with<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
version two but it does come with a

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.230 
version two but it does come with a
stock<00:01:31.560> kernel<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.700> going<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.880> run<00:01:33.090> at

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
stock kernel and it's going to run at

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.850 
stock kernel and it's going to run at
one<00:01:33.390> point<00:01:33.570> two<00:01:33.750> gigahertz<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.530> thing<00:01:34.710> is

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
one point two gigahertz this thing is

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.700 
one point two gigahertz this thing is
blazing<00:01:35.400> fast<00:01:35.430> not<00:01:35.970> only<00:01:36.180> does<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.479> include

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
blazing fast not only does it include

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.109 
blazing fast not only does it include
