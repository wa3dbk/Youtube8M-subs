to the his range in return I apparently
they've<00:00:41.730> been<00:00:41.760> rather<00:00:42.120> cautious<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.719> my

touching the terrain generation since

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.220 
touching the terrain generation since
then<00:00:44.820> because<00:00:45.300> he<00:00:45.420> didn't<00:00:45.690> want<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> miss<00:00:46.050> up

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
then because he didn't want to miss up

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.930 
then because he didn't want to miss up
people's<00:00:46.590> seeds<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.129> change<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.579> offsets

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
people's seeds and change the offsets

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.060 
people's seeds and change the offsets
and<00:00:48.120> generally<00:00:48.629> have<00:00:48.809> nasty<00:00:49.140> boulders<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.860> ones

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
and generally have nasty boulders a ones

eat cut site and no one starts to narrow

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.090 
eat cut site and no one starts to narrow
oh<00:00:52.410> yes<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:53.610> mr.<00:00:54.390> Jibson<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:55.379> are<00:00:55.530> changing

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
oh yes but mr. Jibson we are changing

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.189 
oh yes but mr. Jibson we are changing
because<00:00:56.430> they<00:00:57.030> think<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.480> oceans<00:00:57.870> are<00:00:58.020> rather

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
because they think the oceans are rather

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.910 
because they think the oceans are rather
too<00:00:58.500> large<00:00:58.680> loving<00:00:59.340> times<00:00:59.550> agree<00:00:59.879> they're

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
too large loving times agree they're

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.090 
too large loving times agree they're
huge

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
huge

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.880 
huge
yes<00:01:02.460> uneven<00:01:03.210> random<00:01:03.750> biome<00:01:04.140> replacement<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
yes uneven random biome replacement and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.950 
yes uneven random biome replacement and
that's<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.519> bit<00:01:05.670> ugly<00:01:05.970> I'm<00:01:06.450> not<00:01:06.689> enough

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
that's a bit ugly I'm not enough

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.350 
that's a bit ugly I'm not enough
variation<00:01:07.350> well<00:01:08.040> indeed<00:01:08.460> videos<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.090> may

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
variation well indeed videos as you may

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.359 
variation well indeed videos as you may
recall<00:01:09.510> presently<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.350> plans<00:01:10.619> are<00:01:10.920> indeed

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
recall presently the plans are indeed

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.520 
recall presently the plans are indeed
somewhat<00:01:11.939> uneven<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.720> random<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.260> not

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
somewhat uneven and random it is not

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.530 
somewhat uneven and random it is not
enough<00:01:13.740> variation<00:01:14.070> does<00:01:14.700> learning<00:01:15.210> somewhat

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
enough variation does learning somewhat

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.300 
enough variation does learning somewhat
uh<00:01:15.570> perhaps<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.080> Ted<00:01:16.409> ugly<00:01:16.799> look<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> health

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
uh perhaps I Ted ugly look to the health

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.020 
uh perhaps I Ted ugly look to the health
in<00:01:17.520> your<00:01:17.549> nails

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
in your nails

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.429 
in your nails
yes<00:01:22.310> what<00:01:23.310> anyway<00:01:23.729> mr.<00:01:24.330> Jeff<00:01:24.540> has<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> solution

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
yes what anyway mr. Jeff has a solution

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.080 
yes what anyway mr. Jeff has a solution
oh<00:01:26.780> yes<00:01:27.780> these<00:01:28.619> solutions<00:01:28.920> oh<00:01:29.340> they're<00:01:29.820> going

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
oh yes these solutions oh they're going

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.200 
oh yes these solutions oh they're going
to<00:01:30.210> add<00:01:30.570> more<00:01:31.110> islands<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:32.159> well<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:32.640> checks<00:01:33.030> a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
to add more islands as well as checks a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.510 
to add more islands as well as checks a
huge<00:01:33.479> ocean<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.140> they<00:01:34.619> are<00:01:34.710> presumably<00:01:35.189> going

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
huge ocean so they are presumably going

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.340 
huge ocean so they are presumably going
to<00:01:35.640> fill<00:01:35.939> up<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.180> water<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.509> islands<00:01:37.079> well

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
to fill up the water in islands well

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.230 
to fill up the water in islands well
indeed<00:01:37.829> my<00:01:38.009> observing<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.670> was<00:01:38.790> look<00:01:38.970> closely

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
indeed my observing it was look closely

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.719 
indeed my observing it was look closely
at<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.659> comparison<00:01:40.170> map<00:01:40.439> between<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> 1.6

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
