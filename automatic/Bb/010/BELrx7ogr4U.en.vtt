00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.560
 Welcome to the Holy Spirit 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:08.620
 the fourth scum and degenerate as 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.820
 bosses the operations manager nico minutes 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.540
 I want to give you a closer look at this boss 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.880
 explain 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.549
 you will draw from the story 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.590
 as well as hard mode see regardless of 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.070
 Difficulty comes from all ten of 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.080
 the guild revenge of server c3 on 4 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.529
 the reason for the breakdown lies 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.080
 in that in the server as well as hard 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.090
 almost everything is the same 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.730
 from the moment for the whole 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.090
 history time is in story mode 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.489
 ten minutes to you the operations manager 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.250
 must have attacked and in economy mode 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.110
 but 6 the second reason lies in it 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.989
 that you divide your operation group 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.149
 is completely self-sufficient in four 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.710
 groups at different points 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.789
 drive 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.539
 So you will be in the next few minutes 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:57.430
 material from all teams but see that 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.859
 was partly from the sixteenth 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.170
 and outside makes player mode and 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.260
 additionally as tory and heavy mode 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.840
 mixed the infiltration of the oasis city 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.990
 So your countdown for it starts soon 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.880
 the gate is open and in that 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.650
 you should already have yours 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.470
 So teams have divided 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.350
 Know where to go on the way 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.560
 there will be a series of 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.659
 opponents in the way are therefore next to the 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.180
 two-headed teams that you have to kill 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.369
 is there still oasen enforcer fight? 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.740
 Truids have a lot of health 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.509
 and you should as possible from the 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.729
 So go around these 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.619
 if you get caught 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.939
 you probably have to kill them 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.070
 then respawn within 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.369
 a few seconds makes you so immediately 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.380
 from the dust if you have a killed 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.560
 theoretically you can also c10 and 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.390
 then start the fight to the operations manager 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.700
 if it is very close but im 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.380
 He should then kill the droids 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.880
 if you were once caught by him 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.619
 So let's start with the 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.689
 There are four groups here 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.140
 locations in the eight player mode have to 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:08.019
 you each have two people to one of these 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.390
 red green gold and blue teams are sending in 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.470
 16 players must then logically four 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.090
 player per team 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.710
 and it can never be more 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.300
 because if you attack such a team 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.760
 the corresponding players get the 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.730
 baw if that more than she allowed 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.760
 Number are the teams just solve 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.190
 alarm and the fight is over 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.610
 the first team right at the entrance 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.190
 is almost the team red that consists of 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.890
 a flames technician and a storm 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.910
 protect this set high initial 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.130
 damage on 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.260
 above all things the flame technician 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.700
 So you should kill that first 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.740
 and stop constantly 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.680
 we solved this here so that we 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.140
 on this team two damage makers 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.670
 usually send that if you can 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.709
 should also be one of the damage 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.209
 but do have healing abilities and 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.190
 make good use of it 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.840
 Of course it would be ideal if the 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.350
 second position maker good defensive 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.510
 has skills 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.850
 At the second point we are at team 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.440
 green this consists of a you land 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.730
 and napo wache both report permanently 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.920
 very high damage 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.400
 partly also by surface attacks 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.220
 attacks here primarily the pyro waking up and 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.080
 interrupts her too we send here 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.450
 always and tank and a highlight here 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.980
 you also have to go to one 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.050
 Patrol always pay attention to the stairs 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.840
 of course you should not go up 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.690
 involved in fighting 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.210
 so team green just into a fight 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.980
 then jumps down and hides 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.900
 you so that he is out of sight 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.610
 and the team come down stairs, so to speak 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.820
 must and will be their advantage in 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.770
 In this way you bypass the oasis 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.470
 Executor fight druids 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.570
 the whole thing gets a lot easier 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.190
 third team team gold is located in 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.250
 a building and consists of one 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.200
 Medley and an office guard the middle 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.000
 Of course I will cure and have to 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.890
 be killed first accordingly 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.320
 also you should cure his 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.730
 stop immediately if here in the 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.990
 healing comes through or a 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.240
 hort then comes through 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.640
 additionally they should kill the extra 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.250
 For this reason we have to send 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.430
 Team gold actually always two damage 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.510
 Make it essential there 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.220
 be more effective 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.530
 the last team is a logical one 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.930
 team blue that consists of two packs 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.910
 Hunters and now we only have one 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.340
 healer and day we have over send 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.840
 the team there is blue too 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.340
 at the same time the most dangerous group 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.860
 those who hurt the most 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.570
 that makes both of them 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.150
 frontal areas attacking themselves 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.130
 Shockwave calls the two second cast 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.350
 since that is when you see that on 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.730
 best by the pack hunters through in 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.250
 their back so the shock waves 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.340
 not get it because if they are 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.910
 you get 17 k damage what 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.920
 One really immense amount is alternative 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.660
 Of course it could be to run through it 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.440
 also numb and thus the attack 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.150
 almost cancel 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.860
 if you did it all then 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.350
 You have to eliminate four teams 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.140
 driving northeast of the city 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.480
 in the security operations center 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.510
 you will find the actual bus where 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.970
 almost phase 2 takes place 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.940
 Instructor has basically three 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:23.450
 abilities on the one hand, it works 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.250
 terminate on the current thinks of 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.200
 must then logically defensive 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.790
 Use special skills if these 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.200
 attack somebody else 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.920
 should be the most likely 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.590
 die from it 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.230
 In addition, the operations manager is responsible 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.920
 always blast all games with crowds 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.870
 should that be two seconds kaarst 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.480
 at the latest when this probe expires 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.740
 after 25 seconds or if the player 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:53.010
 he suffers damage, he gets 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.330
 7500 damage from the detonator that 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.070
 So is harm to the measure! 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.470
 need and where their quasi easy to 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.030
 hull has to take care of that 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.670
 officer for that a few 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.560
 seconds after the mass blow up probe 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.300
 getting the rail guns out of the wall 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.070
 drive 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.100
 these are so many little guns 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.540
 are on the wall and the pro shot 2000 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.510
 cause damage and then as I said 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.470
 the detonator trigger trigger 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.220
 Random goals are here in the 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.210
 secondary harm takes medium damage 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.400
 always tried the rail guns like that 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.620
 quickly turn off as possible and 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.540
 then swings back to the 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.680
 head of operations 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.020
 that was it again 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.010
 the operations manager takes a spin 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.100
 in between still the current 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:36.780
 What kind of abo reset quasi 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.300
 According to that, at the moment should 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.660
 So currently thinks scoff and then 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.070
 everything should be in butter 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.020
 in fact, nothing remains for me now 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.700
 I hope the whole thing was fix 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.650
 understandable if you want you can 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.120
 you was all one again 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.680
 written form on our website 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.680
 ready for aging de View
