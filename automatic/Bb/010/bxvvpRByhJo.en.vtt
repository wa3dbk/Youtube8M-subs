ops<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.309> obviously<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.700> good<00:00:08.940> thing<00:00:09.290> and<00:00:10.290> not

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
ops is obviously a good thing and not

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.560 
ops is obviously a good thing and not
enough<00:00:11.070> people<00:00:11.400> go<00:00:11.519> for<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.759> objective<00:00:12.240> and

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
enough people go for the objective and

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.049 
enough people go for the objective and
I'm<00:00:12.840> definitely<00:00:13.349> more<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.400> an<00:00:14.580> objective

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
I'm definitely more of an objective

player you're going to see in this game
here<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.460> don't<00:00:17.699> really<00:00:17.880> go<00:00:18.060> through

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
here that I don't really go through

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.019 
here that I don't really go through
ective<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.810> much<00:00:19.279> bus<00:00:20.279> because<00:00:20.520> our<00:00:20.820> team

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
ective that much bus because our team

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.870 
ective that much bus because our team
was<00:00:21.210> dominating<00:00:21.810> them<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.260> bad<00:00:22.529> but<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.730> only

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
was dominating them so bad but the only

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.429 
was dominating them so bad but the only
reason<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.330> don't<00:00:24.570> go<00:00:24.750> through<00:00:24.960> jected<00:00:25.260> very

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
reason I don't go through jected very

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.050 
reason I don't go through jected very
often<00:00:25.740> because<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.099> get<00:00:26.220> rewarded<00:00:26.400> for<00:00:26.699> kills

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
often because you get rewarded for kills

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.660 
often because you get rewarded for kills
way<00:00:27.420> more<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:28.349> get<00:00:28.500> much<00:00:28.710> more<00:00:28.740> points<00:00:29.429> it's

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
way more you get much more points it's

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.359 
way more you get much more points it's
more<00:00:29.849> satisfying<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.800> so<00:00:31.800> maybe<00:00:31.980> they<00:00:32.189> could

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
more satisfying and so maybe they could

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.920 
more satisfying and so maybe they could
implement<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.850> system<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.300> makes<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.719> feel

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930

that's<00:00:37.590> better<00:00:37.829> than<00:00:38.010> getting<00:00:38.219> 50<00:00:38.489> kills

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
of having to go into each individual I

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.260 
of having to go into each individual I
want<00:03:27.650> explosives<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.370> be<00:03:28.459> less<00:03:28.640> important<00:03:29.180> in

want explosives to be less important in

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.840 
want explosives to be less important in
the<00:03:29.390> game<00:03:29.570> so<00:03:29.900> I<00:03:30.440> think<00:03:30.830> in<00:03:31.190> modern<00:03:31.490> warfare<00:03:31.610> 2

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
the game so I think in modern warfare 2

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.580 
the game so I think in modern warfare 2
we<00:03:32.120> all<00:03:32.240> agree<00:03:32.570> that<00:03:32.600> bloop<00:03:33.110> tubes<00:03:33.380> were<00:03:33.560> a

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
we all agree that bloop tubes were a

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.530 
we all agree that bloop tubes were a
little<00:03:33.890> bit<00:03:34.130> excessive<00:03:34.490> and<00:03:34.970> everyone<00:03:35.360> used

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
little bit excessive and everyone used

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.870 
little bit excessive and everyone used
them<00:03:35.810> black<00:03:36.470> ops<00:03:36.680> i<00:03:36.950> think<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.370> grenades<00:03:37.700> and

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
them black ops i think the grenades and

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.030 
them black ops i think the grenades and
semtex<00:03:38.390> aren't<00:03:38.840> very<00:03:39.080> good<00:03:39.170> they're<00:03:39.770> not<00:03:39.860> good

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
semtex aren't very good they're not good

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.580 
semtex aren't very good they're not good
enough<00:03:40.310> and<00:03:40.870> however<00:03:41.870> claimed<00:03:42.110> wars<00:03:42.440> are

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
enough and however claimed wars are

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.410 
enough and however claimed wars are
overpowered<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:43.340> ce4<00:03:43.880> and<00:03:44.090> things<00:03:44.209> like<00:03:44.360> that

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
overpowered and ce4 and things like that

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.420 
overpowered and ce4 and things like that
but<00:03:44.750> I'd<00:03:45.200> love<00:03:45.380> modern<00:03:45.650> warfare<00:03:45.860> 3<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.340> be

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
but I'd love modern warfare 3 to be

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.000 
but I'd love modern warfare 3 to be
focused<00:03:46.850> on<00:03:46.970> gun<00:03:47.180> on<00:03:47.300> gunn<00:03:47.450> action<00:03:47.600> less<00:03:48.410> less

training because again black ops did a

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:17.439 
training because again black ops did a
great<00:05:16.400> thing<00:05:16.430> they<00:05:16.879> came<00:05:17.029> up<00:05:17.060> with<00:05:17.180> a<00:05:17.270> great

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
great thing they came up with a great

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.420 
great thing they came up with a great
concept<00:05:18.020> but<00:05:18.289> again<00:05:18.860> it<00:05:19.009> was<00:05:19.099> poorly<00:05:19.339> executed

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
concept but again it was poorly executed

concept but again it was poorly executed
in<00:05:20.120> my<00:05:20.210> opinion<00:05:20.509> the<00:05:21.409> bots<00:05:21.620> will<00:05:21.830> crap<00:05:22.159> and<00:05:22.539> at

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
in my opinion the bots will crap and at

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.510 
in my opinion the bots will crap and at
some<00:05:23.930> times<00:05:24.229> they<00:05:24.740> were<00:05:24.800> too<00:05:25.009> good<00:05:25.279> even

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
some times they were too good even

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.309 
some times they were too good even
uneasy<00:05:26.000> you<00:05:26.419> know<00:05:26.539> when<00:05:26.719> you<00:05:26.810> run<00:05:26.990> out<00:05:27.020> and

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
uneasy you know when you run out and

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.050 
uneasy you know when you run out and
they're<00:05:27.439> aiming<00:05:27.710> it<00:05:27.770> you<00:05:27.860> already<00:05:27.979> or<00:05:28.879> when

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
they're aiming it you already or when

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.189 
they're aiming it you already or when
you<00:05:29.150> run<00:05:29.270> around<00:05:29.360> the<00:05:29.509> corner<00:05:29.839> and<00:05:29.930> then<00:05:30.050> I

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
you run around the corner and then I

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:31.929 
you run around the corner and then I
fuse<00:05:30.529> straight<00:05:30.830> away<00:05:31.039> and<00:05:31.460> now<00:05:31.639> it's<00:05:31.759> very

00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:31.939 
fuse straight away and now it's very

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:33.339 
fuse straight away and now it's very
difficult<00:05:32.089> to<00:05:32.300> program<00:05:32.539> that<00:05:32.870> kind<00:05:33.050> of<00:05:33.080> stuff

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:33.349 
difficult to program that kind of stuff

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:34.659 
difficult to program that kind of stuff
but<00:05:33.589> if<00:05:33.710> you're<00:05:33.860> going<00:05:34.009> to<00:05:34.069> make<00:05:34.189> a<00:05:34.250> combat

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
but if you're going to make a combat

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.490 
but if you're going to make a combat
training<00:05:34.909> you've<00:05:35.120> got<00:05:35.300> to<00:05:35.389> make<00:05:35.509> it<00:05:35.659> good<00:05:35.810> so

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
training you've got to make it good so

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.110 
training you've got to make it good so
if<00:05:36.800> it<00:05:36.949> does<00:05:37.099> return<00:05:37.370> please<00:05:37.729> you<00:05:38.029> know

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120
