00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.420
 so you have been waiting for me a little bit 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.460
 lingered but this moment came we 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.320
 we announce the next competition 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.939
 say already 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.400
 your annual test drives on our 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.119
 channel rule in we had a little 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.160
 to change 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.189
 so listen carefully and not 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.470
 say you didn't hear the video you 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.350
 take off to participate in our competition in 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.650
 the end should have a magic phrase 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.800
 filmed specifically for the competition 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.019
 on the site zinkevich dot ru or something 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.260
 very similar to the site address 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:46.530
 Now about the unpleasant if your video is already 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.500
 hung online or hanging in online competition 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.350
 you do not participate carefully select 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.699
 music to their plot copyright 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.000
 can not violate 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.700
 use man 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.130
 we are either free or our own 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.230
 do not use the fact that your video 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.930
 hosted on my youtube channel 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.690
 thinks she washes and accordingly 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.630
 your violation becomes my past 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.950
 one of the contest winners 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.350
 used 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.570
 stolen music and our channel slapped 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.670
 such a strike that I thought it would close 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.290
 by the way it concerns the video can not 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.100
 use movie snippets in 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.130
 telecast 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.640
 if you violated something we immediately 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.820
 know and we won't like it youtube not 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.070
 sleeps roller automatic removed of course 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.649
 then you can remount and again 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.990
 send to 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.600
 So here is the most important authors which already 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.710
 is present on the network links to your channel 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.580
 there will be annotations but all the plots 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.619
 you send it concerns everyone remain 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.299
 on my channel 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.940
 usually by the way this year was a lot 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.159
 questions whether it is possible to participate and 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.780

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.880

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.580
