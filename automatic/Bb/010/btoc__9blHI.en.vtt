00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.120 
gonna pop out I 110 Cap'n do we have a
terminate<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.570> hand<00:01:42.899> over<00:01:43.470> for<00:01:43.619> Brian<00:01:43.860> does

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
terminate in hand over for Brian does

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.710 
terminate in hand over for Brian does
have<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.310> terminated<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.880> yeah<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.540> looks

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
have a terminated in yeah so that looks

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.770 
have a terminated in yeah so that looks
like<00:01:45.869> terminate<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.649> well<00:01:47.340> actually<00:01:47.790> isn't

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
like terminate on well actually isn't

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.359 
like terminate on well actually isn't
I'm<00:01:49.500> probably<00:01:49.680> would've<00:01:49.979> waited<00:01:50.100> on<00:01:50.310> that

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
I'm probably would've waited on that

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.219 
I'm probably would've waited on that
garruk<00:01:50.759> because<00:01:51.149> we<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> hex<00:01:51.780> mage<00:01:52.049> in

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
garruk because we have a hex mage in

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.249 
garruk because we have a hex mage in
play<00:01:52.409> yeah<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.040> just<00:01:53.220> 141<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.210> group<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:55.140> that

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
play yeah and just 141 the group so that

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.130 
play yeah and just 141 the group so that
terminate<00:01:55.680> isn't<00:01:55.950> even<00:01:56.159> good<00:01:56.579> anymore<00:01:57.110> so<00:01:58.110> I

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
terminate isn't even good anymore so I

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.450 
terminate isn't even good anymore so I
think<00:01:58.350> he's<00:01:58.439> hoping<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.979> I'm

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
think he's hoping that I'm

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.480 
think he's hoping that I'm
the<00:01:59.820> blood<00:02:00.060> gas<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.479> hex<00:02:00.630> major<00:02:00.870> going<00:02:01.200> to

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
the blood gas in the hex major going to

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.180 
the blood gas in the hex major going to
attack<00:02:02.490> your<00:02:02.729> attacker<00:02:03.299> room<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.780> then<00:02:04.530> he'll

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
attack your attacker room and then he'll

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.850 
attack your attacker room and then he'll
use<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> terminate<00:02:05.970> after<00:02:06.360> group<00:02:07.049> guys<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:07.740> a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
use a terminate after group guys just a

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.059 
use a terminate after group guys just a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
group key to life I guess right looks

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.630 
group key to life I guess right looks
like<00:02:11.280> we<00:02:11.430> are<00:02:11.700> actually<00:02:11.880> attacking<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:13.640> girl

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640
