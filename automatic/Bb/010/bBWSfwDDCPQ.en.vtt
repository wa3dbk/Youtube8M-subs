00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.920
 are you still surprised by everything 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.900
 what happened in recent days 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.110
 in recent weeks I'm 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.730
 happy 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:24.010
 or warming up at epinal 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.780
 against 20 to see the bristly hairs on 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.400
 rights and have tears near this 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.859
 that they show me unfortunately I 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.579
 am not a player because 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:38.149
 I would have had trouble playing because 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:41.090
 that means all games at Grenoble 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.199
 lyster to his should also put himself at the 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.719
 place supporters when you go to 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:48.559
 stubborn and father guys who are 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:53.210
 there he organizes he loses in the last 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.559
 the sanyo derby and the guys who are 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:03.260
 yzeure when you come to take 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:04.939
 four mills the climb the shoulder it's 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.430
 finally it's the first time we see 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.970
 we feel the supporters also said proud 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.560
 so close on their nearby 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.700
 team of staff players etc 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.890
 that's something you wanted 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.869
 I think it's something that 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.150
 was done naturally 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.979
 naturally because we have gone back 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:27.200
 from below and the players have understood 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.970
 that when one cfa2 brushed face squeezes the 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.960
 past club 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.700
 it does not allow you to win matches for 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.789
 the fans allow to do the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.770
 book so I believe the availability 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:41.310
 that everyone in Pau is unfair 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:46.299
 just reward for a minimum of 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.200
 things that I support more the club is going 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.659
 mount s 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.719
 and will we have to keep 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.700
 this relationship down there I think that 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.689
 in any case I hope to leave what 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.119
 I said two years ago that we 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.840
 started in September we were going 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.959
 play against Algeria 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.039
 I also have the positive side of what 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.659
 we arrive in addition to the results 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.899
 sportsmen of the reconstruction could 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.780
 be that even among supporters at 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.730
 risk of we see the homeland be done this 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.220
 will be super g but also the same as 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.620
 laly grow up and are the same in 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.030
 five years we will be a club of jackdaws 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.560
 when a club that will have nothing to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.420
 see with what he was in league 2 or 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.190
 in league 1 five or six years ago I'm going 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.890
 just remind people that in 2006 the 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.640
 26 and to this child these five years before 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.420
 we file the balance sheet 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.069
 in 2006 we play the meinau against the ace 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.860
 roma 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.440
 the stadium is full and to 25000 people 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.790
 is a cool guy who whistles because 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.640
 rijkaard of fatigue that form the 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.790
 center misses a pass because yann 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.790
 schneider reaches a long game of 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.150
 gums lg account they have they have 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.040
 reason but who deserved these people 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.290
 which earned ridicule and other 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.819
 I hope all the people who 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.640
 return to trading 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.319
 we put two young CDs and rise from 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.900
 the time do not know what they whistle 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.730
 and ricardo faty there is raeder in his 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.319
 session 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.139
 you have often said there since a few 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.700
 days that the public is an argument for 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.409
 you a fort to bring players 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.359
 is it still going to be what is 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.950
 what is still valid in argument 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.359
 still valid for cons sell 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.730
 already national players 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:25.079
 and is it going to be an asset 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.189
 also next season 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:31.359
 in any case to bring players 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:31.870
 blood and the important words which is worth 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.819
 play better 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.790
 so I do not like giving names because 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.519
 it's seller in league 2 in front of 600 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.260
 people at the national before 10000 so 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.669
 it's a selling point 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.829
 really a commercial argument 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.310
 important and that often makes the 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.900
 difference 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.489
 after what the next will be ten 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.799
 thousand people me I wish it me 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.549
 I frankly I would dream to have 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:57.639
 a club like leeds august to 48 people 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:59.459
 and even when we're 15th we'll see when 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.840
 will be 15th but it's true that today 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.159
 Fervor also comes from the results 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.509
 what then next year I think 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.040
 we will have fifteen thousand if we are in 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:07.269
 the first five will we have 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.949
 fifteen thousand if we fight for the 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.540
 maintenance like that should be maybe 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:12.819
 the case for a while I know 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.819
 I hope not because then we 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.819
 will become a super confident
