00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.800
 good morning you are in school again 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:11.769
 training center your business and today we 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.910
 talk to you about such an important skill 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.240
 business person 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.470
 how to plan your day how to 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.290
 use a diary 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.950
 very many keep a diary as follows 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.360
 way they write all their affairs in a row 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.350
 as you do them 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.630
 cross out optimal lead the same day 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.780
 as follows, this is our 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.440
 our page 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.600
 I'm talking about the diary dated 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.510
 here we say yes there 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.790
 usually write date calendar so on and 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.230
 he is lined up with us like this 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:54.130
 way where about that time is homogeneous 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.070
 the Greeks called chronos and kairos chronos 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.370
 this is clearly scheduled time kairos 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:05.220
 this is a good moment I am keeping a diary 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:10.150
 as follows every day I divide by 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:14.770
 two parts into 2 halves with a ruler in this 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.990
 part we write those events those affairs 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.520
 which we have planned hard 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:29.520
 which us tied to time 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:29.520
 let's say 900 Meeting 1200 visit 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:37.060
 1700 meeting I take for example 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.670
 there are those times that we 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.110
 tied tightly on the right side 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:47.110
 diaries we write our affairs 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.690
 the list of topics we want to do in 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.700
 for today i use and 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.760
 I advise you to use the pen 4 color 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.780
 red black blue green and all 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.240
 our business we write 4 colored pen 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.320
 red we write priority cases 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.030
 and on more important combat urgent matters 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.510
 in blue we write all the rest 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.430
 riot speaks green usually 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.590
 executives write those things that 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.070
 delegate to their subordinates and keeps on 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.290
 control and black we write 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.940
 most unpleasant for us sofa in 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.340
 time management they are called frogs 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.130
 that is, what matters is an ordinary person 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.650
 lays for later because we are a bridge 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.220
 our brain always chooses between tasty and 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.980
 useful 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.060
 Chooses a tasty and healthy important thing 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.310
 usually tries 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.160
 leave for later then there are these two we 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.140
 we write in black in this case if 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.940
 even we do not have time to do everything we will have time 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.590
 make at least those that are recorded 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.680
 in red, that is the most important 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.670
 for us business and we enter this part 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.480
 diary these things in order them 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.790
 priority 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.980
 and precisely in those periods when we have 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.830
 for this free time that is 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.420
 span a successful man on that 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.280
 which never hurries anywhere and 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.489
 never going anywhere but then 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.680
 great work there is a concept 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.230
 time budgeting time like and 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.910
 money is needed for budgeting 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.860
 divided by the time reserve 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.600
 Things to do like min budgeting 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.730
 who was a student don't remember how we 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.470
 getting ready for the exam we have three days 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.290
 There are 40 tickets for preparation 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.120
 we divide these three days into 40 tickets and 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.950
 we understand in this way how much we 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.700
 it takes time to prepare each 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.130
 ticket 2 hours 3 hours and so on if we 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.569
 We do not have time for two hours to prepare one 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.489
 ticket 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.999
 better to start the next ticket 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.859
 what to kill time to prepare one does not teach 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:47.280
 everyone else so that's about to 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:51.549
 budget remo sti time in our calendar 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.349
 we put those intervals in 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:57.129
 free and natural which we are for 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:04:01.769
 budgeting for yourself in this case 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:04.239
 will help even this way we define 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.790
 total amount of time needed on 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.329
 performing one big task we 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.669
 we split it disproportionately a given 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.980
 those ponies of the stomachs that we have and 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.979
 thus determine the deadline 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.209
 performing this big task like this 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.609
 Here is the way to keep a diary 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.650
 our day is becoming more thorough 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.650
 planned out all the good 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.639
 how to run a successful business from scratch or 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.600
 make profitable existing 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.090
 do your employees fit 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.460
 requirements of modern business what 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.550
 portrait of a professional leader 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.370
 these questions are now the most relevant 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.620
 the reason for that is the worsening of the problem 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.230
 preparation and lack of necessary 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.230
