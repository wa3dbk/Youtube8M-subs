00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
I did not add water into these because

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.429 
I did not add water into these because
this<00:01:03.290> one<00:01:03.530> is<00:01:03.770> very<00:01:04.489> like<00:01:04.970> thin<00:01:05.479> I<00:01:05.750> have<00:01:06.259> some

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
other ones that are like that's like

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.679 
other ones that are like that's like
thick<00:01:08.899> so<00:01:09.289> I<00:01:09.530> add<00:01:09.859> some<00:01:09.890> water<00:01:10.270> but<00:01:11.270> if<00:01:11.420> you<00:01:11.539> add

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
thick so I add some water but if you add

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.959 
thick so I add some water but if you add
too<00:01:11.869> much<00:01:11.899> water<00:01:12.049> it<00:01:12.590> doesn't<00:01:13.280> look<00:01:13.399> real<00:01:13.729> and

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
too much water it doesn't look real and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.630 
too much water it doesn't look real and
it<00:01:14.090> looks<00:01:14.359> like<00:01:14.829> really<00:01:15.829> light<00:01:16.009> but<00:01:16.219> this<00:01:16.399> one

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
it looks like really light but this one

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.120 
it looks like really light but this one
is<00:01:16.789> perfect<00:01:17.030> I<00:01:17.329> think<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.780> then<00:01:17.869> I<00:01:17.899> have<00:01:18.140> this

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.610 
is perfect I think and then I have this
one<00:01:20.950> it<00:01:21.950> looks<00:01:22.189> like<00:01:22.429> milk

pretty easy and it's very cheap I bought

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.960 
pretty easy and it's very cheap I bought
this<00:03:30.710> for<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:32.020> dollar<00:03:33.020> I<00:03:33.200> think<00:03:33.560> we're<00:03:34.340> not<00:03:34.640> even

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
this for a dollar I think we're not even

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.440 
this for a dollar I think we're not even
a<00:03:35.030> dollar<00:03:36.010> there<00:03:37.010> were<00:03:37.220> a<00:03:37.250> lot<00:03:37.640> of<00:03:37.670> bottles<00:03:38.150> you

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
a dollar there were a lot of bottles you

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.050 
a dollar there were a lot of bottles you
can<00:03:38.510> see<00:03:39.910> but<00:03:40.910> you<00:03:41.480> know<00:03:42.130> only<00:03:43.130> thinking<00:03:43.730> we<00:03:43.850> do

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
can see but you know only thinking we do

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.080 
can see but you know only thinking we do
this<00:03:44.240> it<00:03:44.570> comes<00:03:45.170> out<00:03:45.470> and<00:03:45.650> yes<00:03:45.830> it<00:03:46.010> does<00:03:46.220> but

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
this it comes out and yes it does but

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.930 
this it comes out and yes it does but
you<00:03:48.020> can<00:03:48.260> seal<00:03:48.560> it<00:03:48.710> up<00:03:48.770> here<00:03:49.010> by<00:03:49.220> putting<00:03:49.550> some

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
you can seal it up here by putting some

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.580 
you can seal it up here by putting some
superglue<00:03:50.600> on<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:51.140> and<00:03:51.380> let<00:03:52.370> it<00:03:52.400> dry<00:03:52.520> for<00:03:52.730> a<00:03:53.590> day

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
superglue on it and let it dry for a day

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.590 
superglue on it and let it dry for a day
maybe<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.420> do<00:03:56.420> have<00:03:56.570> some<00:03:56.900> bottles<00:03:57.190> that<00:03:58.600> I've

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
maybe I do have some bottles that I've

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.000 
maybe I do have some bottles that I've
done<00:03:59.840> that<00:03:59.900> wait<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:00.410> it<00:04:00.620> looks<00:04:00.800> like<00:04:00.890> it

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
done that wait and it looks like it

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.820 
done that wait and it looks like it
comes<00:04:01.190> out<00:04:01.450> but<00:04:02.450> now<00:04:02.660> I<00:04:02.690> don't<00:04:02.990> really<00:04:03.380> do<00:04:03.620> that

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
comes out but now I don't really do that

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
comes out but now I don't really do that
anyway<00:04:04.190> but<00:04:04.700> what<00:04:04.970> I<00:04:05.030> do<00:04:05.209> is<00:04:05.750> I<00:04:06.110> have<00:04:06.620> this<00:04:07.250> put

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
anyway but what I do is I have this put

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.960 
anyway but what I do is I have this put
in<00:04:07.970> here<00:04:08.300> then<00:04:08.800> most<00:04:09.800> of<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.280> bottles<00:04:10.640> comes

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
in here then most of the bottles comes

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.640 
in here then most of the bottles comes
with<00:04:12.610> and<00:04:13.780> of<00:04:14.780> course<00:04:15.080> it<00:04:15.200> doesn't<00:04:15.350> come<00:04:15.620> out

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
with and of course it doesn't come out

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.449 
with and of course it doesn't come out
to<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.250> nipple<00:04:16.730> thing<00:04:17.440> but<00:04:18.440> it's<00:04:18.919> fine<00:04:19.280> with

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
to the nipple thing but it's fine with

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.580 
to the nipple thing but it's fine with
me<00:04:19.489> I<00:04:19.640> just<00:04:19.910> do<00:04:20.060> this<00:04:20.239> no<00:04:20.989> up<00:04:21.230> against<00:04:21.470> the

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
me I just do this no up against the

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.170 
me I just do this no up against the
dolls<00:04:21.799> it<00:04:22.070> just<00:04:22.280> looks<00:04:22.460> like<00:04:22.550> it's<00:04:22.790> seeding

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
dolls it just looks like it's seeding

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.140 
dolls it just looks like it's seeding
and<00:04:23.860> just<00:04:24.860> because<00:04:25.160> I<00:04:25.310> don't<00:04:25.370> really<00:04:25.640> steal<00:04:25.970> my

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
and just because I don't really steal my

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.790 
and just because I don't really steal my
bottles<00:04:26.510> anymore<00:04:26.810> it's<00:04:27.169> just<00:04:27.350> I<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:28.060> hate<00:04:29.060> it<00:04:29.240> so

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
bottles anymore it's just I I hate it so

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.890 
bottles anymore it's just I I hate it so
but<00:04:30.800> you<00:04:31.190> can<00:04:31.310> do<00:04:31.430> that<00:04:31.640> as<00:04:32.060> I've<00:04:32.480> done<00:04:32.750> the

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
but you can do that as I've done the

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.530 
but you can do that as I've done the
same<00:04:33.140> with<00:04:33.290> this<00:04:33.410> one<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:36.610> some<00:04:37.610> of<00:04:37.729> you<00:04:37.880> might

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
same with this one and some of you might

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.320 
same with this one and some of you might
wonder<00:04:39.410> if<00:04:40.300> it<00:04:41.300> goes<00:04:41.690> like<00:04:41.990> moldy<00:04:42.590> and<00:04:43.120> I<00:04:44.120> would

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
wonder if it goes like moldy and I would

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.890 
wonder if it goes like moldy and I would
say<00:04:44.510> no<00:04:45.010> but<00:04:46.010> I'm<00:04:46.130> not<00:04:46.700> really<00:04:46.880> sure<00:04:47.060> but<00:04:47.120> it's

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
say no but I'm not really sure but it's

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.350 
say no but I'm not really sure but it's
because<00:04:48.290> I've<00:04:48.620> made<00:04:49.130> some<00:04:49.490> like<00:04:49.790> four<00:04:50.180> or<00:04:50.330> five

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
because I've made some like four or five

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.409 
because I've made some like four or five
years<00:04:50.840> ago<00:04:51.140> and<00:04:51.470> it's<00:04:51.919> still<00:04:52.370> on<00:04:52.550> moly<00:04:52.790> so<00:04:53.390> I

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
years ago and it's still on moly so I

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.000 
years ago and it's still on moly so I
guess<00:04:53.780> it<00:04:53.990> does<00:04:54.110> not<00:04:54.320> get<00:04:54.740> moldy<00:04:55.750> so<00:04:56.860> this<00:04:57.860> is

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
guess it does not get moldy so this is

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.420 
guess it does not get moldy so this is
really<00:04:58.280> great<00:04:59.150> and<00:04:59.450> you<00:04:59.780> can<00:04:59.900> just<00:05:00.250> like<00:05:01.250> put

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
really great and you can just like put

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.900 
really great and you can just like put
in<00:05:01.520> here<00:05:01.760> forever<00:05:02.030> and<00:05:02.320> like<00:05:03.400> change<00:05:04.400> it<00:05:04.669> to
