00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.299 
what I'm going to show you here is how
to<00:00:03.510> take<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:04.170> Tropico<00:00:05.100> 3<00:00:06.060> Xbox<00:00:06.750> 360<00:00:07.170> save<00:00:07.890> and

edit it to have more money than you'll

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.010 
edit it to have more money than you'll
ever<00:00:14.370> need<00:00:14.700> on<00:00:14.880> each<00:00:14.910> Island<00:00:15.240> what<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:15.900> have

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
ever need on each Island what you have

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.859 
ever need on each Island what you have
to<00:00:16.109> do<00:00:16.199> first<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.680> create<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.160> save<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.869> I

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
to do first is create the save and I

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.650 
to do first is create the save and I
started<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.800> save<00:00:20.039> with<00:00:22.820> $9,500<00:00:23.820> for<00:00:24.480> money

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
started the save with $9,500 for money

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.960 
started the save with $9,500 for money
just<00:00:24.900> makes<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.680> easier<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.310> find

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
just makes it easier for you to find

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.839 
just makes it easier for you to find
because<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.599> know<00:00:28.220> that<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.369> hex<00:00:29.519> code<00:00:29.820> for

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
because I know that the hex code for

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.580 
because I know that the hex code for
that<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.210> 2<00:00:30.779> v<00:00:31.019> 1c

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
that is 2 v 1c

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.920 
that is 2 v 1c
so<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.730> start<00:00:32.940> you'll<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> save

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
so to start you'll have to have the save

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.619 
so to start you'll have to have the save
file<00:00:34.579> from<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.730> 360<00:00:37.070> on<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> flash<00:00:38.370> drive<00:00:38.629> so

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
file from the 360 on a flash drive so

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.250 
file from the 360 on a flash drive so
that<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.649> can<00:00:40.829> put<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:42.540> computer<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
that you can put it on the computer the

you'll<00:01:03.809> be<00:01:03.899> using<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.409> minute

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.120 

first<00:01:08.610> I'm<00:01:08.850> going<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.030> go<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.799> flash<00:01:10.799> drive

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
first I'm going to go to the flash drive

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.060 
first I'm going to go to the flash drive
that<00:01:11.159> has<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.610> save<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.710> copy<00:01:13.710> that

that has the save on it and copy that
over<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> computer<00:01:15.259> in<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.439> directory<00:01:16.890> that

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
over to the computer in a directory that

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.170 
over to the computer in a directory that
I<00:01:17.070> have<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.490> work<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.880> it

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
I have to work on it

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.820 
I have to work on it
called<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.020> Tropico<00:01:20.119> you'll<00:01:21.119> notice<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.830> in

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
called it Tropico you'll notice that in

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.210 
called it Tropico you'll notice that in
this<00:01:23.100> directory<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.640> already<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.240> two<00:01:24.570> files

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
this directory I already have two files

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.679 
this directory I already have two files
taksa<00:01:26.220> PXE<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.450> off<00:01:27.630> zip<00:01:28.200> Exe<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:30.000> you'll<00:01:30.479> need

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
taksa PXE and off zip Exe so you'll need

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.420 
taksa PXE and off zip Exe so you'll need
to<00:01:30.810> go<00:01:30.930> out<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.650> internet<00:01:31.950> search<00:01:32.220> for

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
to go out on the internet search for

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.700 
to go out on the internet search for
those<00:01:32.549> two<00:01:32.729> files<00:01:33.030> download<00:01:33.720> them<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.049> then

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
those two files download them and then

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.200 
those two files download them and then
put<00:01:34.950> them<00:01:34.979> into<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.490> directory<00:01:35.670> because

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
put them into this directory because

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.810 
put them into this directory because
this<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.479> what<00:01:36.630> you'll<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.869> using<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.820> extract

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
this is what you'll be using to extract

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.020 
this is what you'll be using to extract
and<00:01:39.590> unencrypted<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> data<00:01:40.920> that's<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and unencrypted the data that's in the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.670 
and unencrypted the data that's in the
save<00:01:42.210> file<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.960> change<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.560> then

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
save file so you can change it and then

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.550 
save file so you can change it and then
inject<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.130> back<00:01:44.189> into<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> save<00:01:45.030> file<00:01:45.500> it's<00:01:46.500> a

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
inject it back into the save file it's a

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.899 
inject it back into the save file it's a
lot<00:01:46.740> easier<00:01:46.860> than<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.280> sounds<00:01:47.549> but<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.790> have

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
lot easier than it sounds but you have

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.120 
lot easier than it sounds but you have
to<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.119> these<00:01:48.240> two<00:01:48.450> files<00:01:48.689> first<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.320> put

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
to have these two files first and put

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.420 
to have these two files first and put
them<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.549> their<00:01:50.850> own<00:01:51.290> directory<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.470> happen<00:01:53.399> to

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
them in their own directory I happen to

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.480 
them in their own directory I happen to
have<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.700> save<00:01:54.090> file<00:01:54.390> here<00:01:55.130> from<00:01:56.130> before<00:01:56.250> that

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
have a save file here from before that

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.709 
have a save file here from before that
I'm<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.939> going<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.119> get<00:01:57.299> rid<00:01:57.540> of

now<00:02:30.090> what<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:30.900> will<00:02:31.080> do<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.530> will<00:02:31.560> extract

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
now what this will do is it will extract

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.730 
now what this will do is it will extract
into<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.570> folder<00:02:36.080> several<00:02:37.080> files<00:02:37.320> several

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
into this folder several files several

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.870 
into this folder several files several
dat<00:02:38.250> files<00:02:38.640> each<00:02:38.910> one<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.300> part<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:41.370> save

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
dat files each one is a part of the save

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.550 
dat files each one is a part of the save
file<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.360> just<00:02:42.390> makes<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.870> easier<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.410> manage

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
file it just makes it easier to manage

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:51.920 
file it just makes it easier to manage
and<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.460> type<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:48.690> offset<00:02:49.110> command<00:02:50.930> make

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
and so I type the offset command make

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.280 
and so I type the offset command make
sure<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.170> put<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.410> zero<00:02:52.680> at<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.860> end<00:02:52.980> there<00:02:54.290> now

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
sure you put a zero at the end there now

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.440 
sure you put a zero at the end there now
will<00:02:55.440> extract<00:02:55.910> everything<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.240> you'll<00:02:57.330> see

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
will extract everything and you'll see

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:05.390 
will extract everything and you'll see
it<00:02:57.540> populate<00:02:57.990> in<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.470> folder<00:03:03.950> now<00:03:04.950> go<00:03:05.190> into

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
it populate in that folder now go into

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.699 
it populate in that folder now go into
that<00:03:05.610> folder<00:03:06.770> right<00:03:07.770> click<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.280> open<00:03:08.340> with<00:03:09.709> H

for<00:03:13.530> this<00:03:13.620> because<00:03:13.920> it's<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.160> easiest<00:03:14.459> you

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
for this because it's the easiest you

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.820 
for this because it's the easiest you
can<00:03:15.450> easily<00:03:15.570> find<00:03:15.990> that<00:03:16.080> on<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.500> internet

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
can easily find that on the internet

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.590 
can easily find that on the internet
once<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.790> go<00:03:17.880> into<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.209> you're<00:03:18.360> gonna<00:03:18.480> have

once you go into that you're gonna have

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.360 
once you go into that you're gonna have
to<00:03:18.690> open<00:03:18.990> all<00:03:19.080> those<00:03:19.260> dat<00:03:19.530> files<00:03:19.830> because

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
to open all those dat files because

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.710 
to open all those dat files because
potentially<00:03:20.850> you<00:03:21.180> could<00:03:21.300> have<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.540> search

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
potentially you could have to search

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.380 
potentially you could have to search
through<00:03:21.990> all<00:03:22.020> of<00:03:22.170> them<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:23.700> won't<00:03:23.970> turn<00:03:24.330> out

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
through all of them it won't turn out

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.360 
through all of them it won't turn out
that<00:03:24.540> way<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:24.959> reality<00:03:25.470> but<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:26.010> makes<00:03:26.220> it

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
that way in reality but it just makes it

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:34.420 
that way in reality but it just makes it
easier<00:03:26.670> if<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.820> open<00:03:27.120> all<00:03:27.240> of<00:03:27.270> them<00:03:27.480> at<00:03:27.600> once

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.910 

once<00:03:35.430> they're<00:03:35.670> all<00:03:35.700> open<00:03:36.470> or<00:03:37.470> then<00:03:37.650> go<00:03:37.739> back

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
once they're all open or then go back

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.150 
once they're all open or then go back
and<00:03:37.950> start<00:03:38.310> at<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.459> first<00:03:38.760> one<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:40.160> just

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
and start at the first one and just

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.590 
and start at the first one and just
search<00:03:41.930> for<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.050> string<00:03:43.400> or<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.850> text<00:03:45.209> money

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
search for the string or the text money

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.509 
search for the string or the text money

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
window I just keep doing this I've

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.750 
window I just keep doing this I've
skipped<00:04:03.900> over<00:04:04.080> a<00:04:04.200> bunch<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.560> them<00:04:04.680> here<00:04:04.760> but

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
skipped over a bunch of them here but

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.840 
skipped over a bunch of them here but
all<00:04:05.850> I'm<00:04:05.940> doing<00:04:06.180> is<00:04:06.209> hitting<00:04:06.510> f3<00:04:07.850> enter

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
all I'm doing is hitting f3 enter

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.210 
all I'm doing is hitting f3 enter
control<00:04:09.420> f4<00:04:10.130> search<00:04:11.540> ok<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:12.840> then<00:04:13.769> close<00:04:14.070> the

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
control f4 search ok and then close the

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.380 
control f4 search ok and then close the
window<00:04:15.769> it<00:04:16.769> goes<00:04:16.979> by<00:04:17.160> pretty<00:04:17.430> quickly<00:04:18.120> you<00:04:18.239> can

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
window it goes by pretty quickly you can

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:26.050 
window it goes by pretty quickly you can
have<00:04:18.570> all<00:04:18.690> of<00:04:18.720> this<00:04:18.959> in<00:04:19.200> a<00:04:19.530> couple<00:04:19.799> of<00:04:19.859> minutes

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.960 

eventually<00:04:26.780> you'll<00:04:27.560> find<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:28.040> string<00:04:28.340> and

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.290 

after<00:04:31.970> that<00:04:32.090> string<00:04:32.560> you'll<00:04:33.560> see<00:04:34.270> some<00:04:35.270> other

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
after that string you'll see some other

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.900 
after that string you'll see some other
bytes<00:04:36.050> in<00:04:36.260> between<00:04:36.650> but<00:04:36.889> then<00:04:37.100> you<00:04:37.580> should<00:04:37.760> see

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
bytes in between but then you should see

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.490 
bytes in between but then you should see
at<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.120> end<00:04:38.240> of<00:04:38.419> this<00:04:39.790> hex<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:41.540> amount<00:04:41.810> to<00:04:42.020> 5<00:04:42.230> 1

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
at the end of this hex the amount to 5 1

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.879 
at the end of this hex the amount to 5 1
C<00:04:42.710> is<00:04:42.740> 9500<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:44.240> amount<00:04:44.510> is<00:04:44.600> actually<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:47.780> 0<00:04:48.590> 0

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
C is 9500 the amount is actually the 0 0

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:55.990
