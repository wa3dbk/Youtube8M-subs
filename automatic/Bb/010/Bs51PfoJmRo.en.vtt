00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.380
 you up everyone knows soon 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.240
 I hope you're fine, I'm fine 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.820
 rather well is found today on 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.890
 call of duty black ops 2 I think 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.119
 you waited a little bit now 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.590
 that he came out I think you do 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.519
 still a lot of videos on it 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.980
 it's true that it's a game 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:36.540
 I was waiting a little because mw3 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.400
 had me how to handle really disappointed 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.239
 I was really not a fan of this game 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.949
 I did not make you 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.420
 a lot of good above I know 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.910
 not even if I did more than 5th 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.110
 last year so 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.860
 so that's really not a game that 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.210
 had made me approach the principle groof 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.769
 to a game that made me hang what 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.769
 it's not really a game in which 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.510
 I wanted to take pleasure from 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.460
 you make videos so that's it 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.339
 so ends up on black of 2 for a 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.900
 from my first parts post neiter 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.519
 so here it is a return to the snipers 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.350
 that many of you were waiting 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.170
 Besides, I'm pretty happy so 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.880
 it's gone look small 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.320
 although very nice gameplay of a 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.580
 gameplay you'll see a little 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.010
 worry with the game play off in part 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.859
 but we 're just taking you to the end so 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.079
 here I am playing with dessert 50 mattresses 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:23.789
 so it's dessert 50 with like 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.710
 accessory the ballistic processor which 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.840
 allows when one is less 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.570
 move the armored bullets so the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.079
 shirt balls and that allows to have a 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.780
 image an increased power of shots from 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.820
 snipers so in secondary weapon I have the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.219
 heap of 45 that seem to me third 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.369
 little jaw second perhaps the 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:47.069
 third gun handgun that we had 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.100
 game I play as with trumps 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.829
 determination dexterity robustness i 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.869
 found in this game that the 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.680
 that the trumps are how to say are 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.770
 less 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.270
 a world are less useful than in the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.350
 other colossi I do not know it's 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.850
 really not what to take as to 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.280
 flat keys or roof of the three 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.970
 dexterity to be able to aim a little more 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.100
 fast after running so it's after 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.380
 robustness and determination here I am not 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.270
 super super useful yet determination 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.860
 which is practical enough to unlock 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.540
 six sets of victims a little bit more 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.000
 quickly but otherwise is it 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.000
 am not really a sport not a fan and 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.700
 that's okay it really plays 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.739
 five media to be there are not really 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.720
 more to have some trump or 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.730
 anything except the egg we got it 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.620
 all ghost according to unlock or 55 so 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.430
 at the last level of prestige that is 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.320
 really not bad 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.940
 which therefore makes it possible not to be 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.320
 visible on drones because there is 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.840
 drones to all parties 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.230
 stakeholders very very often and why 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.239
 not to escape so so so here is 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.100
 it's more or less well done it depends 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.780
 it depends on the person to person of 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.540
 take your point of view me I find 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.920
 it's pretty neutral on it that's good 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.410
 because there are no ghosts 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.459
 people can not fooled huge not the 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.170
 people can not camp it prevents them 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.660
 no camping but people can not 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.370
 stay moderate we have a positioning 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.049
 on the radar we can find them on 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.670
 know where they are if we play 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.600
 cleverly can not kill me all the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.549
 world but when you the opposing team 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.410
 1-1 drones and you are without without 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.390
 radar for example it's going to be very 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.180
 difficult to achieve during a 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.910
 little moment but good shooter give 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.470
 me your opinion if you are how to say 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.200
 it's not for or against, but if you 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.560
 so like to know that phantom is obtained 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.959
 level 55 me I rather rather for 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.030
 I mean I will be anyway 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.739
 quite mixed, however, short of unctuous 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.200
 the end of my class so gear 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.970
 mortal lagonda de centex is a 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.079
 tactical paralyzes the two so 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.220
 this is new class system 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:49.090
 besides his bo 2 I think that 5 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.760
 There are ten objects the pomegranates of Centex 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.260
 the assets and paralyzing and when 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.290
 happy tactics as an object on 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.880
 can have 10 10 objects per class 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.460
 in short, I think you already know 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.360
 the class lesson at worst if you 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.190
 have questions I can answer 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.780
 to comments but I think it's 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.510
 all the jce was repeated well before 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.390
 already I'm doing it 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.040
 so officially short we saw a little 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.070
 in the thrillers and where so here we are 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.840
 So we are on sniper gameplay 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.220
 we are a strategic point you 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.380
 go see that I could not really 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.970
 play the goal thoroughly I see 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.470
 how the team becomes m 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.910
 really eager towards the goal 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.440
 although this part I 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.540
 really next to the point of goals 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.900
 but I will try to defend from 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.390
 better than I can yes I saw something 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.740
 the sniper I'm really a fan of this 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.900
 sniper I said in my video 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.340
 previous you can find in 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.280
 clicking on the notation that will appear 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.350
 now that I snipers could 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.540
 hang on if he was not too insistent 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.190
 as in mw too and that's it I can you 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.800
 to say that this is not the case at all 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.860
 there is no asset no accessories 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.130
 which allows snipers to aim more 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.640
 quick 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.560
 there is none it's not like in mw2 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.620
 petanque with pro pass or good pass 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.300
 hiding on mw3 and black block aubry 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.160
 did not either it's true you had 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.169
 but not on snipers but it's true 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.430
 that I really do not find it so 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:15.540
 very assisted small campers here arms 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.010
 late it's a pity besides small 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.229
 little parenthesis I film with the mode 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.310
 studio and that's why we do not see 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.770
 the killcam that's a shame 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.300
 it seems to me that in mw3's studio 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.440
 the few souls appeared that's 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.090
 by the way very nice there it is 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.420
 pity because I was watching his 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.710
 little corner scared in the corner 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.720
 they fall it's pretty disgusting 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.040
 so I could be what yes Islam 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.600
 scared so I find them really not 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.130
 insisted and I'm really a fan 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.440
 costs of scott does not seem on a 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.610
 are not very simple to place really 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.330
 not at all besides I advise you 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.030
 to try 6th 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.530
 if you have not done it yet and I 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.640
 also finds that this sniper anyway 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.500
 I have not tested others it's them 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.600
 it's really the only sniper I have 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.880
 I tested it develops from the beginning of the 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.280
 game if I do not turn to level 4 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.470
 as soon as we can do in class and what is 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.260
 what do I see I still want to finish my 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.940
 prose so they do not do that said marker 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.710
 and it's really very good I made a 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.510
 hit markers in the game so that's it 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.300
 so you see on the screen that since the 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.770
 fashion studio that bugged I'm sorry but 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.180
 the gameplay will finish now 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.880
 I still hope that this little 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.670
 very fast video you and more about 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.080
 a little over six minutes so 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.670
 so that's my sniper debut 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.620
 with some nice scop shots I have 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.940
 a good start to the game I wanted 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.200
 really you propose I was 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.180
 really disgusted that it does not work anymore 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.160
 that's it so here we are I hope you 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.930
 have spent a good time with 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.290
 my few little explanations on the 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.490
 sniper of black ops 2 do not hesitate to 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.290
 leave a gem a little comment 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.000
 shared I like you all wholesale 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.360
 kisses in the summer to everyone good 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.360
 day
