the<00:02:45.780> back<00:02:45.959> very<00:02:46.139> similar<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.799> one<00:02:46.950> on<00:02:47.099> the

the back very similar to the one on the
nikon<00:02:48.060> d800<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.620> we<00:02:49.709> can<00:02:49.859> turn<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.189> on

nikon d800 and we can turn that on
actually<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.620> think<00:02:52.709> we're<00:02:52.859> going<00:02:52.949> to<00:02:53.010> have<00:02:53.099> to

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:53.219 
actually I think we're going to have to

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:55.189 
actually I think we're going to have to
put<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.430> lens<00:02:53.669> on<00:02:53.819> this<00:02:54.000> sometimes<00:02:54.419> cameras

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:55.199 
put a lens on this sometimes cameras

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.740 
put a lens on this sometimes cameras
like<00:02:55.379> this<00:02:55.669> allow<00:02:56.669> you<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:57.090> turn<00:02:57.329> them<00:02:57.540> on<00:02:57.689> or

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
like this allow you to turn them on or

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.649 
like this allow you to turn them on or
take<00:02:58.439> shutter<00:02:58.709> release<00:02:59.120> shots<00:03:00.120> without<00:03:00.359> the

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
take shutter release shots without the

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.209 
take shutter release shots without the
lens<00:03:00.810> on<00:03:01.049> it<00:03:01.199> but<00:03:01.349> in<00:03:01.439> this<00:03:01.530> case<00:03:01.590> doesn't<00:03:02.129> look

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:02.219 
lens on it but in this case doesn't look

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:03.830 
lens on it but in this case doesn't look
like<00:03:02.340> that's<00:03:02.459> going<00:03:02.579> to<00:03:02.699> happen<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.480> let's<00:03:03.689> get

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
like that's going to happen so let's get

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.649 
like that's going to happen so let's get
right<00:03:04.230> back<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.489> next<00:03:05.699> box<00:03:05.909> opening<00:03:06.449> and

that is the 24 to 85 millimeter F 3.5 to

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.259 
that is the 24 to 85 millimeter F 3.5 to
4.5<00:03:10.500> it's<00:03:11.129> not<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.430> brightest<00:03:11.790> lens<00:03:11.969> on<00:03:12.150> the

according<00:04:57.220> to<00:04:57.400> Nikon<00:04:57.820> is<00:04:58.000> that<00:04:58.120> you<00:04:58.210> can

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
according to Nikon is that you can

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.550 
according to Nikon is that you can
