00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.640 

the<00:00:08.730> next<00:00:09.090> step<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.510> learning<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:10.170> approach

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
the next step to learning the approach

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.640 
the next step to learning the approach
is<00:00:10.980> once<00:00:11.790> you<00:00:11.940> pass<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.540> ball<00:00:12.720> now<00:00:13.260> you<00:00:13.320> have

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
is once you pass the ball now you have

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.590 
is once you pass the ball now you have
to<00:00:13.800> approach<00:00:14.220> this<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.120> where<00:00:15.330> beach

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
to approach this is where beach

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.480 
to approach this is where beach
volleyball<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.320> very<00:00:16.710> very<00:00:17.040> different<00:00:17.280> than

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
volleyball is very very different than

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.120 
volleyball is very very different than
indoor<00:00:17.880> volleyball<00:00:18.260> indoor<00:00:19.260> volleyball<00:00:19.710> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
indoor volleyball indoor volleyball the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.370 
indoor volleyball indoor volleyball the
person<00:00:20.520> passing<00:00:21.030> the<00:00:21.120> ball<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.480> rarely<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
person passing the ball is rarely the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.250 
person passing the ball is rarely the
person<00:00:22.800> hitting<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.369> ball<00:00:23.810> beach<00:00:24.810> volleyball

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
person hitting the ball beach volleyball

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.500 
person hitting the ball beach volleyball
the<00:00:25.590> person<00:00:26.010> passing<00:00:26.610> the<00:00:26.700> ball<00:00:26.880> almost

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the person passing the ball almost

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.900 
the person passing the ball almost
always<00:00:27.780> is<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.350> person<00:00:28.380> hitting<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.070> ball<00:00:29.280> so

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
always is the person hitting the ball so

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.749 
always is the person hitting the ball so
you<00:00:30.540> have<00:00:30.780> to<00:00:30.960> get<00:00:31.110> in<00:00:31.230> position<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.800> pass<00:00:32.399> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
you have to get in position to pass and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.180 
you have to get in position to pass and
hit<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.030> ball<00:00:33.210> after<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.840> pass<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
hit the ball after you pass it so the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.100 
hit the ball after you pass it so the
way<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.370> learn<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:36.899> do<00:00:37.079> a

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
way you learn this is you just do a

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.560 
way you learn this is you just do a
simple<00:00:37.379> drill<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.010> do<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> toss<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.180> ball<00:00:39.329> up

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570

beautiful<00:01:05.390> notice<00:01:06.390> pay<00:01:07.050> attention<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.070> that

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
beautiful notice pay attention to that

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.180 
beautiful notice pay attention to that
it's<00:01:08.640> very<00:01:09.210> very<00:01:09.659> important<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.409> get<00:01:10.650> used<00:01:11.010> to

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
it's very very important to get used to

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.999 
it's very very important to get used to
this<00:01:11.340> step<00:01:11.759> it's<00:01:12.299> very<00:01:12.600> easy<00:01:12.899> to<00:01:13.079> admire<00:01:13.680> what

this step it's very easy to admire what

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.740 
this step it's very easy to admire what
you<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.310> did<00:01:14.579> I<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.090> passed<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.540> ball

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
you just did I just passed the ball

you just did I just passed the ball
isn't<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.200> pretty<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.680> there<00:01:16.950> no<00:01:17.640> once<00:01:18.000> you

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
isn't that pretty up there no once you

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.330 
isn't that pretty up there no once you
pass<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.689> ball<00:01:18.899> you<00:01:19.409> need<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.829> start<00:01:20.100> moving

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.950 

to<00:01:29.439> help<00:01:29.710> your<00:01:30.369> mind<00:01:30.729> in<00:01:30.939> your<00:01:31.060> body<00:01:31.119> connect

to help your mind in your body connect

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.679 
to help your mind in your body connect
in<00:01:32.140> terms<00:01:32.380> of<00:01:32.530> learning<00:01:32.859> a<00:01:32.950> skill<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:34.390> like<00:01:34.570> to

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
in terms of learning a skill we like to

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.599 
in terms of learning a skill we like to
use<00:01:34.869> weights<00:01:35.259> as<00:01:35.500> much<00:01:35.710> as<00:01:35.890> possible<00:01:36.460> because

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
use weights as much as possible because

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.880 
use weights as much as possible because
you<00:01:37.149> really<00:01:37.539> feel<00:01:37.899> what<00:01:38.170> your<00:01:38.350> body<00:01:38.560> is<00:01:38.770> doing

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
you really feel what your body is doing

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.740 
you really feel what your body is doing
a<00:01:39.369> lot<00:01:39.700> of<00:01:39.759> times<00:01:39.969> we<00:01:40.179> think<00:01:40.450> we're<00:01:40.630> doing

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
a lot of times we think we're doing

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.779 
a lot of times we think we're doing
something<00:01:41.409> but<00:01:41.649> we're<00:01:41.829> really<00:01:42.039> not<00:01:42.250> doing<00:01:42.310> it

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
something but we're really not doing it

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.660 
something but we're really not doing it
so<00:01:42.969> until<00:01:43.959> you<00:01:44.560> get<00:01:44.950> some<00:01:45.130> weights<00:01:45.369> in<00:01:45.549> your

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
so until you get some weights in your

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.520 
so until you get some weights in your
hands<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.060> also<00:01:46.360> see<00:01:46.630> yourself<00:01:47.079> do<00:01:47.259> it<00:01:47.289> you're

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
hands and also see yourself do it you're

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.830 
hands and also see yourself do it you're
not<00:01:47.560> really<00:01:47.979> quite<00:01:48.189> sure<00:01:48.250> what<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:48.850> do<00:01:49.060> so<00:01:49.719> the

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
not really quite sure what you do so the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.830 
not really quite sure what you do so the
weights<00:01:50.049> help<00:01:50.380> me<00:01:50.799> to<00:01:51.009> make<00:01:51.250> that<00:01:51.840> mind-body

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
weights help me to make that mind-body

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.980 
weights help me to make that mind-body
connection<00:01:53.289> even<00:01:53.859> better<00:01:54.209> so<00:01:55.209> we<00:01:55.659> got<00:01:55.840> some

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
connection even better so we got some

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.449 
connection even better so we got some
light<00:01:56.229> weights<00:01:56.500> Keeley's<00:01:56.950> got<00:01:57.130> some<00:01:57.280> light

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
light weights Keeley's got some light

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.240 
light weights Keeley's got some light
weights<00:01:57.729> and<00:01:58.030> it's<00:01:58.929> going<00:01:59.380> to<00:01:59.439> go<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.829> exact

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
weights and it's going to go the exact

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.080 
weights and it's going to go the exact
same<00:02:00.549> approach<00:02:01.049> movements<00:02:02.250> but<00:02:03.250> with<00:02:03.880> the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
same approach movements but with the

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.209 
same approach movements but with the
weights<00:02:04.329> in<00:02:04.569> her<00:02:04.659> hands<00:02:05.049> and<00:02:05.229> so<00:02:05.829> you'll

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
weights in her hands and so you'll

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.449 
weights in her hands and so you'll
really<00:02:06.549> notice<00:02:06.909> if<00:02:07.360> our<00:02:07.780> arms<00:02:08.140> didn't<00:02:09.069> get<00:02:09.250> all

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
really notice if our arms didn't get all

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.360 
really notice if our arms didn't get all
the<00:02:09.579> way<00:02:09.729> back<00:02:09.759> it's<00:02:10.660> really<00:02:10.780> easy<00:02:11.349> to<00:02:11.769> have

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
the way back it's really easy to have

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.190
