 we throw 3 tablespoons of oil 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.780

 we put a pinch of salt 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.240
 when the vegetables have been fried 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.760
 we incorporate cut cut dice and 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.740
 the calamari for two people I've 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.240
 half cuttlefish and one squid but 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.240
 You already know this to taste 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.580
 we let them be done together with the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.580
 vegetables 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.520
 and we incorporate the rice we throw two 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.520
 coffee glasses per person 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.740
 we give a few laps to the rice and 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.390
 we incorporate the squid ink for 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.570
 these quantities a couple of sachets 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.340
 about 8 grams if you want the rice 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.270
 get more black milk are about more than 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.070
 tape 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.980
 we mix and incorporate broth 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.230
 fish 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.930
 We put two and a half glasses of broth 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.490
 Each glass of rice is important 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.760
 use the same glass with which we have 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.040
 put the rice 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.140
 the fern broth with hake dreadlocks 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.040
 the heads of the prawns a carrot 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.590
 a leek and an onion 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.790
 the broth is added hot 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.790
 will break the video right away 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.980
 once it starts to boil we leave it 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.980
 cook for 18 minutes 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.910
 if we see that the rice is very dry 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.920
 you can add more little broth to 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.850
 little that is hot for not 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.850
 break the option 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.220
 when there are 3 minutes left until the end 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.340
 of time we incorporate the prawns 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.340
 peeled 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.690
 once the time is over we turn off the 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.530
 fire we cover the paellera with a rag 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.990
 clean and let stand 5 minutes I do not 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.060
 I usually accompany with a light aioli 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.620
 the combination is spectacular although 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.620
 alone is also very rich
