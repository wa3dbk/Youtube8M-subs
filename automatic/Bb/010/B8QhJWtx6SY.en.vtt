00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.879
 Hi, I'll do an experiment today. 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.040
 They always ask to record while Tommy 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:14.120
 machine for some party that today has a 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.849
 marriage 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.310
 I'm a little bit so I do not think much 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.560
 I'm going down, so let's see how 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.630
 What is this video to get good? 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.609
 toada promised nothing my face also 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.070
 rebel but it will be good that I will be able 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.480
 hide all things and indeed 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.220
 My first tip that I always do 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.500
 when I separate my makeup I 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.780
 I want to know that I want it then it is 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.790
 there more or less the shadows that I go 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.130
 want the colors to not stay 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.899
 lost looking for or speaking points 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.309
 when ending forget spending 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.120
 first shadows is one thing I 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.850
 I always did 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.200
 so I'll show you the things done 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.489
 hence the college 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.899
 so here are the things I 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.539
 I chose to use here today also 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.649
 language structure because my video 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.690
 time and broke 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.920
 is I think I'll use this earring is 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.000
 the earring I wore on my day 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.300
 marriage 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.630
 That's why I did it and coke is what it is 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.229
 clean that toy is a bit 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:14.479
 exaggerated or so to start using 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.070
 this one from mine that is a silicone 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.299
 Very sweet baby 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:24.170
 I already passed I made a mask before 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.810
 eat raehk I used this mask is the color 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.729
 the read that one French brand that uses 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:35.689
 rainy things and I also spent the 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.600
 famous reminded them after I will pass 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:43.009
 this here is the cruising machine stroll 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.920
 is and is a milk with the moisturizer that has 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:53.509
 a slight shine so I step one 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:56.110
 a little more in these high regions of the 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.110
 face 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.229
 which is as if it were an illuminator 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.929
 a little on the eyelid 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.330
 I always make up with a towel on the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.709
 because I can go cleaning my 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.050
 hand of these products that I'm going through 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:24.600
 with his hand on his waist so white in 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.640
 light is the base I'm going to wear this beard 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.360
 because whenever the use 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:34.230
 I like to go ranging my products 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.260
 so I step in the breast a little this 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.430
 base is very white, I think it 's the base 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.430
 The clearest I have 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:57.400
 with the brand's brush that tells you 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:03:01.360
 blend of synthetic fiber and normal fiber is 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.470
 synthetic and natural fibers is the most 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.470
 taste in home folder 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:21.620
 get there from the sky start I use as a 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:30.410
 I'm running and I can here and here 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:39.100
 Good , it 's worse then it's mara da da sele 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:39.100
 racing here even longer johnny crash 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:58.060
 jacob spin the other collective spines 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:58.060
 oestúdio genes with the brush 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:17.070
 the corrective cléa de pó that is what I 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.070
 More like to wear in dark circles 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:33.440
 Wow, what makes it so different is making skin 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:37.660
 there is the first shadow because I always 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.660
 I forget I will use this gait 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:05:01.060
 to keep the shade more powerful and 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:06.629
 lasting is very important as well. 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.629
 lead to litex master 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:18.219
 then it was already part of the 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:21.639
 skin and now comes the contour and plus 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:26.740
 I'll use full strong tone palette 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:28.599
 illuminati is she is creamy in that 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.629
 I showed on the blog 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:39.789
 so I spend the mean amount of time here 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:42.039
 spreads that is to create yours has to 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:45.699
 spread well so as not to get weird 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:49.180
 it is super easy to handle 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:54.039
 You can child this shadow and also 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:57.810
 down here to do that 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:06:04.810
 cheese that jaw 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:08.409
 so here on this side is right in that ear 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.219
 here and I do not like to see much of being 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:18.520
 very 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:23.409
 only when it is spreading, so I 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:25.569
 supermodel chez here spot one 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:27.849
 little who wants to tune the nose 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:33.639
 also can do so 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:37.180
 on the side of a trick, but it has to be 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:40.899
 very delicate looks well in the place that 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.089
 has a good spine and from 

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:46.120
 then illuminating is illuminating is amazing 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:49.210
 intention of the name is already okay then I 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.520
 more or less follow that the lucy 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:56.700
 that is coming under the base 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:07:01.200
 because I passed another product and then 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:04.590
 The creamy illuminator can also be 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.560
 come here to give a touch of 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:13.160
 walkway here to give the touch of 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:16.560
 catwalk and under the eyebrows 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:19.560
 a lot of catwalks there he left 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.840
 Let's go over the current chain again. 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.430
 blush I still do not know that when I 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.950
 I want to depend a little on the eye I 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:28.440
 I'm going to brown more or more for pink 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.720
 So I'll let it go at the end. 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.410
 when you have already done oil retouching 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.410
 spine 

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:40.050
 Good, so the skin is done and I go 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.300
 get the eye to the video does not stay 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:45.420
 very long member I'm going to leave 

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:47.460
 he is separated into a part and is seen 

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.460
 chelsea's eye watched and wants 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:52.830
 to continue with certainty and on the 

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.820
 youtube the video must be in some 

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.820
 place close
