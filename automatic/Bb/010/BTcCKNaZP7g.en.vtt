into<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> video<00:00:57.120> as<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.140> all<00:00:58.320> may<00:00:58.500> know<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:59.010> got

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
into the video as you all may know I got

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.939 
into the video as you all may know I got
another<00:01:00.270> map<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.899> one<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> humane<00:01:01.770> labs

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
another map and one to the humane labs

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.250 
another map and one to the humane labs
that's<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.820> base<00:01:03.030> where<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.570> dorazine<00:01:03.989> you

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
that's the base where the dorazine you

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.620 
that's the base where the dorazine you
see<00:01:04.500> what<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.769> possibly<00:01:05.220> could<00:01:05.460> open<00:01:05.880> now<00:01:06.600> I

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
see what you possibly could open now I

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.750 
see what you possibly could open now I
tried<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.320> many<00:01:07.500> things<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.340> won't<00:01:08.549> open

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
tried so many things and it won't open

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.719 
tried so many things and it won't open
so<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.390> gave<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.990> up<00:01:10.020> but<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:10.920> when<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.640> got

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
so I gave that up but then when I got

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.550 
so I gave that up but then when I got
under<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.240> map<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.840> went<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.290> main

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
under the map and I went to the main

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.859 
under the map and I went to the main
labs<00:01:13.799> asada<00:01:14.369> there<00:01:14.640> are<00:01:14.729> some<00:01:14.909> hidden<00:01:15.150> base<00:01:15.540> or

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
labs asada there are some hidden base or

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.039 
labs asada there are some hidden base or
some<00:01:16.229> hidden<00:01:16.530> rooms<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.189> lida<00:01:17.490> base<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
some hidden rooms and lida base and the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.679 
some hidden rooms and lida base and the
only<00:01:19.229> way<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:19.860> there<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.700> swim<00:01:21.509> through

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
only way to get there is to swim through

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.920 
only way to get there is to swim through
the<00:01:22.020> door<00:01:22.290> what's<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.920> DC<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.330> has<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.659> be

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the door what's in DC so it has to be

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.200 
the door what's in DC so it has to be
open<00:01:25.350> some<00:01:25.590> way<00:01:25.740> because<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.670> one<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
open some way because it's one of the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.899 
open some way because it's one of the
three<00:01:27.450> locations<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.650> base<00:01:28.890> where<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.700> get<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
three locations the base where you get a

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.630 
three locations the base where you get a
foster<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.540> level<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.860> jetpack<00:01:32.250> could<00:01:32.520> be

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
foster one level so the jetpack could be

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.120 
foster one level so the jetpack could be
could<00:01:33.119> possibly<00:01:33.180> be<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.079> here<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:34.770> yeah<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.100> I

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
could possibly be in here but yeah as I

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.370 
could possibly be in here but yeah as I
said<00:01:35.280> before<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:36.030> previous<00:01:36.240> videos<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:37.170> all

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
said before in previous videos this all

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.800 
said before in previous videos this all
could<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.799> from<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.909> single-player<00:01:39.329> mission

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.289 
with day from the fov where you broken
any<00:01:42.630> base<00:01:43.110> with<00:01:43.409> him<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.579> yeah<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:44.909> kinda

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
me i'm really trying to find out what it

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.289 
me i'm really trying to find out what it
is<00:03:36.060> machamp<00:03:36.810> let's<00:03:37.220> go<00:03:38.220> on<00:03:38.340> i<00:03:38.579> personally

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
is machamp let's go on i personally

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.630 
is machamp let's go on i personally
think<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.840> fov<00:03:40.410> is<00:03:40.530> also<00:03:40.890> something<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.489> do

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
think the fov is also something to do

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.970 
think the fov is also something to do
with<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:41.970> jetpack<00:03:42.420> because<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.380> said<00:03:43.590> before

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
with the jetpack because it said before

the green light at 3am only
now<00:03:55.990> I<00:03:56.020> found<00:03:56.530> some<00:03:56.770> locations<00:03:57.400> where<00:03:57.640> they

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
now I found some locations where they

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.300 
now I found some locations where they
have<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:57.970> sort<00:03:58.360> of<00:03:58.480> meeting<00:03:58.900> sometimes<00:03:59.620> the

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
have a sort of meeting sometimes the

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.450 
have a sort of meeting sometimes the
first<00:04:00.580> location<00:04:00.970> is<00:04:01.300> here<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.500> as<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.250> can

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
first location is here and as you can

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.160 
first location is here and as you can
see<00:04:03.490> it's<00:04:03.790> really<00:04:03.970> close<00:04:04.300> to<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.570> humane<00:04:04.960> labs

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
see it's really close to the humane labs

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.950 
see it's really close to the humane labs
space<00:04:05.800> and<00:04:06.220> yeah<00:04:06.760> i<00:04:06.790> think<00:04:06.970> they<00:04:07.420> are<00:04:07.450> here<00:04:07.810> at

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
space and yeah i think they are here at

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.800 
space and yeah i think they are here at
any<00:04:08.170> time<00:04:08.530> but<00:04:08.920> on<00:04:09.160> mature<00:04:09.520> then<00:04:10.300> the<00:04:10.450> second

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
any time but on mature then the second

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.780 
any time but on mature then the second
location<00:04:11.080> is<00:04:11.440> at<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.710> mysterious<00:04:11.920> satellite

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
location is at the mysterious satellite

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.900 
location is at the mysterious satellite
just<00:04:13.180> outside<00:04:13.540> seneschal's<00:04:14.380> era<00:04:15.310> two<00:04:15.580> things

to kill each other so I don't know what

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.310

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
was pretty interesting it could lead to

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.120 
was pretty interesting it could lead to
something<00:05:03.750> also<00:05:04.750> another<00:05:05.050> thing<00:05:05.230> here<00:05:05.919> at
