00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
 during his European tour of preparation the Colombian senior team 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.980
 He visited the English capital to face Ireland last Thursday 29 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.449
 of May 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.589
 although Colombia knew how to dominate the game with important scoring opportunities 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.769
 the victory was for the Irish team with a one for zero 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.259
 besides having been a magnificent opportunity of blank in territory 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.679
 This meeting was also a reason for congregation for thousands of 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.199
 Colombians who put on their shirts to support their country 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.089
 here in Latin tibi in summary of the match by the experts 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.170
 the appreciations of the snail channel team 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.750
 about how the Colombian team started and how their match against 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.580
 the Irish team 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.730
 of the sidewalk while the other Colombians seen 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.220
 I think the triumph of Ireland came with 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.500
 still under 1 for 0 of a 'more defensive error by Elvis Gonzalez who 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.890
 Asus first appearance in poster and international with the selection the 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.930
 logical that sit me kind of nerves was wrong they stole the ball and also 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.550
 the ball is diverted because the two agros entry from colombia 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.460
 amaranto and they moved away from the house neighborhood to aim the ball and it does not reach 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.040
 robinson zapata react to touch that protector those the reddish goal since 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.950
 more car with our stuck on Sunday rubichi 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.730
 but from then on I think that Colombia was the value driver 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.120
 handler of the options I counted five clear options of goal only in the 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.440
 first time where for me even the first part the great figure of the party 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.860
 is that the icc is the goalkeeper of Ireland but that it cuts many options out of them 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.130
 I would say three very clear that the goalkeeper saves 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.500
 one of devon carlos escobar a head butt the first stick with fariza the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.150
 left 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.950
 the second division perea 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.710
 here is a headbutt of the same Falcao garcía back to the second 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.690
 stick that you reach to carlyle 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.750
 when you count so many clear options because the team gave a good account 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.240
 of the handling of the ball and clear goal arrivals 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.600
 that is very important and that was what the Colombian team did the matches of 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.000
 preparation serves for that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.040
 we are talking about the game as a little list on the subject about 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.840
 particular 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.940
 and we talked about the possibility that the team would suddenly lose but 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.100
 to see how they are interested in the athletic javier hernández bonnet de 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.589
 no snail channel hahaha since both the game today 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:15.050
 the interesting manager as the oratory as an experiment I think you can 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.639
 I evo in facing a 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:21.009
 Such an atypical style for us South Americans as the selection of the 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:23.579
 errant 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.059
 so that one of the concerns that the Colombian people have is that there is no 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:28.160
 a goal scorer 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.990
 see more there it showed now we have strikers who score but it's not the 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.700
 scorer who used castedo has a pirate party that today 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.459
 there were at least five of the first time and we can not invoke 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.469
 not in every game we're going to have five they're going to get game where it's just going 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.819
 to be one and that's where we have to have the scorer that 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.719
 We are not worried yet, but we have hopes to continue 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:51.700
 advancing clear not 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.259
 the team 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:58.409
 kept something that is important is the style regarding the style of play 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.789
 He did not betray 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:04.829
 the control of the ball that is one of the strengths that Colombia has 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.900
 there and was not inferior to his rival in so much so that the figure of ireland 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.900
 definitely with the cree 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:27.499
 the ocher wanted to taste what the men who cried out forbid it taste 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:29.570
 that is not new in the selection I also like 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.520
 but very good the south project as the team that currently has writes 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.410
 Colombia among all its players and technique a team like football 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.519
 dynamic and tact 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.519
 the key points you have when choosing boys 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.730
 that's why while a mentality they feel the shirt before committing 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:48.379
 with the tactical concept 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.569
 and what good and bad what we have for where a group of hundreds of people 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.589
 that they feel the truth is that one 

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:58.339
 a day with a magnificent match 1 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:59.459
 one for zero 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.459
 by common with the sensation presented in hours party sources 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:07.179
 I have not yet seen him lose and more with the football he showed 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.569
 inside the court and 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.919
 the opposite is also affirmed knowing that those two of applying the 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.129
 Procedures 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.070
 for this game the Colombian team left a good image on their route 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:21.009
 the world cup of south africa 2010 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.169
