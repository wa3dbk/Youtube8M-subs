working model of actual ships that I
dock<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.319> undock<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:10.159> Valdez<00:03:10.579> so<00:03:11.390> that

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
dock and undock and Valdez so that

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.410 
dock and undock and Valdez so that
there's<00:03:12.260> immediate<00:03:13.010> application<00:03:13.579> I<00:03:14.000> can<00:03:14.060> go

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
there's immediate application I can go

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.289 
there's immediate application I can go
from<00:03:14.599> this<00:03:14.840> model<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:15.500> next<00:03:16.340> week<00:03:16.519> dock<00:03:16.969> the

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
from this model and next week dock the

00:03:17.299 --> 00:04:13.020 
from this model and next week dock the
real<00:03:17.480> real<00:03:18.200> ship<00:03:18.530> of<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.859> model

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.490 

I've<00:04:14.030> got<00:04:14.270> a<00:04:14.300> five<00:04:14.570> great<00:04:14.840> appreciation<00:04:15.110> now

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
I've got a five great appreciation now

the<00:04:15.560> ship<00:04:15.830> handling<00:04:16.400> in<00:04:16.880> this<00:04:17.120> only<00:04:17.750> I<00:04:17.840> think

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
the ship handling in this only I think

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.700 
the ship handling in this only I think
so<00:04:18.530> much<00:04:18.740> I<00:04:18.920> could<00:04:19.100> learn<00:04:19.130> it<00:04:19.430> Portland<00:04:20.470> on<00:04:21.470> the

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
so much I could learn it Portland on the

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.100 
so much I could learn it Portland on the
job<00:04:21.920> actual<00:04:22.340> training<00:04:22.760> well<00:04:23.450> here<00:04:23.720> getting<00:04:24.080> to

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
job actual training well here getting to

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.320 
job actual training well here getting to
actually<00:04:24.290> practice<00:04:24.710> and<00:04:25.460> I<00:04:25.760> want<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:26.120> go<00:04:26.180> back

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
actually practice and I want to go back

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.940 
actually practice and I want to go back
now<00:04:26.510> and<00:04:26.540> try<00:04:26.780> out<00:04:26.900> all<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.020> techniques<00:04:27.770> I've

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
now and try out all the techniques I've

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:41.290 
now and try out all the techniques I've
learnt<00:04:28.160> here
