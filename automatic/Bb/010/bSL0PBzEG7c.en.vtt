00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.350
 and what happens more cards how is that what's up 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.540
 you are and well I'm still here you know 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.030
 that preparing my final exams but 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.860
 well, always saturated me, always 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.620
 I get a little swollen 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.480
 Eggs is not studying because I pass 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.970
 around here I try to upload some 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.099
 content today I bring you a new video 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.529
 of mario kart 8 this time is the 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.869
 cup star the cup that is coming 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.819
 always in mario kart let's say the last 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.609
 that unlocks the new circuits 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:33.560
 one of the retro circuits and good as 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.300
 You see it looks amazing 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.710
 obviously the gameplay is not mine 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.660
 new because if I had this game 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.510
 I probably would not be studying for 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.640
 the exams would then be reversed 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.740
 my time to do this but it's not 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.080
 with Spain but that is not if I had 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.080
 this game surely had gone up 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.940
 there are some more videos and good is 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.890
 really liking the attitude of 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.030
 nintendo not when campaigning 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.250
 of this game because it's leaving 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.680
 a lot of freedom has given access 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.300
 anticipated many journalists so that 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.939
 approve the game can upload videos 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.679
 comment make your criticisms and people 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.140
 have access as they know content and 

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:10.110
 do not 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.420
 by youtube seen and there were not too many 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.100
 videos in Spanish about mario kart 8 in 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.440
 English there is a jug there are many people who 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.659
 have uploaded gameplays and such that 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.520
 well I'm going to upload the gameplay for 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.290
 how good the people who have not had 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.830
 Access that has not seen your videos in 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.010
 English then see this 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.290
 and well, that's what I wanted to bring the cup 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.110
 is the whole star cup as you can see 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.740
 how they look incredible circuits I think 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.970
 that the game I do not know if it ran to 64 to 32 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.040
 fps is from fps is but good what 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.750
 You see it looks amazing you can nintendo 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.320
 so much quality the truth that I think it's going 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.630
 to be worth it and it will be a pass 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.980
 there was a lot of fear there were people who 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.560
 he even said that nintendo was not going to 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.740
 let this game go up and even when 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.390
 come out for copyright and such and 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.460
 truth is that they are being very flexible 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.590
 I repeat something that will be very positive and 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.440
 when too much and this game will 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.690
 We are going to give a little water here to the good channel 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.729
 we will continue to see the circuits 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.640
 let's talk a bit as you see 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.959
 here good it gets this way it worked 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.959
 that they have added to mario kart that is that 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.610
 you can adhere to the walls let's say 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.560
 change the severity or eliminate it 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.300
 directly basically changes the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.390
 change because as you see it is changing 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.180
 is opening up to what is the track and the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.260
 design of the selection object 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.959
 objects that also 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.530
 appears up there normally I think that 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.730
 on the other side now too but I 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.400
 it seems that it always seemed right 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.280
 well I do not know 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.409
 as you see now the screen looks very 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.280
 well here in the snow you can also 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:49.930
 appreciate how it looks like let's say the 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.489
 typical white snow of mario kart not that 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.769
 almost did not distinguish the 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.140
 snow and ice also all very 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.310
 currado and good the circuits really 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.620
 they follow the same trend as always 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.750
 obviously they are getting more and more crazy and 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.609
 more you see that there are several roads there are many 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.109
 bifurcation over here I think there's going to be 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.180
 enough options for players 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.890
 experienced people to make the most of 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.870
 circuits let's say that the people who are 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.629
 good really be always the posts 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.519
 although lately this is because if you had 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.019
 filly and he touches you with objects of last and 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.030
 you could even win without having 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.500
 too much idea to play but as you see 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.659
 now you have many many options 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.459
 recesses by which to access thus 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.540
 Fuck life be in what they throw at 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.400
 Water 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.240
 and there are going to be many characters like 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.550
 I went up a lot 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.380
 novelty at least many pupae of 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.390
 these I already uploaded a video explaining 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.190
 let's say how to create a non- mario car 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.750
 kart and it also appeared on the list of 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.290
 characters and had enough look at what 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.780
 handsome is this is suddenly changed the 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.260
 gravity and it appears here with this in this 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.819
 wall that is with a waterfall 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.470
 and all of them that are there to the 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.939
 left that are in the gravity 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.220
 normal and you aside is not enough 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:55.810
 cool this new functionality the truth 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.090
 how good this game we are going to take 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.040
 quite a party I think 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.349
 and good if anyone here has the support 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.940
 I know that right now the viu is difficult 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.280
 buy it because you do not have too many 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.450
 games that are worthwhile but good if 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.920
 someone has it then we could 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.409
 throw some games that enter 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.680
 subscribers and also remember that it's going to 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.730
 leave the super smash bros of the wiiu 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.350
 game that will also be promising 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.060
 quite the truth for the ds I do not think 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.889
 I see what I bought this rage 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.449
 a blue shell is what rages the most 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.520
 He has given me when you are winning and they throw you 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.520
 this shit and you advance everything 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.840
 that what to see if I finish with the 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.030
 exams if I get on top of the channel 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.560
 with more competitive matches with more 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.540
 humor videos to see if I do even 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.760
 blogs or something that goes on object yo 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.470
 I know and I hope you liked this 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.570
 video I hope that good I hope 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.220
 quite anxiously this game also 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.880
 waste this year are going to see quite a lot 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.889
 good releases like alpha omega 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.389
 sapphire and blonde mega us and the 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.340
 provoke mountains and will also be 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.500
