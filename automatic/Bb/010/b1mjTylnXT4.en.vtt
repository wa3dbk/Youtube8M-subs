and Dragon type Pokemon and at first

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.020 
and Dragon type Pokemon and at first
look<00:00:31.320> at<00:00:31.529> its<00:00:31.740> stats<00:00:32.099> are<00:00:32.309> going<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.520> say<00:00:32.669> it's

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
look at its stats are going to say it's

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.299 
look at its stats are going to say it's
not<00:00:33.390> really<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.719> special<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.469> that's<00:00:35.010> part

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
not really that special and that's part

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.370 
not really that special and that's part
of<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.550> reason<00:00:35.700> why<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.630> UU<00:00:36.930> or

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
of the reason why it's in the UU or

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.799 
of the reason why it's in the UU or
underused<00:00:38.010> here<00:00:38.520> most<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.270> dragons<00:00:39.719> are

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
underused here most of the dragons are

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.380 
underused here most of the dragons are
in<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.320> higher<00:00:40.770> tiers<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.520> that's<00:00:42.000> kind<00:00:42.329> of

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
in the higher tiers and that's kind of

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.090 
in the higher tiers and that's kind of
what<00:00:42.510> gives<00:00:42.809> flag<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.469> its<00:00:43.649> own<00:00:43.800> little<00:00:43.980> niche

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
what gives flag on its own little niche

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.350 
what gives flag on its own little niche
to<00:00:45.030> live<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.450> inside<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.680> lower<00:00:46.890> tiers

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
to live in inside of the lower tiers

to live in inside of the lower tiers
plug<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.539> stats<00:00:48.840> are<00:00:49.079> pretty<00:00:49.350> balanced

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
plug on stats are pretty balanced

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.250 
plug on stats are pretty balanced
overall<00:00:50.370> but<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.879> does<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> 100<00:00:51.809> based

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260

total<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.860> attack<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.760> speed<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:54.989> you're

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
total in attack and speed is what you're

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.069 
total in attack and speed is what you're
really<00:00:55.260> going<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.469> want<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.770> highlight<00:00:55.980> so

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
really going to want to highlight so

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.930 
really going to want to highlight so
usually<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.289> go<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.010> my<00:00:59.160> flag<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.670> is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
usually what I go for with my flag on is

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.520 
usually what I go for with my flag on is
I<00:01:00.120> go<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.510> adamant<00:01:00.870> nature<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.379> there

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
I go for the adamant nature so there

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.619 
I go for the adamant nature so there
won't<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.739> special<00:01:02.100> attacking<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.940> I

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
won't be special attacking at all and I

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
like to get that attack boosted so I can

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.000

get<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:05.760> into<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.119> lower<00:01:06.930> 300s<00:01:07.799> range

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
get that up into the lower 300s range

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.740 
get that up into the lower 300s range
like<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> really<00:01:08.520> start<00:01:08.820> packing<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.240> punch<00:01:09.450> if

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
it's set up correctly and that's also

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.210 
it's set up correctly and that's also
where<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.510> focus<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.229> v's<00:01:13.619> when<00:01:13.860> I'm<00:01:13.950> EV

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
where I focus the v's when I'm EV

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.630 
where I focus the v's when I'm EV
training<00:01:14.490> my<00:01:14.670> flag<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.330> go<00:01:16.250> almost<00:01:17.250> entirely

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
training my flag on I go almost entirely

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.570 
training my flag on I go almost entirely
into<00:01:18.180> attack<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.900> speed<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:20.159> get<00:01:20.460> him

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
into attack and speed so I can get him

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.310 
into attack and speed so I can get him
in<00:01:20.729> there<00:01:20.939> hit<00:01:21.210> hard<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.780> get<00:01:22.080> him<00:01:22.200> out<00:01:22.290> of

there before he takes damage because
this<00:01:24.450> flag<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.900> really<00:01:25.530> can't<00:01:25.830> take<00:01:26.130> too

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
this flag on it really can't take too

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.100 
this flag on it really can't take too
many<00:01:26.580> hard<00:01:26.970> hits<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.479> especially<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.990> could

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
many hard hits it especially we could

that<00:03:09.460> I<00:03:09.580> put<00:03:09.760> on<00:03:09.790> my<00:03:10.000> flag<00:03:10.300> on<00:03:10.480> every<00:03:11.440> single

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
that I put on my flag on every single

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.130 
that I put on my flag on every single
flag<00:03:12.280> on<00:03:12.490> I<00:03:12.730> think<00:03:13.300> that<00:03:13.420> you'll<00:03:13.570> run<00:03:13.720> into<00:03:13.750> is

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
flag on I think that you'll run into is

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.650 
flag on I think that you'll run into is
going<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.560> have<00:03:14.710> either<00:03:15.520> Dragon<00:03:16.000> Claw<00:03:16.150> outrage

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
going to have either Dragon Claw outrage

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.570 
going to have either Dragon Claw outrage
I<00:03:17.020> usually<00:03:17.530> go<00:03:17.650> for<00:03:17.680> outrage<00:03:18.160> because<00:03:18.340> when

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
I usually go for outrage because when

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.890 
I usually go for outrage because when
you<00:03:18.640> have<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.790> flag<00:03:18.970> on<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.210> want<00:03:19.390> to<00:03:19.510> hit<00:03:19.600> hard

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
you have a flag on you want to hit hard

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.630 
you have a flag on you want to hit hard
but<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:20.710> also<00:03:20.830> have<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.040> take<00:03:21.190> that<00:03:21.220> risk<00:03:21.460> of

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
but you also have to take that risk of

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.070 
but you also have to take that risk of
being<00:03:21.760> locked<00:03:22.030> into<00:03:22.240> that<00:03:22.330> move<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:22.840> they<00:03:22.930> can

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
being locked into that move and they can

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.930 
being locked into that move and they can
easily<00:03:23.530> switch<00:03:23.650> in<00:03:23.920> ice<00:03:24.130> type<00:03:24.370> or<00:03:24.550> skill<00:03:24.760> type

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
easily switch in ice type or skill type

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.820 
easily switch in ice type or skill type
on<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.270> but<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:25.810> usually<00:03:25.930> go<00:03:26.230> for<00:03:26.260> that<00:03:26.500> outrage

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
on you but I usually go for that outrage

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.410 
on you but I usually go for that outrage
anyway<00:03:27.310> because<00:03:27.460> I<00:03:27.580> usually<00:03:27.820> put<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.180> out<00:03:28.270> when

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
anyway because I usually put it out when

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.980 
anyway because I usually put it out when
I<00:03:28.450> know<00:03:28.570> it's<00:03:28.870> going<00:03:28.990> to<00:03:29.050> be<00:03:29.170> a<00:03:29.200> kill<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:30.990> also

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
I know it's going to be a kill and also

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.620 
I know it's going to be a kill and also

from a flag on maxed out an attack for a
third<00:03:47.530> move<00:03:47.890> um<00:03:48.570> this<00:03:49.570> is<00:03:49.750> kind<00:03:49.900> of<00:03:50.020> where<00:03:50.170> it

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
third move um this is kind of where it

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.440 
third move um this is kind of where it
comes<00:03:51.010> down<00:03:51.190> to<00:03:51.400> what<00:03:51.580> you<00:03:51.700> want<00:03:51.880> your<00:03:52.060> flag<00:03:52.270> on

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
comes down to what you want your flag on

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.560 
comes down to what you want your flag on
to<00:03:52.630> be<00:03:52.750> used<00:03:53.020> for<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:54.430> could<00:03:54.580> easily<00:03:55.090> go<00:03:55.270> for

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
to be used for you could easily go for

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.840 
to be used for you could easily go for
something<00:03:55.930> like<00:03:56.320> a<00:03:56.590> u-turn<00:03:57.040> here<00:03:57.430> so<00:03:57.670> that

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
something like a u-turn here so that

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.820 
something like a u-turn here so that
when<00:03:58.000> your<00:03:58.090> flag<00:03:58.300> on<00:03:58.450> gets<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.080> damage<00:03:59.440> in<00:03:59.620> and

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
when your flag on gets the damage in and

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.170 
when your flag on gets the damage in and
he<00:03:59.920> needs<00:04:00.100> to<00:04:00.160> get<00:04:00.310> back<00:04:00.430> out<00:04:00.640> before<00:04:00.940> he<00:04:01.030> gets

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
he needs to get back out before he gets

he needs to get back out before he gets
it<00:04:01.330> hard<00:04:01.570> you<00:04:02.170> turn<00:04:02.350> is<00:04:02.530> a<00:04:02.620> pretty<00:04:02.890> good<00:04:03.100> option

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
it hard you turn is a pretty good option

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.040 
it hard you turn is a pretty good option
and<00:04:03.670> it's<00:04:03.790> very<00:04:04.000> versatile<00:04:04.450> move<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.870> can<00:04:04.959> get

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
and it's very versatile move you can get

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.449 
and it's very versatile move you can get
you<00:04:05.170> switched<00:04:05.440> into<00:04:05.620> something<00:04:06.010> stronger

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
you switched into something stronger

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.220 
you switched into something stronger
before<00:04:07.060> your<00:04:07.180> flag<00:04:07.360> on<00:04:07.510> gets<00:04:07.720> killed<00:04:07.990> and

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
before your flag on gets killed and

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.370 
before your flag on gets killed and
roofs<00:04:09.220> is<00:04:09.459> also<00:04:09.760> an<00:04:09.850> option<00:04:09.940> here<00:04:10.360> as<00:04:10.450> well<00:04:10.660> for

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
roofs is also an option here as well for

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.590 
roofs is also an option here as well for
if<00:04:11.770> your<00:04:12.070> flag<00:04:12.430> on<00:04:12.610> you<00:04:13.030> can<00:04:13.180> know<00:04:13.360> your

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
if your flag on you can know your

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.640 
if your flag on you can know your
opponent<00:04:13.750> switching<00:04:14.200> out<00:04:14.290> or<00:04:14.410> something<00:04:14.590> like

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
opponent switching out or something like

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.349 
opponent switching out or something like
that<00:04:14.740> you<00:04:14.830> can<00:04:15.010> always<00:04:15.160> get<00:04:15.280> a<00:04:15.310> roost<00:04:15.520> in<00:04:15.730> heel

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
that you can always get a roost in heel

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.210 
that you can always get a roost in heel
off<00:04:16.570> some<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:16.870> that<00:04:16.959> damage<00:04:17.350> that<00:04:17.709> your<00:04:17.859> plugin

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
off some of that damage that your plugin

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.580 
off some of that damage that your plugin
could<00:04:18.340> take<00:04:18.549> but<00:04:19.299> I<00:04:19.540> think<00:04:19.840> usually<00:04:20.290> you<00:04:20.410> turn

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
could take but I think usually you turn

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.069 
could take but I think usually you turn
is<00:04:20.680> going<00:04:20.799> to<00:04:20.859> be<00:04:20.919> a<00:04:20.950> better<00:04:21.070> option<00:04:21.160> be

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
is going to be a better option be

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.260 
is going to be a better option be
has<00:04:22.199> your<00:04:22.560> flag<00:04:22.830> on<00:04:23.009> won't<00:04:23.280> be<00:04:23.370> surviving<00:04:24.120> many

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
has your flag on won't be surviving many

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.809 
has your flag on won't be surviving many
things<00:04:24.599> in<00:04:25.050> more<00:04:25.500> than<00:04:25.590> one<00:04:25.770> hit<00:04:25.979> anyway<00:04:26.370> and

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 
things in more than one hit anyway and

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.820 
things in more than one hit anyway and
the<00:04:27.449> last<00:04:27.599> move<00:04:27.930> in<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.169> set<00:04:28.349> usually<00:04:28.620> comes

the last move in the set usually comes

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.499 
the last move in the set usually comes
down<00:04:28.889> to<00:04:29.159> one<00:04:29.340> of<00:04:29.460> three<00:04:29.849> you<00:04:30.090> have<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.330> choose

down to one of three you have to choose
