00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.530 

it's<00:00:55.610> supposed<00:00:55.820> to<00:00:55.850> be<00:00:55.970> the<00:00:56.089> other<00:00:56.119> way<00:00:56.420> around

hair<00:01:03.409> because<00:01:03.830> they<00:01:04.040> are<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.280> legs<00:01:04.519> now<00:01:05.269> this

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
hair because they are the legs now this

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.170 
hair because they are the legs now this
transformation<00:01:06.530> requires<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:07.400> legs<00:01:07.670> needing

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
transformation requires the legs needing

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.179

to<00:01:08.420> be<00:01:08.540> pretty<00:01:08.900> big<00:01:09.140> so<00:01:11.560> that's<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.860> reason

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
to be pretty big so that's the reason

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.920 
to be pretty big so that's the reason
for<00:01:13.369> that<00:01:15.310> he<00:01:16.310> walks<00:01:16.549> on<00:01:16.759> all<00:01:16.820> fours<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.330> this

for that he walks on all fours and this

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.109 
for that he walks on all fours and this
transformation<00:01:18.350> is<00:01:18.729> completely<00:01:19.729> different

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
transformation is completely different

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.770 
transformation is completely different

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
than the toys so don't expect it to be

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
this decks are down a long haul these

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.300 
this decks are down a long haul these
guys<00:04:00.500> four<00:04:00.889> wheels<00:04:02.079> again<00:04:03.079> the<00:04:03.319> peg<00:04:03.560> there<00:04:04.569> now

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
guys four wheels again the peg there now

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.009 
guys four wheels again the peg there now
it<00:04:07.310> does<00:04:07.519> sort<00:04:07.819> of<00:04:07.909> dump<00:04:08.150> but<00:04:08.479> the<00:04:08.599> wheel<00:04:08.780> goes

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
it does sort of dump but the wheel goes

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.839 
it does sort of dump but the wheel goes
along<00:04:09.319> with<00:04:09.500> it<00:04:09.560> so<00:04:09.919> I<00:04:10.040> really<00:04:10.250> wouldn't<00:04:10.609> count

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
along with it so I really wouldn't count

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.910 
along with it so I really wouldn't count
that

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.340

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
does go up and down and rotate really

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.150 
does go up and down and rotate really
only<00:04:36.630> goes<00:04:36.840> up<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:37.140> down<00:04:37.200> for<00:04:37.440> transformation

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
only goes up and down for transformation

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.210 
only goes up and down for transformation
but<00:04:39.710> still<00:04:40.710> there<00:04:40.920> for<00:04:41.160> whatever<00:04:41.310> reason<00:04:43.220> he

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220

looks pretty cool front wheels

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.280 
looks pretty cool front wheels
I<00:04:46.470> guess<00:04:46.830> these<00:04:47.040> would<00:04:47.250> be<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.520> back<00:04:47.670> wheels

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.800 

yeah

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
you got the sort of sense back here too

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.720 
you got the sort of sense back here too
bad<00:05:06.150> I<00:05:06.180> didn't<00:05:06.540> have<00:05:06.720> any<00:05:06.990> strength<00:05:07.730> like

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
bad I didn't have any strength like

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.190 
bad I didn't have any strength like
you're<00:05:08.880> starting<00:05:09.240> with<00:05:09.270> me<00:05:09.570> but<00:05:11.960> that's<00:05:12.960> all

right goes in and out like that this
does<00:05:21.720> rotate<00:05:24.860> and<00:05:25.860> yeah<00:05:26.160> it's<00:05:26.460> just<00:05:26.700> really

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
does rotate and yeah it's just really

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.689

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:41.649 

last<00:05:34.699> but<00:05:34.879> not<00:05:34.999> least<00:05:36.639> scavenger<00:05:40.269> histones<00:05:41.269> go

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:41.659 
last but not least scavenger histones go

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:44.739 
last but not least scavenger histones go
up<00:05:41.779> and<00:05:41.959> down<00:05:42.399> net<00:05:43.399> doesn't<00:05:44.269> really<00:05:44.509> peg

00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:44.749 
up and down net doesn't really peg

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:48.309 
up and down net doesn't really peg
together<00:05:45.079> anyway<00:05:46.089> I<00:05:47.089> couldn't<00:05:47.749> find<00:05:47.989> a<00:05:48.169> way

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:48.319 
together anyway I couldn't find a way

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:55.179 
together anyway I couldn't find a way
that<00:05:49.419> worked<00:05:51.699> very<00:05:52.699> well<00:05:52.759> so<00:05:53.149> I<00:05:53.869> just<00:05:54.739> don't

00:05:55.179 --> 00:05:55.189 
that worked very well so I just don't

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.719 
that worked very well so I just don't
have<00:05:55.339> them<00:05:55.519> peg<00:05:55.699> together<00:05:55.999> as<00:05:56.209> of<00:05:56.360> now<00:05:57.489> but<00:05:58.489> it

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
have them peg together as of now but it

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:04.419 
have them peg together as of now but it
still<00:05:58.879> looks<00:05:59.239> pretty<00:05:59.449> cool<00:06:02.979> as<00:06:03.979> you<00:06:04.069> can<00:06:04.189> see

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:04.429 
still looks pretty cool as you can see

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:06.729 
still looks pretty cool as you can see
there's<00:06:04.669> a<00:06:04.729> flap<00:06:05.179> there<00:06:05.479> so<00:06:06.139> you<00:06:06.199> can't<00:06:06.469> see

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:06.739 
there's a flap there so you can't see

00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:12.759 
there's a flap there so you can't see
any<00:06:06.949> of<00:06:07.069> the<00:06:07.399> junk<00:06:08.360> in<00:06:08.539> the<00:06:08.659> trunk<00:06:11.589> but<00:06:12.589> yes

any of the junk in the trunk but yes

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:16.419 
any of the junk in the trunk but yes
there's<00:06:13.249> scavenger<00:06:15.009> looking<00:06:16.009> awesome<00:06:16.129> as

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:16.429 
there's scavenger looking awesome as

00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:23.619 
there's scavenger looking awesome as
always<00:06:18.939> all<00:06:19.939> right<00:06:21.819> no<00:06:22.819> more<00:06:22.999> dilly-dally
