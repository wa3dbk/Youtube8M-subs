roughly a hundred and forty pieces of
clay<00:02:22.260> here<00:02:22.740> well<00:02:23.190> not<00:02:23.910> blocks<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.600> clay<00:02:24.870> that

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
clay here well not blocks the clay that

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.570 
clay here well not blocks the clay that
you<00:02:25.140> get<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.620> roughly<00:02:25.980> get<00:02:26.190> around<00:02:26.450> 140<00:02:27.450> and

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
you get you roughly get around 140 and

in my next video I'm going to be showing
you<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.190> duplication<00:02:32.910> glitch<00:02:32.940> after<00:02:33.540> you've

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
you the duplication glitch after you've
