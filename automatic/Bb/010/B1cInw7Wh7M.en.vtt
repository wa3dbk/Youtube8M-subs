00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.030
 Halli hello here is the night of raw 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.070
 good morning good energy 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.470
 it's weekend again and me 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.220
 doing the morning of the pancake ta the 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.050
 close 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.230
 but really is not because he 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.000
 otherwise have and must stop a bit 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.470
 to improvise, let's see if that works 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.190
 if it works, I will the video synonymous 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.660
 high I have the idea today chocolate 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.279
 making oatmeal pancakes 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.100
 i have no leather and i have 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.670
 no community soy milk more there 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.809
 That's why I have here now 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.050
 making oatmeal stuffed in the blender 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:44.140
 try to make it out of it 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.089
 That's exactly 500 km of oatmeal then 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.499
 I believe a liter of milk in 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:51.269
 introduction sign there I have now 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:53.139
 only this sojadrink with chocolate there 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.399
 I did not used to 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:58.329
 to make pancakes 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.789
 then I still need as a substitute namely 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.280
 always like these flealy shells 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.649
 remind one to two teaspoons 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.719
 I prefer to take it first if it is 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.000
 not too much on deck after 2 34 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:11.649
 minutes and maybe something else 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.439
 give in but make it a good one 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:17.530
 then we still need consistency 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:21.729
 Two crises since four are rockfalls 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.280
 no stuffed is not the original one 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.140
 So also a teaspoon corresponds to me 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.789
 say spread teaspoon and then 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.960
 I give another two tablespoons good 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:33.969
 olive oil with one for yesterday hereby 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.520
 I'll just let it go 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.020
 and let's see if that 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.200
 works maybe it works out yes 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.200
 get rid of the sea 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.060
 very good so that has been great 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:04.310
 worked this is a really good mini 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:08.300
 is not a victory by an estimated 10 to 20 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:14.780
 because the already violence is cereal 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:22.160
 the come where I times a little fire 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:24.910
 already with the hearing aid through it 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.280
 the larger chunks become small 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:34.510
 then I give my first the pinch 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.510
 salt home such a coated teaspoon 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:46.040
 Now we have the whole better 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.730
 league minister to go in the whole 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.730
 chocolate drinks 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:33.050
 the 2 and now I'll take one 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.960
 teaspoon flea seed husks painted that 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.010
 is extremely so always first time 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.470
 to start with little 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.310
 and because we really five minutes 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.940
 to let go 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.310
 that has come right and then will 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.870
 stop again a teaspoon to give 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.000
 I have often made too thick 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:55.280
 and even if liquid he admits 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.650
 is that there nothing I leave now five times 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.360
 minutes and already the flags 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:05.270
 So the flags are hot now 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.340
 so the dough is looks very good 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.100
 out is almost a bit gone so well 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.720
 a teaspoon of flea seed husks is already 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.300
 almost too much equal to the band half 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.250
 because in this chocolate cacaus take 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.200
 So little cara served their umbrellas 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.760
 Thickener that would have been almost 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.799
 it is enough to see what she has 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.810
 and prefer to start small and you 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.410
 work hard so that it does not get too thick 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.410
 but it has to 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:56.370
 so the first gear is ready yes me 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.230
 think that looks very good to the 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.930
 Children will definitely taste once 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.480
 quite good improvisational pancakes 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.460
 if not everything is there too 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.550
 sometimes be creative around reste too 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:13.010
 Recycle and feed the family 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.010
 Have fun imitating and see you soon 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.850
 so now it will be tried for the first time 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.950
 He tries for good but it is him 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:27.240
 of consistency 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:28.470
 why this waffle or how to bread 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.480
 can not roll him so well 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.540
 that's why they now have small jobs 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:38.330
 painted with jam or with with to 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:40.740
 good sugar or with cocoa powder and 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.900
 then you go up and that's how it is 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.160
 A little bit of bread like a weapon 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.330
 works better so that you know 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.180
 you know that will be a bit 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.910
 by that the oats are not as fluid as 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:55.230
 with spelled flour or rye flour or with 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:57.750
 rice flour and that still tastes great 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.660
 Tasty but just that she is informed yes 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:05.490
 a bit waffle moderately bread moderate 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:08.760
 to put old crash away to crash 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.000
 They also work well as as much fun to 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.000
 imitate
