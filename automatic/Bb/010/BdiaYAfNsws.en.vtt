00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.430
 It is totally blind popular dr Yoshida Takayoshi 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.299
 I have a leg book and I have a leg syndrome 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.679
 You may hear a resolute response inside 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.210
 Restless legs syndrome is a formal Article 6 scheduled 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.360
 If you try to go out at night, you feel sleepless and you sleep 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.050
 It is 9 songs that competes with Mayuki 22 that will be gone 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.160
 Not very well known but in fact 5% to 8% of the population 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.580
 It is very friendly 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.810
 Yes, even when it starts from time to time 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.780
 It gets stronger and stronger 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.990
 I do not know yet to act 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.830
 Please see this and the patient himself is tired of talking 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.010
 Sense of affiliation or partnership heard on the 1st 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.050
 Put up 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.710
 I know I'm particularly arrogant who is apathetic 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.410
 There are a lot of people who feel like that, and after becoming a member 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.760
 If you feel like an exhibition is taking place 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.500
 there is 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.210
 However 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.030
 The story itself is not a problem but is renewed with the feeling of the foot 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.880
 I'm connected to a place and I have a problem with my childhood 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.490
 for 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.310
 When the person feels itchy to talk 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.780
 I want to say 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.829
 Especially for those who are the masters of Nissho, it is the sugar of the child but 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.350
 Because we make use of that hit 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.440
 There is no doubt that there is something in it 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.470
 Five to two times boycotts of women compared to merged men 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.729
 Also 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.630
 I'm kidding 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.640
 Such a low is moving the feeling that the legs are thin 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.670
 Because I hear that I move the leg, so the patient 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.630
 It's a pretty cool board to move legs that can go already 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.100
 Since the distance will be wider, we will keep moving the focus again 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.350
 In this patient, I can not sleep at night 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.660
 I'm very ill for help 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.480
 Lol But now it's the same as Sato Park's dopamine nerve in the park 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.670
 That help the work of 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.630
 Yes, I especially care about a new medicine called Pramipexole 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.800
 Listen to 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.680
 Because 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.740
 Conversely, the syndrome I mentioned is 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.999
 In order to have some abnormality seriously over 8 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.999
 It is guessed that it is not the Imperial Army 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.439
 Please see here if you are currently familiar with this 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.460
 About restless leg syndrome 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.740
