00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
you're gonna have to try that a couple

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.690 
you're gonna have to try that a couple
times<00:01:52.160> yourself<00:01:52.729> until<00:01:53.090> you<00:01:54.050> get<00:01:54.229> it<00:01:54.700> however

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
times yourself until you get it however

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.100 
times yourself until you get it however

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
however it feels comfortable to you but

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.109 
however it feels comfortable to you but
it<00:02:00.110> should<00:02:00.320> work<00:02:00.530> better<00:02:00.770> than<00:02:01.009> just<00:02:01.369> doing<00:02:01.640> it

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
it should work better than just doing it

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.219 
it should work better than just doing it
top<00:02:02.570> or<00:02:02.810> bottom

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
top or bottom

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.749 
top or bottom
one<00:02:03.649> at<00:02:03.770> a<00:02:03.830> time<00:02:05.920> all<00:02:06.920> right<00:02:07.039> going<00:02:07.369> into<00:02:07.670> the

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
one at a time all right going into the

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.999 
one at a time all right going into the
next<00:02:07.940> fast<00:02:08.239> part<00:02:08.539> but<00:02:08.780> after<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.229> it's

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
next fast part but after that it's

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.370 
next fast part but after that it's
basically<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.729> same<00:02:11.450> concept<00:02:11.630> but<00:02:11.989> instead

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
basically the same concept but instead

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.550 
basically the same concept but instead
of<00:02:12.470> pressing<00:02:12.890> yellow<00:02:13.670> red<00:02:13.970> green<00:02:14.750> red<00:02:14.959> you're

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
of pressing yellow red green red you're

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.199 
of pressing yellow red green red you're
gonna<00:02:15.739> want<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.040> move<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.640> use<00:02:16.790> these<00:02:17.030> two

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
gonna want to move I use these two

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.180 
gonna want to move I use these two
fingers<00:02:17.420> but<00:02:18.079> whatever<00:02:18.829> feels<00:02:19.070> most

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
fingers but whatever feels most

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.800

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
go blue yellow red yellow so it'll be

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:34.090 
go blue yellow red yellow so it'll be
like<00:02:23.989> that<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.840> be<00:02:31.420> once<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.840> know<00:02:33.100> you

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.010 

not<00:02:42.830> at<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.040> end<00:02:43.190> there's<00:02:43.430> just<00:02:43.670> one<00:02:44.000> one<00:02:44.690> fast

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
not at the end there's just one one fast

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.920 
not at the end there's just one one fast
