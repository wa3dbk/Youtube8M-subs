gotta go back to to having that killer

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.370 
gotta go back to to having that killer
instinct<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.329> that's<00:01:27.719> what<00:01:27.840> I'm<00:01:27.929> working<00:01:28.109> on

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
instinct and that's what I'm working on

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.279 
instinct and that's what I'm working on
getting<00:01:28.889> that<00:01:29.100> explosiveness<00:01:29.789> I<00:01:30.270> think<00:01:30.899> in

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
getting that explosiveness I think in

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.980 
getting that explosiveness I think in
that<00:01:31.499> fight<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.009> lacked<00:01:32.789> explosiveness<00:01:33.569> and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
that fight I I lacked explosiveness and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.010 
that fight I I lacked explosiveness and
try<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.649> jump<00:01:34.889> on<00:01:35.039> him

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
try to jump on him

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.419 
try to jump on him
maybe<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.109> respected<00:01:37.619> his<00:01:37.740> power<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.039> little<00:01:38.189> too

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
maybe I respected his power a little too

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.270 
maybe I respected his power a little too
much<00:01:38.609> because<00:01:38.850> he's<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> strong<00:01:39.539> puncher<00:01:40.280> but

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
much because he's a strong puncher but

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.029 
much because he's a strong puncher but
you<00:01:42.240> know<00:01:42.359> I<00:01:42.659> still<00:01:43.139> thought<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.649> fight<00:01:43.889> was

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
you know I still thought that fight was

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.190 
you know I still thought that fight was
stopped<00:01:44.429> way<00:01:44.670> too<00:01:44.729> early<00:01:44.909> he<00:01:45.630> connected<00:01:46.079> me

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
stopped way too early he connected me

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.620 
stopped way too early he connected me
with<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.350> good<00:01:46.560> combination<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:48.329> referee

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
with a good combination but the referee

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.879 
with a good combination but the referee

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
early he connected me with a good

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.530 
early he connected me with a good
combination<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.910> fight<00:02:12.090> was<00:02:12.209> over<00:02:12.330> I

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
combination and the fight was over I

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.300 
combination and the fight was over I
thought<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.290> was<00:02:13.380> way<00:02:13.500> too<00:02:13.530> early<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:14.010> wish<00:02:14.250> I

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310
