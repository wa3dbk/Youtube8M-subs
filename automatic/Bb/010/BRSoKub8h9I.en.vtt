walls<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.330> entire<00:00:27.689> new<00:00:28.080> meta<00:00:28.320> game<00:00:28.619> that's

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
walls in the entire new meta game that's

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.440 
walls in the entire new meta game that's
just<00:00:29.250> basic<00:00:29.929> even<00:00:30.929> like<00:00:31.109> stab<00:00:32.120> moves<00:00:33.120> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
just basic even like stab moves the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.180 
just basic even like stab moves the
super<00:00:33.809> effective<00:00:34.050> against<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.620> can't<00:00:34.829> take<00:00:35.010> it

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
super effective against it can't take it

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.810 
super effective against it can't take it
out<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.550> what<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.719> wall<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:38.129> wall

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
out so what this is is a wall a wall

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.780 
out so what this is is a wall a wall
that<00:00:38.879> attacks<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.840> very<00:00:40.200> annoying<00:00:40.559> war<00:00:40.800> its

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
that attacks a very annoying war its

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.260 
that attacks a very annoying war its
idea<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.809> use<00:00:42.840> gyroball<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:45.000> people

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
idea is to use gyroball and for people

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.090 
idea is to use gyroball and for people
who<00:00:45.329> don't<00:00:45.480> know<00:00:45.570> what<00:00:45.750> durable<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:46.860> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
who don't know what durable is it's a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.690 
who don't know what durable is it's a
move<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.700> where<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:49.110> slower<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.620> are<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
move it where the slower you are the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.139 
move it where the slower you are the
more<00:00:51.449> attack<00:00:51.989> ii<00:00:52.020> has<00:00:52.730> to<00:00:53.730> put<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.000> simply

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
more attack ii has to put it simply

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.000 
more attack ii has to put it simply
there's<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.629> huge<00:00:54.809> formula<00:00:55.410> but<00:00:55.559> i<00:00:55.649> can't<00:00:55.920> be

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
there's a huge formula but i can't be

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.150 
there's a huge formula but i can't be
bothered<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.370> recite<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.120> i<00:00:57.300> don't<00:00:57.329> know

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
bothered to recite it and i don't know

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.680 
bothered to recite it and i don't know
anyway<00:00:59.160> um<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.890> yes<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.520> torkoal<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.180> this

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
anyway um so yes it's a torkoal and this

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.270 
anyway um so yes it's a torkoal and this
little<00:01:03.870> layout<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.650> bit<00:01:04.830> different<00:01:05.040> but

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
little layout is a bit different but

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.710 
little layout is a bit different but
hopefully<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.820> see<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.240> item<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
hopefully you can see it's item is a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.570 
hopefully you can see it's item is a
leftover<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:08.060> single<00:01:09.060> leftover<00:01:09.659> yes<00:01:09.900> anyway

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
leftover a single leftover yes anyway

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.570 
leftover a single leftover yes anyway
and<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.060> moves<00:01:12.270> are<00:01:12.570> curse<00:01:12.990> amnesia<00:01:13.740> toxic

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
and the moves are curse amnesia toxic

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.120 
and the moves are curse amnesia toxic
and<00:01:14.820> durable<00:01:15.450> now<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.259> idea<00:01:16.380> behind<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.920> moose

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
and durable now the idea behind a moose

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.760 
and durable now the idea behind a moose
was<00:01:17.490> rather<00:01:18.299> simple<00:01:18.780> first<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.320> we<00:01:19.530> needed

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
was rather simple first of all we needed

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.929 
was rather simple first of all we needed
curse<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.880> need<00:01:21.060> each<00:01:21.210> gate<00:01:21.540> speed<00:01:22.320> down<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.939> as

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
curse we need each gate speed down in as

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.450 
curse we need each gate speed down in as
much<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.140> after<00:01:25.680> three<00:01:26.159> curses

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
much as we can so after three curses

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.120 
much as we can so after three curses
you've<00:01:26.880> got<00:01:27.119> lots<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.990> attack<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.560> very

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
you've got lots of attack and very

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.730 
you've got lots of attack and very
little<00:01:29.340> speed<00:01:29.850> which<00:01:30.210> gives<00:01:30.780> joy<00:01:31.049> oval<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.560> hell

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
little speed which gives joy oval a hell

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.560 
little speed which gives joy oval a hell
of<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.950> lot<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.250> power<00:01:33.049> the<00:01:34.049> problem<00:01:34.500> came<00:01:34.710> with

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
of a lot of power the problem came with

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.120 
of a lot of power the problem came with
special<00:01:36.570> defense<00:01:36.990> because<00:01:37.380> now<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.740> very

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
special defense because now we have very

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.240 
special defense because now we have very
high<00:01:38.189> defense<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:40.409> there's<00:01:40.680> no<00:01:40.799> need<00:01:40.829> for

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
high defense and so there's no need for

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.090 
high defense and so there's no need for
any<00:01:41.430> v's<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.329> actual<00:01:42.720> defense<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.979> we're

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
any v's in the actual defense what we're

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.280 
any v's in the actual defense what we're
going<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.460> about<00:01:44.490> special<00:01:45.090> defense<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.840> Mel

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
going to do about special defense so Mel

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.859 
going to do about special defense so Mel
suggested<00:01:46.829> amnesia<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.670> I'm<00:01:48.509> need<00:01:48.720> your

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
suggested amnesia and I'm need your

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.069 
suggested amnesia and I'm need your
works<00:01:49.049> really<00:01:49.320> well<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.860> plus<00:01:50.640> 2s<00:01:51.000> plus<00:01:51.240> twos

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
works really well it plus 2s plus twos

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.020 
works really well it plus 2s plus twos
I'm<00:01:52.350> going<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.619> use<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.770> term<00:01:53.159> yes<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.759> plus

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
I'm going to use that term yes a plus

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.389 
I'm going to use that term yes a plus
twos<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.360> special<00:01:55.350> defense<00:01:55.680> every<00:01:56.040> time<00:01:56.219> it's

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
twos the special defense every time it's

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.249 
twos the special defense every time it's
used<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.820> after<00:01:57.149> three<00:01:57.420> turns<00:01:57.659> you've<00:01:58.079> got

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
used so after three turns you've got

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.850 
used so after three turns you've got
plus<00:01:58.500> 6<00:01:58.770> special<00:01:59.009> defense<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:01.590> then

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
plus 6 special defense and then

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.800 
plus 6 special defense and then
obviously<00:02:02.100> we<00:02:02.460> would<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:02.939> gyro<00:02:03.210> pool<00:02:03.570> and

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
obviously we would have gyro pool and

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.990 
obviously we would have gyro pool and
then<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.140> last<00:02:04.290> move<00:02:04.680> was<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:05.340> tricky<00:02:05.759> one<00:02:05.969> to

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
then the last move was a tricky one to

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.240 
then the last move was a tricky one to
choose<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.840> go<00:02:07.350> for<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.619> number<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.979> things

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
choose you go for a number of things

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.520 
choose you go for a number of things
here<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.700> can<00:02:08.879> have<00:02:09.090> protects<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.349> have

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
here you can have protects you can have

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.770 
here you can have protects you can have
toxic<00:02:11.190> which<00:02:11.430> is

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
toxic which is

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.020 
toxic which is
I've<00:02:11.870> got<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.319> can<00:02:12.470> have<00:02:12.700> earthquake<00:02:13.700> if<00:02:13.910> you

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
I've got you can have earthquake if you

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.460 
I've got you can have earthquake if you
want<00:02:14.209> another<00:02:14.360> attacking<00:02:14.840> move<00:02:15.170> because

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
want another attacking move because

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.890 
want another attacking move because
after<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:15.980> curse<00:02:16.790> Bruce<00:02:17.180> is<00:02:17.510> going<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.750> be

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
after the curse Bruce is going to be

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.930 
after the curse Bruce is going to be
doing<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.230> lot<00:02:18.260> of<00:02:18.410> damage<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:22.430> reason<00:02:22.790> why<00:02:22.910> you

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
doing a lot of damage the reason why you

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.680 
doing a lot of damage the reason why you
really<00:02:23.270> want<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:24.520> move<00:02:25.520> for<00:02:26.030> your<00:02:26.150> fourth<00:02:26.390> one

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
really want a move for your fourth one

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.050 
really want a move for your fourth one
that<00:02:27.319> can<00:02:27.560> do<00:02:27.740> something<00:02:28.130> at<00:02:28.520> least<00:02:28.790> is

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
that can do something at least is

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.720 
that can do something at least is
because<00:02:29.510> gyroball<00:02:29.900> only<00:02:30.350> has<00:02:30.530> maximum<00:02:30.980> 8pp

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
because gyroball only has maximum 8pp

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.699 
because gyroball only has maximum 8pp
which<00:02:32.690> means<00:02:32.930> you're<00:02:33.380> going<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.590> be<00:02:33.650> stuck

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
which means you're going to be stuck

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.470 
which means you're going to be stuck
there<00:02:33.920> doing<00:02:34.430> nothing<00:02:34.850> for<00:02:34.880> quite<00:02:35.239> a<00:02:35.270> while

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
there doing nothing for quite a while

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.690 
there doing nothing for quite a while
which<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.750> why<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:36.140> put<00:02:36.440> toxic<00:02:36.650> on<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.160> um<00:02:37.310> I

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
which is why I put toxic on it um I

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.960 
which is why I put toxic on it um I
didn't<00:02:38.420> exactly<00:02:38.690> use<00:02:38.900> this<00:02:39.410> set<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.860> its<00:02:40.010> best

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
didn't exactly use this set to its best

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.199 
didn't exactly use this set to its best
fer<00:02:41.239> with<00:02:41.630> toxic<00:02:42.170> on<00:02:42.350> it<00:02:42.500> but<00:02:42.800> I<00:02:43.340> blame<00:02:43.970> hacks

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
fer with toxic on it but I blame hacks

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.610 
fer with toxic on it but I blame hacks
on<00:02:44.450> that<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:44.930> you'll<00:02:45.290> see<00:02:45.440> that<00:02:45.470> in<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:45.739> moment

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
on that and you'll see that in a moment

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.160 
on that and you'll see that in a moment
the<00:02:48.620> v's<00:02:49.190> that<00:02:49.489> you'll<00:02:49.640> want<00:02:49.790> on<00:02:50.060> our<00:02:50.090> max<00:02:50.870> HP

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
the v's that you'll want on our max HP

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.150 
the v's that you'll want on our max HP
which<00:02:51.680> is<00:02:51.860> 252<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.989> max<00:02:53.989> special<00:02:54.470> defense<00:02:54.830> and

which is 252 and max special defense and

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.860 
which is 252 and max special defense and
you<00:02:55.220> want<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.430> sassy<00:02:55.820> nature<00:02:56.150> because<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.630> want

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
you want a sassy nature because you want

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.410 
you want a sassy nature because you want
lower<00:02:57.680> speed<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.400> are<00:02:58.550> higher<00:02:58.790> specialty

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
lower speed and you are higher specialty

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.780 
lower speed and you are higher specialty
offense<00:02:59.720> but<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.680> can<00:03:00.890> have<00:03:01.130> something<00:03:01.580> that

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
offense but you can have something that

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.420 
offense but you can have something that
Lucius<00:03:02.300> attack<00:03:02.690> but<00:03:03.170> always<00:03:03.410> have<00:03:03.830> it<00:03:03.980> so<00:03:04.220> that

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
Lucius attack but always have it so that

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.880 
Lucius attack but always have it so that
your<00:03:05.000> speed<00:03:05.300> is<00:03:05.330> being<00:03:05.750> hindered<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.470> e<00:03:06.500> speed

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
your speed is being hindered the e speed

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.220 
your speed is being hindered the e speed
is<00:03:07.069> lower<00:03:07.340> because<00:03:07.580> that<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.330> what<00:03:08.600> their<00:03:08.840> idea

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
is lower because that is what their idea

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.350 
is lower because that is what their idea
of<00:03:09.290> this<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.880> fundamentally<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:12.880> I've<00:03:13.880> put

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
of this that fundamentally is I've put

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.590 
of this that fundamentally is I've put
the<00:03:14.420> extra<00:03:15.080> four<00:03:15.470> on<00:03:15.739> defense<00:03:16.070> because<00:03:17.060> it's

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
the extra four on defense because it's

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.970 
the extra four on defense because it's
supposed<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.110> be<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.290> war<00:03:19.600> so<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:21.769> whole<00:03:21.950> idea

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
supposed to be a war so the whole idea

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.940 
supposed to be a war so the whole idea
of<00:03:22.430> what<00:03:22.670> you<00:03:22.790> do<00:03:22.970> is<00:03:23.239> you<00:03:23.660> get<00:03:23.840> you<00:03:24.380> spend<00:03:24.860> a

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
of what you do is you get you spend a

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.039 
of what you do is you get you spend a
couple<00:03:25.100> of<00:03:25.280> turns<00:03:25.519> cursing<00:03:26.209> which<00:03:26.480> nothing

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
couple of turns cursing which nothing

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.780 
couple of turns cursing which nothing
will<00:03:27.380> really<00:03:27.530> take<00:03:27.829> you<00:03:27.890> out<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.430> this<00:03:28.579> is<00:03:28.760> a

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
will really take you out and this is a

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.729 
will really take you out and this is a
special<00:03:29.090> attack<00:03:29.570> in<00:03:29.750> which<00:03:29.870> case<00:03:30.170> you<00:03:30.709> should

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
special attack in which case you should

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.229 
special attack in which case you should
know<00:03:31.040> that<00:03:31.220> it's<00:03:31.400> going<00:03:31.549> to<00:03:31.610> use<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:31.790> special

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
know that it's going to use a special

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.300 
know that it's going to use a special
tracking<00:03:32.570> you<00:03:32.630> go<00:03:32.750> from<00:03:32.989> nezer<00:03:33.200> instead<00:03:33.650> and

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
tracking you go from nezer instead and

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.490 
tracking you go from nezer instead and
once<00:03:34.579> you've<00:03:34.790> got<00:03:34.970> two<00:03:35.180> or<00:03:35.540> three<00:03:35.840> curses<00:03:36.079> up

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
once you've got two or three curses up

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.759 
once you've got two or three curses up
and<00:03:36.850> at<00:03:37.850> least<00:03:38.060> two<00:03:38.360> or<00:03:38.510> three<00:03:38.560> Amnesia's<00:03:39.560> up

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.699 
and at least two or three Amnesia's up
you<00:03:40.579> start<00:03:40.820> spamming<00:03:41.150> durable<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.079> when

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
you start spamming durable and when

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.020 
you start spamming durable and when
something's<00:03:43.130> which<00:03:43.370> is<00:03:43.549> in<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.850> you<00:03:44.000> know

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
something's which is in the you know

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.430 
something's which is in the you know
that<00:03:44.329> you're<00:03:44.450> not<00:03:44.480> exactly<00:03:44.810> going<00:03:45.140> to<00:03:45.260> take

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
that you're not exactly going to take

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.050 
that you're not exactly going to take
out<00:03:45.680> too<00:03:45.890> quickly<00:03:46.250> then<00:03:46.579> use<00:03:46.790> toxic<00:03:47.120> on<00:03:47.450> it

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
out too quickly then use toxic on it

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.340 
out too quickly then use toxic on it
that's<00:03:50.060> about<00:03:50.299> all<00:03:50.359> you<00:03:50.630> need<00:03:50.810> to<00:03:50.930> do<00:03:51.079> really

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
that's about all you need to do really

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.910 
that's about all you need to do really
and<00:03:51.709> it<00:03:52.430> gets<00:03:52.790> so<00:03:53.209> flipping<00:03:54.049> defensive<00:03:54.739> it's

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
and it gets so flipping defensive it's

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.280 
and it gets so flipping defensive it's
insane<00:03:55.519> it's<00:03:55.549> really<00:03:56.269> hard<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:56.720> take<00:03:56.900> out<00:03:57.109> and

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
insane it's really hard to take out and

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.750 
insane it's really hard to take out and
you'll<00:03:57.380> see<00:03:57.620> that<00:03:57.799> with<00:03:57.980> this<00:03:58.160> little

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
you'll see that with this little

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.750 
you'll see that with this little

nothing the only problem is that this

like
steel<00:06:37.080> types<00:06:37.470> but<00:06:38.430> you<00:06:38.640> can<00:06:38.820> probably<00:06:39.030> wear

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.480 
steel types but you can probably wear

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
them down eventually given the right

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.300 
them down eventually given the right
variables<00:06:43.950> and<00:06:44.270> toxic<00:06:45.270> won't<00:06:45.480> affect<00:06:46.310> the

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
steel types either so you might want to

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.440 
steel types either so you might want to
put<00:06:49.950> on<00:06:50.070> something<00:06:50.340> like<00:06:50.610> earth-quaking<00:06:51.060> this

debt<00:06:51.750> to<00:06:51.960> deal<00:06:52.200> with<00:06:52.410> things<00:06:52.620> like<00:06:52.890> that<00:06:53.010> but

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
debt to deal with things like that but

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.280 
debt to deal with things like that but
it's<00:06:53.550> entirely<00:06:54.030> your<00:06:54.210> choice<00:06:54.330> but<00:06:54.900> you<00:06:55.110> can

it's entirely your choice but you can

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.790 
it's entirely your choice but you can
see<00:06:55.530> just<00:06:55.560> how<00:06:56.510> incredibly<00:06:57.510> defensive<00:06:58.500> it<00:06:58.650> is

the<00:06:59.160> only<00:06:59.280> problems<00:06:59.790> that<00:07:00.030> will<00:07:00.150> have<00:07:00.330> is<00:07:00.540> if

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690
