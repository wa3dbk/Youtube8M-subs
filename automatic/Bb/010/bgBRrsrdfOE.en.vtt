00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
for sprint speed and 89 strength so this

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.690

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
as he only has 81 pace but he definitely

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.350

little skill run as you guys see right

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.840 
little skill run as you guys see right
there<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.830> that's<00:03:14.160> his<00:03:14.310> weak<00:03:14.490> foot<00:03:14.670> once

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
there and that's his weak foot once

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.490 
there and that's his weak foot once
again<00:03:15.060> tended<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.630> score<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.900> lot<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.200> goals

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
again tended to score a lot of goals

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.200 
again tended to score a lot of goals
with<00:03:16.680> his<00:03:16.800> weak<00:03:16.980> but<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.580> fact<00:03:17.850> being<00:03:18.060> is

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
with his weak but the fact being is

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.910 
with his weak but the fact being is
because<00:03:18.330> in<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.840> hybrid<00:03:19.200> that<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.350> used<00:03:19.680> him<00:03:19.830> in

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
because in the hybrid that I used him in

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.340 
because in the hybrid that I used him in
he<00:03:20.130> was<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.580> left<00:03:21.000> striker<00:03:21.330> so<00:03:21.690> his<00:03:22.080> right

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
he was the left striker so his right

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.840 
he was the left striker so his right
foot<00:03:22.500> was<00:03:22.710> on<00:03:22.740> the<00:03:23.010> inside<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.580> when<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:23.700> was

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
foot was on the inside and when I was

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.210 
foot was on the inside and when I was
coming<00:03:24.060> into<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.540> inside<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.130> exposing<00:03:26.130> the

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
coming into the inside and exposing the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.950 
coming into the inside and exposing the
defense<00:03:26.550> I<00:03:26.700> used<00:03:26.940> his<00:03:27.060> right<00:03:27.300> foot<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.510> lot<00:03:27.780> as

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
defense I used his right foot a lot as

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.840 
defense I used his right foot a lot as
you<00:03:28.140> guys<00:03:28.320> can<00:03:28.470> see<00:03:28.530> right<00:03:28.890> there<00:03:29.160> um<00:03:29.490> you<00:03:29.730> know

his<00:03:33.870> outside<00:03:34.260> foot<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.560> going<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.890> be<00:03:35.010> that

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
his outside foot is going to be that

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.100 
his outside foot is going to be that
right<00:03:35.370> foot<00:03:35.580> rather<00:03:35.850> than<00:03:36.060> he<00:03:36.210> left<00:03:36.450> so<00:03:36.660> that's

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
right foot rather than he left so that's

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.810 
right foot rather than he left so that's
