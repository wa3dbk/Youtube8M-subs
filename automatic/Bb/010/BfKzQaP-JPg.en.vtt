00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
much I mean it's not this technically

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.230 
much I mean it's not this technically
realistic<00:05:03.530> graphical<00:05:04.220> powerhouse<00:05:04.790> but<00:05:05.120> it's

something<00:05:08.600> simple<00:05:08.990> and<00:05:09.110> fun<00:05:09.350> is<00:05:09.530> actually

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
something simple and fun is actually

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.110 
something simple and fun is actually
