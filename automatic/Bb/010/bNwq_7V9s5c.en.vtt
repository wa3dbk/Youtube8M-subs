00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.910

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.740
 in other friends with enough because 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.209
 are very good day for longer 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.000
 I bring you a verse and this time it's 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.650
 they will mock versus evangelion so 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.090
 I hope you like it and start good 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.470
 You already know that before starting the 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.210
 verse is I have to say the winner of the 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.919
 previous verses and a series of things from 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.200
 that same winner things are characters 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.390
 that most hate pony favorite character 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.190
 favorite and moment that I liked the most without 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.050
 doubt the previous versus has been one of 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.329
 the most hard-fought verses that have been 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.520
 until now it was still not that today 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.190
 inverse is playing online there was a lot 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.929
 many comments on that versus those 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.300
 votes were very close in the 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:48.909
 first few days are exceeded by 12 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.920
 votes until finally after that 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.899
 won took advantage the winner was the 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.030
 inegi not here but for very few votes 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.010
 as per 100 votes character that more me 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.569
 they like me if they want me is my house 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.909
 love that person do not know that I 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:03.159
 I love the characters, that is, the women 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.440
 strengths of each level I like them to be 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.420
 protagonists and that are the boom of their 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.400
 own anime the character that I hate the most 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.200
 I'm going to jump because the character 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.060
 what more hate appeared was the manga 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.460
 still did not appear very well in the anime 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.110
 so I do not want to put spoilers on 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.530
 moment that I like the most was the first 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.409
 first name 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.790
 epic of the series and when the end of 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.170
 one of the first chapters was 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.390
 totally wow 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.670
 since that episode is that it started 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.490
 get a lot of people to see this anime and 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.380
 it was when eren was preparing to 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.180
 fight against the titans and of a 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.670
 moment to another appears the titan with slab 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.830
 while of current values ​​as such 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.390
 and the opening that I like the most I like 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.950
 the two but the second one seems more like a 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.899
 national anthem although it is also very 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.090
 good has a solo and very good guitar 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.659
 but I like the first one better then 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.659
 there they have it 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.400
 do not 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.690
 well now my opinion is going which one 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.840
 like this single online 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.510
 I like more single and both are series 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.180
 very good as I said the last verse 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.640
 both were his series of each year 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.860
 respective follows that undoubtedly better 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.010
 anime in 2013 senate can be discussed 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.280
 but both very good series have in 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.769
 a good plot can be said and then 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.530
 well I like it better and here because as 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.620
 I said it did not deviate as much as 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.620
 It is also a very good series 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.659
 considering the history of shinji 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.150
 and carl and in many ways and 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.400
 meanings yes and it's a failure like being 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.799
 awkward human socially abandoned by 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.360
 his father who continuously seeks the 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.940
 approval unable to have a 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.470
 own initiative is probably one 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.510
 of the main characters more 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.690
 easy or diables of the anime though 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.610
 It is also one of the most enduring 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.290
 cindy lives in a world that has been 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.420
 devastated fifteen years ago by a 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.170
 terrible cataclysm called the second 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:17.019
 impact that reduced the human population to 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.760
 half and that came after contacting 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.700
 for the first time with some mysterious 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.920
 series of so-called angels after 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.170
 happened the un formed a new 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.239
 organization called nerd that 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.220
 commissions the protection of the earth this 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.260
 series consists of 26 episodes his house 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.870
 producer bainet and its genres are 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.190
 medical and psychological drama action I can 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.530
 tell him vangeli although it's one of the 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.780
 best series is considered by many 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.760
 critics and not just encourage by 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.380
 professional critics like this 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.270
 as the best anime in history by 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.459
 your things that this anime has inside 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.080
 It has a very good plot personally 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.980
 I think it's one of the best tapas if 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.990
 not the best 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.580
 after one piece personally I think 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.770
 that this we do the best drama that 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.959
 there are well connected to a life and everything 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.660
 it is so well connected and there are so many 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.209
 branches in like 25 episodes that one that to 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.709
 wow no doubt a masterpiece I have 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.700
 pretty darling they were the first 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.440
 anime I wrote 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.120
 thanks to this year he knew me I was encouraged 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.670
 favorite that hid the thanks 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.680
 anime I met mocked thanks to 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.140
 anime and I also met the blood 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.079
 because I was always looking for animes with that 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.550
 thematic as a mecca and something psychological 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.020
 wings are very good nor do I know 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.450
 many people who have not seen it 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.910
 I have two friends who have not seen it 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.220
 and I still do not know why it sounds very series 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.650
 good too much is hard to understand 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.180
 It is extremely difficult to understand 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.010
 I had to go the three times to 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.320
 understand it very well but only at 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.880
 end the rest not because the end is what 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.919
 complicated is so serious yet still a 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.510
 too good series those that we have 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.340
 viewed 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.080
 I do not consider it as an anime to the 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.690
 childhood because I'm sure that a 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.180
 child is not going to like this I consider it 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.280
 more unanimous retro normal a retro saint 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.590
 very good anime I recommend it and more 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.190

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.140
 they are also very good 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.180
 the story unfolds on the planet 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.310
 land where humans live under the 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.380
 terrestrial surface and have never seen 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.750
 sunlight walk his young 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.450
 decided and daring that wishes with desire 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.260

 active and create chaos under the 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.040
 surface

 and they manage to go out and see what the earth is like 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.940
 outside from here they will discover 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.470
 that they are not alone and that there are reasons why 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.140
