should bring back a lot of memories so
let's<00:01:03.729> see<00:01:03.940> what<00:01:04.120> we've<00:01:04.269> got<00:01:04.300> in<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:05.050> box

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
let's see what we've got in the box

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.460 
let's see what we've got in the box
okay<00:01:06.190> so<00:01:06.250> first<00:01:06.850> out<00:01:07.120> of<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.330> box<00:01:07.570> is<00:01:07.810> this<00:01:08.229> one

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
okay so first out of the box is this one

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.430 
okay so first out of the box is this one
and<00:01:08.710> it<00:01:08.830> looks<00:01:08.860> to<00:01:09.400> me<00:01:09.549> like<00:01:09.790> a<00:01:10.440> Styracosaurus

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
and it looks to me like a Styracosaurus

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.440 
and it looks to me like a Styracosaurus
so<00:01:11.590> I<00:01:11.620> think<00:01:11.770> this<00:01:12.130> is<00:01:12.190> Emma

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
so I think this is Emma

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.200 
so I think this is Emma
one<00:01:13.870> of<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.049> characters<00:01:14.620> from<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:15.400> film<00:01:15.760> and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
one of the characters from the film and

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.480 
one of the characters from the film and
I<00:01:16.870> think<00:01:17.260> there's<00:01:17.440> a<00:01:17.530> little<00:01:17.680> lemur<00:01:17.980> in<00:01:18.280> there

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
I think there's a little lemur in there

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.670 
I think there's a little lemur in there
with<00:01:18.640> its<00:01:18.790> legs<00:01:19.060> splayed<00:01:19.900> apart<00:01:20.290> so<00:01:20.560> I<00:01:20.620> think

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
with its legs splayed apart so I think

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.160 
with its legs splayed apart so I think
this<00:01:21.040> lemurs<00:01:21.460> gonna<00:01:21.640> sit<00:01:22.000> on<00:01:22.240> Emma's<00:01:22.900> back

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
this lemurs gonna sit on Emma's back

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.200 
this lemurs gonna sit on Emma's back

electronics<00:02:05.290> so<00:02:05.890> it'll<00:02:06.730> be<00:02:06.820> cool<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.090> take<00:02:07.450> a

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
electronics so it'll be cool to take a

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.830 
electronics so it'll be cool to take a
look<00:02:07.750> at

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
look at

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.940

be another lemur sat down but it's got
an<00:03:06.620> electronic<00:03:07.069> feature<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:07.790> this<00:03:07.970> will<00:03:08.090> be

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
an electronic feature so this will be

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.630 
an electronic feature so this will be
really<00:03:08.360> cool<00:03:08.599> to<00:03:08.750> see<00:03:09.010> what<00:03:10.010> this<00:03:10.130> one<00:03:10.340> is<00:03:10.430> like

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
really cool to see what this one is like

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.610 
really cool to see what this one is like
really<00:03:11.360> nice<00:03:11.540> sculpt<00:03:11.989> actually<00:03:12.470> they're

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
really nice sculpt actually they're

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.789 
really nice sculpt actually they're
looking<00:03:12.859> pretty<00:03:12.890> good<00:03:13.280> even<00:03:13.609> in<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.880> packets

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
looking pretty good even in the packets

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.699 
looking pretty good even in the packets

okay what's the next one okay so we've

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.949 
okay what's the next one okay so we've
got<00:03:18.739> another<00:03:19.130> Iguanodon<00:03:19.940> we're<00:03:20.630> gonna<00:03:20.720> have<00:03:20.870> a

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
got another Iguanodon we're gonna have a

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.160 
got another Iguanodon we're gonna have a
whole<00:03:21.200> herd<00:03:21.560> of<00:03:21.769> iguanodons<00:03:22.489> after<00:03:22.970> this<00:03:23.170> so

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
whole herd of iguanodons after this so

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.660 
whole herd of iguanodons after this so
again<00:03:24.440> I<00:03:24.470> don't<00:03:24.590> know<00:03:24.769> if<00:03:24.859> this<00:03:24.980> one's<00:03:25.190> aladar

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
again I don't know if this one's aladar

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.500 
again I don't know if this one's aladar
I<00:03:25.910> think<00:03:26.239> it<00:03:26.390> might<00:03:26.569> be<00:03:26.600> he's<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.319> hero<00:03:28.510> looks

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
I think it might be he's the hero looks

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.330 
I think it might be he's the hero looks
like<00:03:29.660> it's<00:03:29.810> got<00:03:29.989> a<00:03:30.019> little<00:03:30.140> action<00:03:30.769> feature<00:03:31.040> on

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
like it's got a little action feature on

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.090 
like it's got a little action feature on
there<00:03:31.549> on<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:32.090> back<00:03:32.299> there<00:03:32.680> so<00:03:33.680> we'll<00:03:33.859> find

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
there on the back there so we'll find

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.650 
there on the back there so we'll find
out<00:03:34.220> what<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.430> does<00:03:34.760> when<00:03:35.239> we<00:03:35.329> get<00:03:35.480> him<00:03:35.569> out

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
out what that does when we get him out

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.479 
out what that does when we get him out
of<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.840> box<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:38.180> bag<00:03:38.389> sorry<00:03:38.840> oh<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:40.340> then

lumped together but we will find out so
this<00:03:49.790> one<00:03:50.030> is<00:03:50.269> a<00:03:50.569> long-necked<00:03:51.109> dinosaur

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
this one is a long-necked dinosaur

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.870 
this one is a long-necked dinosaur
and<00:03:52.239> this<00:03:53.239> one's<00:03:53.450> baleen<00:03:53.989> I<00:03:54.260> believe<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:54.920> then

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
and this one's baleen I believe and then

and this one's baleen I believe and then
here<00:03:56.450> we've<00:03:56.660> got<00:03:56.900> a<00:03:57.139> tree<00:03:57.760> with<00:03:58.760> loads<00:03:59.090> of

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
here we've got a tree with loads of

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.090 
here we've got a tree with loads of
lemurs<00:03:59.690> hanging<00:04:00.109> off<00:04:00.230> of<00:04:00.440> it<00:04:00.650> which<00:04:00.859> looks

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
lemurs hanging off of it which looks

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.740 
lemurs hanging off of it which looks
pretty<00:04:01.400> cool<00:04:01.670> I<00:04:01.910> remember<00:04:02.269> there's<00:04:02.420> a<00:04:02.480> scene

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
pretty cool I remember there's a scene

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.259

like<00:04:02.959> this<00:04:03.019> in<00:04:03.319> the<00:04:03.440> film<00:04:04.000> so<00:04:05.000> that<00:04:05.120> looks

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
like this in the film so that looks

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.309 
like this in the film so that looks
pretty<00:04:05.359> detailed

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
pretty detailed
