00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.550
 we can congratulate you or not yet 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.070
 no not yet not yesterday was like I do not know by 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.139
 at least in the afternoon almost at 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.910
 late at night they gave you like 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.679
 confirmed technician of mexico america 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.930
 is a power of mexico then 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.029
 I asked if he was already an officer or if 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.949
 simply ay if interest and 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.560
 conversations and move on 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.570
 project or you are a candidate more than 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.180
 that you can tell us because surely 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.820
 you know a lot but you can not tell a little 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.699
 that the reality if always the reality 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.440
 is that the truth that we are 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.890
 leaving things is my employer in 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.960
 Mexico 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.329
 I have spoken as the few people I know there 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.489
 a couple of important offers 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.890
 fortunately I have chances as to 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.280
 to be able to choose what is the project and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.809
 the challenge that most excites me what is the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.820
 team that can hire me the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.800
 players that I need to like to 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.510
 look for the championship so that 's what 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.309
 I'm thinking calmly what 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.280
 is the best option and the challenge that I 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.650
 I'm more excited about feeling comfortable in 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.330
 the place that I will feel that the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.930
 players that I need for that project 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.340
 and above all feel the adrenaline of 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.289
 go out every weekend on the court and 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.899
 to see the weekend what works 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:18.509
 during the week this is logical what 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.479
 It encourages me what excites me no no 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.700
 it's an economic issue I think that's 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.929
 consequently you found the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.220
 money but what you have to 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:27.090
 to really get excited are the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.649
 Projects 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.780
 obviously Mexico has many 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.670
 chances because there is a market that what 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.160
 I know because I know the teams with 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.140
 the players however the experience 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.659
 European I would like very much I want to try 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.850
 Let's see 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.530
 how would I go in europe doing what 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.530
 I play as my teams can 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:53.690
 we're on the air for television wait 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.690
 turn 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.730
 it will be because matosas is the following 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.630
 American technician after what 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.640
 we've heard things like that, not if it's still 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.560
 course one season and have a contract 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.970
 in force even though they do not violate the rules 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.700
 what explained the baseball of the famous 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.070
 so perin is a jalada looks bad the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.870
 way when Mr. alcalÃ¡ or no chichi 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.030
 to see I'll give you the example of the teacher 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.470
 cross that ended up directing to Morelia and 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.850
 now he is going to direct people but no longer 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.220
 I had a current contract you know no 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:29.120
 they have a current contract, it also ends 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:35.380
 we did not have the season did not finish the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.380
 course in December no carry 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:43.970
 the bus here what is spoken and is 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.580
 he says he is still fighting the 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.740
 final and already have a contract already 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.410
 practically already praised in an advance 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.720
 very important to know what good is not 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.470
 It's part of nature if you're not 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.550
 agreement that you are going to renew 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.320
 the champion to the runner-up as you want 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.620
 Well, you have the freedom to negotiate 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.190
 is clear and it's up to you is saying that 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.360
 freedom or what they can do if 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.570
 talk about the ways that are doing it 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.720
 not a technician who is going to be a champion or who 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.310
 is going to be rational or asia runner-up who 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.350
 and I'm saying grace before 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.510
 days is looking for that maybe what 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.200
 it does not look good that he does not have his right to 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.000
 do it but of course we are being 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.050
 champions after painting with what you 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.050
 family but his vision 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.720
 exempt from criticism that is not 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.300
 well you can do it with your car not 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:53.380
 as you want 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:56.230
 is your car the freedoms of your things 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.810
 of the class but 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.849
 the same Thursday that's why it feels annoying 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.470
 the situation that now does not 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.890
 like how he plays is fine is not the 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.890
 American 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:19.229
 it's a case up until a month ago with a 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:19.229
 Rolls-Royce will change for another 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:32.710
 that normal calm but when can 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.020
 be matosas when the bully is already 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.520
 speaks of this one of this triangulation that 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.770
 the america can come that paul 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.590
 aguilar leave 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:46.020
 to me what I think is that they throw 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:49.370
 things and is already free matosas 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.370
 And why not 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.150
 certainly without a doubt that yes but what 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.470
 you say is also very true I will not go 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.300
 to a team where there is a plantation 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.940
 where I can have the equipment to be 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.860
 champion and only they have to be 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.099
 the monterrey and the tiger is the america 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.840
 blue cross blue pumas chivas is the type 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:12.150
 of cloves plus chivas are not in these 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.840
 moments in those conditions do not 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.840
 will carry matosas 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.710
 the problem of construction descent 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.900
 but are the teams that can 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.509
 have it here one was a technician of this 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:32.960
 level you imagine the demon that more 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.960
 they want all current champion 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:43.800
 that was after winning the win 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:47.760
 the selection of what you said 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:57.700
 capello de mourinho 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:06:00.430
 because madrid like the one in the bayern 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.200
 Munich was champion of Europe champion of 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.180
 green he went with treatments the champion 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.340
 of everything that real closed shot no no no 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.660
 but to see he retires because he was not going 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.750
 to withdraw when they tell you what's coming 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.310
 guardiola was he said here here finished 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.230

 goodbye not because he said here he finished that 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.570
 started the guardiola rumor when not 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.250
 He had said he was going to retire when 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.540
 start the guardiola group said 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.640

 with jupp heynckens 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:51.570
 many expectations will come in a 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.080
 championship with a league record or 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:56.670

 technical to see who gets goal from the forward 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.620
 last three years of Mexican soccer the 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:11.060
 coming mauer has won us good 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.060

 with this team from america they are demanding 

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.480
