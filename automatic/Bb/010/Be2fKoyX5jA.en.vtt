carick<00:00:37.579> well<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.640> didn't<00:00:38.940> do<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> whole<00:00:39.270> lot<00:00:39.420> to

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
carick well I didn't do a whole lot to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.190 
carick well I didn't do a whole lot to
to<00:00:40.850> make<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.030> run<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:42.840> keep<00:00:43.050> it

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
to make it run but I just keep it

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.369 
to make it run but I just keep it
running<00:00:43.399> let's<00:00:44.399> kind<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.910> talk<00:00:45.120> about<00:00:45.480> you

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
running let's kind of talk about you

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.900 
running let's kind of talk about you
know<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.649> controls<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.219> how<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.340> start<00:00:47.700> this

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
know the controls and how to start this

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.180 
know the controls and how to start this
machine<00:00:48.300> right<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.020> able<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> exactly

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
machine right so able to do it exactly

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.630 
machine right so able to do it exactly
but<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.360> there<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.780> lot<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.500> other<00:00:52.770> early<00:00:53.399> bikes

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
but so there a lot of other early bikes

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.850 
but so there a lot of other early bikes
there'd<00:00:53.969> be<00:00:54.120> levers<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:55.110> know<00:00:55.260> here<00:00:55.559> there

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
there'd be levers you know here there

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.260 
there'd be levers you know here there
this<00:00:56.460> bike<00:00:56.760> uses<00:00:57.239> twist<00:00:57.629> grips<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.940> this<00:00:59.940> grip

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
this bike uses twist grips so this grip

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.420 
this bike uses twist grips so this grip
the<00:01:00.449> left<00:01:00.660> side<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.320> twisted<00:01:01.980> all<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> way<00:01:02.370> to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the left side is twisted all the way to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.929 
the left side is twisted all the way to
the<00:01:02.730> outside<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:04.439> compression<00:01:05.129> is

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
the outside and the compression is

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.289 
the outside and the compression is
released<00:01:06.689> from<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.530> engine<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> could<00:01:08.939> turn

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
released from the engine so I could turn

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.740 
released from the engine so I could turn
the<00:01:09.540> motor<00:01:09.750> over<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:11.630> turning<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the motor over like like turning the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.179 
the motor over like like turning the
pedals<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.740> bicycle<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.280> bicycle<00:01:14.570> so<00:01:16.189> right

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
pedals like a bicycle a bicycle so right

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:17.920 
pedals like a bicycle a bicycle so right
now

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
now

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.990 
now
rear<00:01:18.930> wheel<00:01:19.080> spinning<00:01:19.530> turning<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.850> could

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
rear wheel spinning turning if I could

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.390 
rear wheel spinning turning if I could
ride<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.540> bicycle

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
ride it like the bicycle

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.110 
ride it like the bicycle
as<00:01:22.730> soon<00:01:22.940> as<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:23.150> throw<00:01:23.390> this<00:01:23.600> lever<00:01:23.870> forward

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
as soon as I throw this lever forward

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:33.820 
as soon as I throw this lever forward
now<00:01:26.120> I'm<00:01:26.300> turning<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:26.810> engine<00:01:32.350> if<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.530> wanted

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
now I'm turning the engine if I wanted

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
now I'm turning the engine if I wanted
it<00:01:33.980> to<00:01:34.130> fire<00:01:34.340> up<00:01:34.580> I<00:01:35.080> release<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.520> engaged<00:01:37.520> the

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
it to fire up I release the engaged the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.650 
it to fire up I release the engaged the
compression<00:01:39.340> by<00:01:40.340> turning<00:01:40.730> that<00:01:40.910> twist<00:01:41.450> grip

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
compression by turning that twist grip

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.160 
compression by turning that twist grip
like<00:01:41.960> that<00:01:42.230> the<00:01:43.160> compression<00:01:43.580> is<00:01:43.970> in<00:01:44.930> the

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
like that the compression is in the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.320 
like that the compression is in the
there's<00:01:45.770> compression<00:01:46.370> now<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:46.580> if<00:01:46.850> I<00:01:46.940> tried<00:01:47.210> to

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
there's compression now so if I tried to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.320 
there's compression now so if I tried to
turn<00:01:47.750> it<00:01:47.930> over<00:01:51.040> if<00:01:52.040> I<00:01:52.340> had<00:01:52.610> a<00:01:52.640> lot<00:01:52.940> of<00:01:53.030> momentum

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
turn it over if I had a lot of momentum

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.050 
turn it over if I had a lot of momentum
built<00:01:53.780> up<00:01:53.990> in<00:01:54.350> turning<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.070> pedals<00:01:55.430> it<00:01:55.760> would

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
built up in turning the pedals it would

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.820 
built up in turning the pedals it would
push<00:01:56.810> through<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:57.590> pop<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:58.280> fire<00:01:59.830> in

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
push through that and pop and fire in

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.640 
push through that and pop and fire in
this<00:02:01.100> position<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.150> I've<00:02:02.300> gone<00:02:02.540> from<00:02:02.930> there

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
this position so I've gone from there

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.280 
this position so I've gone from there
which<00:02:04.310> is<00:02:04.490> compression<00:02:04.970> released<00:02:05.479> to

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
which is compression released to

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.550 
which is compression released to
compression<00:02:07.010> and<00:02:07.220> at<00:02:07.850> this<00:02:08.000> point<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:09.170> this

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
compression and at this point the this

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.410 
compression and at this point the this
also<00:02:09.830> controls<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.930> up<00:02:11.930> here<00:02:12.320> at<00:02:12.530> the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
also controls the up here at the

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.680 
also controls the up here at the
controls<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:15.050> spark<00:02:15.380> advance<00:02:15.850> so<00:02:16.850> in<00:02:17.510> this

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
controls the spark advance so in this

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.800 
controls the spark advance so in this
position<00:02:18.200> I'm<00:02:18.440> retarded<00:02:19.240> I'm<00:02:20.240> not<00:02:20.510> retarded

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
position I'm retarded I'm not retarded

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.270 
position I'm retarded I'm not retarded
that<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.170> spark<00:02:21.440> advance<00:02:21.740> is<00:02:21.920> retargeting

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
that the spark advance is retargeting

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.350 
that the spark advance is retargeting
and<00:02:23.020> as<00:02:24.020> I<00:02:24.290> turn<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.740> further<00:02:25.070> it<00:02:25.580> advances<00:02:26.180> it

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
and as I turn it further it advances it

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.500 
and as I turn it further it advances it
so<00:02:26.570> once<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.959> pops<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:28.550> get<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:29.000> run

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
so once it pops to get it to run

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.420 
so once it pops to get it to run
steadily<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.470> advance<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.610> timing<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:33.430> as

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
steadily I advance the timing and as

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.220 
steadily I advance the timing and as
soon<00:02:34.610> as<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:34.850> happens<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.570> motors<00:02:35.930> on<00:02:36.080> its

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
soon as that happens the motors on its

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.759 
soon as that happens the motors on its
own<00:02:36.640> then<00:02:37.640> I'll<00:02:37.760> pull<00:02:38.239> this<00:02:38.390> back<00:02:38.720> so<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.620> now

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
own then I'll pull this back so that now

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.900 
own then I'll pull this back so that now
the<00:02:39.830> rear<00:02:40.190> wheel<00:02:40.400> is<00:02:40.610> disengaged

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
the rear wheel is disengaged

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.720 
the rear wheel is disengaged
because<00:02:43.540> if<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.380> were<00:02:44.530> forward<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.520> motor

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
because if it were forward and the motor

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.180 
because if it were forward and the motor
was<00:02:45.970> running<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.660> rear<00:02:46.930> wheel<00:02:46.960> spinning<00:02:47.530> and

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
was running that rear wheel spinning and

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.400 
was running that rear wheel spinning and
if<00:02:48.310> it<00:02:48.430> were<00:02:48.550> to<00:02:48.670> come<00:02:48.820> off<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.270> stand<00:02:49.570> we'd<00:02:50.290> be

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
if it were to come off the stand we'd be

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.390 
if it were to come off the stand we'd be
off<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:50.830> run<00:02:50.980> yeah<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:52.360> I<00:02:52.450> can<00:02:52.690> bring<00:02:53.200> like<00:02:54.100> a

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
off and run yeah and I can bring like a

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.510 
off and run yeah and I can bring like a
bicycle<00:02:55.560> coaster<00:02:56.560> brake<00:02:56.770> and<00:02:56.980> vice<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.370> play

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
bicycle coaster brake and vice to play

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:05.430 
bicycle coaster brake and vice to play
it<00:03:01.980> anyway<00:03:03.210> throttle<00:03:04.210> that<00:03:04.630> controls<00:03:05.080> Todd

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
it anyway throttle that controls Todd

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.140 
it anyway throttle that controls Todd
Reiter<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:07.680> yeah<00:03:08.680> I<00:03:08.950> mean<00:03:09.160> it's<00:03:09.370> all<00:03:09.550> fairly

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
Reiter and yeah I mean it's all fairly

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.010 
Reiter and yeah I mean it's all fairly
simple<00:03:13.290> by<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.380> time<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:15.550> got<00:03:15.730> your<00:03:16.000> bed<00:03:16.750> cops

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
simple by the time you got your bed cops

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.230 
simple by the time you got your bed cops
here<00:03:17.440> at<00:03:17.530> once<00:03:17.710> for<00:03:17.950> oil<00:03:18.160> once<00:03:18.490> for<00:03:18.700> gas<00:03:18.880> you

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
here at once for oil once for gas you

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.410 
here at once for oil once for gas you
just<00:03:19.420> turn<00:03:19.840> them<00:03:20.020> and<00:03:20.580> oil<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:21.820> gas<00:03:22.000> flow

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
just turn them and oil and gas flow

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.360 
just turn them and oil and gas flow
they're<00:03:22.630> spoiling<00:03:23.020> this<00:03:23.350> side<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.860> gas<00:03:24.070> on

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
they're spoiling this side and gas on

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.550 
they're spoiling this side and gas on
this<00:03:24.580> side<00:03:24.820> this<00:03:25.660> is<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:25.840> pump<00:03:26.230> for<00:03:26.710> the<00:03:26.830> oil<00:03:28.560> so

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
this side this is a pump for the oil so

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.740 
this side this is a pump for the oil so
the<00:03:29.710> viewers<00:03:30.040> only<00:03:30.310> aware<00:03:30.700> of<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:31.210> pressure

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
the viewers only aware of the pressure

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.040 
the viewers only aware of the pressure
as<00:03:32.050> you're<00:03:32.230> riding<00:03:32.350> no<00:03:32.680> you<00:03:32.860> don't<00:03:33.100> actually

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
as you're riding no you don't actually

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.710 
as you're riding no you don't actually
there's<00:03:35.050> the<00:03:35.800> the<00:03:36.580> motor<00:03:36.790> pretty<00:03:37.210> much<00:03:37.420> takes

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
there's the the motor pretty much takes

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.080 
there's the the motor pretty much takes
care<00:03:38.020> of<00:03:38.050> itself<00:03:38.500> but<00:03:38.860> as<00:03:39.640> far<00:03:39.910> as<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.060> oil

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
care of itself but as far as the oil

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.490 
care of itself but as far as the oil
pressure<00:03:40.480> goes<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:41.200> can't<00:03:42.040> get<00:03:42.160> that<00:03:42.310> back<00:03:42.520> down

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
pressure goes I can't get that back down

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.010 
pressure goes I can't get that back down
but<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.830> if<00:03:45.310> you're<00:03:45.550> up<00:03:45.700> going<00:03:46.270> up<00:03:46.360> a<00:03:46.510> hill<00:03:46.690> and

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
but the if you're up going up a hill and

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.250 
but the if you're up going up a hill and
the<00:03:48.010> bike<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:48.390> listed<00:03:49.390> upward<00:03:49.750> for<00:03:50.020> a<00:03:50.050> while

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
the bike is listed upward for a while

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.590 
the bike is listed upward for a while
you<00:03:50.470> do<00:03:50.620> that's<00:03:50.980> when<00:03:51.160> we<00:03:51.310> use<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.880> pump<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.480> I

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
you do that's when we use the pump and I

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.650 
you do that's when we use the pump and I
see<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:53.110> drive<00:03:53.440> is<00:03:53.650> engaged<00:03:54.010> it<00:03:54.640> goes<00:03:54.880> and

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
see that drive is engaged it goes and

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.450 
see that drive is engaged it goes and
you<00:03:55.930> can<00:03:56.110> control<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.560> speed<00:03:57.010> with<00:03:57.310> the

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
you can control the speed with the

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.750 
you can control the speed with the
throttle<00:03:57.940> or<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:58.540> advance<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.310> to<00:04:00.310> kill<00:04:00.580> it

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
throttle or the advance and to kill it

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.780 
throttle or the advance and to kill it
you<00:04:01.060> just<00:04:01.890> release<00:04:02.890> the<00:04:03.070> compression<00:04:03.610> in<00:04:03.700> the

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
you just release the compression in the

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.240 
you just release the compression in the
motor<00:04:04.110> by<00:04:05.110> turning<00:04:05.470> that<00:04:05.590> grip<00:04:05.830> all<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.130> way

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
motor by turning that grip all the way

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.690 
motor by turning that grip all the way
out

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
out

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.650 
out
you<00:04:07.540> can<00:04:07.690> also<00:04:08.070> disengage<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.340> drive<00:04:09.610> and<00:04:10.510> I

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
you can also disengage the drive and I

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.240 
you can also disengage the drive and I
was<00:04:10.840> when<00:04:11.140> I<00:04:11.170> was<00:04:11.350> riding<00:04:11.680> it<00:04:11.770> around<00:04:11.830> that's

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
was when I was riding it around that's

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.940 
was when I was riding it around that's
kind<00:04:12.640> of<00:04:12.700> how<00:04:12.820> I<00:04:12.850> was<00:04:13.210> going<00:04:13.930> kind<00:04:14.680> of<00:04:14.770> like

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
kind of how I was going kind of like

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.820 
kind of how I was going kind of like
driving<00:04:15.160> a<00:04:15.460> tractor<00:04:16.020> you<00:04:17.020> just<00:04:17.260> engage<00:04:17.590> and

driving a tractor you just engage and

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:18.740 
driving a tractor you just engage and
disengage<00:04:17.920> the<00:04:18.430> clutch

disengage the clutch
you<00:04:19.750> don't<00:04:19.930> really<00:04:20.140> control<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.680> speed<00:04:21.010> of

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
you don't really control the speed of

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.540 
you don't really control the speed of
the<00:04:21.220> engine<00:04:21.370> now<00:04:21.910> as<00:04:22.150> one<00:04:22.390> of<00:04:22.420> its<00:04:22.690> call<00:04:23.550> claims

it<00:04:28.720> was<00:04:28.900> a<00:04:28.930> rather<00:04:29.169> comfortable<00:04:29.590> bike<00:04:30.039> to

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
it was a rather comfortable bike to

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.240 
it was a rather comfortable bike to
riding<00:04:30.699> the<00:04:30.789> time<00:04:31.259> feel<00:04:32.259> box<00:04:32.500> centered<00:04:33.069> on

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
that it's one of these so enlarged in

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.589 
that it's one of these so enlarged in
many<00:04:38.259> ways<00:04:38.500> this<00:04:38.979> is<00:04:39.340> the

many ways this is the

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.580 
many ways this is the
great-great-grandfather<00:04:40.599> to<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.379> bikes

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
great-great-grandfather to the bikes

great-great-grandfather to the bikes
were<00:04:41.740> riding<00:04:42.039> today<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.550> bikes<00:04:42.759> were

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
were riding today and the bikes were

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.969 
were riding today and the bikes were
testing<00:04:43.330> him<00:04:43.449> at<00:04:43.810> our<00:04:43.870> own<00:04:44.229> website<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:44.949> I
