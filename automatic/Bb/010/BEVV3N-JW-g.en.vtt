00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.230
 very good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.140
 600 vertical episode that the truth 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.320
 is that I had you a little abandoned 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.070
 I had quite good gigs and Well 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.850
 here we continue 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.399
 and today I want to talk to you 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.940
 of material I'm going to talk about a 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:46.390
 backpack the salomon is the sense set is 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.120
 a super light backpack we are 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:54.000
 talking about 90 grams of backpack without 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.000
 include the the flash ie the 2 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.370
 these would be more than known from 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.610
 Solomon and it's a little backpack 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.040
 special last year he bought me 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.130
 to agree to transmit it since the year 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.130
 happened then I realized that 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.399
 really for there are many races that 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.630
 you do not need 12 liters not like I did 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:21.390
 last year of volume in the back 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.310
 there are careers where it covers 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.909
 practically with a fanny pack 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.800
 the obligatory material is worth then 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.819
 good is a special backpack we are going to 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.380
 talk about it as you see has nothing 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.240
 to put in the back I know 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.340
 really this is a vest instead of 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.909
 bring a fanny pack you are wearing a 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.190
 vest is worth but has us 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.659
 indispensable or what is necessary better said 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.369
 to carry the indispensable material 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.890
 that they demand of us in all those 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.640
 careers in which we do not need a 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.040
 windbreaker 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.960
 talented is a waterproof jacket 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.870
 a waterproof pants and a mesh 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.880
 otherwise 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.230
 if they are meat type transvulcania in 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.580
 the one that you demand the thermal blanket 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:11.150
 frontal one liter of water and you know of 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.350
 well that you will not see bad weather 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.510
 backpack that happens to the needs 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:19.330
 perfectly and we're going to get in 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.330
 matter if you see in the front 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.960
 It has two large pockets for 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.960
 flat 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.400
 of half a liter each included in the 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.950
 backpack 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.739
 so 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.200
 We have covered the water issue 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.350
 what else do we see in the front in 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.150
 our man the right 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.930
 we have a zipper pocket 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.700
 front in which we can put the mobile 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.650
 in my case always the license 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.700
 federative 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.940
 even the car keys what 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.940
 we want 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.400
 we also continue with this part right 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.980
 in a more than generous pocket for 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.010
 put all kinds of nutrition in 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.390
 gels sticks 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.300
 good change pretty 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.850
 we followed and right here in the part of 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.910
 cost what would be stuck to our 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.360
 our rib to our our 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.390
 dorsal we have more than already known 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.860
 side pocket of salmon in which by 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.470
 course mountain zipper 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.520
 vertical opening that makes it much more 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.490
 easy to open 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.120
 if you see the generous uncles in which 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.580
 the gloves fit 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.040
 at fault 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.690
 in which I too lime 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.510
 a bus 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.960
 what comes out of the pocket in which I've 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.960
 tucked also 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:53.230
 thermal blanket with replacement batteries 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.960
 for the front and where is also my 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:00.160
 I'll use front to back dump 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.160
 we go to the other side 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:07.410
 and has equally possible to put the 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.480
 flyer to the removed before a pocket without 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.280
 zipper which is also not bad 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.900
 option to put the mobile instead of taking it 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.480
 with zipper we all know that we 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.489
 like to take pictures of the 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.820
 landscapes where we run and in this 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.470
 side includes the whistle that is already 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.110
 Mandatory material as you all know 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.410
 on almost all faces in almost all not 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.630
 in all races 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.090
 fluid also in the backpack 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.600
 apart equally who was a side a 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.980
 pocket for more food 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.040
 Y 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.110
 in the other side pocket also of 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.760
 vertical opening 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.760
 the windbreaker enters 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:53.460
 is amazing from my point of view 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:56.479
 that in this thing in this backpack 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.479
 that for all that 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.870
 personal opinion I have already trained with 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.870
 she 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:05.299
 in this becomes 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:11.630
 good for telling us something else 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.660
 super breathable material and very very 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.000
 well all the possibilities of adjustment 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.990
 that offers you can you can regulate 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.300
 easily the height of each one and is the 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:28.090
 typical Solomon system with these 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.090
 Trimmings are really hooked there 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.750
 and basically it's like not wearing anything 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:38.230
 I repeat a 90 gram backpack in the 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.130
 what fits 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:44.050
 almost all good all the material 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:47.130
 necessary that asks us to demand the 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.130
 organization in a race 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.809
 you see 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.809
 I do not know anything absolutely nothing 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:01.990
 plus some extra material including 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.240
 food and be right back including food and 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.090
 the rest 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.979
 what to say about this backpack because it 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.080
 I honestly would not be the first 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.300
 backpack that I bought myself 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.360
 it's a very specific backpack and this is 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.449
 a very specific personal opinion for 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.639
 Careers do not have to be short 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:23.099
 but careers in which you know that the 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.590
 Mandatory material will get you in from 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.569
 You obviously need things 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.099
 light and now they are doing no longer 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:31.349
 only with talents but waterproof 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:33.270
 layers of super lightweight waterproofs 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:36.599
 then it would be a backpack that I 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:39.389
 would have as a second backpack or for 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:41.610
 trainings a little long if you do not 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:44.460
 like to go with your money or to 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.830
 very specific races as I say in the 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.250
 that do not require us some meshes 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:53.370
 waterproof and other good and little more 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:56.099
 I am going to leave the video the video 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:59.280
 of the training that I took with her the other 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:07:02.099
 day gave me a good beating of 5 hours and 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.029
 see you in the next one that already 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:05.029
 start talking about 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:13.729
 of my option when it comes to nutrition 

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:17.409
 before during and after the race 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:17.409
 see you in the next thank you 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.570
 Y
