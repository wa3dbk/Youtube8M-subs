amber and I figured out how to make most
of<00:00:06.359> our<00:00:06.480> time<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:06.839> washing<00:00:07.230> bottles<00:00:07.379> with

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
of our time and washing bottles with

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.850 
of our time and washing bottles with
some<00:00:08.490> equipment<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.500> solutions<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:10.710> we've

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
some equipment and solutions that we've

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.689 
some equipment and solutions that we've
come<00:00:11.580> up<00:00:11.610> with<00:00:12.469> so<00:00:13.759> first<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.849> all<00:00:14.910> we<00:00:15.599> use<00:00:16.670> bbw

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
come up with so first of all we use bbw

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.750 
come up with so first of all we use bbw
it's<00:00:18.480> just<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.779> general<00:00:19.560> all-around<00:00:19.949> oxygen

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
it's just a general all-around oxygen

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.840 
it's just a general all-around oxygen
based<00:00:21.080> cleaner<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.859> watch<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> bottle<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.760> do

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
based cleaner to watch the bottle to do

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.310 
based cleaner to watch the bottle to do
it<00:00:23.970> for<00:00:24.060> our<00:00:24.150> clear<00:00:24.330> bottles<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.840> for<00:00:25.080> wine

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
it for our clear bottles and for wine

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.830 
it for our clear bottles and for wine
bottles<00:00:25.740> here<00:00:26.779> and<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:28.470> also<00:00:28.650> use<00:00:29.539> stars'<00:00:30.539> and

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
bottles here and we also use stars' and

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.979 
bottles here and we also use stars' and
sanitizer<00:00:31.700> the<00:00:32.700> surface<00:00:33.059> statin<00:00:33.420> sanitizer

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
sanitizer the surface statin sanitizer

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.119 
sanitizer the surface statin sanitizer
so<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.530> stays<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.950> surface<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:37.230> keeps

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
so it stays on the surface and it keeps

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.479 
so it stays on the surface and it keeps
the<00:00:38.540> models<00:00:39.540> clean<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.559> sanitized<00:00:41.010> until

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
the models clean and sanitized until

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.709 
the models clean and sanitized until
they're<00:00:41.640> ready<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.910> bottle<00:00:42.059> with<00:00:42.300> update<00:00:42.629> so

to use these bottles here so we have
some<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:10.450> solution<00:01:11.049> of<00:01:11.170> ppw<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:11.860> water<00:01:12.040> and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
some the solution of ppw and water and

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.850 
some the solution of ppw and water and
here<00:01:12.460> is<00:01:12.580> really<00:01:12.909> warm<00:01:13.180> water<00:01:13.740> that's<00:01:14.740> why

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
here is really warm water that's why

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.950 
here is really warm water that's why
we're<00:01:15.039> the<00:01:15.130> gloves<00:01:15.399> because<00:01:15.700> ebw<00:01:16.539> hurts<00:01:16.810> my

hands and the water is really hot anyway

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.020 
hands and the water is really hot anyway
so<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:21.130> kind<00:01:21.399> of<00:01:21.490> shake<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.940> bottle<00:01:22.149> here

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
so just kind of shake the bottle here

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.480 
so just kind of shake the bottle here
just<00:01:25.030> to<00:01:25.780> get<00:01:25.899> off<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.140> debris<00:01:26.470> or<00:01:27.220> all<00:01:27.369> the

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
leftover residue of whatever was in here

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.660 
leftover residue of whatever was in here
before<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.520> just<00:01:30.909> dump<00:01:31.119> it<00:01:31.240> out

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.969 

and<00:01:36.479> then<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.870> this<00:01:37.280> attachment<00:01:38.280> here

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
and then we have this attachment here

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.380 
and then we have this attachment here
that<00:01:40.979> washes<00:01:41.370> the<00:01:41.520> box<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.909> rinses<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
that washes the box that rinses the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.070 
that washes the box that rinses the
bottle<00:01:43.340> we<00:01:44.340> had<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.610> get<00:01:44.729> an<00:01:44.820> adapter<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.600> be

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
bottle we had to get an adapter to be

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.980 
bottle we had to get an adapter to be
able<00:01:46.260> to<00:01:46.380> fit<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.800> onto<00:01:47.670> our<00:01:47.880> sink<00:01:48.600> faucet

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
able to fit this onto our sink faucet

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.920 
able to fit this onto our sink faucet
but<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.200> works<00:01:49.320> really<00:01:49.590> well

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.350 

it<00:01:52.680> works<00:01:52.860> with<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.580> wine<00:01:53.790> bottles<00:01:54.000> beer

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
it works with with wine bottles beer

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.030 
it works with with wine bottles beer
bottles<00:01:54.750> even<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> carboy<00:01:55.380> there's<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.740> lot<00:01:55.920> of

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
bottles even the carboy there's a lot of

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.270 
bottles even the carboy there's a lot of
water<00:01:56.250> pressure<00:01:56.490> there<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.110> then<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.410> just<00:01:58.920> dip

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
water pressure there and then I just dip

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.530 
water pressure there and then I just dip
the<00:01:59.430> neck<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.760> the<00:01:59.850> bottle<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
the neck of the bottle here in the

the neck of the bottle here in the
sanitizer<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:02.010> is<00:02:02.130> another<00:02:02.400> tool<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:03.750> we

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
sanitizer this is another tool that we

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.400 
sanitizer this is another tool that we
