perfect you want a time that shot
perfect<00:01:31.200> get<00:01:31.319> an<00:01:31.409> X<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.799> release<00:01:32.069> or<00:01:32.579> slightly

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
perfect get an X and release or slightly

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.249 
perfect get an X and release or slightly
late<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.420> don't<00:01:33.569> want<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.899> get<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.109> early

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
late you don't want to get it early

late you don't want to get it early
because<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.710> will<00:01:34.890> break<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.189> shot<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:36.149> is

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
because you will break the shot this is

now<00:01:37.890> we're<00:01:38.100> gonna<00:01:38.189> let<00:01:38.280> them<00:01:38.549> score<00:01:38.819> this<00:01:39.450> move

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
now we're gonna let them score this move

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.539 
now we're gonna let them score this move

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
actually has a high rate of making this

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.179 
actually has a high rate of making this
two<00:01:51.329> also<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.319> we're<00:01:52.439> gonna<00:01:52.530> post<00:01:52.740> don't<00:01:52.950> cover

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
two also so we're gonna post don't cover

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.969 
two also so we're gonna post don't cover
and<00:01:53.579> remember<00:01:53.999> that<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.299> was<00:01:54.450> passed

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
and remember that that was passed

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.749 
and remember that that was passed
automatically<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.219> would<00:01:56.369> never<00:01:56.520> get<00:01:56.729> that

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
automatically you would never get that

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.459 
automatically you would never get that
flex<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.569> pain<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:57.990> we're<00:01:58.170> gonna<00:01:58.259> back

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
flex in that pain so we're gonna back

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.889 
flex in that pain so we're gonna back
him<00:01:58.590> out<00:01:58.709> a<00:01:58.740> little<00:01:58.920> bit<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.670> know<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.090> get<00:02:00.840> my

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
little shimmy and you can see are you

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.539 
little shimmy and you can see are you
gonna<00:02:03.719> do<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.139> time<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.619> shot<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.429> I'm

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
said a surgery bucket is the best

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.530 
said a surgery bucket is the best
defender<00:02:26.159> on<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> game<00:02:26.609> this<00:02:26.969> is<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.180> Hall<00:02:27.510> of

Fame simulation so in ranked games this
were<00:02:30.269> probably<00:02:30.450> going<00:02:30.659> to<00:02:30.750> hydrate<00:02:31.079> if<00:02:31.260> you

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
were probably going to hydrate if you

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.410 
were probably going to hydrate if you
time<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.709> perfectly<00:02:32.129> you<00:02:32.579> have<00:02:32.909> the<00:02:33.090> time<00:02:33.269> just

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
time it perfectly you have the time just

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.559 
time it perfectly you have the time just
move<00:02:33.629> perfectly<00:02:33.840> or<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.739> won't<00:02:34.950> be<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.069> brick

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
move perfectly or it won't be a brick

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.970 
move perfectly or it won't be a brick
now<00:02:36.569> let's<00:02:36.780> go<00:02:36.900> see<00:02:37.109> when<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.260> plan<00:02:37.530> on<00:02:37.560> start<00:02:37.920> to

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
now let's go see when I plan on start to

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.319 
now let's go see when I plan on start to
show<00:02:38.129> you<00:02:38.189> guys<00:02:38.430> I'm<00:02:38.700> going<00:02:38.909> all<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.120> same

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
show you guys I'm going all the same

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.750 
show you guys I'm going all the same
simulation<00:02:40.230> as<00:02:40.349> you<00:02:40.469> can<00:02:40.620> see<00:02:40.889> and<00:02:41.159> I'm

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
simulation as you can see and I'm

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.300 
simulation as you can see and I'm
basically<00:02:42.540> using<00:02:42.930> virtual<00:02:43.439> dirt<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.980> Dirk<00:02:44.129> is

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
basically using virtual dirt and Dirk is

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.099 
basically using virtual dirt and Dirk is

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
slow to do a one I brought one in you

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.670 
slow to do a one I brought one in you
can't<00:02:48.510> do<00:02:48.629> for<00:02:48.810> our<00:02:48.900> one<00:02:49.079> in<00:02:49.260> but<00:02:49.379> I<00:02:49.439> rather

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
can't do for our one in but I rather

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.670 
can't do for our one in but I rather
just<00:02:49.799> do<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.189> three<00:02:50.430> out<00:02:50.609> -<00:02:51.569> you<00:02:52.109> know<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.590> can

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
just do it three out - you know you can

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.190
