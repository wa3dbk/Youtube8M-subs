00:01:34.888 --> 00:01:37.968
Overzealous at the prospect of a challenge,

00:01:38.168 --> 00:01:41.008
Rengar ambushed the monster in haste.

00:01:42.428 --> 00:01:45.348
It far outclassed anything he'd hunted before.

00:01:45.608 --> 00:01:50.708
Their fight was savage, and each suffered crippling wounds.

00:01:51.068 --> 00:01:55.648
Rengar lost an eye, but the most grievous blow was to his pride.

00:01:55.888 --> 00:01:58.568
He had never before failed to make the kill.

00:01:59.928 --> 00:02:03.368
Worse yet, the severity of his injuries forced him to retreat.

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:12.648
He was wracked with pain, but beneath it, he felt a glimmer of joy.

00:02:12.648 --> 00:02:14.103
The hunt was on.

00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:34.168
On his den's largest wall, he reserves a space for the beast's head,

00:02:34.168 --> 00:02:37.568
a trophy he swears will one day be the centerpiece of his collection.
