00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
set this is the rock quarry and Brewster

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.319 
set this is the rock quarry and Brewster
with<00:00:30.400> the<00:00:30.669> three<00:00:31.000> boulders<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:32.910> then<00:00:33.910> heard

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
with the three boulders and then heard

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.300 
with the three boulders and then heard
the<00:00:34.510> two<00:00:34.690> pieces<00:00:35.079> to<00:00:35.290> hold<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.680> bridge<00:00:35.920> and

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:43.190 
the two pieces to hold the bridge and
some<00:00:37.560> sides<00:00:38.560> to<00:00:39.750> keep<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:41.340> Train<00:00:42.340> on<00:00:42.370> track

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
some sides to keep the Train on track

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.710 
some sides to keep the Train on track
and<00:00:44.309> laughs<00:00:45.309> post

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.710 

then<00:00:50.350> we<00:00:50.650> have<00:00:50.980> a<00:00:51.250> bunch<00:00:51.520> of<00:00:51.640> trucks<00:00:52.060> as<00:00:52.450> you

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
then we have a bunch of trucks as you

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.030 
then we have a bunch of trucks as you
can<00:00:52.990> see<00:00:53.200> there<00:00:53.410> are<00:00:53.470> a<00:00:53.500> lot<00:00:53.620> of<00:00:53.650> tracks

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
can see there are a lot of tracks

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.240 
can see there are a lot of tracks
included<00:00:54.760> in<00:00:54.880> the<00:00:55.000> set<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:56.530> have<00:00:56.710> some<00:00:57.010> big

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
included in the set we have some big

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.950 
included in the set we have some big
pieces<00:00:57.490> and<00:00:57.790> medium<00:00:58.920> some<00:00:59.920> round<00:01:00.220> and<00:01:00.550> very

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
pieces and medium some round and very

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:10.719 
pieces and medium some round and very
small<00:01:01.960> ones

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.760 

and<00:01:10.820> there<00:01:11.450> are<00:01:11.509> more<00:01:11.719> than<00:01:11.869> one<00:01:12.110> ways<00:01:12.320> to

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
and there are more than one ways to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:21.399 
and there are more than one ways to
build<00:01:13.700> their<00:01:14.000> track<00:01:19.840> so<00:01:20.840> this<00:01:21.020> is<00:01:21.170> how<00:01:21.350> the

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
build their track so this is how the

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:33.910 
build their track so this is how the
finished<00:01:21.880> railway<00:01:22.880> looks<00:01:23.539> like

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.859 

this<00:01:34.580> rock<00:01:35.180> lie<00:01:35.509> is<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.400> starting<00:01:37.400> line<00:01:40.869> and

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
this rock lie is the starting line and

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.310 
this rock lie is the starting line and
then<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:43.009> train<00:01:43.310> comes<00:01:43.909> around<00:01:44.450> this<00:01:44.960> trunk

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
then the train comes around this trunk

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:54.639 
then the train comes around this trunk
and<00:01:47.020> over<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.170> bridge

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.999 

and<00:01:54.740> then<00:01:55.460> around

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.649 

and<00:01:58.159> under<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.180> bridge<00:01:59.450> and<00:02:00.280> then<00:02:01.280> stops<00:02:02.240> at

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
and under the bridge and then stops at

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.460 
and under the bridge and then stops at
the<00:02:02.930> rock<00:02:03.079> quarry<00:02:03.380> again

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.950 

as<00:02:09.530> you<00:02:10.160> can<00:02:10.310> see<00:02:10.550> there<00:02:10.790> is<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:11.600> light<00:02:11.990> here<00:02:16.960> so

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
as you can see there is a light here so

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.510 
as you can see there is a light here so
Brewster<00:02:18.320> is<00:02:18.440> arriving<00:02:18.860> at<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.220> rock<00:02:19.430> Roy

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.380 

with<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.820> stronger<00:02:26.330> are

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.360 

and<00:02:30.620> let<00:02:31.620> Brewster<00:02:32.220> stand<00:02:32.640> right<00:02:33.120> there<00:02:34.370> then

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
and let Brewster stand right there then

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:51.560 
and let Brewster stand right there then
you<00:02:35.670> left<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.210> border<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:38.280> went<00:02:38.550> inside<00:02:50.210> now

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
you left a border and went inside now

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.980 
you left a border and went inside now
you'll<00:02:51.930> flip<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.920> down<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.990> have

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
you'll flip this down and you have

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.890 
you'll flip this down and you have
booster<00:02:58.620> again<00:02:59.100> this<00:02:59.880> true<00:03:00.180> start<00:03:00.720> its

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
booster again this true start its

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:13.940 
booster again this true start its
journey<00:03:06.740> will<00:03:07.740> go<00:03:07.980> under<00:03:08.370> these<00:03:08.580> legs<00:03:12.950> around

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
journey will go under these legs around

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.730 
journey will go under these legs around
the<00:03:14.340> track

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:34.210 

up<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.610> bread<00:03:32.200> rooster<00:03:33.200> will<00:03:33.350> continue<00:03:33.950> F

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
up the bread rooster will continue F

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:48.100 
up the bread rooster will continue F
Jane<00:03:44.560> you'll<00:03:45.560> go<00:03:45.800> under<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.310> bridge<00:03:46.610> and<00:03:47.600> then

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
Jane you'll go under the bridge and then

00:03:48.110 --> 00:04:01.750 
Jane you'll go under the bridge and then

trail

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.920 

they've<00:04:51.920> numbered<00:04:52.370> all<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.730> pieces<00:04:53.000> so<00:04:53.600> it's

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
they've numbered all the pieces so it's

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.330 
they've numbered all the pieces so it's
easy<00:04:54.530> to<00:04:54.860> know<00:04:55.010> which<00:04:55.790> piece<00:04:56.210> will<00:04:56.540> go<00:04:56.990> where

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
easy to know which piece will go where

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.920 
easy to know which piece will go where
such<00:04:58.340> as<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:58.910> round<00:04:59.150> ones<00:05:00.040> and<00:05:01.040> say<00:05:01.340> 3<00:05:01.850> st<00:05:02.570> or
