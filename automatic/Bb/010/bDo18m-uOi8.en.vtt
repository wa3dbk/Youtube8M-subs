I<00:00:04.529> stayed<00:00:05.220> relatively<00:00:05.970> close<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.990> ABC<00:00:07.740> and

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
I stayed relatively close to ABC and

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.209 
I stayed relatively close to ABC and

bash<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.369> was<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.670> original<00:00:30.179> Bourne<00:00:30.420> shell

that<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.929> mostly<00:00:31.260> had<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.529> deal<00:00:31.679> with<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.099> then

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
that I mostly had to deal with and then

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.910 
that I mostly had to deal with and then
on<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> other<00:00:33.120> hand<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.600> C<00:00:33.780> language<00:00:33.989> which

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
on the other hand the C language which

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.979 
on the other hand the C language which
you<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.550> use<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.940> do<00:00:36.059> anything<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.780> want

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
you can use to do anything you want

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.750 
you can use to do anything you want
including<00:00:37.710> implementing<00:00:38.579> your<00:00:38.700> own

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760

including implementing your own
programming<00:00:39.270> language<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.469> all<00:00:40.590> takes<00:00:40.920> a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
programming language but it all takes a

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.190 
programming language but it all takes a
lot<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.219> effort<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.879> it's<00:00:42.300> easy<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.719> make

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
lot of effort and it's easy to make

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.590 
lot of effort and it's easy to make
mistakes<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:44.070> only<00:00:45.200> sort<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:47.059> come<00:00:48.059> out<00:00:48.090> much

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
mistakes that only sort of come out much

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.100 
mistakes that only sort of come out much
later<00:00:48.989> after<00:00:49.320> you've<00:00:49.879> already<00:00:50.879> implemented<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
later after you've already implemented a

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.400 
later after you've already implemented a
lot<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.980> code<00:00:53.190> you'll<00:00:53.550> realize<00:00:53.940> oh<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.690> should

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
lot of code you'll realize oh I should

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.630 
lot of code you'll realize oh I should
have<00:00:55.500> used<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.829> different<00:00:55.980> kind<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.460> data

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
have used a different kind of data

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.080 
have used a different kind of data
structure<00:00:57.030> start<00:00:58.020> over<00:00:58.289> from<00:00:58.410> scratch<00:00:58.649> that

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
structure start over from scratch that

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.970

everybody

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
everybody

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.090 
everybody
idea<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.739> part<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.240> ploy<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.900> get

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
idea in part was just a ploy to get

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.240 
idea in part was just a ploy to get
funding<00:01:08.100> from<00:01:08.400> certain<00:01:08.909> corners<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:10.010> I<00:01:11.010> may

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
funding from certain corners if I may

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.719 
funding from certain corners if I may
admit<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:13.070> one<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.280> reasons

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
admit to that and one of the reasons

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.100 
admit to that and one of the reasons
that<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.020> end<00:01:16.250> not<00:01:17.250> much<00:01:17.520> happened<00:01:18.110> was

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
that in the end not much happened was

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.310 
that in the end not much happened was
that<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:20.729> funding<00:01:21.210> turned<00:01:21.630> out<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.110> much

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
that the funding turned out to be much

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.679 
that the funding turned out to be much
harder<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.009> obtain<00:01:23.189> than<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:24.210> writing<00:01:24.450> a

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
harder to obtain than just writing a

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.399 
harder to obtain than just writing a
proposal<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.880> winning<00:01:26.880> some<00:01:27.659> contests<00:01:28.170> which

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
proposal and winning some contests which

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.010 
proposal and winning some contests which
we<00:01:28.619> all<00:01:29.070> did<00:01:29.369> successfully<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.570> getting

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
we all did successfully and then getting

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.109 
we all did successfully and then getting
the<00:01:31.229> funding<00:01:31.590> turned<00:01:31.799> out<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.340> be<00:01:32.490> still<00:01:32.880> an

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the funding turned out to be still an

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.630 
the funding turned out to be still an
impossible<00:01:33.869> hurdle<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.470> know<00:01:34.920> plenty<00:01:35.400> of

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
impossible hurdle I know plenty of

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.910 
impossible hurdle I know plenty of

to high school students at some level I

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.389 
to high school students at some level I
heard<00:01:41.430> recently<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:42.180> somewhere<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.720> England

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399

heard recently that somewhere in England
there<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.549> national<00:01:45.060> initiative<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.750> at

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
there is a national initiative that at

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.770 
there is a national initiative that at
least<00:01:46.049> considering<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.070> don't<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.399> how<00:01:47.780> sort

of how much that actually became a

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.050 
of how much that actually became a
definite<00:01:52.140> plan<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.740> teach<00:01:53.250> Python<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.909> all

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
definite plan to teach Python to all

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.969 
definite plan to teach Python to all
high<00:01:54.270> school<00:01:54.570> students<00:01:54.960> there<00:01:55.200> which<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.950> a

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
high school students there which is a

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.490 
high school students there which is a

great idea the wonderful experiment and
no<00:01:59.159> matter<00:01:59.369> what<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.880> outcome<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.810> lot<00:02:01.530> will<00:02:01.740> be
