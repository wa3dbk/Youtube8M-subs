00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
Hobby Lobby set the precedent on this

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.570 
Hobby Lobby set the precedent on this
case<00:02:25.140> before<00:02:25.380> hand<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:25.980> was<00:02:26.190> not<00:02:26.370> the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
case before hand this was not the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.380 
case before hand this was not the
reality<00:02:26.849> before<00:02:27.480> hand<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.290> was<00:02:28.560> very<00:02:28.800> simple

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
reality before hand it was very simple

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.260

secular<00:02:30.390> laws<00:02:30.770> override<00:02:31.770> religious<00:02:32.459> dogma<00:02:33.030> if

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
secular laws override religious dogma if

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.559 
secular laws override religious dogma if

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
that religious dogma violates the law so

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.080 
that religious dogma violates the law so

your employee about what's in their

your employee about what's in their

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
health plan because it violates what you

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.170 
health plan because it violates what you
like<00:03:15.110> it's<00:03:16.110> such<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.650> silly<00:03:17.069> idea<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.000> I

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
like it's such a silly idea and it I

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.050 
like it's such a silly idea and it I
mean<00:03:18.329> the<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:19.380> idea<00:03:19.620> also<00:03:20.220> rests<00:03:20.820> on<00:03:20.940> the

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
mean the I the idea also rests on the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.840 
mean the I the idea also rests on the
premise<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:22.410> employer<00:03:23.190> should<00:03:23.670> be<00:03:23.760> able

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
premise that the employer should be able

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.240 
premise that the employer should be able
to<00:03:24.150> manage<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.870> employee's<00:03:25.350> life<00:03:25.709> I<00:03:25.980> mean

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
to manage the employee's life I mean

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.530 
to manage the employee's life I mean
that's<00:03:26.400> like<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.730> employer<00:03:27.150> giving<00:03:27.450> the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
that's like the employer giving the

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.090 
that's like the employer giving the
employee<00:03:27.840> money<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.560> then<00:03:28.890> when<00:03:29.010> the

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
employee money and then when the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.550 
employee money and then when the
