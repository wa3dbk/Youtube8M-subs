00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
I think it costs less than ten bucks

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.620 
I think it costs less than ten bucks
because<00:03:44.080> it's<00:03:44.350> like<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:45.100> was<00:03:45.250> like<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.580> buck<00:03:46.120> 50

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
because it's like it was like a buck 50

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.390 
because it's like it was like a buck 50
for<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.900> bread<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:48.070> cheese<00:03:48.520> was<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.540> think

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
for the bread the cheese was I think

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
three dollars the pepperoni was like

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.380 
three dollars the pepperoni was like
four<00:03:55.390> dollars<00:03:55.750> that's<00:03:56.610> in<00:03:57.610> like<00:03:57.760> two<00:03:58.030> dollars

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
four dollars that's in like two dollars

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
for the marinara so that's ten dollars

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.260 
for the marinara so that's ten dollars
and<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.740> Magna<00:04:03.010> Mater<00:04:03.100> is<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.670> only<00:04:03.850> like

that's the first time you pay for it and

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.480 
that's the first time you pay for it and
then<00:04:07.270> every<00:04:07.600> time<00:04:07.630> you<00:04:07.870> pay<00:04:08.020> for<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.290> bread
