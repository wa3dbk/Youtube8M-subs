high humidity trouble with a lot of
Vanda<00:02:19.280> orchids<00:02:19.640> are<00:02:19.849> the<00:02:20.450> roots<00:02:20.690> are<00:02:20.959> just

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
Vanda orchids are the roots are just

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.559 
Vanda orchids are the roots are just
hanging<00:02:21.620> like<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:21.980> they're<00:02:22.849> not<00:02:22.879> actually

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
hanging like this they're not actually

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.839 
hanging like this they're not actually
in<00:02:23.750> any<00:02:23.959> kind<00:02:24.200> of<00:02:24.230> media<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:25.160> in<00:02:25.489> a<00:02:25.640> low

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
in any kind of media so in a low

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.699 
in any kind of media so in a low
humidity<00:02:26.420> situation<00:02:26.989> these<00:02:27.200> can<00:02:27.470> really

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
humidity situation these can really

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.920 
humidity situation these can really
desiccate<00:02:28.340> out<00:02:28.519> really<00:02:28.879> quickly<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.420> you'll

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
desiccate out really quickly and you'll

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.509 
desiccate out really quickly and you'll
find<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.260> vent<00:02:30.470> is<00:02:30.650> not<00:02:30.890> going<00:02:31.099> to<00:02:31.160> get<00:02:31.280> enough

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
find the vent is not going to get enough

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.850 
find the vent is not going to get enough
water<00:02:31.549> so<00:02:32.510> in<00:02:32.810> this<00:02:32.989> video<00:02:33.260> I'm<00:02:33.440> going<00:02:33.709> to

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
see that is what a healthier look like

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.570 
see that is what a healthier look like
with<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:02.990> good<00:05:03.259> active<00:05:03.830> growing<00:05:04.160> tip<00:05:04.370> right

with a good active growing tip right

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.650 
with a good active growing tip right
there<00:05:06.310> and<00:05:07.310> let<00:05:08.060> me<00:05:08.240> show<00:05:08.479> you<00:05:09.970> these<00:05:10.970> here

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
there and let me show you these here

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.320 
there and let me show you these here
this<00:05:12.169> would<00:05:12.380> be<00:05:12.410> an<00:05:12.620> unhealthy<00:05:13.130> root<00:05:13.520> tip<00:05:13.729> here

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.270 

see<00:05:17.330> if<00:05:17.509> I<00:05:17.659> can<00:05:17.900> focus<00:05:18.169> on<00:05:18.530> that<00:05:21.009> there<00:05:22.009> we<00:05:22.130> go

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
see if I can focus on that there we go

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.700 
see if I can focus on that there we go
so<00:05:23.030> that<00:05:23.060> is<00:05:23.180> when<00:05:23.389> an<00:05:23.509> unhealthy<00:05:23.930> vander

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
so that is when an unhealthy vander

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.330 
so that is when an unhealthy vander
orchid<00:05:25.159> root<00:05:25.310> tip<00:05:25.639> looks<00:05:25.909> like<00:05:27.009> where<00:05:28.009> it<00:05:28.190> is

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
orchid root tip looks like where it is

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.740 
orchid root tip looks like where it is
unhealthy<00:05:28.639> down<00:05:28.970> there<00:05:29.180> though<00:05:29.330> I<00:05:29.360> see<00:05:29.630> it

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
unhealthy down there though I see it

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.810 
unhealthy down there though I see it
starting<00:05:30.110> to<00:05:30.139> UM<00:05:30.409> grow<00:05:31.039> a<00:05:31.070> new<00:05:31.340> tip<00:05:31.580> just

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
starting to UM grow a new tip just

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.339 
starting to UM grow a new tip just
slightly<00:05:32.240> higher<00:05:32.419> up<00:05:32.659> so<00:05:33.560> that's<00:05:33.680> a<00:05:33.860> good<00:05:34.009> sign

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
slightly higher up so that's a good sign

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.689 
slightly higher up so that's a good sign
