00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.640 
I asked Jim to create a Mickey theme and
an<00:02:17.250> Oswald<00:02:17.700> theme<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.780> thing<00:02:18.989> is<00:02:19.019> it<00:02:19.290> had<00:02:19.470> to

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
an Oswald theme the thing is it had to

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.520 
an Oswald theme the thing is it had to
be<00:02:19.680> flexible<00:02:20.250> because<00:02:20.909> in<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.840> game<00:02:22.079> you

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
be flexible because in a game you

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.410 
be flexible because in a game you
changed<00:02:23.189> the<00:02:23.310> music<00:02:23.430> based<00:02:23.879> on<00:02:24.090> what<00:02:24.299> the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
changed the music based on what the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.229 
changed the music based on what the
player<00:02:24.629> does<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.590> he<00:02:26.220> needed<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.790> create<00:02:27.090> a

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
player does so he needed to create a

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.449 
player does so he needed to create a
theme<00:02:27.689> that<00:02:27.930> was<00:02:28.250> incredibly<00:02:29.250> flexible

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
theme that was incredibly flexible

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.670 
theme that was incredibly flexible
frankly<00:02:30.030> more<00:02:30.780> flexible<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.379> thought<00:02:31.560> was

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
frankly more flexible and I thought was

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.930 
frankly more flexible and I thought was
