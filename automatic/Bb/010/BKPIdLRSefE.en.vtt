building<00:02:21.460> right<00:02:22.180> from<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.570> very<00:02:22.810> youngest

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
building right from the very youngest

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.170 
building right from the very youngest
age<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.740> four<00:02:24.010> or<00:02:24.070> five<00:02:24.220> year<00:02:24.430> old<00:02:24.610> something

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
age is four or five year old something

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.090 
age is four or five year old something
that<00:02:25.450> we<00:02:25.570> used<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:26.020> consider<00:02:26.380> that<00:02:26.530> we<00:02:26.740> made<00:02:26.950> of

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
that we used to consider that we made of

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.980 
that we used to consider that we made of
considered<00:02:27.580> as<00:02:27.700> X<00:02:27.910> pros<00:02:28.210> as<00:02:28.450> being

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
considered as X pros as being

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.070 
considered as X pros as being
babysitting<00:02:29.770> but<00:02:30.250> something<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.300> changed<00:02:31.960> my

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
babysitting but something I changed my

babysitting but something I changed my
mind<00:02:32.320> very<00:02:32.620> quickly<00:02:32.890> when<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.520> saw<00:02:33.970> after<00:02:34.330> say<00:02:34.480> a

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
mind very quickly when I saw after say a

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.720 
mind very quickly when I saw after say a
couple<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.900> weeks<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.320> a<00:02:35.470> five<00:02:36.310> year<00:02:36.340> olds

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
couple of weeks of a five year olds

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.000 
couple of weeks of a five year olds
coming<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.120> programs<00:02:37.540> sounds<00:02:38.260> kind<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.740> crazy

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
coming to programs sounds kind of crazy

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.330 
coming to programs sounds kind of crazy

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
but the the advances and the progress I

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.790 
but the the advances and the progress I
made<00:02:42.460> was<00:02:43.030> pretty<00:02:43.270> astonishing<00:02:43.570> part<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.650> it's

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
made was pretty astonishing part of it's

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.800 
made was pretty astonishing part of it's
no<00:02:44.890> doubt<00:02:45.100> you've<00:02:45.430> got<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.730> do<00:02:45.850> with<00:02:46.030> learning

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
no doubt you've got to do with learning

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.830 
no doubt you've got to do with learning
code<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.380> cope<00:02:47.620> with<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.400> lot<00:02:48.970> of<00:02:49.120> activity

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
code to cope with a lot of activity

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.470 
code to cope with a lot of activity

there but one said that they got used to

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.730 
there but one said that they got used to
the<00:02:52.600> idea<00:02:52.690> of<00:02:53.020> being<00:02:53.170> out<00:02:53.320> there<00:02:53.500> with<00:02:53.620> the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
lots of traffic the progress I made was

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.660 
lots of traffic the progress I made was
pretty<00:02:58.750> mind-boggling<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.860> so<00:03:00.310> we're<00:03:00.580> doing

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
pretty mind-boggling and so we're doing

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.250 
pretty mind-boggling and so we're doing
for<00:03:00.940> one<00:03:01.120> moment<00:03:01.390> think<00:03:01.780> about<00:03:01.930> is

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
for one moment think about is

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.680 
for one moment think about is
babysitting<00:03:02.860> nowadays<00:03:03.430> we<00:03:04.180> certainly<00:03:04.450> think

babysitting nowadays we certainly think

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.320 
babysitting nowadays we certainly think
of<00:03:05.020> it<00:03:05.380> as<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.740> first<00:03:05.770> steps<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.610> a<00:03:07.090> good

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
of it as the first steps and a good

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:16.850 
of it as the first steps and a good
skill<00:03:07.900> development<00:03:08.320> program

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860
