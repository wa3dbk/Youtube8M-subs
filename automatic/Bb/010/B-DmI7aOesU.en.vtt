plans to fight two times this year and I
think<00:01:35.310> he<00:01:35.369> plans<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.759> fight<00:01:35.939> two<00:01:36.150> times<00:01:36.450> next

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.690 
think he plans to fight two times next
year<00:01:36.990> as<00:01:37.110> well<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:39.650> yeah<00:01:40.650> i<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:41.460> when

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
year as well and yeah i think for when

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.399 
year as well and yeah i think for when
it<00:01:41.790> comes<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.090> both<00:01:42.270> fighters<00:01:42.509> boat<00:01:42.960> pacquiao

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
it comes to both fighters boat pacquiao

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.200 
it comes to both fighters boat pacquiao
and<00:01:43.439> mayweather<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.979> think<00:01:44.250> 2015<00:01:44.909> will<00:01:45.119> be

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
and mayweather I think 2015 will be

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.240 
and mayweather I think 2015 will be
their<00:01:45.360> last<00:01:45.540> year<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.049> know<00:01:46.530> maybe<00:01:46.770> not<00:01:46.979> Floyd

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
their last year I know maybe not Floyd

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.330 
their last year I know maybe not Floyd
but<00:01:47.460> for<00:01:47.670> Pacquiao<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.149> think<00:01:48.360> definitely<00:01:49.340> 2016

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
but for Pacquiao I think definitely 2016

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.310 
but for Pacquiao I think definitely 2016
election<00:01:50.729> time<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.570> think<00:01:52.049> he'll<00:01:52.170> be

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
election time and I think he'll be

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.190 
election time and I think he'll be
running<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.159> Senator<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.750> Philippines

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
running for a Senator in the Philippines

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.069 
running for a Senator in the Philippines
and<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.920> think<00:01:56.340> he<00:01:56.430> will<00:01:56.579> retire<00:01:56.880> after<00:01:57.149> 2015

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
and I think he will retire after 2015

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.649 
and I think he will retire after 2015
and<00:01:58.290> focus<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.250> politics<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:02.000> Floyd<00:02:03.000> who

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
and focus on politics and Floyd who

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.330 
and focus on politics and Floyd who
knows<00:02:03.869> if<00:02:04.110> he<00:02:04.229> if<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.649> keeps<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.159> this

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
knows if he if it keeps on this

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.419 
knows if he if it keeps on this
undefeated<00:02:05.909> streak<00:02:06.320> he<00:02:07.320> might<00:02:07.560> continue<00:02:08.009> at
