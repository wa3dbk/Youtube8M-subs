00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
a mini review of the Animus i - wide

a mini review of the Animus i - wide
dromeda<00:00:07.819> I<00:00:08.320> really<00:00:09.320> want<00:00:09.440> to<00:00:09.530> pronounce<00:00:09.650> it<00:00:09.950> so

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
dromeda I really want to pronounce it so

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.800 
dromeda I really want to pronounce it so
give<00:00:10.850> you<00:00:10.910> a<00:00:10.940> little<00:00:11.030> quad<00:00:11.300> that<00:00:11.480> just<00:00:11.630> came

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:11.810 
give you a little quad that just came

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:19.870 
give you a little quad that just came
out<00:00:12.430> it's<00:00:13.430> kind<00:00:14.150> of<00:00:14.330> a<00:00:16.720> toy<00:00:17.720> slash<00:00:18.680> hobby<00:00:19.010> grade

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
out it's kind of a toy slash hobby grade

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.740 
out it's kind of a toy slash hobby grade
and<00:00:21.190> it's<00:00:22.190> pretty<00:00:22.400> cool<00:00:22.640> I<00:00:22.910> like<00:00:23.180> it<00:00:23.210> so<00:00:23.480> far<00:00:23.510> I

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
and it's pretty cool I like it so far I

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.779 
and it's pretty cool I like it so far I
got<00:00:23.869> it<00:00:23.960> a<00:00:23.990> couple<00:00:24.050> days<00:00:24.350> ago<00:00:24.550> works<00:00:25.550> good

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
got it a couple days ago works good

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.290 
got it a couple days ago works good
outside<00:00:26.770> looks<00:00:27.770> real<00:00:27.980> good<00:00:28.010> inside<00:00:28.490> I<00:00:28.940> think<00:00:29.270> I

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
outside looks real good inside I think I

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.480 
outside looks real good inside I think I
like<00:00:29.449> about<00:00:29.600> it<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:29.990> most<00:00:30.109> probably<00:00:30.890> is<00:00:31.100> the

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
like about it the most probably is the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.790 
like about it the most probably is the
battery<00:00:32.530> it's<00:00:33.530> about<00:00:34.120> it's<00:00:35.120> a<00:00:35.210> one<00:00:35.420> cell<00:00:35.800> 700

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
battery it's about it's a one cell 700

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.439 
battery it's about it's a one cell 700
but<00:00:36.890> you<00:00:37.010> get<00:00:37.159> about<00:00:37.370> 10<00:00:37.609> minutes<00:00:38.379> pretty<00:00:39.379> good

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
but you get about 10 minutes pretty good

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.579 
but you get about 10 minutes pretty good
pretty<00:00:41.449> good<00:00:41.569> power<00:00:41.929> and<00:00:43.300> also<00:00:44.300> it<00:00:44.600> is<00:00:44.659> you<00:00:45.440> can

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
pretty good power and also it is you can

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:47.860 
pretty good power and also it is you can
use<00:00:45.739> it<00:00:45.920> any<00:00:46.129> link<00:00:46.420> you<00:00:47.420> want<00:00:47.600> to<00:00:47.659> use<00:00:47.749> your

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
use it any link you want to use your

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.680 
use it any link you want to use your
radio<00:00:48.199> but<00:00:48.469> this<00:00:48.679> is<00:00:48.859> just<00:00:49.069> a<00:00:49.219> SOT<00:00:49.909> link<00:00:50.679> from

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
radio but this is just a SOT link from

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.039 
radio but this is just a SOT link from
one<00:00:53.690> of<00:00:53.780> my<00:00:53.839> heli-max<00:00:54.170> little<00:00:55.420> vs1<00:00:56.420> cam

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:57.049 
one of my heli-max little vs1 cam

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:59.590 
one of my heli-max little vs1 cam
whatever<00:00:57.519> it<00:00:58.519> linked<00:00:58.850> right<00:00:58.969> up<00:00:59.119> to<00:00:59.239> this<00:00:59.359> and

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
whatever it linked right up to this and

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.639 
whatever it linked right up to this and
I<00:00:59.690> kind<00:00:59.869> of<00:00:59.899> like<00:01:00.079> using<00:01:00.940> this<00:01:01.940> controller

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
I kind of like using this controller

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.590 
I kind of like using this controller
better<00:01:03.649> than<00:01:03.889> the<00:01:03.979> other<00:01:04.100> one<00:01:04.340> it's<00:01:04.540> kind<00:01:05.540> of

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
better than the other one it's kind of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.040 
better than the other one it's kind of
has<00:01:05.750> more<00:01:06.530> of<00:01:06.650> a<00:01:06.710> better<00:01:06.860> feel<00:01:07.160> my<00:01:07.310> hands<00:01:07.550> plus

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
has more of a better feel my hands plus

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.230 
has more of a better feel my hands plus
it<00:01:09.050> also<00:01:10.360> if<00:01:11.360> you<00:01:11.510> hit<00:01:11.660> this<00:01:11.930> button<00:01:13.150> see<00:01:14.150> it

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
it also if you hit this button see it

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.100 
it also if you hit this button see it
flush<00:01:14.980> it<00:01:15.980> actually<00:01:16.480> you<00:01:17.480> can<00:01:17.660> temporarily

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
flush it actually you can temporarily

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.220 
flush it actually you can temporarily
put<00:01:18.620> an<00:01:18.710> advanced<00:01:19.220> mode<00:01:19.610> which<00:01:20.600> will<00:01:20.750> let<00:01:21.080> you

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
put an advanced mode which will let you

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.010 
put an advanced mode which will let you
take<00:01:21.440> it<00:01:21.620> past<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:24.400> gyros<00:01:25.400> safe<00:01:25.820> access<00:01:26.810> but

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
take it past the gyros safe access but

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.060 
take it past the gyros safe access but
then<00:01:27.110> if<00:01:27.230> you<00:01:27.320> let<00:01:27.530> go

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
then if you let go

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.750 
then if you let go
and<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.120> gyro<00:01:29.390> is<00:01:29.570> kind<00:01:30.410> of<00:01:30.440> like<00:01:30.650> break<00:01:31.490> or

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
and the gyro is kind of like break or

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.580 
and the gyro is kind of like break or
whatever<00:01:31.940> you<00:01:32.150> need<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.270> be<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:32.960> write<00:01:33.500> you

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
whatever you need to be and write you

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.850 
whatever you need to be and write you
back<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:33.920> it's<00:01:34.010> kind<00:01:34.160> of<00:01:34.190> like<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.340> reverse

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
back so it's kind of like a reverse

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.930 
back so it's kind of like a reverse
panic<00:01:36.860> button<00:01:37.160> in<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.340> way<00:01:37.460> where<00:01:37.670> if<00:01:37.790> you're

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
panic button in a way where if you're

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.910 
panic button in a way where if you're
doing<00:01:37.970> something<00:01:38.510> you<00:01:38.660> want<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:38.870> do<00:01:39.050> real

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
doing something you want to do real

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.020 
doing something you want to do real
extreme<00:01:40.840> sideways<00:01:41.840> speed<00:01:42.290> or<00:01:42.560> flip<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.850> hold

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
extreme sideways speed or flip and hold

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.340 
extreme sideways speed or flip and hold
it<00:01:44.120> down<00:01:44.150> and<00:01:44.330> if<00:01:44.659> you<00:01:44.780> get<00:01:44.870> in<00:01:44.960> trouble<00:01:45.260> or

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
it down and if you get in trouble or

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.750 
it down and if you get in trouble or
you're<00:01:45.409> ready<00:01:45.620> to<00:01:45.680> start<00:01:45.920> let<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:46.340> go<00:01:46.520> it

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
you're ready to start let it go it

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.540 
you're ready to start let it go it
should<00:01:47.440> dry<00:01:48.440> out<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:49.010> then<00:01:49.130> play<00:01:49.280> with<00:01:49.340> that

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
should dry out so then play with that

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.460 
should dry out so then play with that
today<00:01:49.730> in<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:49.970> field<00:01:50.240> that's<00:01:50.960> another<00:01:51.230> thing

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
today in the field that's another thing

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.680 
today in the field that's another thing
outside<00:01:51.710> it<00:01:52.100> works<00:01:52.250> for<00:01:52.430> really<00:01:52.640> good

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
outside it works for really good

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.149 
outside it works for really good
pretty<00:01:54.650> pretty<00:01:54.920> quick<00:01:55.250> pretty<00:01:55.909> good<00:01:56.090> power<00:01:56.330> I

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
pretty pretty quick pretty good power I

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.890 
pretty pretty quick pretty good power I
tweaked<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.460> pitch<00:01:59.000> a<00:01:59.150> little<00:01:59.240> bit<00:01:59.360> more<00:01:59.630> on

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
tweaked the pitch a little bit more on

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.320 
tweaked the pitch a little bit more on
the<00:02:00.080> blades<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:01.820> seemed<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.510> fix<00:02:04.330> problem

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
the blades and it seemed to fix problem

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.039 
the blades and it seemed to fix problem
of<00:02:05.450> when<00:02:05.659> it<00:02:06.220> as<00:02:07.239> it's<00:02:08.239> coming<00:02:08.450> down<00:02:08.719> a<00:02:08.749> little

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
of when it as it's coming down a little

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:13.320 
of when it as it's coming down a little
too<00:02:09.200> fast<00:02:09.439> it<00:02:10.189> kind<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.459> wobbles<00:02:10.879> and

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.490 

that<00:02:14.330> kind<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.750> fixed<00:02:15.080> with<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.230> little<00:02:15.410> bit

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
that kind of fixed with a little bit

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.290 
that kind of fixed with a little bit
more<00:02:15.620> pitch<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:16.160> just<00:02:16.340> basically<00:02:16.880> took<00:02:17.120> them

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
more pitch it just basically took them

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.260 
more pitch it just basically took them
and<00:02:17.590> pulled<00:02:18.590> them<00:02:18.740> all<00:02:18.830> in<00:02:19.640> their<00:02:19.910> directions

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
and pulled them all in their directions

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.670 
and pulled them all in their directions
and<00:02:20.720> give<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.900> little<00:02:21.050> more<00:02:21.200> pitch<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.620> it

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
and give a little more pitch and it

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.580 
and give a little more pitch and it
