00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.759
 custom decorating the Christmas tree 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.589
 appeared in the middle ages then Christmas 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.870
 decoration were only with edible 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.280
 the cookies swayed on the branches next to 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.429
 fruits and nuts 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.220
 from the 17th century began to make 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.410
 spruce adornment gilded 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.189
 the bumps were painting empty egg 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.269
 shells 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.880
 The first Christmas balls appeared in 1848 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.710
 year in germany they were made from 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.320
 clear and colored glass and 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.230
 decorated with sparkles to this day 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.020
 technology of their manufacture by hand almost 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.149
 did not change at first you warm up the form 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.590
 you prepare then you warm up 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:47.040
 the blank you put the glass in shape and 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.000
 blow like every form 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.580
 different need to give a bump for example 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.510
 can be once and the bell is very 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.730
 many operations 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.370
 then we must first give her temper 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.610
 then beat off then skirt show smooth 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.710
 it was and then it is just starting to bend 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.080
 the case is very difficult dangerous 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.690
 temperature over 1000 degrees 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.570
 the most important thing to feel the moment when 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.210
 the glass became malleable and it succeeds 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.460
 only master amateurs like us 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.229
 see firsthand can 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.990
 create just something 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.630
 and then after several attempts at 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.930
 next stage painting of course too 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.869
 Manual was a very interesting order not 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.020
 I will call quite popular 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.979
 man of ours in the republic yes we are to him 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.180
 did a friendly cartoon that is brought 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:49.740
 us his photo we have this photo 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:52.380
 overpopulated ball and she was in such a face 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.920
 it would be over but a particular person all 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.750
 the rest did not finish pocky wow 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.750
 hobby up to specifically he was sitting there 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.590
 cigarette luxury billiards 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.240
 Yes, but it was very beautiful toy 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.149
 paint the balls step by step or otherwise 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.739
 speaking by color at first for example all 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.860
 yellow elements of the picture 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.260
 then all blue and red so on 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.900
 most varied from Christmas to 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.690
 the works of the impressionists are not loved 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.060
 There are no artists recognized 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.630
 in each picture you probably start 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.720
 fall in love and start and draw 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.480
 each artist his own handwriting and 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.730
 each turns out differently and that's why you 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.070
 do some with like with some of his 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.519
 probably the highlight is why the drawing 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.040
 looks a little different and if you 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.260
 don't like that i somehow rework 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.380
 but the most important difference from the factory 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.290
 products warmth of human soul and hands 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.260
 which believe is felt in each 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.489
 Christmas decorations too 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.709
 there is a fashion 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.630
 then there are toys in the shape of cones who 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.640
 icicles then bells 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.580
 but one species enjoys unchanged 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.510
 Demanded is the balls with the image of the symbol 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.640
 years this time it's a tiger cub elena 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.780
 Suvorov drank and not Ainars crow class
