polishing your nails and don't

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.990 
polishing your nails and don't
concentrate<00:04:28.680> so<00:04:28.920> much<00:04:28.950> on<00:04:29.400> that<00:04:29.430> and<00:04:29.820> worry

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
concentrate so much on that and worry

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.300 
concentrate so much on that and worry

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
and when you're done I would just take a

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.500 
and when you're done I would just take a
cleanup<00:04:34.950> brush<00:04:35.280> what<00:04:35.670> I<00:04:35.700> actually<00:04:35.910> use<00:04:36.240> is<00:04:36.390> a

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
cleanup brush what I actually use is a
