two centimeters there you go
now<00:03:01.780> I'm<00:03:01.870> making<00:03:02.140> these<00:03:02.230> quite<00:03:02.500> large<00:03:02.770> you<00:03:02.860> can

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
now I'm making these quite large you can

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.170 
now I'm making these quite large you can
make<00:03:03.190> them<00:03:03.340> whatever<00:03:03.430> size<00:03:03.760> you<00:03:03.940> want

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
make them whatever size you want

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.230 
make them whatever size you want
in<00:03:04.300> fact<00:03:04.690> when<00:03:04.930> my<00:03:05.050> mom<00:03:05.230> used<00:03:05.350> to<00:03:05.470> make<00:03:05.560> them

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
in fact when my mom used to make them

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.610 
in fact when my mom used to make them
mommy<00:03:07.240> used<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:07.390> just<00:03:07.600> get<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.750> knife<00:03:07.990> and<00:03:08.560> just

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
mommy used to just get a knife and just

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.830 
mommy used to just get a knife and just
cut<00:03:08.920> them<00:03:09.070> into<00:03:09.220> odd<00:03:09.550> shapes<00:03:09.910> just<00:03:10.210> works

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
cut them into odd shapes just works

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.080 
cut them into odd shapes just works
equally<00:03:11.320> perfect<00:03:12.630> but<00:03:13.630> I<00:03:13.810> kind<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.170> like<00:03:14.350> a

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
equally perfect but I kind of like a

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.220 
equally perfect but I kind of like a
little<00:03:16.090> bit<00:03:16.180> more<00:03:16.360> finesse<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:17.110> my

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
little bit more finesse to my

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.740 
little bit more finesse to my
presentation<00:03:17.760> simply<00:03:18.760> do<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.180> now<00:03:19.570> if<00:03:19.660> you

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
presentation simply do that now if you

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.240 
presentation simply do that now if you
don't<00:03:19.840> have<00:03:20.080> one<00:03:20.500> of<00:03:20.590> these<00:03:20.680> colors<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.100> can

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
don't have one of these colors you can

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.160 
don't have one of these colors you can
always<00:03:21.370> use<00:03:21.580> a<00:03:21.670> teacup<00:03:22.090> turn<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:22.870> upside<00:03:23.140> down

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
always use a teacup turn it upside down

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.290 
always use a teacup turn it upside down
don't<00:03:24.130> stab<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.370> little<00:03:24.550> bit<00:03:24.670> of<00:03:24.760> VAM<00:03:24.940> flower

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
don't stab it a little bit of VAM flower

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.230 
don't stab it a little bit of VAM flower
and<00:03:25.600> then<00:03:27.390> you'll<00:03:28.390> have<00:03:29.760> just<00:03:30.760> a<00:03:30.850> perfect

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
and then you'll have just a perfect

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.860 
and then you'll have just a perfect
color<00:03:31.800> flower<00:03:32.800> again<00:03:36.330> yeah<00:03:37.330> I've<00:03:37.600> got<00:03:37.840> a

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
baking tin here it's a little bit of

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.190 
baking tin here it's a little bit of
flour<00:03:40.150> in<00:03:40.270> there<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.600> make<00:03:40.690> sure<00:03:40.750> that<00:03:41.080> they
