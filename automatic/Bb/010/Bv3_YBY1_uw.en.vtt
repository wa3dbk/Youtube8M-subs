00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.260
 no matter what the village says 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.010
 you are a great young 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:28.040
 unfortunately I'm about to die 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:30.420
 but I will be one of other leaves and see the 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:35.360
 future for you 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.360
 I ask you please take care of yourself 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.280
 death 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.640
 I think I was too far away to be able 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.640
 see the future with these eyes of yours 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.670
 I'm a failure I was not able to protect 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.670
 I report and I'm still breaking my 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.660
 promises 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.660
 excuse me 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.479
 death 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.479
 sense 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.520
 I think it's time for me to join with 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.520
 cds 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.509
 that state here almost 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.270
 so you were here 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.360
 Now that you are here, you are going to tell me your 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.880
 true story 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.680
 Of course, it 's a long story 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.890
 so I'll take the time to 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.890
 tell him if it's okay 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.380
 good dad
