00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.479 
paint on the cranks is really delicate
like<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.720> just<00:03:22.620> wrote<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:22.980> around<00:03:23.190> for<00:03:23.430> the

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
like I just wrote it around for the

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.610 
like I just wrote it around for the
first<00:03:23.910> 5<00:03:24.209> minutes<00:03:24.480> when<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.840> got<00:03:25.050> it<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.350> paint

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
first 5 minutes when I got it and paint

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.440 
first 5 minutes when I got it and paint
already<00:03:25.860> started<00:03:26.459> coming<00:03:26.850> off<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.209> side<00:03:27.420> of

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
already started coming off the side of

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.440 
already started coming off the side of
the<00:03:27.630> cranks<00:03:28.140> but<00:03:29.070> it's<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.459> mountain<00:03:29.760> bike<00:03:29.940> so

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
the cranks but it's a mountain bike so

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.420 
the cranks but it's a mountain bike so
it's<00:03:30.690> probably<00:03:31.170> gonna<00:03:31.350> get<00:03:31.560> beat<00:03:31.830> up<00:03:31.860> anyway

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
it's probably gonna get beat up anyway

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.750 
it's probably gonna get beat up anyway
so<00:03:32.489> don't<00:03:32.880> expect<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.600> stay<00:03:33.810> perfect<00:03:34.760> the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
so don't expect it to stay perfect the

so don't expect it to stay perfect the
