00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.299 

all<00:00:05.609> right<00:00:06.120> so<00:00:06.569> now<00:00:07.050> that<00:00:07.080> you<00:00:07.439> have<00:00:07.710> your<00:00:08.040> cast

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
all right so now that you have your cast

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.950 
all right so now that you have your cast
on<00:00:08.639> now<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:08.910> need<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.210> learn<00:00:09.330> how<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.570> do<00:00:09.780> the

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
on now you need to learn how to do the

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.839 
on now you need to learn how to do the
knit<00:00:10.519> and<00:00:11.519> how<00:00:12.209> to<00:00:12.269> do<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.900> purl<00:00:13.429> now<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.490> big

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
knit and how to do the purl now the big

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.550 
knit and how to do the purl now the big
difference<00:00:15.240> between<00:00:15.269> knit<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.809> purl<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.350> that

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
difference between knit and purl is that

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.620 
difference between knit and purl is that
the<00:00:16.680> purl<00:00:16.890> creates<00:00:17.370> these<00:00:17.550> little<00:00:17.610> bumps<00:00:18.420> like

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
the purl creates these little bumps like

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.220 
the purl creates these little bumps like
this<00:00:20.000> so<00:00:21.000> there's<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.510> years<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.750> row<00:00:21.870> of<00:00:21.990> purl

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
this so there's the years of row of purl

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.180 
this so there's the years of row of purl
and<00:00:22.500> here's<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.980> row<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.310> purl

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.190 
and here's a row of purl

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.840 
and here's a row of purl
now<00:00:26.190> knitting<00:00:27.620> creates<00:00:28.620> these<00:00:28.770> little<00:00:28.850> V

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850 
now knitting creates these little V

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
now knitting creates these little V
shapes<00:00:30.410> so<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.590> see<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.770> have<00:00:32.009> two<00:00:32.189> rows

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.150 

and<00:00:36.870> basically<00:00:37.859> a<00:00:38.129> purl<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.089> created<00:00:40.100> by<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
and basically a purl is created by the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.279 
and basically a purl is created by the
back<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.909> knit<00:00:42.089> whereas<00:00:42.749> the<00:00:43.019> knit<00:00:43.170> is

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
back of the knit whereas the knit is

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:46.819 
back of the knit whereas the knit is
created<00:00:43.820> by<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.879> back<00:00:45.089> of<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.300> purl<00:00:45.739> so<00:00:46.739> we're

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
created by the back of the purl so we're

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.290 
created by the back of the purl so we're
going<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.980> show<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.190> how<00:00:47.429> to<00:00:47.460> do<00:00:47.730> each<00:00:48.030> and

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
going to show you how to do each and

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.149 
going to show you how to do each and
this<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> Continental<00:00:49.440> method<00:00:49.890> which<00:00:50.010> is

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
this is the Continental method which is

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:52.489 
this is the Continental method which is
the<00:00:50.190> method<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.699> prefer<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.179> knit<00:00:51.359> in<00:00:51.539> now<00:00:52.409> as

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:52.499 
the method I prefer to knit in now as

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:54.649 
the method I prefer to knit in now as
far<00:00:52.679> as<00:00:52.739> holding<00:00:52.980> your<00:00:53.280> yarn<00:00:53.519> a<00:00:53.760> lot<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.300> people

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
far as holding your yarn a lot of people

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.139 
far as holding your yarn a lot of people
are<00:00:55.499> very<00:00:55.559> specific<00:00:56.309> about<00:00:56.429> how<00:00:56.729> they<00:00:56.909> hold

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
are very specific about how they hold

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.360 
are very specific about how they hold
their<00:00:57.329> yarn<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.809> could<00:00:58.620> really<00:00:58.769> care<00:00:58.859> less<00:00:59.039> I

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
their yarn I could really care less I

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.099 
their yarn I could really care less I
just<00:00:59.550> want<00:00:59.729> to<00:00:59.789> knit<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.479> get<00:01:00.839> it<00:01:00.929> done<00:01:01.050> with

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
just want to knit and get it done with

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.469 
just want to knit and get it done with
so<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.469> say<00:01:01.829> hold<00:01:02.519> onto<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.879> yarn<00:01:03.149> harbor's

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
so I say hold onto that yarn harbor's

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:04.490 
so I say hold onto that yarn harbor's
going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.690> best<00:01:03.839> fit<00:01:04.110> you

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
going to best fit you

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.050 
going to best fit you
some<00:01:05.129> people<00:01:05.400> will<00:01:05.489> wrapped<00:01:05.700> around<00:01:05.850> their

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
some people will wrapped around their

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.730 
some people will wrapped around their

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.679 

so<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.049> hold<00:01:19.680> my<00:01:19.920> yarn<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.369> my<00:01:20.399> left<00:01:20.640> hand<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.570> do

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
so I hold my yarn in my left hand you do

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.060 
so I hold my yarn in my left hand you do
want<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.930> at<00:01:22.049> least<00:01:22.140> create<00:01:22.409> some<00:01:22.740> sort<00:01:22.920> of

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
want to at least create some sort of

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.859 
want to at least create some sort of
tension<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.909> your<00:01:24.119> fingers<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.479> there's

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
tension with your fingers so there's

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.420 
tension with your fingers so there's
good<00:01:25.079> to<00:01:25.200> at<00:01:25.259> least<00:01:25.409> pinch<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.950> thing<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
good to at least pinch the thing the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.760 
good to at least pinch the thing the
yarn<00:01:26.640> between<00:01:26.850> your<00:01:27.180> fingers<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:28.259> helps<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
yarn between your fingers that helps to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.999 
yarn between your fingers that helps to
control<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.700> better<00:01:29.820> now<00:01:30.469> this<00:01:31.469> is<00:01:31.649> our<00:01:31.799> knit

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
control it better now this is our knit

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.620 
control it better now this is our knit
so<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.430> our<00:01:32.549> knit<00:01:32.729> side<00:01:32.969> we're<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.479> knit

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
so on our knit side we're going to knit

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.139 
so on our knit side we're going to knit
on<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> purl<00:01:34.229> side<00:01:34.439> we're<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.799> purl<00:01:35.149> now

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
on the purl side we're going to purl now

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.730 
on the purl side we're going to purl now
this<00:01:36.359> is<00:01:36.509> our<00:01:36.630> first<00:01:36.659> loop<00:01:37.140> we<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> front

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
this is our first loop we have the front

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.069 
this is our first loop we have the front
of<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> loop<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:39.149> on<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> purl<00:01:39.570> side<00:01:39.869> we

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
of the loop and then on the purl side we

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.469 
of the loop and then on the purl side we
have<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> back<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> loop<00:01:41.090> when<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.240> knit

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
have the back of the loop when we knit

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.929 
have the back of the loop when we knit
we're<00:01:42.750> going<00:01:42.990> through<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.350> Sprunt<00:01:43.619> loop<00:01:43.939> it

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
we're going through the Sprunt loop it

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.779 
we're going through the Sprunt loop it
creates<00:01:45.570> kind<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.140> until<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.310> creates<00:01:47.700> kind

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
creates kind of until this creates kind

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.999 
creates kind of until this creates kind
of<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.090> hole<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> front<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
of like a hole in the front here the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.740 
of like a hole in the front here the
hole<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.880> where<00:01:51.149> you're<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> stick<00:01:51.630> in

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
hole is where you're going to stick in

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.459 
hole is where you're going to stick in
your<00:01:51.780> needle<00:01:52.369> just<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:54.170> show<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.229> it

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
your needle just like that show you it

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.099 
your needle just like that show you it
on<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.679> back<00:01:55.799> side<00:01:56.039> so<00:01:56.250> here's<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.579> hole

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
on the back side so here's that hole

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:59.260 
on the back side so here's that hole
sticking<00:01:58.109> it<00:01:58.200> through

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
sticking it through

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.990 
sticking it through
so<00:01:59.900> create<00:02:00.290> you're<00:02:00.979> kind<00:02:01.189> of<00:02:01.250> creating<00:02:01.490> a<00:02:01.759> bit

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
so create you're kind of creating a bit

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.090 
so create you're kind of creating a bit
of<00:02:02.180> an<00:02:02.270> ex<00:02:02.479> with<00:02:02.750> your<00:02:02.780> needles<00:02:03.259> with<00:02:03.920> your

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
of an ex with your needles with your

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.359 
of an ex with your needles with your
needle<00:02:04.610> shoved<00:02:04.909> through<00:02:06.759> this<00:02:07.759> first<00:02:08.000> loop<00:02:09.369> so

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
needle shoved through this first loop so

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.979 
needle shoved through this first loop so
again<00:02:10.870> and<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:12.020> also<00:02:12.170> helps<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.739> to<00:02:12.920> use<00:02:13.580> this

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
again and it also helps to to use this

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.479 
again and it also helps to to use this
thinning<00:02:14.989> out<00:02:15.230> of<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.470> needle<00:02:15.680> here<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.280> help

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
thinning out of the needle here to help

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.600 
thinning out of the needle here to help
get<00:02:16.700> your<00:02:17.300> needle<00:02:17.480> in<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:19.040> done<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.459> go<00:02:19.580> in

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
get your needle in so done it you go in

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.290 
get your needle in so done it you go in
from<00:02:20.030> underneath<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.690> loop<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.650> here's<00:02:21.860> the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
from underneath the loop so here's the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.460 
from underneath the loop so here's the
capital<00:02:23.300> loop<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.599> bottom<00:02:23.840> of<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.019> loop<00:02:24.110> runs

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
capital loop the bottom of the loop runs

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.410 
capital loop the bottom of the loop runs
through<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.890> bottom<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.390> front<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:29.090> see

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
through the bottom of the front so see

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.040 
through the bottom of the front so see
how<00:02:29.599> it<00:02:29.690> looks

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
how it looks

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.830 
how it looks
your<00:02:30.739> should<00:02:30.980> look<00:02:31.099> just<00:02:31.130> like<00:02:31.519> that<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:32.720> this

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
your should look just like that so this

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.699 
your should look just like that so this
is<00:02:32.989> your<00:02:33.140> French<00:02:33.440> that's<00:02:34.160> their<00:02:34.459> back<00:02:35.709> going

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
is your French that's their back going

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.620 
is your French that's their back going
in<00:02:36.940> just<00:02:37.940> like<00:02:38.239> that

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
in just like that

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.470 
in just like that
okay<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.400> kind<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.670> helps<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:41.000> just<00:02:41.239> kind<00:02:41.450> of

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
okay so it kind of helps to just kind of

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.850 
okay so it kind of helps to just kind of
pinch<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:41.870> right<00:02:42.080> here<00:02:42.350> to<00:02:42.500> make<00:02:42.620> sure<00:02:42.650> you're

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
pinch it right here to make sure you're

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
pinch it right here to make sure you're
holding<00:02:43.160> that<00:02:43.190> loop<00:02:43.430> on<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:44.810> take<00:02:45.049> your<00:02:45.230> yarn

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
holding that loop on you take your yarn

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.640 
holding that loop on you take your yarn
and<00:02:46.880> you're<00:02:47.360> basically<00:02:47.690> grabbing<00:02:48.230> this

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
and you're basically grabbing this

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.110 
and you're basically grabbing this
string<00:02:49.519> right<00:02:49.700> here<00:02:50.019> and<00:02:51.019> pulling<00:02:51.410> it<00:02:51.590> through

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
string right here and pulling it through

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
string right here and pulling it through
the<00:02:53.260> loop<00:02:54.260> that<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:54.709> just<00:02:54.890> came<00:02:55.190> through<00:02:56.140> and

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
the loop that you just came through and

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.890 
the loop that you just came through and
take<00:02:57.349> that<00:02:57.500> old<00:02:57.680> loop<00:02:58.390> kind<00:02:59.390> of<00:02:59.510> pull<00:02:59.660> things

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
take that old loop kind of pull things

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.180 
take that old loop kind of pull things
tie<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.260> on<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.530> new<00:03:00.650> needle

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
tie it on the new needle

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.849 
tie it on the new needle
try<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.209> again<00:03:02.569> scooch<00:03:03.290> up<00:03:03.410> your<00:03:03.590> work<00:03:03.709> a

pull it through

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.680 
pull it through
sometimes<00:03:25.310> that<00:03:25.489> helps<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.970> hold<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.390> on<00:03:26.450> when

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
sometimes that helps to hold it on when

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.130 
sometimes that helps to hold it on when
you're<00:03:26.810> getting<00:03:27.079> these<00:03:27.230> two<00:03:27.560> knitting<00:03:29.140> you

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.530 

and<00:03:53.850> that's<00:03:54.780> how<00:03:54.960> you<00:03:55.020> knit

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.570 

all<00:03:59.540> right<00:04:00.380> so<00:04:00.620> now<00:04:00.770> you've<00:04:01.010> gotten<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.490> the

all right so now you've gotten to the

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.400 
all right so now you've gotten to the
end<00:04:01.760> of<00:04:01.940> your<00:04:02.060> row<00:04:02.240> mine<00:04:03.050> looks<00:04:03.260> a<00:04:03.320> little

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
end of your row mine looks a little

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.730 
end of your row mine looks a little
janky<00:04:03.710> so<00:04:04.130> speeding<00:04:04.610> through<00:04:04.790> it<00:04:05.740> straighten

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
janky so speeding through it straighten

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.680 
janky so speeding through it straighten
it<00:04:06.890> out<00:04:06.920> there<00:04:07.340> okay<00:04:07.850> so<00:04:07.910> you<00:04:08.060> got<00:04:08.210> to<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.570> end

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
it out there okay so you got to the end

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.810 
it out there okay so you got to the end
of<00:04:08.840> your<00:04:08.960> row<00:04:09.140> now<00:04:09.890> it's<00:04:10.070> time<00:04:10.250> to<00:04:10.370> do<00:04:10.490> the<00:04:10.610> purl

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
of your row now it's time to do the purl

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.970 
of your row now it's time to do the purl
side<00:04:11.150> so<00:04:11.390> we<00:04:11.450> need<00:04:11.600> to<00:04:11.720> flip<00:04:11.960> our<00:04:12.290> needle<00:04:12.620> from

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
side so we need to flip our needle from

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.240 
side so we need to flip our needle from
our<00:04:13.160> right<00:04:13.340> hand<00:04:14.650> you're<00:04:15.650> going<00:04:15.770> to<00:04:15.830> put<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.130> in

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.090 
our right hand you're going to put it in
your<00:04:16.370> left<00:04:16.520> hand<00:04:17.560> then<00:04:18.560> you're<00:04:18.739> under<00:04:18.890> grab

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
your left hand then you're under grab

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.800 
your left hand then you're under grab
the<00:04:19.610> empty<00:04:19.880> needle<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:20.270> put<00:04:20.390> it<00:04:20.420> back<00:04:20.570> in<00:04:20.720> your

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
the empty needle and put it back in your

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.180 
the empty needle and put it back in your
right<00:04:20.960> hand<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.380> now<00:04:21.500> we're<00:04:21.739> going<00:04:21.860> to<00:04:21.920> do<00:04:22.100> the

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
right hand and now we're going to do the

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.910 
right hand and now we're going to do the
same<00:04:22.430> thing<00:04:22.700> only<00:04:22.970> purl<00:04:23.620> now<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.680> biggest

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
same thing only purl now the biggest

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.650 
same thing only purl now the biggest
difference<00:04:25.340> between<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.820> purl<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.420> knit

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
difference between the purl and the knit

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.870 
difference between the purl and the knit
is<00:04:26.870> that<00:04:27.380> you<00:04:27.560> hold<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:28.070> string<00:04:28.280> in<00:04:28.520> front

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
is that you hold the string in front

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.570 
is that you hold the string in front
whereas<00:04:29.660> when<00:04:29.870> you're<00:04:29.960> knitting<00:04:30.220> this<00:04:31.220> string

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
whereas when you're knitting this string

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.180 
whereas when you're knitting this string
you<00:04:32.210> hold<00:04:32.420> behind<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.930> needle<00:04:33.230> when<00:04:34.070> you're

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
you hold behind the needle when you're

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.920 
you hold behind the needle when you're
purling<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:34.940> hold<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:35.330> in<00:04:35.420> front<00:04:35.600> of<00:04:35.810> the

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
purling you hold it in front of the

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.810 
purling you hold it in front of the
needle<00:04:36.230> like<00:04:37.040> this<00:04:39.220> again<00:04:40.220> there's<00:04:40.460> no<00:04:40.580> real

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
needle like this again there's no real

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.060 
needle like this again there's no real
specific<00:04:41.330> way<00:04:41.450> you<00:04:41.510> should<00:04:41.900> hold<00:04:42.170> it<00:04:42.350> just<00:04:42.500> do

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
specific way you should hold it just do

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.320 
specific way you should hold it just do
whatever<00:04:43.220> is<00:04:43.430> comfortable<00:04:43.640> as<00:04:44.060> long<00:04:44.210> as

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
whatever is comfortable as long as

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.550 
whatever is comfortable as long as
you're<00:04:44.450> creating<00:04:44.810> some<00:04:45.050> sort<00:04:45.260> of<00:04:45.380> tension

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
you're creating some sort of tension

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.670 
you're creating some sort of tension
with<00:04:45.950> the<00:04:45.980> string<00:04:46.460> I<00:04:47.230> just<00:04:48.230> kind<00:04:48.410> of<00:04:48.470> wrap<00:04:48.650> it

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
with the string I just kind of wrap it

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.860 
with the string I just kind of wrap it
around<00:04:48.860> my<00:04:49.040> thumb<00:04:50.680> so<00:04:51.680> for<00:04:51.950> the<00:04:52.100> purl

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.750 

we're<00:04:55.830> going<00:04:55.950> to<00:04:56.010> take<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.460> tip<00:04:56.610> of<00:04:56.730> your

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
we're going to take the tip of your

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.000 
we're going to take the tip of your
needle<00:04:57.020> we're<00:04:58.020> still<00:04:58.230> using<00:04:58.380> this<00:04:58.650> front<00:04:58.919> of

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
needle we're still using this front of

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.740 
needle we're still using this front of
the<00:04:59.160> front<00:04:59.520> of<00:04:59.730> the<00:04:59.790> loop<00:04:59.910> only<00:05:00.120> instead<00:05:00.660> of

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
the front of the loop only instead of

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.810 
the front of the loop only instead of
going<00:05:00.930> from<00:05:01.230> underneath<00:05:01.530> we're<00:05:02.400> going<00:05:02.639> down

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
going from underneath we're going down

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.110 
going from underneath we're going down
from<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.150> top<00:05:03.419> and<00:05:03.690> through<00:05:04.020> so<00:05:04.910> here's<00:05:05.910> my

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
from the top and through so here's my

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.170 
from the top and through so here's my
finger<00:05:06.620> going<00:05:07.620> through<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.760> loop<00:05:08.910> like<00:05:09.150> that

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
finger going through the loop like that

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.210 
finger going through the loop like that
it's<00:05:10.110> essentially<00:05:10.590> what<00:05:10.710> you're<00:05:10.830> doing<00:05:11.070> with

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
it's essentially what you're doing with

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.590 
it's essentially what you're doing with
the<00:05:11.310> needles<00:05:11.669> you're<00:05:11.880> just<00:05:12.060> going<00:05:12.540> through

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
the needles you're just going through

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.550 
the needles you're just going through
the<00:05:12.840> loop<00:05:13.050> like<00:05:13.260> that<00:05:13.500> again<00:05:14.430> creating<00:05:14.970> that<00:05:15.120> X

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
the loop like that again creating that X

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.860 
the loop like that again creating that X
doesn't<00:05:16.560> hurt<00:05:16.800> to<00:05:17.010> pinch<00:05:17.610> it<00:05:17.760> in<00:05:17.880> place<00:05:18.090> this

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
doesn't hurt to pinch it in place this

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.470 
doesn't hurt to pinch it in place this
time<00:05:19.139> you're<00:05:19.260> going<00:05:19.350> to<00:05:19.470> take<00:05:19.620> your<00:05:19.830> yarn<00:05:20.480> wrap

time you're going to take your yarn wrap
it<00:05:21.660> around<00:05:22.040> so<00:05:23.040> you<00:05:23.070> can<00:05:23.400> pull<00:05:23.669> that<00:05:23.700> new<00:05:24.090> loop

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
it around so you can pull that new loop

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.270 
it around so you can pull that new loop
through<00:05:25.130> and<00:05:26.130> pull<00:05:26.430> it<00:05:26.520> off<00:05:28.070> tighten<00:05:29.070> the<00:05:29.160> work

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
through and pull it off tighten the work

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.680 
through and pull it off tighten the work
here
