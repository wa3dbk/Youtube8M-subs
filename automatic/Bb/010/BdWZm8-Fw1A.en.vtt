it<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.729> most<00:01:35.939> part<00:01:36.210> you

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
it is that you just the most part you

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.630 
it is that you just the most part you
won't<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> keyboard<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.009> mouse<00:01:38.130> that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
won't have a keyboard and mouse that

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.730 
won't have a keyboard and mouse that
being<00:01:38.909> said<00:01:39.150> my<00:01:39.810> opinion<00:01:40.170> might<00:01:40.290> change<00:01:40.560> with

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
being said my opinion might change with

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.730 
being said my opinion might change with
this<00:01:40.890> because<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.340> me<00:01:41.909> hooking<00:01:42.570> up<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.930> keyword

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
this because of me hooking up a keyword

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.100 
this because of me hooking up a keyword
a<00:01:43.860> mouse<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.340> later<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:44.970> but<00:01:45.450> we'll<00:01:45.869> see<00:01:46.020> how

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
a mouse to it later on but we'll see how

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.889 
a mouse to it later on but we'll see how
that<00:01:46.170> goes<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.399> most<00:01:47.549> part<00:01:47.750> it's<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
that goes but for the most part it's the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.289 
that goes but for the most part it's the
controls<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:50.159> not<00:01:50.369> as<00:01:50.579> responsive<00:01:50.909> as

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
controls it's just not as responsive as

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.139 
controls it's just not as responsive as
the<00:01:51.479> P<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.649> pit<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.700> not<00:01:53.880> as

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
the P it to the pit it's not as

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.569 
the P it to the pit it's not as
responsive<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.840> PC<00:01:55.290> obviously<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.369> frame

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
responsive as a PC obviously the frame

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.569 
responsive as a PC obviously the frame
rate<00:01:56.820> I've<00:01:57.420> been<00:01:57.719> watching<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.920> definitely

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
rate I've been watching it is definitely

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.940 
rate I've been watching it is definitely
different<00:01:59.700> because<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:01.229> game<00:02:01.380> runs<00:02:01.619> at<00:02:01.740> 30

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
different because this game runs at 30

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.789 
different because this game runs at 30
frames<00:02:02.130> per<00:02:02.369> second<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.960> if<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.380> guys<00:02:04.500> watch

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
frames per second and if you guys watch

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.580 
frames per second and if you guys watch
pc<00:02:05.790> game<00:02:06.000> plays<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.869> runs<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.229> lot<00:02:07.380> higher

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
pc game plays it runs it a lot higher

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.290 
pc game plays it runs it a lot higher
frame<00:02:07.979> rate<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.429> what<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.789> pretty<00:02:09.149> much

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
frame rate and what that pretty much

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.540 
frame rate and what that pretty much
means<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.780> games<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.470> lot<00:02:10.500> smoother<00:02:11.370> on

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
means is that games a lot smoother on

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.970 
means is that games a lot smoother on
the<00:02:11.760> pc<00:02:12.209> obviously

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
the pc obviously

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.089 
the pc obviously
I<00:02:13.010> mean<00:02:13.190> if<00:02:14.230> more<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:15.379> everything's<00:02:15.800> gonna<00:02:15.950> be

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
I mean if more so everything's gonna be

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.979 
I mean if more so everything's gonna be
superior<00:02:16.459> for<00:02:16.879> this<00:02:17.000> game<00:02:17.150> for<00:02:17.390> PC<00:02:17.780> because

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
superior for this game for PC because

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.570 
superior for this game for PC because
that's<00:02:18.409> what<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.799> game<00:02:18.950> was<00:02:18.980> meant<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.549> be

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
that's what the game was meant to be

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.360 
that's what the game was meant to be
played<00:02:19.700> on<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.450> this<00:02:21.019> is<00:02:21.140> more<00:02:21.319> so<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.590> Valve's

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
played on and this is more so of Valve's

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.789 
played on and this is more so of Valve's
interpretation<00:02:23.090> of<00:02:23.269> a<00:02:23.690> console<00:02:24.260> version<00:02:24.620> of

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
interpretation of a console version of

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.890 
interpretation of a console version of
counter-strike<00:02:25.489> and<00:02:25.730> albeit<00:02:26.269> it<00:02:26.480> is<00:02:26.599> a<00:02:26.629> damn

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
counter-strike and albeit it is a damn

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.930 
counter-strike and albeit it is a damn
good<00:02:27.170> one<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.560> honestly<00:02:28.159> thought<00:02:28.640> when<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:28.879> first

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
good one I honestly thought when I first

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.449 
good one I honestly thought when I first
got<00:02:29.330> this<00:02:29.510> game<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:30.410> was<00:02:30.530> going<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.769> be<00:02:30.920> kind<00:02:31.340> of

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
got this game it was going to be kind of

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.369 
got this game it was going to be kind of
shitty<00:02:31.700> that<00:02:32.299> was<00:02:32.360> more<00:02:32.599> so<00:02:32.780> just<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:33.110> sick

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
shitty that was more so just a sick

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.199 
shitty that was more so just a sick
twisted<00:02:33.590> experiment<00:02:34.430> that<00:02:34.580> turned<00:02:34.760> out<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:34.970> be

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
twisted experiment that turned out to be

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.410 
twisted experiment that turned out to be
a<00:02:35.239> shitload<00:02:35.660> of<00:02:35.840> fun<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.410> I<00:02:37.340> 11<00:02:38.150> little

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
a shitload of fun and I 11 little

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.350 
a shitload of fun and I 11 little
difference<00:02:38.780> between<00:02:38.840> PC<00:02:39.709> and<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.579> consoles<00:02:41.060> I

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
difference between PC and the consoles I

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.979 
difference between PC and the consoles I
don't<00:02:41.540> know<00:02:41.780> if<00:02:42.790> it's<00:02:43.790> just<00:02:44.060> me<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.870> this

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
don't know if it's just me that this

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.300 
don't know if it's just me that this
happens<00:02:45.440> on<00:02:45.560> pc<00:02:45.980> too<00:02:46.160> i<00:02:46.370> would<00:02:46.970> go<00:02:47.120> into<00:02:47.299> a<00:02:48.310> go

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
happens on pc too i would go into a go

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.830 
happens on pc too i would go into a go
into<00:02:49.489> arms<00:02:49.730> race<00:02:49.940> like<00:02:50.150> I'm<00:02:50.390> doing<00:02:50.660> right<00:02:50.690> now

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
into arms race like I'm doing right now

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.020 
into arms race like I'm doing right now
and<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.769> would<00:02:51.890> go<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:52.340> don't<00:02:52.519> know<00:02:52.640> if<00:02:52.790> other

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
and I would go I don't know if other

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.910 
and I would go I don't know if other
guys<00:02:53.299> had<00:02:53.629> arthritis<00:02:54.019> on<00:02:54.319> their<00:02:54.500> hands<00:02:54.829> or
