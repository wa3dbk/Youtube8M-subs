bulb<00:00:09.150> for<00:00:09.750> my<00:00:10.160> temperature<00:00:11.160> gauge<00:00:11.280> side<00:00:11.910> and

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
bulb for my temperature gauge side and

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:21.500 
bulb for my temperature gauge side and
puzzled<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.250> bought<00:00:15.030> this<00:00:16.220> w<00:00:17.220> 3w<00:00:17.940> b<00:00:19.010> p2<00:00:20.300> which<00:00:21.300> is

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
puzzled I bought this w 3w b p2 which is

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.070 
puzzled I bought this w 3w b p2 which is
the<00:00:21.660> bulb

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
the bulb

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.490 
the bulb
they<00:00:22.230> said<00:00:22.590> supposed<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.279> go<00:00:23.430> in<00:00:23.580> there<00:00:24.080> but<00:00:25.080> I

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
they said supposed to go in there but I

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.609 
they said supposed to go in there but I
am<00:00:26.279> totally<00:00:26.519> clueless<00:00:27.000> on<00:00:27.480> where<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.199> would<00:00:28.380> go

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
am totally clueless on where it would go

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.229 
am totally clueless on where it would go
for<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.689> temperature<00:00:31.309> as<00:00:32.309> far<00:00:32.759> as<00:00:32.940> changing

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
for the temperature as far as changing

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.830 
for the temperature as far as changing
your<00:00:33.510> bulbs<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.500> LEDs<00:00:35.190> these<00:00:36.000> already<00:00:36.540> have

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
your bulbs to LEDs these already have

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.619 
your bulbs to LEDs these already have
LEDs<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.860> there<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.309> nobody<00:00:38.850> really<00:00:39.149> explains

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
LEDs in there and nobody really explains

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.330 
LEDs in there and nobody really explains
it<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> e46<00:00:41.450> they<00:00:42.450> are<00:00:42.629> all<00:00:42.899> LEDs<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.860> they

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
it on the e46 they are all LEDs and they

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.150 
it on the e46 they are all LEDs and they
are<00:00:44.489> all<00:00:44.899> soldered<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.320> there<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:46.980> you're

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
are all soldered in there so if you're

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.459 
are all soldered in there so if you're
thinking<00:00:47.370> about<00:00:47.820> changing<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.930> blue

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
thinking about changing it to blue

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.850 
thinking about changing it to blue
lights<00:00:50.690> you're<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.289> there<00:00:52.530> for<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
lights you're going to be in there for a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.330 
lights you're going to be in there for a
while<00:00:53.190> soldering<00:00:53.820> all<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:55.170> these<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.010> your

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
while soldering all of these to your

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.459 
while soldering all of these to your
circuit<00:00:57.059> board<00:00:57.800> which<00:00:58.800> controls<00:00:59.579> pretty<00:01:00.059> much

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
circuit board which controls pretty much

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.770 
circuit board which controls pretty much
everything<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:02.219> you're<00:01:02.550> going<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.270> for

everything so you're going to be in for

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.899 
everything so you're going to be in for
a<00:01:03.809> huge<00:01:04.460> freaking<00:01:05.460> job<00:01:06.350> they<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.530> other

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
a huge freaking job they have other

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.760 
a huge freaking job they have other
videos<00:01:08.909> out<00:01:09.180> there<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.840> will<00:01:10.049> explain<00:01:10.530> on

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
videos out there that will explain on

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.810 
videos out there that will explain on
how<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.070> remove<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.820> from<00:01:12.240> your<00:01:12.450> vehicle<00:01:13.820> but

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
how to remove this from your vehicle but

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.060 
how to remove this from your vehicle but
none<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.240> them<00:01:15.390> show<00:01:15.720> anything<00:01:16.350> about<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
none of them show anything about the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.660 
none of them show anything about the
bulbs<00:01:17.580> these<00:01:18.270> things<00:01:18.630> right<00:01:18.990> here<00:01:19.670> I'm

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
bulbs these things right here I'm

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.649 
bulbs these things right here I'm
thinking<00:01:21.360> they<00:01:21.630> operate<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:23.450> they're<00:01:24.450> like

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
thinking they operate the they're like

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.420 
thinking they operate the they're like
motors<00:01:25.460> for<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.509> gauges<00:01:27.770> for<00:01:28.770> your<00:01:28.979> speedo

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
motors for the gauges for your speedo

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.649 
motors for the gauges for your speedo
your<00:01:30.299> temperature<00:01:31.020> gauge<00:01:31.790> your<00:01:32.790> tachometer

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
your temperature gauge your tachometer

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.390 
your temperature gauge your tachometer
and<00:01:33.689> all<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.200> there<00:01:34.560> are<00:01:34.650> no<00:01:34.799> bulbs<00:01:35.070> in

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
and all of that there are no bulbs in

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.590 
and all of that there are no bulbs in
there<00:01:35.659> so<00:01:36.659> I'm<00:01:36.990> thinking<00:01:38.270> I'm<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.450> gonna

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
there so I'm thinking I'm just gonna

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.100 
there so I'm thinking I'm just gonna
have<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.990> live<00:01:40.229> with<00:01:40.470> my<00:01:40.650> burned<00:01:41.009> out

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
have to live with my burned out

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.980 
have to live with my burned out
temperature<00:01:43.110> gauge<00:01:43.409> bulb<00:01:44.390> yeah<00:01:45.390> it's<00:01:45.689> so

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
temperature gauge bulb yeah it's so

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.020 
temperature gauge bulb yeah it's so
pretty<00:01:47.360> intricate<00:01:48.360> what<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.750> did<00:01:49.020> was<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.770> am<00:01:50.520> I

did what the guy said with the red
sharpie<00:01:54.390> pen<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.130> didn't<00:01:56.549> do<00:01:56.909> as<00:01:57.119> good<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.630> a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
sharpie pen but I didn't do as good of a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.530 
sharpie pen but I didn't do as good of a
job<00:01:57.780> as<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.619> thought<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.070> did<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.790> when<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.060> put<00:02:00.420> it

job as I thought I did and when I put it

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.310 
job as I thought I did and when I put it
in<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:01.430> spun<00:02:02.430> my<00:02:02.640> gauges<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.509> having<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.049> car

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
in it spun my gauges and having the car

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.089 
in it spun my gauges and having the car
look<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:05.369> junk<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.840> I'm<00:02:07.290> gonna<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.829> to

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
look like like junk so I'm gonna have to

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.820 
look like like junk so I'm gonna have to
try<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.000> do<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.390> again<00:02:09.869> like<00:02:10.259> if<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.590> look<00:02:10.679> at
