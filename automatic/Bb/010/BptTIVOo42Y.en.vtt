00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.770
 and because we write here 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.840

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.070

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.699
 opening as you see here in the console 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.710
 that was connected from up here and once 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.040
 that everything has been loaded so we're going to 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.610

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.329
 with our brothers or friends but 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.289

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.320
 interconnected if they are not connected 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:37.130
