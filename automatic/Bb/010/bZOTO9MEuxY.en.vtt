00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 the recipe presented is a recipe from 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.569
 buns made on margarine so everything 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.559
 first we will prepare the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.230
 ingredients 500 g pastry flour 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.820
 500 g of flour by choice or by force 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.500
 we can also see in the ass of 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.439
 hen on the left 20 grams of salt and in 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.699
 the right part 120 g of sugar 50 g 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.350
 of yeast that have been reserved in a 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.539
 container apart since I do not do it 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.369
 not put at the beginning of the kneading and the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.019
 13th that were broken using a 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.869
 second container is placed at the bottom of 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.130
 the tank and finally 500 grams of 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.079
 brioche fat that have been 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.520
 cut into small dice and set apart 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:42.149
 since they were finally incorporated from 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.620
 kneading so the first step of the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.680
 kneading egg shaving ingredients 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.149
 and the kneading of the first gear 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.320
 this first period of kneading in 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.449
 first gear we call 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.100
 age phrase actually allows to mix 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.899
 ingredients and to be able to stall 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.370
 our set ie to check if there 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.780
 had no mistake in the recipe or 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.430
 errors over time the weighings of the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.079
 ingredients is here to power and a 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.969
 down synaj using a liquid like 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.870
 for example, add one or two euros 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.689
 additional 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.820
 or else at lloyds of water or milk 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.880
 one can also counter phrasing himself 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.229
 added a certain amount of flour 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.450
 we will take care to do these two actions 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.710
 rather at the beginning of kneading either in 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.600
 early first-time times during the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.040
 braking to avoid incorporating 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.850
 flour too long after that ie 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.770
 at the end of the first or second 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.229
 speed when we could find 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.159
 pieces of flour mix badly 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.360
 the wrapped mix of the ingredients of the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.950
 very first ingredients were made 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.530
 of which we can come incorporated note yeast 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.259
 who will not be killed by salt 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.030
 at the beginning of kneading so it's a 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.740
 method among so many others I prefer 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.930
 do that but learn what will guarantee 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.189
 in fact afterwards 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.479
 accidents it avoids accidents in 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.829
 made of yeast burnt by salt we will see 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.320
 also to stay next to her 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.369
 blender this period of age phrases 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.810
 we can move a little later 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.640
 when the recipe is set and the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.170
 first gear will be launched but there we 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.820
 will need to corner our cube 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.780
 for but I have the ingredients that 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.920
 could restore and possibly 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.570
 at the bottom of the tank we can see that the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.829
 flour mix poorly it remains 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.479
 possibly stuck on the sides of 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.700
 the cub so the learner is var and 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.020
 stop his drummer and come corner the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.619
 bottom of his tank using his horn in 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.619
 rounded plastic 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.780
 always ensured in respect 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.610
 safety rules ie it 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.900
 extinguish the material they were in 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.090
 operation to gird the corner where 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.100
 allah or so to add the material 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.570
 oily or as soon as the blade needs a 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.190
 back item of utensils needs to 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.750
 go inside the tank we have to 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.310
 stop his equipment must be more in 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.050
 functioning and we have to stop on 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.640
 must wait for the complete stop of the arm 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.830
 before entering the interior of the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.420
 vat so will it be older aged one can 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.130
 throw his drummer in first gear 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.440
 always for five minutes to her of 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.850
 his minter so we can use these 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.810
 five minutes to go to ask 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.760
 possibly other ingredients 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.620
 of a next recipe how much then 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.090
 to prepare his 500 grams of material 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.709
 fat cut in small dice if they do not 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.709
 do not know if it was not done before 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.790
 so the character of the second 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.530
 speed we will only increase the 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.910
 speed variator and launched his 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.140
 15 minute timer 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.610
 so this is an example of recipes the 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.170
 first five minutes five first 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.480
 minutes first two speeds and 15 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.710
 second gear minutes so he's going 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.240
 be sure to learn from you 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.130
 serve your material without looking 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.660
 necessarily the drive controller and 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.580
 learn to observe the speed of your 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.200
 arm since from one mixer to another 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.690
 the number of second-minute laps 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.370
 speed can be different so more 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.700
 the more the apprentices' experience will be 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.230
 great 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.060
 learners will be great - they 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.800
 will need made to observe the speed 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.000
 of their lives there is their travelers 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.050
 but rather look at how 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.420
 have their paws inside 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:40.940
 their tanks so the dough and take off on 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.470
 sees a kind of amath ball not 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.980
 of formed around the arm in the center 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.510
 of the tank 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.670
 so we can proceed with the incorporation 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.900
 of fat so there it exists 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.950
 also several methods are to 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.720
 incorporation of fat 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.130
 of one time ie the 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.810
 whole fat but at 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.950
 inside the tank is when you can 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.810
 put it in several times 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.790
 or then there are people who 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.530
 stop the vat take out the dough and they 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.900
 have even incorporated the material through the 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.920
 hand on the top of their tower whose 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.900
 several methods exist 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.400
 the rule is the proposed method it's 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.900
 the corporation fat cut 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.310
 in small dice leave to temperature 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.720
 ambient or that they can soften 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.720
 is incorporated inside the drummer in 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.910
 only once so this method can 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.859
 to be good only if you keep a 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.239
 eye on his drummer and so regularly 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.370
 we're going to come to the fat corner 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.380
 for easy and on incorporation if a 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.220
 drummer speeding too fast 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.110
 that is to say second or third 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.190
 speed and that one does not observe his 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.360
 fat at the level of 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.590
 incorporation in his paw 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.210
 we will see a fat that does not 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.110
 agrees rapaz port that will stick 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.130
 on the sides of the tank 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.800
 it's called a pastry 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.460
 which burns so we'll have a brioche 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.320
 bad quality 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.910
 so you have to keep an eye 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.850
 on his drummer while of course making 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.480
 another job but it will have to proceed 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.680
 many times the same action 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.260
 that is to say, corner accumulate for 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.880
 facilitate some corporations so at the 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.590
 level of time on the timer we could 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.970
 see that it was three minutes that's 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.070
 theoretical if the fat well 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.720
 heard is incorporated before our 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.280
 paw at a good glutinous network and at the 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.080
 good temperature we can stop his 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.150
 drummer rather the opposite is also 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.620
 just that is if it misses a 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.940
 thirty seconds or a minute for 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.020
 that the dough is the right temperature 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.610
 can let the drummer turn a 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.840
 little minute more 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.699
 so here we see that at fat 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.199
 remained glued to the top right of the 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.129
 cub so here we go corner his material 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:18.360
 fat and to facilitate its 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:20.129
 incorporation so the learn should have been 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.360
 wait a little longer and maybe 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:23.159
 turn his drummer a tiny 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.990
 a little slower, which would risk my 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.610
 notice of having turned his temperature 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.539
 has increased its pasta temperature to 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.539
 above 25 degrees 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.650
 always kept here is a small eye on 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.630
 his paw he recognizes the bottom of the tank 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.080
 and kneading but she will soon 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.080
 be finished 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:50.369
 so our paw and take off our 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:51.599
 fat it is incorporated one goes 

00:05:50.369 --> 00:05:53.399
 to be able to stop his drummer 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:54.569
 pick up his arm there is also 

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:55.919
 several methods some people 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.899
 are going to throw flour lovers of the 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:59.309
 tank I do not do as wise esteem in 

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:01.049
 does the flour come to dry the 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:02.219
 surface of the dough and will make it taste 

00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:04.019
 more easily I prefer to work 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:05.279
 with flour on my work plan 

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:07.999
 possibly guys from my asshole 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:07.999
 but without excess
