00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:16.550
 Now we make really good cookies and 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:19.310
 Although comes with white chocolate coat 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.470
 and of course more gluten-free 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.930
 Here I have soft butter 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.910
 just prepare it 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.420
 room temperature then let stand 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.890
 the soft 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:38.100
 We give 100 grams of sugar and one 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.480
 little salt we want that in the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.480
 machine and stir that softly 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.850
 so now we have one here 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.590
 uniform butter sugar mass because 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.710
 this directory is now an important 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.510
 in the one that we for example 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.180
 smashed with a spoon and then 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.860
 enter gradually in because what 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.800
 can happen if it all here 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.930
 give that to me then the fat from 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.210
 recognizes and then the mass becomes so 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:28.680
 it's a bit weird that this is the one 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:33.090
 then the machine slowly stops 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.509
 because that's especially important here 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.960
 the mass is really nice and bright 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.420
 Of course that goes without saying 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.130
 even with a hand mixer if the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.810
 really good strong that can also with 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.600
 Just show the Chinese how 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.690
 that should look like now 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.070
 we are currently flavoring a bit 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.050
 you can either orange with 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.590
 sat down or put lemons he makes 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.410
 Behave is orange is important here 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.979
 So you really only have the outer shell 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.899
 finely grate and not the white one 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.289
 skin because bitter substances else come in 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:14.180
 the essential oils of citrus 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.560
 are really only in the whole city 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.740
 Now we have the white chocolate 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.209
 is here already melted ready 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.530
 how exactly one melts chocolate 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.530
 Bake can see here now 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.930
 I've got lukas here now 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:37.560
 sliver this is sugar with almonds too 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.360
 small pieces can be shaped if you like that 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.640
 now can not get in the single can 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.000
 you also white chocolate otherwise 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.280
 give 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.319
 how is that nice 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.480
 why am I doing this in now there 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.930
 there is still a bit of caramel in there 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.280
 Karachi effect while eating 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:00.660
 we painted mandl white here and 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.700
 I hazelnuts myself now because of me 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.680
 it tastes interesting who finds 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.940
 but now much so hopefully so 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.530
 I do not like it or I do not know 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.790
 maybe you are against hessen alone 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.090
 even his youngest can only let 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.410
 Almonds very important the good in free 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:26.430
 mail all free as it is now 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:28.440
 the day when i have heard the day and 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.290
 Check yourself out here is the 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.290
 consistency of the dough that can vary 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.780
 for example, after a size important 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.180
 Here is the gluten-free day that he 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.830
 really wet we leave that 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.850
 Cool now and still can 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.650
 subgroup mission 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.269
 I have two here now 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.780
 worked different hooks 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:51.510
 pack and swing here for the 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.010
 eggs and then for the dough if we 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.250
 now a hand mixer did he 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.870
 mostly to the spirals, too, that's the case 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.790
 how you want what then so 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.400
 a bit easier for the device 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.840
 then as I said for the states 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.260
 then take the high trowel and make 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.860
 that is to day now comes in the 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.150
 I pack a fridge in a foil 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.350
 Refrigerator we leave the cutter again 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.470
 a little bit out 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.760
 He is now so nice and soft for go 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.450
