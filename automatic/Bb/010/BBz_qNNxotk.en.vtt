00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
necessary so for the first team just

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.940 
necessary so for the first team just
take<00:01:12.270> out<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.600> new<00:01:12.780> mixing<00:01:13.080> bowl<00:01:13.289> and<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:13.740> just

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
take out a new mixing bowl and then just

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.590 
take out a new mixing bowl and then just
put<00:01:14.130> some<00:01:14.310> coffee<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.759> it<00:01:14.940> I'm<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.360> using

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
put some coffee in it I'm just using

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.020 
put some coffee in it I'm just using
this<00:01:15.869> boom<00:01:16.200> an<00:01:16.350> instant<00:01:16.920> classic<00:01:17.280> roast<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
this boom an instant classic roast and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.699 
this boom an instant classic roast and
this<00:01:18.390> actually<00:01:18.840> doesn't<00:01:19.050> have<00:01:19.259> an<00:01:19.380> exact

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:19.709 
this actually doesn't have an exact

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:21.380 
this actually doesn't have an exact
measurement<00:01:19.860> because<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:20.789> depends<00:01:21.240> on

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
measurement because it just depends on

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.419 
measurement because it just depends on
how<00:01:21.810> much<00:01:22.020> would<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.410> like<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.709> make<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.310> then

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
how much would you like to make and then

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:25.550 
how much would you like to make and then
just<00:01:23.640> take<00:01:23.819> out<00:01:24.000> some<00:01:24.030> body<00:01:24.509> lotion<00:01:24.990> I'm<00:01:25.259> using

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
just take out some body lotion I'm using

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.520 
just take out some body lotion I'm using
the<00:01:25.800> st.<00:01:26.099> Ives<00:01:26.450> naturally<00:01:27.450> indulgent<00:01:28.050> one<00:01:28.289> and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the st. Ives naturally indulgent one and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.350 
the st. Ives naturally indulgent one and
then<00:01:28.890> I'm<00:01:29.069> just<00:01:29.220> gonna<00:01:29.399> put<00:01:29.700> some<00:01:29.729> squared<00:01:30.240> on

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
then I'm just gonna put some squared on

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.969 
then I'm just gonna put some squared on
the<00:01:30.420> coffee<00:01:30.899> I<00:01:31.289> don't<00:01:31.500> know<00:01:31.560> if<00:01:31.649> that's<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
the coffee I don't know if that's the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.370 
the coffee I don't know if that's the
right<00:01:32.069> word<00:01:32.429> but<00:01:32.759> yeah<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.330> then<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:34.170> like

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
right word but yeah and then just like

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.960 
right word but yeah and then just like
the<00:01:34.530> coffee<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.039> doesn't<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.490> an<00:01:35.640> exact

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
the coffee it doesn't have an exact

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.150 
the coffee it doesn't have an exact
measurement<00:01:36.119> because<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.410> just<00:01:37.560> depends<00:01:37.950> on

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
measurement because it just depends on

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.949 
measurement because it just depends on
what<00:01:38.490> consistency<00:01:38.970> would<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.599> like<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.929> to

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:39.959 
what consistency would you like it to

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:42.260 
what consistency would you like it to
become<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.709> is<00:01:40.890> actually<00:01:41.369> optional<00:01:41.580> but<00:01:42.090> if

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
become this is actually optional but if

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.669 
become this is actually optional but if
you<00:01:42.300> want<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.750> protect<00:01:43.110> your<00:01:43.229> skin<00:01:43.349> from<00:01:43.500> the
