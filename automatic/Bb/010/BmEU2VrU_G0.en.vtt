00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:09.150
 we find myself with a hoarse voice 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.370
 so it annoys me so today I 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.460

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.780
 kraft year hunted but stalk these 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.460
 assumptions like a traced man 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.910
 problem except that it's the father's 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.000
 crack and it does not change strictly 1 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.220
 so be a multiple there is nothing that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.900
 really change who I think is 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.960
 really exactly the same thing so 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.520

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.160
 first you have to download a mass 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.239

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.059
 crack there you have to listen to the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.790

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.559

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.380
 bar in a dog I was typing 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:12.570

 I personally have a server that 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.069
 I like and who I advertise 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:57.250
 often even since then has always done 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:59.319
 more to say it's street etc 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.840

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.939

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:09.700
 really a great server what on one 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.189
 light servers that I had so 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.189
 it serves as a corner infection 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.580
