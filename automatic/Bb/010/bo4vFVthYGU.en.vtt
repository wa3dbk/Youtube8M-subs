 Option to decorate cakes and cold case 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.910

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.640
 fast and has a delicious flavor that 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.700
 pleases children and adults does not require 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.460
 sugar or cornstarch to extend cut 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:35.020
 the circle of marzipan that gives the area 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:38.110
 of the colca we fix it and we arrange the 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.260
 cupcake the milk marzipan is handled in 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.110
 3 consistencies consistency 1 is 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.600
 to cover cakes and place the 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.640
 consistency 2 that should be a bit more 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.880
 firm helps us to model figures 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.660
 flat or two-dimensional and the 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.320
 consistency 3 has greater hardness for 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.880
 model figures with volume and 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.920
 three-dimensional when they work with 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.680
 the hands seem to be 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.320
 working with plasticine and as you 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.840
 they are advancing in the handling of this mass 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.950
 they will realize that it is amazing and 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.250
 It is also very delicious 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.630
 the wings are made of unflavored gelatin 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.450
 that melts 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.259
 and a sheet is formed when it dries 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.460
 they cut and so we can embed them for 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.460
 stimulate the wings 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.860
 I invite you to do the marzipan course 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.720
 where they will learn from the most basic and 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.960
 they can make their own creations 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.960
 they will do this and many other things more
