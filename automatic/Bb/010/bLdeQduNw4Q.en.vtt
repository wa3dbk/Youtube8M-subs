information in one view so it's really a
very<00:01:25.979> fun<00:01:26.979> communication<00:01:27.820> application<00:01:28.540> on

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
very fun communication application on

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.560 
very fun communication application on
the<00:01:29.530> other<00:01:29.650> hand<00:01:29.770> media<00:01:30.220> escape<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:31.180> focus

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
the other hand media escape the focus

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.260 
the other hand media escape the focus
there<00:01:31.810> is<00:01:32.020> on<00:01:32.259> media<00:01:32.649> as<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.880> name<00:01:34.060> suggests

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
there is on media as the name suggests

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.240 
there is on media as the name suggests
so<00:01:35.110> this<00:01:35.320> is<00:01:35.470> an<00:01:35.590> application<00:01:35.829> that

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
so this is an application that

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.130 
so this is an application that
aggregates<00:01:37.060> or<00:01:37.329> blurs<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.689> boundaries

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
aggregates or blurs the boundaries

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.260 
aggregates or blurs the boundaries
between<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.799> different<00:01:39.159> media<00:01:39.520> experiences

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
between the different media experiences

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.260 
between the different media experiences
in<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.570> handset<00:01:40.960> so<00:01:41.290> it's<00:01:41.470> about<00:01:41.619> accessing

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
in the handset so it's about accessing

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.510
