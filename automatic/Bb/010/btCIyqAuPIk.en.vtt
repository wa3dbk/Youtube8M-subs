 because in this video I will show you the 15 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.940
 products we use every day 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.219
 then we start from the shower there is the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.440
 first thing I do is the shower that is 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.780
 products closed 15 products closed of 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.590
 plus the sonic clay and you know it 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.539
 all and the used adoro used can be said 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.170
 the golden one 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.479
 I love using it as this product of 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.159
 shiseido that I like crazy 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.380
 which no longer ends had to be a 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.770
 sample but it will never end 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.119
 second month third month I don't know this 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.939
 here of the line the holes and precisely a 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.549
 gentle cleansing product for the face 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.110
 I adore the first few times madly 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.990
 I used to feel my own skin 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.710
 which was swish even though it was never 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.450
 never pulled to the skin never dry 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.540
 dry but perfect for my opinion 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.220
 I might not even put the cream after and 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.170
 so these are the products here 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.250
 I always love that I always use all the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.399
 days in the shower 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:49.680
 then when I go out of the shower what I do 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.930
 use water all over my face 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.970

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.729

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.540
 very much the half precisely on the pad 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.819
 of cotton passed it under the business 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.640
 on the eyes just to give an extra 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.850
 botta of 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.380
 of cleaning though honestly not 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.160
 would also be useful for those who remove make- up 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.650
 evening 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.160
 I use multi sonic and then use this though 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:26.360
 now is my ritual immediately after 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:30.280
 what i do put to nine in the shower 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.500

 the kingdom ricky foam not only the milan 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.630
 face but I also wash this body 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.319
 Mediterranean also this is enough xvi of the 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.120
 norm and I propose will be in the finished products 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.640
 Mediterranean nature and honey 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.340
 acacia a bathroom shower 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.360
 crazy there is this line is the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.580
 Cocoa butter that I love the hand cream there is 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.120
 the hand cream the soap hands this 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.959
 I love the whole line because I love it 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:06.350
 name believe in the scent of honey e 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.930
 this is a scent of flowers and flowers 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.480
 honey that something delicious and 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.840
 so I use this step between showers then 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.290
 precisely when they left the house goes 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.660
 already use moisturizers and what this 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.829
 this is my skin that is routine and 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.670
 now 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:28.190
 and it is precisely that of gvc the smile is a 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.950
 and this is where the serum is 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.180
 here and the cream always the same smile is a 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.760
 and for ten steps now I put it from 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.540
 part serum what i'm using di 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.560
 shiseido because then I'll make a video where 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.260
 I will explain everything to you 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.030
 so be alert, you who pin 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.730
 in the high asked the video on the serum 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.269
 that of shiseido and nothing therefore use 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.730
 these two as a facial moisturizer then 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:01.579
 I wash my teeth and I love this 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:05.299
 do not listen to those who say they use i 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:08.690
 Abrasive whitening toothpastes are 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.000
 too much too strong for the enamel 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.549
 romina of teeth makes ruin me 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.799
 the tooth enamel instead use these 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.269
 products that do the opposite ie that 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.879
 they go to 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.800
 to fill all the various writing comb 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:26.050
 that could have your tooth 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.939
 just to avoid loved ones and so on 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:35.439
 that is better a non-white tooth 10 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:40.090
 massano that not white 8 yes no 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:42.430
 better white people 8 reddish than not 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.889
 white 10 but maybe with cavities 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:49.110
 because by dint of using abrasive thing 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.110
 with cap on the brazilian line the bicarbonate 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.789
 you destroy the teeth and we have only bodies 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.430
 these very careful states therefore I use 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:00.819
 of gold for use both this can and 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.680
 I have been using it for years and years 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:05.199
 I therefore very well prefer 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.810
 products that cure al dente more than 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:10.029
 whiten al dente 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.879
 definitely dentist or dentist e 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:17.080
 listen to write below and say the 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:18.310
 yours on these things then I use the 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.229
 deodorant 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.599
 I'm using this almost now 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:25.300
 Mediterranean and lavender during 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.839
 spray as I told you in another video 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.210
 it does n't taste like talcum powder 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:34.599
 and to this delicious fragrance of 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.289
 cool of baby clean making me 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:39.310
 go crazy 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:44.800
 so this then when I have hair 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:47.370
 curly use this which is the god john of the dry 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.960

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.080
 even if liquid such as if you can 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.839
 the foam to refresh my curls 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.000
 and instead when I'm smooth I use this 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:00.879
