00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
this week well we're going skydiving and

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.609 
this week well we're going skydiving and
you<00:02:00.390> may<00:02:00.540> ask<00:02:00.719> why<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.079> black<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.469> white

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
you may ask why is it black and white

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.889 
you may ask why is it black and white
but<00:02:01.740> I'm<00:02:01.829> gonna<00:02:01.920> get<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.340> get<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.780> a

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
but I'm gonna get that get to that in a

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.800 
but I'm gonna get that get to that in a
minute<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.890> here<00:02:05.610> they're<00:02:05.790> walking<00:02:06.299> towards

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
minute but here they're walking towards

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.080 
minute but here they're walking towards
the<00:02:06.990> plane<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:08.310> know<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:08.940> like

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
the plane you know it's just like

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.300 
the plane you know it's just like
they're<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.840> away<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.500> then<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.800> like<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
they're going away and then I like the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.920 
they're going away and then I like the
fact<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:11.790> cone<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.450> here

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
fact that this cone is here

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.140 
fact that this cone is here
and<00:02:13.019> and<00:02:13.500> also<00:02:13.799> they're<00:02:14.099> not<00:02:14.220> centered<00:02:14.790> when

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
and and also they're not centered when

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.149 
and and also they're not centered when
we<00:02:15.239> talk<00:02:15.450> about<00:02:15.480> composition<00:02:16.079> they're<00:02:16.920> not

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
we talk about composition they're not

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.350 
we talk about composition they're not
centered<00:02:17.640> right<00:02:17.819> in<00:02:17.939> the<00:02:18.030> middle<00:02:18.180> I'm<00:02:18.329> going

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
centered right in the middle I'm going

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.330 
centered right in the middle I'm going
to<00:02:18.540> use<00:02:18.689> this<00:02:18.930> I'm<00:02:19.170> not<00:02:19.349> going<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.560> crop<00:02:19.799> but

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
to use this I'm not going to crop but

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.710 
to use this I'm not going to crop but
here<00:02:20.549> it's<00:02:20.670> how<00:02:20.849> you<00:02:20.909> see<00:02:21.150> how<00:02:21.239> its<00:02:21.390> split

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
here it's how you see how its split

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.470 
here it's how you see how its split
they're<00:02:22.379> not<00:02:22.560> right<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.370> middle<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:23.730> it's

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
they're not right in the middle so it's

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.420 
they're not right in the middle so it's
balanced<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.200> little<00:02:25.530> bit<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.890> left<00:02:26.129> by<00:02:26.400> the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
balanced a little bit on the left by the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.399 
balanced a little bit on the left by the
cone<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.420> little<00:02:27.689> bit<00:02:27.810> on<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.049> right<00:02:28.230> by

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
cone and a little bit on the right by

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.979 
cone and a little bit on the right by
this<00:02:28.470> sign<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.450> let's<00:02:30.450> take<00:02:30.629> a<00:02:30.659> look<00:02:30.840> at<00:02:30.900> the

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
this sign and let's take a look at the

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:31.690 
this sign and let's take a look at the
sign

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
sign

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.520 
sign
you<00:02:32.700> know<00:02:32.819> skydiving<00:02:33.480> orange<00:02:33.870> no<00:02:34.109> spectators

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
you know skydiving orange no spectators

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.259 
you know skydiving orange no spectators
beyond<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.159> point<00:02:35.370> spinning<00:02:35.909> propeller

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
beyond this point spinning propeller

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.729 
beyond this point spinning propeller
will<00:02:36.540> chop<00:02:36.870> your<00:02:37.079> head<00:02:37.319> off

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
will chop your head off

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.979 
will chop your head off
yeah<00:02:38.129> that's<00:02:38.640> cool<00:02:38.970> that's<00:02:39.329> cool<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.750> have<00:02:39.870> in

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
yeah that's cool that's cool to have in

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.869 
yeah that's cool that's cool to have in
there<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.260> they're<00:02:40.409> beyond<00:02:40.769> that<00:02:41.099> point<00:02:41.430> you

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
there so they're beyond that point you

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.849 
there so they're beyond that point you
know<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.239> didn't<00:02:42.659> plan<00:02:42.689> on<00:02:43.109> having<00:02:43.290> them<00:02:43.500> beyond

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
know I didn't plan on having them beyond

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.740 
know I didn't plan on having them beyond
at<00:02:44.159> that<00:02:44.340> point<00:02:44.640> but<00:02:44.909> obviously<00:02:45.629> these

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
at that point but obviously these

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.280 
at that point but obviously these
propellers<00:02:46.200> will<00:02:46.530> chop<00:02:46.920> your<00:02:47.159> head<00:02:47.370> off<00:02:48.290> yeah

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
propellers will chop your head off yeah

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.509 
propellers will chop your head off yeah
you<00:02:49.349> wouldn't<00:02:49.680> want<00:02:49.829> that<00:02:49.859> to<00:02:50.099> happen<00:02:50.250> when

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
you wouldn't want that to happen when

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.399 
you wouldn't want that to happen when
you're<00:02:50.609> going<00:02:50.760> skydiving<00:02:51.319> especially<00:02:52.319> when

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
you're going skydiving especially when

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:53.420 
you're going skydiving especially when
you're<00:02:52.500> gonna<00:02:52.590> be<00:02:52.680> jumping<00:02:52.950> out<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.400> plane

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
you're gonna be jumping out of the plane

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.869 
you're gonna be jumping out of the plane
next<00:02:53.879> but<00:02:54.569> I<00:02:54.780> just<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:55.530> this<00:02:56.099> photo<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:56.670> it

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
I just basically got down low I like to

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.210 
I just basically got down low I like to
shoot<00:03:12.569> low<00:03:12.780> angles<00:03:13.230> when<00:03:13.680> I'm<00:03:13.769> trying<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.129> make

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
shoot low angles when I'm trying to make

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.729 
shoot low angles when I'm trying to make
a<00:03:14.340> point<00:03:14.670> in<00:03:14.849> an<00:03:14.970> image<00:03:15.269> I<00:03:15.420> shoot<00:03:16.049> down<00:03:16.319> lower

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
a point in an image I shoot down lower

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.740 
a point in an image I shoot down lower
and<00:03:17.160> shoot<00:03:17.489> up<00:03:17.699> at<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:17.910> subject<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:18.359> makes<00:03:18.540> a

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
and shoot up at the subject that makes a

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.409 
and shoot up at the subject that makes a
subject<00:03:19.169> seem<00:03:19.379> larger<00:03:20.280> now<00:03:20.730> Greg's<00:03:21.060> really

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
subject seem larger now Greg's really

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.210 
subject seem larger now Greg's really
tall<00:03:21.660> he<00:03:21.840> likes<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.139> shoot<00:03:22.290> down<00:03:22.560> on<00:03:22.769> subjects

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
tall he likes to shoot down on subjects

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.369 
tall he likes to shoot down on subjects
but<00:03:23.340> that's<00:03:23.519> his<00:03:23.790> thing<00:03:24.150> that's<00:03:24.629> not<00:03:24.870> mine<00:03:25.169> I

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
but that's his thing that's not mine I

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.740 
but that's his thing that's not mine I
don't<00:03:25.440> like<00:03:25.799> shooting<00:03:26.099> down<00:03:26.849> on<00:03:26.879> subjects<00:03:27.660> I

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
don't like shooting down on subjects I

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.199 
don't like shooting down on subjects I
like<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.349> feel<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:28.680> making<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.940> subject

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
like the feel of making the subject

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.509 
like the feel of making the subject
larger<00:03:30.959> now<00:03:31.199> that<00:03:31.680> doesn't<00:03:31.889> work<00:03:32.159> well<00:03:32.340> in

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
larger now that doesn't work well in

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.039 
larger now that doesn't work well in
portraits<00:03:33.060> as<00:03:33.180> greg<00:03:33.389> has<00:03:33.569> shown<00:03:33.840> me<00:03:34.019> that

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
portraits as greg has shown me that

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.289 
portraits as greg has shown me that
you're<00:03:34.319> better<00:03:34.470> off<00:03:34.709> standing<00:03:35.489> or<00:03:36.090> being

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
you're better off standing or being

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.789 
you're better off standing or being
higher<00:03:36.510> up<00:03:36.540> for<00:03:36.930> family<00:03:37.260> portraits<00:03:37.680> because

higher up for family portraits because

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.979 
higher up for family portraits because
I've<00:03:38.069> I<00:03:38.280> botched<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:39.000> whole<00:03:39.180> family<00:03:39.389> portrait

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
I've I botched a whole family portrait

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.839 
I've I botched a whole family portrait
by<00:03:40.139> shooting<00:03:40.799> everything<00:03:41.129> too<00:03:41.340> low<00:03:41.579> and<00:03:41.790> it

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
by shooting everything too low and it

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.390 
by shooting everything too low and it
just<00:03:42.000> didn't<00:03:42.540> work<00:03:42.599> right<00:03:42.959> so<00:03:43.229> that<00:03:43.889> was<00:03:44.159> cool

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
just didn't work right so that was cool

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.399 
just didn't work right so that was cool
you<00:03:44.909> know<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.209> was<00:03:45.299> cool<00:03:45.449> that<00:03:45.659> Greg<00:03:45.930> helped<00:03:46.229> me

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
you know it was cool that Greg helped me

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.080 
you know it was cool that Greg helped me
out<00:03:46.440> there<00:03:46.889> but<00:03:47.099> in<00:03:47.190> this<00:03:47.310> case<00:03:47.579> I<00:03:47.729> like

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
out there but in this case I like

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.089 
out there but in this case I like
showing<00:03:48.659> what<00:03:49.079> is<00:03:49.199> going<00:03:49.470> on<00:03:49.620> in<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.859> image

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
showing what is going on in the image

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.180 
showing what is going on in the image
you've<00:03:50.519> got<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:51.750> plane<00:03:52.109> you<00:03:52.440> have<00:03:52.590> this<00:03:52.799> sign

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
you've got the plane you have this sign

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.550 
you've got the plane you have this sign
you<00:03:53.699> have<00:03:54.150> this<00:03:54.359> cone<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:55.049> everything<00:03:55.440> is

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
you have this cone and everything is

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.349 
you have this cone and everything is
evenly<00:03:56.010> matched<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.639> they're<00:03:56.729> not<00:03:56.940> right<00:03:57.209> in

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
evenly matched and they're not right in

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.759 
evenly matched and they're not right in
the<00:03:57.449> middle<00:03:57.629> so<00:03:57.720> for<00:03:58.109> your<00:03:58.199> rule<00:03:58.409> of<00:03:58.530> thirds

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
the middle so for your rule of thirds

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.460 
the middle so for your rule of thirds
are<00:03:58.979> thrown<00:03:59.310> off<00:03:59.459> slightly<00:04:00.030> but<00:04:00.989> everything

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
are thrown off slightly but everything

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.229 
are thrown off slightly but everything
is<00:04:01.590> here<00:04:01.829> everybody<00:04:02.310> is<00:04:02.459> walking<00:04:02.729> to<00:04:03.120> the

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
is here everybody is walking to the

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.140 
is here everybody is walking to the
plane<00:04:03.479> and<00:04:04.190> you<00:04:05.190> know<00:04:05.250> that's<00:04:05.549> what<00:04:05.760> makes<00:04:05.879> a

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
plane and you know that's what makes a

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.930 
plane and you know that's what makes a
really<00:04:06.840> cool<00:04:07.109> photojournalistic<00:04:07.979> image<00:04:08.459> he's

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
really cool photojournalistic image he's

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.430 
really cool photojournalistic image he's

wearing the chicken suit he's walking
towards<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.739> plane<00:04:10.889> so<00:04:11.040> we<00:04:11.129> know<00:04:11.340> they're

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
towards the plane so we know they're

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:12.949 
towards the plane so we know they're
going<00:04:11.669> skydiving<00:04:12.030> you<00:04:12.419> don't<00:04:12.659> want<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.870> get

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
going skydiving you don't want to get

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.809 
going skydiving you don't want to get
your<00:04:13.109> head<00:04:13.229> chopped<00:04:13.530> off<00:04:13.739> so<00:04:13.979> it's<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.669> whole

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.159 
mmm we're about to jump out of a plane

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.009 
mmm we're about to jump out of a plane
should<00:04:17.669> I<00:04:17.699> be<00:04:17.940> worried<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.389> that's<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.750> feel

should I be worried and that's the feel

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.170 
should I be worried and that's the feel
that<00:04:19.049> I<00:04:19.349> get<00:04:19.409> from<00:04:19.680> this<00:04:19.799> is<00:04:19.859> like<00:04:20.130> well<00:04:20.760> we're

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
risk we're taking a chance here so I

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.840 
risk we're taking a chance here so I
chose<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:26.460> be<00:04:26.580> black

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
white now that's not saying the color

wouldn't<00:04:30.840> have<00:04:30.930> been<00:04:31.110> good<00:04:31.350> let's<00:04:31.980> take<00:04:32.190> a

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
wouldn't have been good let's take a

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.490 
wouldn't have been good let's take a
look<00:04:32.490> at<00:04:32.640> the<00:04:32.910> color<00:04:33.150> all<00:04:33.690> right<00:04:33.840> obviously<00:04:34.080> it

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
look at the color all right obviously it

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.320 
look at the color all right obviously it
starts<00:04:34.770> off<00:04:34.890> flat<00:04:35.190> in<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.460> raw<00:04:35.610> file<00:04:35.910> but<00:04:36.120> boom

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
starts off flat in the raw file but boom

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.970 
starts off flat in the raw file but boom
if<00:04:36.750> we<00:04:36.840> pump<00:04:37.050> it<00:04:37.230> right<00:04:37.410> up<00:04:37.620> with<00:04:37.800> your

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
if we pump it right up with your

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.880 
if we pump it right up with your
contrast<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:38.850> look<00:04:39.150> how<00:04:39.270> much<00:04:39.780> that<00:04:40.230> pops<00:04:40.620> I

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
contrast and look how much that pops I

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.160 
contrast and look how much that pops I
mean<00:04:41.130> sure<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.370> color<00:04:41.730> looks<00:04:42.030> cool<00:04:42.270> you<00:04:42.540> know

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
mean sure the color looks cool you know

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.470 
mean sure the color looks cool you know
the<00:04:43.530> chicken<00:04:43.770> suits<00:04:44.100> yellow<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:44.970> you've<00:04:45.300> got

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.660 
the chicken suits yellow and you've got
the<00:04:45.600> sky<00:04:45.870> but<00:04:46.560> it<00:04:46.650> doesn't<00:04:46.980> seem<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.310> exude

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
the sky but it doesn't seem to exude

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.780 
the sky but it doesn't seem to exude
that<00:04:48.150> same<00:04:48.510> you<00:04:49.230> know<00:04:49.320> boom<00:04:49.830> this<00:04:50.370> you<00:04:50.670> know

that same you know boom this you know
can<00:04:50.940> I<00:04:51.000> say<00:04:51.150> boom<00:04:51.360> nests<00:04:51.630> yeah<00:04:52.050> it<00:04:52.320> doesn't

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
can I say boom nests yeah it doesn't

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.310 
can I say boom nests yeah it doesn't
exude<00:04:52.950> that<00:04:53.160> same<00:04:53.400> boom<00:04:53.700> nests<00:04:54.030> that<00:04:54.570> I<00:04:54.600> get<00:04:54.990> if

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
exude that same boom nests that I get if

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.910 
exude that same boom nests that I get if
I<00:04:55.940> desaturate<00:04:56.940> leave<00:04:57.630> my<00:04:57.840> contrast<00:04:58.410> up<00:04:58.650> I'm

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
I desaturate leave my contrast up I'm

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.910 
I desaturate leave my contrast up I'm
gonna<00:04:59.340> move<00:04:59.700> my<00:04:59.730> blacks<00:05:00.480> up<00:05:00.780> so<00:05:01.500> I<00:05:01.530> like<00:05:01.890> it

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
I'm going to change tweak my exposure

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.020 
I'm going to change tweak my exposure
just<00:05:05.430> slightly<00:05:06.260> and<00:05:07.260> now<00:05:08.160> it<00:05:08.340> has<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:08.700> feel
