00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
something else actually I'll take it to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.240 
something else actually I'll take it to
be<00:00:39.780> fair<00:00:40.020> I've<00:00:40.260> recorded<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.920> few<00:00:41.190> times

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
be fair I've recorded this a few times

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.940 
be fair I've recorded this a few times
so<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.000> doesn't<00:00:42.270> sound<00:00:42.510> enthusiastic<00:00:42.989> it's

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
so this doesn't sound enthusiastic it's

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.100 
so this doesn't sound enthusiastic it's
because<00:00:44.370> things<00:00:45.210> have<00:00:45.420> not<00:00:45.570> been<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:45.960> well

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110
