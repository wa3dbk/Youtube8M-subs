00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:10.600
 Well then I would like to give a lecture on how to fold the rocket 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:12.330
 The finished type looks like this 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.690
 Yes 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.410
 Because this rocket Yonbo foot is attached 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.740
 Yeah 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.750
 Curvature 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.570
 I can stand myself 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.600
 Yes 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.600
 Well lecture how to make this rocket 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.810
 Yes 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.829
 I have no qualification 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:42.300
 At first I felt like I saw a paper balloon 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.100
 I already have a little more 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.100
 It's overlapping now 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.780
 Open Come bag open Roman bag to in 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.590
 The other side is also open with sack weave as well 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.470
 Yes 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.340
 It is in 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.850
 With this triangle turned into a wing 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.140
 Well then , it's a paper hikoki 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.770
 For the battle of communication in the middle 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.770
 think 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.300
 Like left and right 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.300
 Go for the middle battle 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.270
 Something like this 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.579
 It feels like a following of head 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.579
 Deura by I know 54 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.220
 Like a paper airplane 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.909
 Yes 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.330
 It turned out to be something like this 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.630
 It is in 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:23.030
 If you can come here, this is both ends now 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:26.410
 Further toward the both ends in the middle game 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.410
 Nakagawa Io Sisters 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.530
 In the left and right 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.270
 It is possible of man 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.000
 Of the corner 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:42.470
 It is a feeling to turn the pointed part to the middle 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.470
 If the bag is crying 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.110
 In reverse is already administered 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.110
 Towards the middle 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.050
 In this say this 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:07.920
 It looks like this is quite thin 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.340
 Yes this is fine then this bottom 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.190
 It is one piece 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:16.930
 Makeup is eco- friendly 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:21.310
 Line of child down the line is the ne market of envelopes 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.790
 Match the line under this triangle 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.790
 Main dish 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.530
 Part of the end 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.530
 think 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.330
 Even ears like a beard 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.890
 It's what say upside down this 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.790
 information 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.790
 Fit online 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.730
 Which 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.730
 think 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:58.400
 Well, if you can come here already, do this in the completed lesson 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:03.159
 Open it like this and finger it 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.159
 Put your finger in the bag inside 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.640
 Please format 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.640
 Let's arrange the shape properly 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.530
 It lost all Te-kun 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.540
 The balance is probably 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.829
 It should be good 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.010
 The bag caught only properly 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.730
 If only spread 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.060
 Say a large stand 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.060
 Yes 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.670
 How is it? 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.650
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:43.409
 If it becomes the sensibility of a rocket 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.980
 Yes packets after it this is a it is not only just win 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.990
 Actually it flies 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:56.950
 Yes , how to fly 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:56.950
 It is normal one who is nothing, but in the state that I stood from this gap of the one where the foot does not disturb well 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.220
 Down to 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:07.570
 What does it mean that the neck is bent 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:13.120
 It is closer to the straw of shorter Ueno Miku team of the neck to bend 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:18.699
 I will insert it because I bent it into a key shape and protected it 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:21.020
 Shorter Shi straight it is and put blow the foot breath pledged treasure 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.860
 If you breathe in properly a 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.200
 Rocket Kyu 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.960
 To the fact that fly 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:35.600
 Than you can rocket play 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:41.350
 I think it might be fun to try playing with a straw prepared with a straw neck bent by all means 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.350
 Yes , that's how to make a rocket
