actually<00:02:36.560> trying<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.220> game<00:02:37.400> versus<00:02:37.940> just

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
actually trying in the game versus just

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.820 
actually trying in the game versus just
kind<00:02:38.330> of<00:02:38.360> recreational<00:02:39.170> play<00:02:39.380> but<00:02:39.620> when<00:02:39.739> it

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
kind of recreational play but when it

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.380

but<00:03:02.120> one<00:03:02.239> thing<00:03:02.420> about<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:02.750> game<00:03:02.959> that<00:03:03.170> made

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
but one thing about that game that made

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.050 
but one thing about that game that made
it<00:03:03.410> last<00:03:03.620> so<00:03:03.860> long<00:03:03.890> is<00:03:04.250> just<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.700> wasn't

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
it last so long is just it wasn't

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.970 
it last so long is just it wasn't
getting<00:03:05.510> on<00:03:05.750> peoples<00:03:05.900> nerves<00:03:06.170> people<00:03:06.739> just

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
getting on peoples nerves people just

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.410 
getting on peoples nerves people just
liked<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.519> I<00:03:07.640> think<00:03:07.850> that<00:03:07.970> kind<00:03:08.090> of<00:03:08.209> worked

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
liked it and I think that kind of worked

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.270 
liked it and I think that kind of worked
against<00:03:08.750> advanced<00:03:09.049> warfare<00:03:09.560> on<00:03:09.769> why<00:03:09.950> advanced

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
against advanced warfare on why advanced

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.070 
against advanced warfare on why advanced
warfare<00:03:10.580> got<00:03:10.819> old<00:03:11.030> so<00:03:11.269> fast<00:03:11.569> there<00:03:11.870> really

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
warfare got old so fast there really

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.720 
warfare got old so fast there really
wasn't<00:03:12.260> any<00:03:12.440> variety<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:13.310> know<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.459> had<00:03:13.610> the

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
wasn't any variety you know you had the

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.370 
wasn't any variety you know you had the
same<00:03:13.940> guns<00:03:14.239> and<00:03:14.480> gameplays<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:14.989> was<00:03:15.170> all<00:03:15.260> with

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
same guns and gameplays it was all with

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.199 
same guns and gameplays it was all with
the<00:03:15.470> Balor<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.980> ASM<00:03:16.430> one<00:03:16.640> just<00:03:16.970> really

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
the Balor the ASM one just really

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.210 
the Balor the ASM one just really
overpowered<00:03:17.870> over<00:03:18.200> use<00:03:18.380> weapons<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:19.040> it<00:03:19.130> was

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
overpowered over use weapons and it was

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.740 
overpowered over use weapons and it was
kind<00:03:19.340> of<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.549> same<00:03:19.730> kinds<00:03:20.120> of<00:03:20.180> gameplays<00:03:20.599> I

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
kind of the same kinds of gameplays I

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.720 
kind of the same kinds of gameplays I
mean<00:03:20.870> sure<00:03:21.019> you've<00:03:21.200> had<00:03:21.349> one<00:03:21.620> shot<00:03:21.650> dnase<00:03:22.340> you

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
mean sure you've had one shot dnase you

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.670 
mean sure you've had one shot dnase you
had<00:03:22.880> pistol<00:03:23.269> dnase<00:03:23.599> somewhat<00:03:24.140> unique<00:03:24.290> game

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
had pistol dnase somewhat unique game

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.110 
had pistol dnase somewhat unique game
plays<00:03:24.920> but<00:03:25.220> if<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.400> think<00:03:25.610> about<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:25.849> it<00:03:26.090> was

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
plays but if you think about it it was

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.089 
plays but if you think about it it was
really<00:03:26.540> all<00:03:26.690> just<00:03:26.720> triples<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.530> quads<00:03:27.769> and

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
really all just triples and quads and

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.710 
really all just triples and quads and
then<00:03:28.250> on<00:03:28.340> top<00:03:28.489> of<00:03:28.549> that<00:03:28.670> you<00:03:28.880> had<00:03:29.000> supply<00:03:29.390> drops

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
then on top of that you had supply drops

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.780 
then on top of that you had supply drops
and<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:30.049> just<00:03:30.260> made<00:03:30.410> for<00:03:30.650> a<00:03:30.680> pretty<00:03:30.859> bad<00:03:31.489> game

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
and that just made for a pretty bad game

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.220 
and that just made for a pretty bad game
on<00:03:31.940> YouTube<00:03:32.359> it<00:03:32.510> wasn't<00:03:32.840> necessarily

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
on YouTube it wasn't necessarily

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.229 
on YouTube it wasn't necessarily
entertaining<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:33.980> watch<00:03:34.010> where<00:03:34.430> his<00:03:34.549> mw3<00:03:34.970> and

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
entertaining to watch where his mw3 and

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.970 
entertaining to watch where his mw3 and
bo<00:03:35.359> to<00:03:35.570> just<00:03:35.810> kind<00:03:35.959> of<00:03:35.989> have<00:03:36.109> this<00:03:36.230> wow<00:03:36.470> factor

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
bo to just kind of have this wow factor

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.259 
bo to just kind of have this wow factor
for<00:03:37.190> me<00:03:37.220> another<00:03:37.579> thing<00:03:37.820> about<00:03:37.910> advanced

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
for me another thing about advanced

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.150 
for me another thing about advanced
warfare<00:03:38.630> is<00:03:38.780> while<00:03:38.959> there<00:03:39.109> was<00:03:39.260> no<00:03:39.530> variety<00:03:39.739> it

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
warfare is while there was no variety it

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.559 
warfare is while there was no variety it
was<00:03:40.250> kind<00:03:40.430> of<00:03:40.519> too<00:03:40.700> easy<00:03:40.970> people<00:03:41.420> were<00:03:41.480> getting

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
was kind of too easy people were getting

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.360 
was kind of too easy people were getting
gameplays<00:03:42.049> left<00:03:42.319> and<00:03:42.500> right<00:03:42.650> so<00:03:42.920> many<00:03:43.040> people

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
gameplays left and right so many people

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.069 
gameplays left and right so many people
that<00:03:43.519> I<00:03:43.579> know<00:03:43.700> even<00:03:44.180> personally<00:03:44.810> we're

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
that I know even personally we're

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.229 
that I know even personally we're
dropping<00:03:45.410> triple<00:03:45.739> dnas<00:03:46.100> quad<00:03:46.400> dnas<00:03:46.850> and<00:03:47.150> it

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
dropping triple dnas quad dnas and it

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.640 
dropping triple dnas quad dnas and it
just<00:03:47.420> seemed<00:03:47.540> like<00:03:47.569> it<00:03:47.750> was<00:03:47.840> too<00:03:48.019> easy<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.410> get

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
just seemed like it was too easy to get

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.050 
just seemed like it was too easy to get
there<00:03:48.799> wasn't<00:03:49.069> a<00:03:49.100> whole<00:03:49.130> lot<00:03:49.310> of<00:03:49.609> challenge

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
there wasn't a whole lot of challenge

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.640 
there wasn't a whole lot of challenge
obviously<00:03:50.239> you<00:03:50.569> had<00:03:50.720> God<00:03:50.930> accounts<00:03:51.380> and<00:03:51.500> stuff

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
obviously you had God accounts and stuff

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.410 
obviously you had God accounts and stuff
reverse<00:03:52.130> boosted<00:03:52.549> accounts<00:03:52.910> so<00:03:53.120> that<00:03:53.150> just

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
reverse boosted accounts so that just

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.940 
reverse boosted accounts so that just
made<00:03:53.569> for<00:03:53.720> an<00:03:53.780> easy<00:03:54.019> game<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:54.440> think<00:03:54.470> people<00:03:54.769> got

being<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.739> beta<00:04:00.920> stage<00:04:01.250> there<00:04:01.549> are<00:04:01.700> some

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
being the beta stage there are some

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.160 
being the beta stage there are some
things<00:04:02.090> that<00:04:02.209> are<00:04:02.389> gonna<00:04:02.480> change<00:04:02.750> I<00:04:02.959> brought

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
things that are gonna change I brought

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.780 
things that are gonna change I brought
this<00:04:03.290> up<00:04:03.440> in<00:04:03.560> my<00:04:03.650> last<00:04:03.829> commentary<00:04:04.400> as<00:04:04.579> of

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
this up in my last commentary as of

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.550 
this up in my last commentary as of
right<00:04:04.819> now<00:04:05.000> if<00:04:05.359> the<00:04:05.540> beta<00:04:05.750> was<00:04:06.079> the<00:04:06.200> actual

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
right now if the beta was the actual

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.229 
right now if the beta was the actual
full<00:04:06.950> game<00:04:07.220> I<00:04:07.430> think<00:04:07.639> it<00:04:07.730> would<00:04:07.819> get<00:04:07.910> old<00:04:08.090> very

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
full game I think it would get old very

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.240 
full game I think it would get old very
quickly<00:04:08.630> my<00:04:09.170> last<00:04:09.380> video<00:04:09.620> was<00:04:09.739> kind<00:04:09.950> of<00:04:10.010> about

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
quickly my last video was kind of about

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.530 
quickly my last video was kind of about
patches<00:04:10.819> and<00:04:11.030> what<00:04:11.150> people<00:04:11.420> were<00:04:11.510> thinking

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
patches and what people were thinking

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.330 
patches and what people were thinking
about<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:12.049> beta<00:04:12.230> so<00:04:12.470> far<00:04:12.709> but<00:04:12.950> I<00:04:12.980> think<00:04:13.220> more

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
about the beta so far but I think more

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.830 
about the beta so far but I think more
problems<00:04:13.819> are<00:04:13.970> just<00:04:14.150> showing<00:04:14.269> themselves<00:04:14.510> in

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
problems are just showing themselves in

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.270 
problems are just showing themselves in
the<00:04:14.930> beta<00:04:15.079> you<00:04:15.319> have<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.530> black<00:04:15.769> hat<00:04:16.039> there's

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
the beta you have the black hat there's

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.949 
the beta you have the black hat there's
still<00:04:16.549> Opie<00:04:16.910> weapons<00:04:17.269> that<00:04:17.359> people<00:04:17.630> feel<00:04:17.780> need

the hater killstreak does I don't know
what<00:04:46.540> it<00:04:46.630> is<00:04:46.870> but<00:04:47.110> if<00:04:47.320> someone<00:04:47.500> is<00:04:47.680> working

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
what it is but if someone is working

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.920 
what it is but if someone is working
hard<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.370> actually<00:04:48.610> earn<00:04:49.060> that<00:04:49.389> kill<00:04:49.660> streak

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
hard to actually earn that kill streak

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.480 
hard to actually earn that kill streak
only<00:04:50.260> to<00:04:50.350> have<00:04:50.380> it<00:04:50.530> taken<00:04:50.740> down<00:04:50.950> by<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.310> enemy

team in just a matter of seconds the no
I<00:04:53.410> don't<00:04:53.889> really<00:04:54.070> think<00:04:54.220> that's<00:04:54.520> fair<00:04:54.730> at<00:04:54.850> all

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
I don't really think that's fair at all

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.159 
I don't really think that's fair at all
I<00:04:55.030> don't<00:04:55.240> think<00:04:55.570> that's<00:04:55.660> a<00:04:55.780> good<00:04:55.810> thing<00:04:56.020> to

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
I don't think that's a good thing to

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.780 
I don't think that's a good thing to
implement<00:04:56.650> into<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.919> game<00:04:57.100> but<00:04:57.310> overall<00:04:57.700> I

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
implement into the game but overall I

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.340 
implement into the game but overall I
guess<00:04:58.090> that's<00:04:58.330> just<00:04:58.419> up<00:04:58.720> to<00:04:58.750> david<00:04:59.169> vonderhaar

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
guess that's just up to david vonderhaar

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.780 
guess that's just up to david vonderhaar
and<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.770> rest<00:04:59.950> of<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.190> treyarch<00:05:00.490> team<00:05:00.669> to

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
and the rest of the treyarch team to

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.430 
and the rest of the treyarch team to
decide<00:05:01.090> all<00:05:01.360> we<00:05:01.510> can<00:05:01.630> really<00:05:01.750> do<00:05:01.990> about<00:05:02.020> it<00:05:02.350> is

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
decide all we can really do about it is

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.870 
decide all we can really do about it is
just<00:05:02.680> voice<00:05:02.830> our<00:05:03.040> opinions<00:05:03.430> tell<00:05:03.669> them<00:05:03.790> that

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
just voice our opinions tell them that

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.159 
just voice our opinions tell them that
we<00:05:03.970> don't<00:05:04.060> like<00:05:04.300> it<00:05:04.450> and<00:05:04.540> we<00:05:04.630> can<00:05:04.780> wait<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:05.050> see

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
we don't like it and we can wait to see

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:06.750 
we don't like it and we can wait to see
what<00:05:05.320> happens<00:05:05.440> and<00:05:05.860> along<00:05:06.130> with<00:05:06.160> that<00:05:06.310> I<00:05:06.460> think

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
what happens and along with that I think

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.850 
what happens and along with that I think
it's<00:05:06.880> fairly<00:05:07.060> easy<00:05:07.210> just<00:05:07.750> like<00:05:07.870> aw<00:05:08.350> people<00:05:08.770> are

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
it's fairly easy just like aw people are

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.710 
it's fairly easy just like aw people are
already<00:05:08.980> dropping<00:05:09.400> tons<00:05:09.760> of<00:05:10.000> gameplays<00:05:10.360> even

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
already dropping tons of gameplays even

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.360 
already dropping tons of gameplays even
with<00:05:10.840> variety<00:05:11.350> it's<00:05:11.470> not<00:05:11.650> necessarily<00:05:12.250> with

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
with variety it's not necessarily with

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.100 
with variety it's not necessarily with
the<00:05:12.460> same<00:05:12.639> gun<00:05:12.850> every<00:05:13.180> time<00:05:13.389> but<00:05:13.660> I<00:05:13.690> think<00:05:13.960> when

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
the same gun every time but I think when

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.270 
the same gun every time but I think when
you're<00:05:14.260> in<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.440> beta<00:05:14.620> stage<00:05:14.950> and<00:05:15.190> you're

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
you're in the beta stage and you're

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.310 
you're in the beta stage and you're
already<00:05:15.490> dropping<00:05:15.970> triple<00:05:16.450> nuclear's<00:05:16.930> double

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
already dropping triple nuclear's double

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.379 
already dropping triple nuclear's double
nuclear's<00:05:17.740> unique<00:05:18.130> pistol<00:05:18.610> nuclear's<00:05:19.030> just

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
nuclear's unique pistol nuclear's just

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.240 
nuclear's unique pistol nuclear's just
all<00:05:19.540> different<00:05:19.930> unique<00:05:20.229> game<00:05:20.530> plays<00:05:20.770> I<00:05:20.979> think

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
all different unique game plays I think

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.860 
all different unique game plays I think
that's<00:05:21.400> when<00:05:21.580> you<00:05:21.669> know<00:05:21.880> it's<00:05:22.120> a<00:05:22.240> bit<00:05:22.419> too<00:05:22.630> easy

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
that's when you know it's a bit too easy

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.360 
that's when you know it's a bit too easy
maybe<00:05:23.169> it's<00:05:23.380> time<00:05:23.530> to<00:05:23.650> make<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.889> game<00:05:24.040> harder

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
maybe it's time to make the game harder

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.560 
maybe it's time to make the game harder
I<00:05:24.490> don't<00:05:24.700> know<00:05:24.760> maybe<00:05:24.940> that's<00:05:25.210> just<00:05:25.330> my<00:05:25.510> two

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
I don't know maybe that's just my two

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.120 
I don't know maybe that's just my two
cents<00:05:25.930> compared<00:05:26.290> to<00:05:26.380> yours<00:05:26.620> but<00:05:26.800> I<00:05:26.950> just

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
cents compared to yours but I just

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.379 
cents compared to yours but I just
wanted<00:05:27.340> to<00:05:27.400> give<00:05:27.580> my<00:05:27.610> thoughts<00:05:27.880> on<00:05:28.090> how<00:05:28.210> things

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
wanted to give my thoughts on how things

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:29.760 
wanted to give my thoughts on how things
will<00:05:28.570> play<00:05:28.600> out<00:05:28.720> from<00:05:28.990> here<00:05:29.169> on<00:05:29.260> out<00:05:29.290> maybe<00:05:29.680> you
