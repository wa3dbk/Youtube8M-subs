00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 we are continuing our special week 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.130
 eu and it is with a phenomenon that we 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.839
 comes directly from the united states on 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.519
 cheerleading of course not to be confused 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.139
 with men cheerleaders 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.790
 you discovered it through series 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.320
 such as glee or high school 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.730
 music hall and if you do not see 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.960
 still what is it like and well I 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.570
 take you to meet one of the teams 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.380
 the best of France and who excels 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.380
 let's go we go 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.960
 between acrobatics dances skirt to these 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.029
 knots in the hair cheerleading 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.090
 seduces more and more two frenchies 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.440
 it was time , however, what 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.980
 is a real difference in level between 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.829
 the cheerleaders 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.140
 in the United States it's in France yes 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.690
 unfortunately why we 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.309
 usually starts at age three 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.440
 which is far from the case here 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.500
 and it's much more intensive at 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.500
 them 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.910
 I was very very acrobatic 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.050
 does it happen sometimes that they 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.320
 have accidents like in any 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.840
 sport 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.090
 yes often this moment we have accidents 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.600
 the day before yesterday I made myself 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.020
 ankle 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.040
 it's painful but we do it with 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.250
 it's really more than a sport 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.310
 what is it you education that does not say 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.690
