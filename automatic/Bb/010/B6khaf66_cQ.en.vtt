00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.210 
I've constructed our pizzas we're going
to<00:03:18.580> pop<00:03:18.790> those<00:03:18.970> into<00:03:19.330> an<00:03:19.420> oven<00:03:19.630> at<00:03:19.900> about<00:03:20.220> 190

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
to pop those into an oven at about 190

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.880 
to pop those into an oven at about 190
degrees<00:03:21.610> Celsius<00:03:22.239> for<00:03:22.420> about<00:03:22.720> 20<00:03:23.349> to<00:03:23.530> 25

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
degrees Celsius for about 20 to 25

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.710 
degrees Celsius for about 20 to 25
minutes<00:03:24.099> just<00:03:24.910> keep<00:03:25.090> an<00:03:25.209> eye<00:03:25.300> on<00:03:25.360> them<00:03:25.569> because

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
minutes just keep an eye on them because

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.839 
minutes just keep an eye on them because
each<00:03:26.110> oven<00:03:26.500> is<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.709> little<00:03:27.010> bit<00:03:27.130> different<00:03:27.549> but

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
each oven is a little bit different but

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.339 
each oven is a little bit different but
maybe<00:03:28.060> just<00:03:28.299> give<00:03:28.480> them<00:03:28.569> a<00:03:28.690> turn<00:03:28.870> halfway

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
maybe just give them a turn halfway

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:30.449 
maybe just give them a turn halfway
through<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.709> make<00:03:29.830> sure<00:03:30.010> they're<00:03:30.160> cooking

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
through to make sure they're cooking

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.250 
through to make sure they're cooking
evenly<00:03:30.849> all<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.540> way<00:03:31.629> around<00:03:33.360> mmm<00:03:34.360> yum<00:03:34.630> Pizza

going<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.569> simply<00:03:37.780> cut<00:03:38.110> those<00:03:38.349> up<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:38.829> could

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.650 
going to simply cut those up you could
leave<00:03:39.130> them<00:03:39.250> in<00:03:39.400> for<00:03:39.640> if<00:03:39.760> you<00:03:39.880> like<00:03:40.060> but<00:03:40.599> I
