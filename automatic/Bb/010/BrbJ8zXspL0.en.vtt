the most fun with a camera is to shoot

the most fun with a camera is to shoot
wide<00:02:55.350> open<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.460> create<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.820> shallow<00:02:57.240> depth<00:02:57.570> of

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.850 

you<00:03:21.099> might<00:03:21.400> ask<00:03:21.700> yourself<00:03:22.000> if<00:03:22.659> there<00:03:23.290> is<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.500> big

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
you might ask yourself if there is a big

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.100 
you might ask yourself if there is a big
difference<00:03:24.430> between<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:25.150> new<00:03:25.360> models<00:03:25.840> and

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
difference between the new models and

difference between the new models and
the<00:03:26.319> older<00:03:26.769> ones<00:03:27.040> when<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.549> comes<00:03:27.819> to

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
the older ones when it comes to

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.559 
the older ones when it comes to
recording<00:03:28.569> video<00:03:28.900> I<00:03:29.340> would<00:03:30.340> say<00:03:30.580> no<00:03:30.849> because

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
recording video I would say no because

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.140 
recording video I would say no because
there<00:03:32.409> is<00:03:32.590> not<00:03:32.769> much<00:03:32.830> improvement<00:03:33.549> like

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
there is not much improvement like

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.869 
there is not much improvement like
higher<00:03:34.510> bitrate<00:03:34.870> or<00:03:35.349> a<00:03:35.409> headphone<00:03:36.190> jack

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
higher bitrate or a headphone jack
