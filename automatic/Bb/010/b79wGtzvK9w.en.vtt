so why why should I go with the
technology<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.750> little<00:01:55.110> bit<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.259> help<00:01:55.549> a

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
technology and a little bit of help a

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.020 
technology and a little bit of help a
little<00:01:57.210> easier<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.600> hit<00:01:57.780> them<00:01:58.049> then<00:01:58.409> blades

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
little easier to hit them then blades

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.330 
little easier to hit them then blades
yeah<00:02:00.060> really<00:02:00.420> happy<00:02:00.689> with<00:02:00.810> those

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
yeah really happy with those

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.330 
yeah really happy with those
the<00:02:01.790> Longines<00:02:02.299> they<00:02:02.570> know<00:02:02.689> they<00:02:02.840> don't<00:02:03.340> repent

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
the Longines they know they don't repent

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.280 
the Longines they know they don't repent
writing<00:02:04.820> I<00:02:04.970> like<00:02:05.810> that

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
writing I like that

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.770 
writing I like that
7r<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:06.950> 8-iron<00:02:07.280> they<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.090> only<00:02:08.239> club<00:02:08.569> switch

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
7r and 8-iron they the only club switch

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.300 
7r and 8-iron they the only club switch
going<00:02:09.110> which<00:02:09.349> launching<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:09.920> little<00:02:10.130> higher

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
going which launching a little higher

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.820 
going which launching a little higher
but<00:02:11.180> they're<00:02:11.870> not<00:02:11.959> spinning<00:02:12.260> at<00:02:12.410> all<00:02:12.530> so

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
but they're not spinning at all so

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.740 
but they're not spinning at all so
that's<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:13.069> pretty<00:02:13.220> good<00:02:13.340> flight<00:02:13.610> all<00:02:14.450> brand

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
that's a pretty good flight all brand

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.880 
that's a pretty good flight all brand
new<00:02:14.870> as<00:02:14.989> well<00:02:16.000> this<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.950> 58<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.840> FG<00:02:21.260> FG<00:02:21.620> 2

degree<00:02:24.769> balance<00:02:25.160> that's<00:02:25.610> what<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.910> says<00:02:26.090> but

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
degree balance that's what it says but

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.660 
degree balance that's what it says but
we<00:02:26.470> grinded<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.650> little<00:02:28.040> bit<00:02:28.130> off<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:28.489> it's

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
we grinded that a little bit off so it's

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.080 
we grinded that a little bit off so it's
around<00:02:28.790> 7<00:02:29.120> degree<00:02:29.510> bounce<00:02:29.720> now<00:02:30.280> it's<00:02:31.280> 58<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.819> hit

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
around 7 degree bounce now it's 58 I hit

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.960

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
degrees like 49 yeah yeah it's weird I

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.060 
degrees like 49 yeah yeah it's weird I
know<00:03:05.299> to<00:03:05.329> degree<00:03:05.900> 10<00:03:06.410> meters<00:03:06.680> different

pretty<00:03:24.609> big<00:03:25.609> grip<00:03:26.120> like<00:03:26.840> that<00:03:26.870> because<00:03:27.380> I<00:03:27.470> try

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
pretty big grip like that because I try

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.009 
pretty big grip like that because I try
to<00:03:27.709> get<00:03:27.920> both<00:03:28.100> palms<00:03:28.840> on<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:30.139> the<00:03:30.230> grip<00:03:32.019> just

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
to get both palms on to the grip just

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.020 
to get both palms on to the grip just
gets<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.410> you<00:03:33.709> know<00:03:33.829> the<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.400> wrist<00:03:34.609> moving

gets the you know the the wrist moving
inland<00:03:35.269> stiller<00:03:36.130> because<00:03:37.130> I<00:03:37.220> tend<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.790> to

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
inland stiller because I tend to to

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.479 
inland stiller because I tend to to
hinge<00:03:38.870> it<00:03:38.989> a<00:03:39.109> little<00:03:39.319> bit<00:03:39.500> in<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.100> backswing

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
hinge it a little bit in the backswing

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.309 
hinge it a little bit in the backswing
and<00:03:40.549> then<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.880> shot<00:03:41.269> the<00:03:41.420> clubface<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:41.870> have<00:03:42.200> to

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
and then I shot the clubface and have to

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.470 
and then I shot the clubface and have to
do<00:03:42.410> you<00:03:42.980> know<00:03:43.069> to<00:03:43.130> repair<00:03:43.760> to<00:03:43.940> get<00:03:44.090> back<00:03:44.269> and

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
do you know to repair to get back and

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.430 
do you know to repair to get back and
impact<00:03:44.840> them

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
impact them

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.370 
impact them
this<00:03:45.859> helps<00:03:46.190> me<00:03:46.340> just<00:03:46.609> to<00:03:46.730> have<00:03:46.940> that's<00:03:47.319> just<00:03:48.319> a

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
this helps me just to have that's just a

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.830 
this helps me just to have that's just a
bit<00:03:48.680> more<00:03:48.829> still<00:03:49.069> and<00:03:49.130> do<00:03:49.700> more<00:03:50.389> movement<00:03:50.780> out

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
bit more still and do more movement out

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.440 
bit more still and do more movement out
on<00:03:50.959> my<00:03:51.049> shoulders
