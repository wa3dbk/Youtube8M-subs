 sing songs , songs that resonate 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:35.680
 with echoes inside the mountains to 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.960

 making me lose contemplating the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.460
 firmament that on this night 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.460

 the glow of your eyes 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.700
 as a full moon to shine 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.700
 stars 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:21.440

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:25.810
 and they reflect my impulses blindly 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:29.580
 as mystic full moon where I find 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:35.010
 everything that magic refers to 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:38.170

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.270
 my mind that is lost 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.970
 when with your light

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.520
 and full moon 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.800
