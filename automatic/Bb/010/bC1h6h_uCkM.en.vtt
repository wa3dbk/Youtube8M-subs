today we finally got it out basically
the<00:00:42.690> main<00:00:42.840> reason<00:00:43.140> why<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.379> did<00:00:43.770> not<00:00:43.890> use<00:00:44.190> it

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the main reason why we did not use it

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.229 
the main reason why we did not use it
because<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.750> need<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> new<00:00:46.379> battery<00:00:47.090> but<00:00:48.090> also

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
because I need a new battery but also

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.910 
because I need a new battery but also
because<00:00:51.140> motor<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.289> making<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.800> knocking<00:00:53.399> noise

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
because motor is making a knocking noise

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.369
