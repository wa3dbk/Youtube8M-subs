00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
really nice and soft I've been using

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.910 
really nice and soft I've been using
this<00:01:44.759> for<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:45.030> couple<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.390> days<00:01:45.600> now<00:01:45.920> probably

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
this for a couple of days now probably

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.490 
this for a couple of days now probably
two<00:01:47.189> weeks<00:01:47.220> or<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.119> what<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.780> would<00:01:48.899> do<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.470> I

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
two weeks or so and what I would do is I

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.800 
two weeks or so and what I would do is I
would<00:01:50.159> moisturize<00:01:50.850> my<00:01:51.090> hair<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.420> then<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.570> add

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
would moisturize my hair and then I add

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.670 
would moisturize my hair and then I add
a<00:01:51.840> couple<00:01:52.140> drops<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.220> also<00:01:53.369> seal<00:01:53.880> and

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
a couple drops of this and also seal and

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.929 
a couple drops of this and also seal and
I<00:01:55.680> think<00:01:55.890> I'll<00:01:55.979> be<00:01:56.130> repurchasing<00:01:56.880> this

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
I think I'll be repurchasing this

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.249 
I think I'll be repurchasing this
because<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:57.930> not<00:01:58.469> like<00:01:59.100> it's<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.450> P<00:02:00.750> or<00:02:01.079> it's

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
because it's not like it's so P or it's

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.130 
because it's not like it's so P or it's
like<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> sirum<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.909> kind<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.570> liquid<00:02:03.840> e

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
like a sirum it's just kind of liquid e

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.920 
like a sirum it's just kind of liquid e
but<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.649> just<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:06.509> don't<00:02:06.570> know<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.899> just

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
but it just it just I don't know it just

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.229 
but it just it just I don't know it just
goes<00:02:07.380> into<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> hair<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.489> blends<00:02:08.970> out

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
goes into the hair and this blends out

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.809 
goes into the hair and this blends out
or<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:11.280> just<00:02:11.310> goes<00:02:12.000> into<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.480> hair

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
or it just goes into the hair

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.580 
or it just goes into the hair

very soft when I'm done using it and

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.729 
very soft when I'm done using it and
ceramide<00:02:23.739> is<00:02:24.069> good<00:02:24.489> for<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.790> hair<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.739> heard

that it's good footing here I'm not sure

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.179 
that it's good footing here I'm not sure
about<00:02:28.269> why<00:02:28.719> but<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.230> know<00:02:29.349> that<00:02:29.590> somebody<00:02:30.040> is

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189
