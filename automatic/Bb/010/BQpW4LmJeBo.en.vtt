00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
you can seem to get ryobi nowadays and

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.759 
you can seem to get ryobi nowadays and
it<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.920> hundred<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.340> twenty<00:00:20.640> dollars<00:00:21.769> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
it was a hundred and twenty dollars the

the<00:00:25.890> economy<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:28.080> backwards

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
the economy of it is that it's backwards

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.240 
the economy of it is that it's backwards
compatible<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.570> don't<00:00:31.470> have<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.740> throw<00:00:32.070> up

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
compatible so I don't have to throw up

it completely new kit you'll have to do
that<00:01:01.230> with<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.500> rebels<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.640> don't<00:01:02.850> need<00:01:03.359> to

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
that with the rebels so I don't need to

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
and saw the reason that I got these

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.340 
and saw the reason that I got these
instead<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.270> buying<00:01:09.600> new<00:01:09.840> batteries

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
instead of just buying new batteries

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.010 
instead of just buying new batteries
because<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.890> was<00:01:11.010> very<00:01:11.310> close<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.939> price<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.630> can

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
because it was very close in price I can

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.560 
because it was very close in price I can
get<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.560> whole<00:01:13.799> kit<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:15.119> way<00:01:15.299> i<00:01:15.330> would

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
get a whole kit and that way i would

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.149 
get a whole kit and that way i would
also<00:01:15.720> get<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> impact<00:01:16.530> your<00:01:16.710> gun<00:01:16.860> which<00:01:17.040> I

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
also get the impact your gun which I

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.660 
also get the impact your gun which I
really<00:01:17.369> did<00:01:17.580> want<00:01:17.840> JDM<00:01:18.840> patch<00:01:18.990> gun<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:20.369> impact

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
really did want JDM patch gun the impact

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.940 
really did want JDM patch gun the impact
driver<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.930> good<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.290> driving<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.740> long

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.899 
driver it's good for driving in long
screws<00:01:23.340> lag<00:01:23.700> bolts<00:01:24.920> you<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.100> use<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.490> your<00:01:26.520> car

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
screws lag bolts you can use on your car

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.410 
screws lag bolts you can use on your car
if<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.270> want<00:01:27.979> it's<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.340> super<00:01:29.850> heavy<00:01:29.970> duty

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
if you want it's not super heavy duty

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.060 
if you want it's not super heavy duty
though<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.290> actually<00:01:31.590> break<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
though so you can actually break the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.130 
though so you can actually break the
handle<00:01:32.400> which<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.970> how<00:01:33.119> i<00:01:33.150> broke<00:01:33.600> my<00:01:34.380> previous

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
handle which is how i broke my previous

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.410 
handle which is how i broke my previous
drill<00:01:37.140> actually<00:01:37.920> i<00:01:38.070> had<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> master<00:01:38.700> graph<00:01:39.119> that

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
drill actually i had a master graph that

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.060 
drill actually i had a master graph that
I<00:01:39.479> really<00:01:39.840> liked<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.320> broke<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.619> because<00:01:40.979> i

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
I really liked and I broke it because i

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.850 
I really liked and I broke it because i
was<00:01:41.220> using<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.700> dr<00:01:42.540> bolts<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:44.009> anyway<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:46.560> here

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
was using it dr bolts so anyway so here

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
was using it dr bolts so anyway so here
you<00:01:46.950> go<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.850> lithium<00:01:48.119> ion<00:01:48.659> its<00:01:49.040> twenty<00:01:50.040> twenty

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
you go so lithium ion its twenty twenty

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.929 
you go so lithium ion its twenty twenty
percent<00:01:51.180> more<00:01:51.390> run<00:01:51.570> time<00:01:51.600> than<00:01:52.320> my<00:01:52.770> cat<00:01:53.070> holds

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
percent more run time than my cat holds

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.510 
percent more run time than my cat holds
charge<00:01:54.030> up<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.540> four<00:01:54.780> times<00:01:54.990> longer<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.770> it's

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
charge up to four times longer and it's

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.380 
charge up to four times longer and it's
forty<00:01:56.850> five<00:01:57.030> percent<00:01:57.060> less<00:01:57.659> weight<00:01:58.729> so<00:01:59.729> it's<00:02:00.240> a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
forty five percent less weight so it's a

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.730 
forty five percent less weight so it's a
fairly<00:02:00.600> big<00:02:01.049> difference<00:02:01.770> moving<00:02:02.399> up<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.700> that

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
fairly big difference moving up to that

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.319 
fairly big difference moving up to that
so

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
so

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.940 
so
now<00:02:07.329> when<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.720> look<00:02:07.840> at<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.050> cost<00:02:08.289> I<00:02:08.649> just

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
now when you look at the cost I just

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.640 
now when you look at the cost I just
went<00:02:09.239> around<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.569> a<00:02:10.599> couple<00:02:11.020> of<00:02:11.349> different

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
went around to a couple of different

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.890 
went around to a couple of different
places<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.130> picked<00:02:12.370> up<00:02:12.459> some<00:02:12.520> prices<00:02:13.090> the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900

then the makita double pack was the same
price<00:04:35.699> it<00:04:35.909> was<00:04:36.199> 160<00:04:37.199> dollars<00:04:37.669> or<00:04:38.669> two<00:04:38.939> of<00:04:39.090> them

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
price it was 160 dollars or two of them

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.439 
price it was 160 dollars or two of them
so<00:04:40.740> that's<00:04:41.189> like<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.580> same<00:04:41.789> price<00:04:42.060> is<00:04:42.419> a

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
so that's like the same price is a

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.100 
so that's like the same price is a
single<00:04:43.050> battery<00:04:43.819> which<00:04:44.819> is<00:04:44.870> kind<00:04:45.870> of<00:04:45.900> an<00:04:45.990> odd

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
single battery which is kind of an odd

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.619 
single battery which is kind of an odd
