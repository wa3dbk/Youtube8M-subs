00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.450
 announce that we have a surprise 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.969

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.129
 buses here of strength that gently 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.230
 gave us the vehicle that has been here 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.060

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.270
 On the way, I'm going to take a test. 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.890
 knowledge of how many lines of 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.530

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.330

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.440
 of the state with 60 years 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.930
 Paulo has never seen so many buses but 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.640
 transport every day and several times 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.350
 so it is known by many 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.780
 drivers and collectors 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.000
 today got another friend jackson who 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.000
 has been in the position for only seven months 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.010
 when you want to talk to me only 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.650
 struggling the ride continues he wants 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.020
 know every detail of the vehicles and 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.860
 then take all doubts with the boss 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:37.270
 of maintenance but they are Sundays 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:40.120
 59 x will be disabled in 2005 2006 and 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.280

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.110
 same bus from today to 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.640
 Your mother than I am when I'm 30 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.800
 in the company 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.140
 he could not leave without registering 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.780
 this moment would be a signal for the 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.540
 because the driver does not 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.480
 I want something besides I want to be a non fruit 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.730
 I know how else, who knows, God will provide 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.620
 and here ends the visit of Paul to 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.750
 bus company he is already 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.209
 farewell and the people who welcomed him 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.070
 Paulo even has a joke that says 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.200
 that everything in the passing life - the 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.940
 driver and the conductor and his passion 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.489
 by bus also right 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.079
 exactly which is very rewarding to 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.239
 message you leave to people 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.100
 who are watching us that values 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.830
 but the transportation they have is because 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.130
 it is a very system is the bread the new age 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.610
 and can not deprive and break the 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.610
 bus 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.920
 Curious history of paulo in if you 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.480
 wants to be owner of bus fleet paulo 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.800
 going to have to work it should not be easy
