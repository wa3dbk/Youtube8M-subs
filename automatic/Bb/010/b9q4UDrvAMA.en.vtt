okay<00:00:00.840> this<00:00:01.050> is<00:00:01.230> a<00:00:01.260> walk-around<00:00:01.500> of<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.040> car<00:00:03.080> do

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
okay this is a walk-around of the car do

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:30.430 
okay this is a walk-around of the car do
it<00:00:04.230> far<00:00:04.710> away

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.070 

I'll<00:00:30.740> try<00:00:30.920> to<00:00:30.980> do<00:00:31.100> it<00:00:31.130> close<00:00:31.370> up<00:00:31.580> and<00:00:31.760> find<00:00:32.080> sort

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080 
I'll try to do it close up and find sort

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.710 
I'll try to do it close up and find sort
of<00:00:33.140> how<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.260> color<00:00:33.560> changes

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.520 

kind<00:00:37.720> of<00:00:37.810> hard<00:00:37.960> to<00:00:38.050> film<00:00:39.990> but<00:00:40.990> as<00:00:41.200> you<00:00:41.260> can<00:00:41.380> see

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
kind of hard to film but as you can see

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.750 
kind of hard to film but as you can see
it's<00:00:41.650> primarily<00:00:42.160> blue<00:00:43.650> try<00:00:44.650> to<00:00:44.710> get<00:00:44.860> how<00:00:45.730> it

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
it's primarily blue try to get how it

00:00:45.760 --> 00:01:08.999 
it's primarily blue try to get how it
changes<00:00:46.210> to<00:00:46.480> purple

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.039 

I<00:01:10.259> think<00:01:11.259> that's<00:01:11.469> showing<00:01:11.890> some<00:01:12.100> purple<00:01:12.579> now

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
I think that's showing some purple now

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.600 
I think that's showing some purple now
you<00:01:14.049> can<00:01:14.229> see<00:01:14.439> when<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.649> lights<00:01:14.829> really<00:01:15.369> on<00:01:15.460> it

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
you can see when the lights really on it

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.740 
you can see when the lights really on it
it<00:01:15.729> shows<00:01:15.909> purple<00:01:16.329> most<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.259> time<00:01:18.570> more<00:01:19.570> of<00:01:19.659> a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
it shows purple most the time more of a

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.389 
it shows purple most the time more of a
blue<00:01:20.079> yeah<00:01:21.070> there<00:01:21.369> it<00:01:21.460> is<00:01:21.549> there's<00:01:21.789> a<00:01:21.850> purple

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
blue yeah there it is there's a purple

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.190 
blue yeah there it is there's a purple
so<00:01:24.399> it'll<00:01:24.729> show<00:01:24.909> purple<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:25.509> sometimes<00:01:25.869> green

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
so it'll show purple and sometimes green

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.190 
so it'll show purple and sometimes green
