on the second half of the season we've
always<00:02:14.570> preached<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.140> fact<00:02:15.350> that<00:02:15.550> we<00:02:16.550> have<00:02:16.670> to

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
always preached the fact that we have to

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.790 
always preached the fact that we have to
stop<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.210> run<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.690> earn<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.290> right<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.500> rush

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800

them<00:02:18.980> third<00:02:19.160> down<00:02:19.400> wait<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.360> win<00:02:20.540> first<00:02:20.810> and

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
them third down wait to win first and

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.600 
them third down wait to win first and
second<00:02:21.350> down<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.800> put<00:02:22.400> them<00:02:22.490> in<00:02:22.550> a

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
second down and put them in a

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.220 
second down and put them in a
third-and-long<00:02:23.060> situation<00:02:23.780> where<00:02:23.960> we<00:02:24.080> know

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
third-and-long situation where we know

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.440 
third-and-long situation where we know
they're<00:02:25.100> not<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.460> throw<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.060> ball<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.300> get

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
they're not to throw the ball to get

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.699 
they're not to throw the ball to get
this<00:02:26.570> first<00:02:26.750> down<00:02:26.960> and<00:02:27.170> that's<00:02:27.290> when<00:02:27.560> we

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
this first down and that's when we

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.740 
this first down and that's when we
really<00:02:28.550> are<00:02:28.700> pinner<00:02:28.970> years<00:02:29.240> back<00:02:29.480> and

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
really are pinner years back and

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.960 
really are pinner years back and
quarterback<00:02:30.560> probably<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.610> biggest<00:02:31.820> thing

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
quarterback probably the biggest thing

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.120 
quarterback probably the biggest thing
is<00:02:32.270> their<00:02:32.480> combination<00:02:33.350> of<00:02:33.470> speed<00:02:33.740> and<00:02:33.800> power

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
is their combination of speed and power

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.010 
is their combination of speed and power
really<00:02:34.520> I<00:02:34.820> mean<00:02:35.120> they<00:02:35.300> have<00:02:35.420> some<00:02:35.600> athletes

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
really I mean they have some athletes

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.330 
really I mean they have some athletes
they<00:02:36.170> got<00:02:36.320> some<00:02:36.500> guys<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.680> couldn't<00:02:37.070> if<00:02:37.220> they

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
they got some guys I couldn't if they

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.310 
they got some guys I couldn't if they
get<00:02:37.490> on<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.700> edge<00:02:37.850> they'll<00:02:38.209> outrun<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:38.840> and

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
get on the edge they'll outrun you and

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.750 
get on the edge they'll outrun you and
they'll<00:02:39.500> go<00:02:39.530> they'll<00:02:39.920> go<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.190> distance<00:02:40.340> but

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
they'll go they'll go the distance but

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.060 
they'll go they'll go the distance but
then<00:02:41.120> they're<00:02:41.900> not<00:02:41.990> just<00:02:42.200> kind<00:02:42.500> of<00:02:42.560> an<00:02:42.740> edge

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
then they're not just kind of an edge

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.310
