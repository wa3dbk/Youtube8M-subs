00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 this e3 was going to be great they said that we 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.810
 they were going to show all the best of the bully 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.179
 gentlemen said this e3 was my oldest 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.920
 disappointment of the year there were only a couple of 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.710
 announcements that really called me the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.960
 attention that are the pikmin 3 and 1 that already 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.630
 it was known that it was the wii and mansion of the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.420
 3ds the rest titles of which already 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.820
 We knew and to change refried of mario 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.640
 2 for this year one for side and another 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.250
 for the 3ds and that there is df zero that there is 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.140
 Metroid had no illusions to see the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.360
 first f zero in ten years but 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.460
 They preferred to show refritos and ports with 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.469
 other subtitles I do not know about you but 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.540
 I hope that in the following months 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.640
 show something that makes it worth it 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.590
 what the innovative console will cost 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.780
 at the moment they are just as bad at home 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.820
 that as it was the 3ds I thought they had 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.739
 learned from his mistake but it seems that at 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.899
 See that your fan voice is happy 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.180
 They decided to do the same although good 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.190
 Relaxing a bit, I hope that we 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.500
 show something to buy the bulli 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.120
 later because I do not know what 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.399
 shown today I do not call anything the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.530
 good attention for those who 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.909
 like the refried ones the new super mario 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.640
 bros 2 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.009
 on August 17 in the united states so 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.289
 fanboys go collecting their tickets 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.359
 in addition to the announcement of nintendo land that 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.340
 it will be a compendium of mini games based 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:19.770
 in the franchises like luigi's mansion 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.780
 or cell the confirmation of batman arkham 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.179
 city ​​for which it will be a supposed 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.640
 nothing special edition also 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:29.340
 announced zombie that it will be something like 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.560
 resident evil calm not those of now 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.049
 at least they will have zombies that do look 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.659
 zombies and to the rejoicing of several is 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.759
 for exclusive or even not known whether 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.920
 be temporary or permanent and the truth 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.140
 It looks like the titles you need to 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.110
 win the market advance loops 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.969
 enrolled and a taken that will use items from 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.739
 mario not like today's garbage like 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.629
 'resident' and ball operation assaulting you 

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:53.909
 wallet that is garbage that neither for 

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:56.129
 clean the butt serves already then 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.679
 I'll talk about that that title next to 

00:01:56.129 --> 00:02:00.659
 batman the nintendo land and the picking 3 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.409
 They are the only ones who called me the 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.659
 Attention 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.450
 in summary nintendo did not show us anything 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.220
 attractive this 3 but hopefully in 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.829
 these months give us something that is worth the 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.870
 sorry to buy it now yes the subject that 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:15.930
 I wanted to take this out, they told me 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.330
 almost a year ago you are a fool they are the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.580
 You play sure as you dare to 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.319
 get in touch with the speaker when they try 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.720
 they always go beyond graphics 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.480
 giving us new experiences are not a 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.819
 high definition you are an improvement that 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.930
 they have never raised anything they always put 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.329
 new stuff 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.000
 you are a complete ignorant nintendo and 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.890
 it will be easy to lose attention with this not 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.769
 I mean, nintendo has come back 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.810
 plagiarist proves he's on nintendo 3ds 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.299
 but if you have to emphasize that they 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.609
 they have also copied and very shamelessly 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.829
 and logical luso fanboys do not say anything 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.769
 let's start with the most recent plagiarism and 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:55.140
 cheeky in the pre e3 where iwata spoke 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.450
 about the functions of voodoo presented a 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.670
 I command something like the classic control 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.859
 of bubi and like me if I play other 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.010
 platforms I immediately noticed that it was 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.930
 too similar to the xbox control 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.879
 360 of insurance you at this moment 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.099
 they are saying or thinking about commenting 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.720
 this is a coincidence 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.609
 I swear by my ship this is a simple 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.620
 coincidence this command is just one 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.520
 adaptation this this is plagiarism 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.130
 this does not 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.990
 I swear this is just coincidence 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.760
 happy but castles the positions of 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.740
 the buttons are similar is a simple 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.360
 computer match 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.850
 it is very little mother that 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.770
 nintendo has copied that design although 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.930
 could have made one like the bubi 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.210
 which is similar to super nintendo 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.040
 that one was very good just that it was 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.320
 annoyed that the cable was in the 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.630
 lower part could have put that 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.220
 well they say that if it's broken do not repair it 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.170
 It is the next game 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.510
 it seems to me a very brazen copy of 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.850
 turn and this with tweed is she before the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.220
 fanboys commented on this leave and the menu 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.800
 of the game for tickets as you can 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.590
 have fun killing extraterrestrials besides 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.800
 what is that not some young man to hahahahaha 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.440
 so fucking sex boxers big is better then 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.080
 that does not yield that if it makes you think 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.420
 be something not like those horns that are 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.460
 are for toasts forever alone ha ha ha 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.590
 assholes without social life 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.260
 I find a very shameless copy 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.480
 similarities are too many extraterrestrials 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.940
 who attack your planet have armor 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.460
 more technologically advanced than you 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.620
 weapons of futuristic touches please 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.539
 he who says that it is not a plagiarism 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.880
 it can be more funk boy is very similar 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:32.160
 nothing else they lack a title that 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.830
 similar to go software and completed the 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.020
 something else the nintenderos boast 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.120
 that the command of the guru is novel 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.800
 I know you but it seems to me only a 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.560
 'ipad' with buttons and one or two 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.050
 added if it innovates in the industry but 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.270
 do not exaggerate nintendo ds was not the 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.639
 first touch screen console like 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.720
 you believe before was the teaser of 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:57.599
 atari had touch screen came out in 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.580
 1994 the elector of playstation 2 was the 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:02.039
 first movement control and not the 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.199
 weymouth as many fans boast and 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.150
 because he talked about this because a lot of fans 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.430
 they got mad at the fights game 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.620
 zombie that I recognize it is copy of 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.419
 smash bros but why did not they say anything 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.699
 of the crossover that also allowed 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.610
 fights of 4 that was between one piece 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.130
 naruto and dragon ball z I leave you homework 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.319
 think before speaking I say goodbye to 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.990
 Knowing that this video will be voted 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:27.060
 negative by the postsdata fanboys if you go 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.289
 to make some offensive comment on 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.629
 relation to the video 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.689
 but the only thing that will be achieved is that you 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:37.189
 I deleted only allow comments 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:37.189
 argumentatives see you in another video
