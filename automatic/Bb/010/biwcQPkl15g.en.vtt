will it be better hairs like even more
better<00:01:03.120> here<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:04.110> yeah<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.339> good<00:01:05.760> quality

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
better here but yeah it's good quality

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.640 
better here but yeah it's good quality
here<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.580> is<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.909> when<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.450> go<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> wind<00:01:10.409> it

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
here it is it when you go in the wind it

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:20.060 
here it is it when you go in the wind it
flows<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.970> think<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:18.470> if<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.799> want

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.399 
flows and I think that that if you want
to<00:01:20.189> not<00:01:20.610> spend<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.299> much<00:01:21.450> money<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.170> that
