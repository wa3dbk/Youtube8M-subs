using a very nice 451 team in guys for

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.300 
using a very nice 451 team in guys for
some<00:03:36.810> reason<00:03:37.170> any<00:03:37.320> time<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.590> come<00:03:37.830> up<00:03:37.920> against<00:03:38.190> a

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
some reason any time I come up against a

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.390 
some reason any time I come up against a
four<00:03:38.640> for<00:03:38.880> two<00:03:39.120> or<00:03:39.270> four<00:03:39.450> five<00:03:39.930> one<00:03:40.260> it's<00:03:41.220> not

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
four for two or four five one it's not

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.759 
four for two or four five one it's not
that<00:03:41.459> their<00:03:41.850> attack<00:03:42.239> bothers<00:03:43.110> me<00:03:43.290> it's<00:03:43.530> there

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
that their attack bothers me it's there

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.470 
that their attack bothers me it's there
defending<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.489> don't<00:03:45.000> know<00:03:45.090> what<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.330> is<00:03:45.360> I

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
defending I don't know what it is I

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.940 
defending I don't know what it is I
think<00:03:45.780> it's<00:03:45.900> because<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.290> midfield<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.800> so

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
think it's because the midfield is so

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.520 
think it's because the midfield is so
congested<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:47.730> my<00:03:47.940> pants<00:03:48.300> my<00:03:48.780> passing<00:03:49.320> lanes

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
congested and my pants my passing lanes

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.729 
congested and my pants my passing lanes
are<00:03:49.739> all<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:50.250> guess<00:03:50.760> covered<00:03:51.209> I<00:03:51.870> find<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.709> very

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
are all I guess covered I find it a very

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.250 
are all I guess covered I find it a very
hard<00:03:53.370> difficult<00:03:53.820> time<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.120> score<00:03:54.360> here<00:03:54.959> we<00:03:55.110> get

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
hard difficult time to score here we get

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.500
