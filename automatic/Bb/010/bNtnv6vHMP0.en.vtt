the<00:01:03.120> parking<00:01:03.539> brake<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.229> get

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the parking brake on so you can get

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.740 
the parking brake on so you can get
these<00:01:04.530> three<00:01:04.890> get<00:01:05.489> those<00:01:05.700> three<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.619> then

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
these three get those three and then

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.850 
these three get those three and then
take<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> parking<00:01:10.080> brake<00:01:10.200> off<00:01:10.320> turn<00:01:10.710> them

take the parking brake off turn them

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.289 
take the parking brake off turn them
both<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.549> get<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.760> other<00:01:11.909> three<00:01:12.150> on

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
both so you can get the other three on

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.109 
both so you can get the other three on
the<00:01:12.390> other<00:01:12.510> side<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.260> parking<00:01:13.590> brake<00:01:13.740> on

they're<00:01:15.119> gonna<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.330> pretty<00:01:15.509> tight<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:16.740> just

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
they're gonna be pretty tight so we just

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.859 
they're gonna be pretty tight so we just
use<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.250> leverage<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.759> get<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.659> really

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
use the leverage and get it really

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.420 
use the leverage and get it really
square<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.560> pull<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.830> they'll<00:01:19.979> come<00:01:20.100> off<00:01:20.189> no

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
square and pull and they'll come off no

and these usual Drive axles should pop
right<00:02:47.100> off<00:02:47.340> not<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.390> said<00:02:48.600> with<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.780> hammer

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
right off not you said with a hammer

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.140 
right off not you said with a hammer
it'll<00:02:49.200> come<00:02:49.350> off<00:02:49.470> once<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.370> angles<00:02:50.730> marrying

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
it'll come off once the angles marrying

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.460 
it'll come off once the angles marrying
little<00:02:51.360> low<00:02:51.450> down<00:02:51.720> they<00:02:51.989> don't<00:02:52.080> have<00:02:52.230> any

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
little low down they don't have any

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.070 
little low down they don't have any
choice<00:02:52.769> but<00:02:53.010> they<00:02:53.190> really<00:02:53.430> come<00:02:53.580> off<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.870> pop

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
choice but they really come off and pop

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.380 
choice but they really come off and pop
themselves<00:02:55.530> off<00:02:58.790> once<00:02:59.790> you<00:02:59.880> lower<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.209> drive
