wondering what the fuck am i doing well

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.839 
wondering what the fuck am i doing well
this<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.590> little<00:00:13.889> tactic<00:00:14.280> here<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.730> I've

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
this is a little tactic here that I've

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.670 
this is a little tactic here that I've
pulled<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.330> from<00:00:15.599> games<00:00:15.870> such<00:00:16.139> as<00:00:16.170> Counter

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
pulled in from games such as Counter

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.710 
pulled in from games such as Counter
Strike<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.490> Richthofen<00:00:18.090> call<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.449> duty

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
Strike and of Richthofen call of duty

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.960 
Strike and of Richthofen call of duty
and<00:00:19.289> you'll<00:00:19.529> see<00:00:19.740> me<00:00:19.890> as<00:00:20.039> jumping<00:00:20.699> when<00:00:20.850> I'm

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
and you'll see me as jumping when I'm

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.230 
and you'll see me as jumping when I'm
running<00:00:21.150> around<00:00:21.420> constantly<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:23.090> this<00:00:24.090> is

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
running around constantly and this is

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.599 
running around constantly and this is
also<00:00:24.390> kind<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.230> like<00:00:25.470> bunnyhopping<00:00:25.920> as<00:00:26.430> it

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
also kind of like bunnyhopping as it

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.099 
also kind of like bunnyhopping as it
seemed<00:00:26.849> from<00:00:27.000> counter-strike<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:27.900> you've

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
seemed from counter-strike if you've

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.230 
seemed from counter-strike if you've
ever<00:00:28.710> played<00:00:28.859> counter-strike<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.699> basically

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
ever played counter-strike and basically

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.849 
ever played counter-strike and basically
bunny-hopping<00:00:30.660> helps<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.439> move<00:00:31.590> around

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
bunny-hopping helps you move around

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.420 
bunny-hopping helps you move around
faster<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.610> makes<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.880> harder<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.329> hit<00:00:34.430> it

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
faster it makes you harder to hit it

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.130 
faster it makes you harder to hit it
allows<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.969> check<00:00:36.270> your<00:00:36.329> corners<00:00:36.899> better

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
allows you to check your corners better

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.020 
allows you to check your corners better
and<00:00:37.410> kind<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.620> move<00:00:37.829> places<00:00:38.340> quicker<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:38.940> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
and kind of move places quicker it's a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.790 
and kind of move places quicker it's a
very<00:00:39.270> very<00:00:39.540> helpful<00:00:39.780> tactic<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.530> you'll<00:00:40.620> see

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
very very helpful tactic and you'll see

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.889 
very very helpful tactic and you'll see
me<00:00:40.920> using<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.340> throughout<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.390> whole<00:00:42.600> thing

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
me using it throughout this whole thing

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.860 
me using it throughout this whole thing
I<00:00:44.000> tested<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.059> out<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.329> someone<00:00:45.539> running

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
I tested it out with someone running

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.840 
I tested it out with someone running
straight<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.410> start<00:00:46.920> at<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.070> same<00:00:47.309> spot<00:00:47.640> they

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
straight on start at the same spot they

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.940 
straight on start at the same spot they
ran<00:00:48.059> straight<00:00:48.390> i<00:00:48.450> bunnyhop<00:00:49.079> got<00:00:49.320> there<00:00:49.559> faster

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
ran straight i bunnyhop got there faster

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.740 
ran straight i bunnyhop got there faster
than<00:00:50.100> them<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.730> not<00:00:50.910> really<00:00:51.180> bunny<00:00:51.480> hopping

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
than them it's not really bunny hopping

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.990 
than them it's not really bunny hopping
you're<00:00:52.050> not<00:00:52.170> hopping<00:00:52.800> around<00:00:53.039> every<00:00:53.520> second

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
you're not hopping around every second

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.080 
you're not hopping around every second
alright<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:55.440> do<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.800> hop<00:00:56.010> kind<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.760> give<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
alright you do the hop kind of give it a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.670 
alright you do the hop kind of give it a
split<00:00:57.390> second<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.780> then<00:00:57.870> hop<00:00:58.140> again<00:00:58.289> or<00:00:58.590> else

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
split second and then hop again or else

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.650 
split second and then hop again or else
you<00:00:58.890> actually<00:00:59.219> go<00:00:59.340> slower<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.390> got<00:01:00.570> to

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
you actually go slower so you got to

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.180 
you actually go slower so you got to
time<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:00.930> right<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.469> you'll<00:01:01.590> see<00:01:01.620> me<00:01:01.949> right

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
time it right and you'll see me right

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.529 
time it right and you'll see me right
here<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.730> an<00:01:02.879> example<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.329> where<00:01:03.510> it

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
here this is an example of where it

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.780 
here this is an example of where it
would<00:01:03.750> go<00:01:03.899> great<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.489> tight

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
would go great it's just in tight

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.399 
would go great it's just in tight
quarters<00:01:06.119> hopping<00:01:06.720> around<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.140> makes<00:01:07.290> you

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
quarters hopping around and makes you

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.620 
quarters hopping around and makes you
harder<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.860> hit<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.549> kind<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.210> gives<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
harder to hit it kind of gives you a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.840 
harder to hit it kind of gives you a
more<00:01:09.960> aggressive<00:01:10.560> play<00:01:10.740> style<00:01:10.890> allows<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.700> to

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
more aggressive play style allows you to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.880 
more aggressive play style allows you to
turn<00:01:12.390> around<00:01:12.810> faster<00:01:13.380> when<00:01:13.560> you're<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
turn around faster when you're in the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.460 
turn around faster when you're in the
air<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.400> all<00:01:14.490> sorts<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.880> stuff<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.290> go

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
air and all sorts of stuff you can go

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.320 
air and all sorts of stuff you can go
around<00:01:16.590> corners<00:01:17.070> faster<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.060> really

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
around corners faster and you really

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.010 
around corners faster and you really
really<00:01:18.540> want<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.900> time<00:01:19.140> these<00:01:19.820> hops<00:01:20.820> right<00:01:21.020> so

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
really want to time these hops right so

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.990 
really want to time these hops right so
they<00:01:22.170> again<00:01:22.830> like<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.130> said<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:23.850> them

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
they again like I said if you do them

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.700 
they again like I said if you do them
too<00:01:24.210> quickly<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.869> will<00:01:24.960> actually<00:01:25.170> slow<00:01:25.680> down

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
too quickly you will actually slow down

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.429 
too quickly you will actually slow down
and<00:01:26.220> go<00:01:26.310> slower<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.299> gotta<00:01:27.509> got<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.290> kind

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
and go slower so you gotta got to kind

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.370 
and go slower so you gotta got to kind
of<00:01:28.530> get<00:01:28.650> them<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:29.450> perfect<00:01:30.450> timing

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
of get them to go perfect timing

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.469 
of get them to go perfect timing
it's<00:01:31.890> kind<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.369> get<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> feel<00:01:32.880> for<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.299> it's

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
it's kind of you get a feel for it it's

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.999 
it's kind of you get a feel for it it's
not<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.840> hard<00:01:34.079> as<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.650> Counter<00:01:34.979> Strike

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
not as hard as it is in Counter Strike

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.620 
not as hard as it is in Counter Strike
it's<00:01:35.400> actually<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.759> mean<00:01:35.970> really<00:01:36.180> easy<00:01:36.420> you're

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630

there and the thing you have to be

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.990 
there and the thing you have to be
careful<00:03:42.980> is<00:03:43.130> is<00:03:43.340> when<00:03:43.520> you're<00:03:43.610> coming<00:03:43.760> up<00:03:43.970> the

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
careful is is when you're coming up the
