 apricot 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.170
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.240
 catch a mold we have caught 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.440
 you can spread it on butter 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:41.260
 we have heard has been this role 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.190
 of oven and now we put it here like this 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.950
 we avoid the butter we are going to take one of 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.230
 the masses 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.090
 we put it carefully here with a lot 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.540
 we are going to open it and we are going to 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.060
 give the form 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.750
 have our mold 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.520
 you will see that it is a very easy recipe 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.380
 very fast and that is very good going to 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.750
 to surprise 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.770
 how easy it is and how good it is 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.570
 in the end 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.100
 Well, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.859
 remove the skin from the apple and now 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.859
 we are going to cut into very thin slices 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.860
 at the same time that the wheels are very finite 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.330
 because this is going to go now what if 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.300
 we make chubby for the apple goes to 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.340
 get raw 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.380
 We put to heat while the oven to 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.230
 180 degrees for about 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.140
 15 to 20 minutes once we have the 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.560
 apple cut we're going to put it in the 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.560
 mold 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.640
 that cover all 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.580
 we do with apples if 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:54.170
 you want to make with another fruit I have not 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.460
 tried but good if the own 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.500
 we also do it 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.500
 there is no hole without apple 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.960
 once the whole apple is put 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.960
 let's catch the butter 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.430
 and we are going to put pieces 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.430
 butter cooking distributed 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.370
 good as you see we have the whole cake 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.680
 stuffed with lard now let's catch 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.070
 I do not have sifted but well I get it 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.410
 with a tiny colander we take a 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.890
 teaspoon of sugar and we're going to 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.880
 distribute well for the whole cake 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.880
 to have sight 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.150
 Oh 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.519
 and now the same with cinnamon cinnamon 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.709
 something that you like more cinnamon can 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.550
 that he throw more than he liked less a 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.410
 less cinnamon 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.790
 and do not be afraid at the time of this is the 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.790
 cinnamon because the new one is going to dissolve 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.140
 and you will not know cinnamon so much 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.620
 because if we have more cameras and 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.620
 overwhelming 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.970
 and once we have the cinnamon we're going 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.970
 to throw the apricot jam 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.310
 doctor case 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.750
 well this is the aspect of our 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:50.080
 cake with apple sugar cinnamon 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.990
 and the apricot we now take in the 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.410
 another puff pastry and we're going to put it well 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.410
 above 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.300
 let's go finishing and giving it the form 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.300
 so pretty 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:19.870
 As you can see, the form is already given 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.870
 now we make you little hairline 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.820
 we make sure that the oven is 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:34.490
 hot when it's hot we 're going to 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.490
 put in let's make a few heads 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.740
 and you'll see how he's going to say u, how easy 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.050
 and how good now we are going to put it 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.960
 baked 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.060
 with the oven already hot at 180 degrees and 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.979
 we put the cake and we will leave 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.039
 about 20 minutes too 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.810
 to 180 degrees anyway when I 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.699
 let's go to get it out, we puncture it a little bit 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.280
 the knife will never come out clean but 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.919
 when we see that the texture is 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.240
 Crunchy of the dough is when it is 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:11.690
 ready 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.819

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.900
 seen that this was already golden brown and 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:19.430
