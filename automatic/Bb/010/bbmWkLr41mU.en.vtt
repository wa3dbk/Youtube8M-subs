at<00:00:39.600> there's<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.170> be<00:00:40.200> about<00:00:40.800> 10<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.300> 15

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
at there's going to be about 10 to 15

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.959 
at there's going to be about 10 to 15
thrayl<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.440> come<00:00:43.649> through<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.219> throw<00:00:44.910> all

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
of the easiest enemies to do this on in

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.459 
of the easiest enemies to do this on in
this<00:00:47.550> particular<00:00:47.820> area<00:00:48.270> they<00:00:48.989> all<00:00:49.140> line<00:00:49.440> up

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469

this particular area they all line up
for<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:51.860> it's<00:00:52.860> really<00:00:53.129> easy<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.699> really

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
for you so it's really easy and really

for you so it's really easy and really
quick<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.239> finish<00:00:54.719> here<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.680> easiest

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
quick to finish here this is the easiest

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.760 
quick to finish here this is the easiest
spot<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.430> found<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.059> far<00:00:57.170> it's<00:00:58.170> probably<00:00:58.469> it's

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
spot I found so far it's probably it's

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.740 
spot I found so far it's probably it's
very<00:00:59.070> efficient<00:00:59.670> takes<00:00:59.969> maybe<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.420> three

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
very efficient takes maybe like three

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.799 
very efficient takes maybe like three
minutes<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.230> do<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.739> if<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.699> need<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.180> respawn

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
minutes to do and if you need to respawn

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.960 
minutes to do and if you need to respawn
and<00:01:04.110> kill<00:01:04.559> more<00:01:04.769> thrill<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.309> get<00:01:05.460> more<00:01:05.580> double

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
and kill more thrill and get more double

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.580 
and kill more thrill and get more double
kills<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.360> could<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.570> die<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.110> area

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
kills you could just die in this area

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.160 
kills you could just die in this area
and<00:01:07.860> it'll<00:01:08.700> respawn<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.630> very<00:01:09.869> first

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
and it'll respawn you on the very first

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.929 
and it'll respawn you on the very first
wave<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.100> could<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.460> rinse<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.850> repeat

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
wave so you could just rinse and repeat

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.679 
wave so you could just rinse and repeat
it's<00:01:12.450> super<00:01:13.110> easy<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.340> takes<00:01:14.580> about<00:01:14.729> less

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
it's super easy and it takes about less

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.620 
it's super easy and it takes about less
than<00:01:15.930> 30<00:01:16.140> seconds<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.710> get<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.130> part

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
than 30 seconds to get to this part

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.190 
than 30 seconds to get to this part
anyways<00:01:18.630> I'm<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.740> peace<00:01:20.369> your<00:01:21.000> hybrids<00:01:21.479> said

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
anyways I'm out peace your hybrids said

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.900 
anyways I'm out peace your hybrids said
to<00:01:22.380> be<00:01:22.560> uncrackable

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:51.470 

you<00:01:28.910> know<00:01:29.060> we're<00:01:29.210> here<00:01:29.420> I'll<00:01:30.230> get<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.500> work

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.290 

I'm<00:01:52.260> starting<00:01:52.650> to<00:01:52.680> sense<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.040> pattern

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
I'm starting to sense a pattern

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.600 
I'm starting to sense a pattern
shouldn't<00:01:54.300> be<00:01:54.420> long
