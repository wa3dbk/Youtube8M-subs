towards<00:01:16.979> dribbling<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.490> usually<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.180> like

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
towards dribbling and usually just like

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.480 
towards dribbling and usually just like
moves<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.439> ball<00:01:19.590> too<00:01:19.860> far<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.159> front<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.400> them

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
moves the ball too far in front of them

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.340

got the left several time midfielder
Gerrard<00:03:25.740> and<00:03:26.090> he<00:03:27.090> has<00:03:27.660> my<00:03:28.050> 89<00:03:28.590> passing<00:03:29.160> which

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
Gerrard and he has my 89 passing which

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.910 
Gerrard and he has my 89 passing which
was<00:03:29.459> really<00:03:29.790> really<00:03:30.060> good<00:03:30.150> each<00:03:30.690> each<00:03:31.050> 87<00:03:31.770> shot

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
was really really good each each 87 shot

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.140 
was really really good each each 87 shot
as<00:03:32.010> well<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:32.370> think<00:03:32.400> he's<00:03:32.640> power<00:03:32.820> someone

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
as well and I think he's power someone

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.630 
as well and I think he's power someone
like<00:03:33.270> 1995<00:03:34.050> so<00:03:34.890> he's<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.959> really<00:03:36.959> kind<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.640> well

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
like 1995 so he's a really kind of well

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.630 
like 1995 so he's a really kind of well
overall<00:03:39.090> good<00:03:39.630> overall<00:03:40.520> well-rounded<00:03:41.520> player

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
overall good overall well-rounded player
