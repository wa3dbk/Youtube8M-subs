I've been to this conference for three
days<00:02:43.590> holy<00:02:44.010> cow<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.640> got<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.880> whole<00:02:45.150> list<00:02:45.329> of

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
days holy cow I got a whole list of

days holy cow I got a whole list of
things<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:46.680> we've<00:02:46.829> got<00:02:46.859> to<00:02:47.010> change<00:02:47.370> the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
things that we've got to change the

things that we've got to change the
resistance<00:02:48.450> will<00:02:48.750> be<00:02:48.920> powerful<00:02:50.120> if<00:02:51.120> we<00:02:51.329> are

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
resistance will be powerful if we are

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.539 
resistance will be powerful if we are
frozen<00:02:51.959> in<00:02:52.380> our<00:02:52.500> models<00:02:52.980> relative<00:02:53.430> to

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
create learning environments if we're

create learning environments if we're

great university is and then we're in

somebody<00:03:06.680> said<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:06.950> me<00:03:07.069> yesterday<00:03:07.430> that<00:03:08.410> they

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.380 
had not ever been to a conference like
this<00:03:12.220> that's<00:03:13.220> because<00:03:13.700> there's<00:03:14.000> never<00:03:14.269> been

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
this that's because there's never been
