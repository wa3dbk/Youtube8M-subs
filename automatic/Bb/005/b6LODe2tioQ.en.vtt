pretty much like that the solo and

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.600 
pretty much like that the solo and
turnin<00:01:43.840> left<00:01:44.050> since<00:01:44.500> it's<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:44.770> live<00:01:44.950> track<00:01:45.370> was

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
turnin left since it's a live track was

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.969 
turnin left since it's a live track was
just<00:01:45.820> improvised<00:01:46.300> so<00:01:46.600> I<00:01:46.840> don't<00:01:47.680> memorize

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
just improvised so I don't memorize

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.130 
just improvised so I don't memorize
those<00:01:48.370> things<00:01:48.700> I<00:01:48.909> played<00:01:49.119> it<00:01:49.300> we<00:01:49.750> played<00:01:49.990> that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
those things I played it we played that

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.780 
those things I played it we played that
song<00:01:50.350> three<00:01:50.680> times<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.310> was<00:01:51.460> just<00:01:51.670> a

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
song three times and that was just a

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.969 
song three times and that was just a
third<00:01:52.000> one<00:01:52.210> that<00:01:52.360> came<00:01:52.570> out<00:01:52.750> so<00:01:53.080> but<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:53.770> guess

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
third one that came out so but I guess

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.590 
third one that came out so but I guess
what<00:01:54.190> I'm<00:01:54.310> thinking<00:01:54.340> of<00:01:54.790> is<00:01:56.490> we<00:01:57.490> modulate<00:01:57.759> we

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
what I'm thinking of is we modulate we

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.940 
what I'm thinking of is we modulate we
go<00:01:58.780> down<00:01:58.990> to<00:01:59.950> our<00:01:59.979> f-sharp<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:01.650> I'm<00:02:02.650> really

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
go down to our f-sharp and I'm really

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.140 
go down to our f-sharp and I'm really
just<00:02:03.130> thinking<00:02:03.520> about<00:02:03.640> playing<00:02:05.610> my<00:02:06.610> 16th

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
just thinking about playing my 16th

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:23.400 
just thinking about playing my 16th
notes<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:08.310> I'm<00:02:09.310> thinking

with<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.810> couple<00:03:02.110> of<00:03:02.170> blue<00:03:02.350> notes<00:03:02.590> thrown<00:03:02.920> in

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
with a couple of blue notes thrown in

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.310 
with a couple of blue notes thrown in
there<00:03:03.310> then<00:03:04.210> at<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.450> end<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.780> song

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
there then at the end of the song

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.410 
there then at the end of the song
the<00:03:05.500> second<00:03:05.890> solo<00:03:06.190> that's<00:03:06.850> really<00:03:07.240> crazy

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
the second solo that's really crazy

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.230 
the second solo that's really crazy
there's<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.900> lot<00:03:08.080> of<00:03:08.170> feedback<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:09.150> open<00:03:10.150> the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
there's a lot of feedback I open the

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.480 
there's a lot of feedback I open the
doors<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.140> speaker<00:03:11.560> cabinet<00:03:12.070> so<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:12.250> was

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
doors to the speaker cabinet so I was

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.060 
doors to the speaker cabinet so I was
just<00:03:12.520> turning<00:03:12.850> around<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.590> facing<00:03:14.590> the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
just turning around and facing the

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.820 
just turning around and facing the
cabinet's<00:03:15.580> with<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:15.790> guitar<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.330> get<00:03:16.480> feedback

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
cabinet's with a guitar to get feedback

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.560 
cabinet's with a guitar to get feedback
I'm<00:03:17.830> doing<00:03:18.100> some<00:03:18.250> crazy<00:03:18.460> things<00:03:18.910> with<00:03:19.060> Sam<00:03:19.330> I'm

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
I'm doing some crazy things with Sam I'm

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:26.630 
I'm doing some crazy things with Sam I'm
playing<00:03:19.810> these<00:03:22.830> trying<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:23.890> get<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.160> high

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.190 

getting<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.700> high<00:03:27.880> B<00:03:28.120> harmonics<00:03:28.750> there<00:03:28.960> with

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
getting the high B harmonics there with

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.970 
getting the high B harmonics there with
Sam<00:03:29.440> I<00:03:29.800> think<00:03:30.220> I<00:03:30.370> even<00:03:30.400> didn't<00:03:30.880> I<00:03:31.590> went<00:03:32.590> right

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
Sam I think I even didn't I went right

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.110 
Sam I think I even didn't I went right
about<00:03:33.190> here<00:03:33.430> so<00:03:34.860> I<00:03:35.860> could<00:03:36.130> get<00:03:36.280> it<00:03:36.430> in<00:03:36.610> key<00:03:36.940> of

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
about here so I could get it in key of

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.690 
about here so I could get it in key of
being<00:03:37.410> know<00:03:38.410> that<00:03:38.590> sounds<00:03:38.890> weird<00:03:38.950> but<00:03:39.340> I<00:03:41.700> did

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
being know that sounds weird but I did

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.220 
being know that sounds weird but I did
it<00:03:42.790> really<00:03:42.910> good<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.360> day<00:03:43.510> we<00:03:43.660> recorded<00:03:44.140> it

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
it really good that day we recorded it

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.750 
it really good that day we recorded it
but<00:03:44.410> that's<00:03:44.770> pretty<00:03:44.920> much<00:03:45.130> it<00:03:45.430> with<00:03:45.610> those

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
but that's pretty much it with those

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.130 
but that's pretty much it with those
tricks<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.390> never<00:03:46.570> know<00:03:46.720> how<00:03:46.900> they're<00:03:47.020> going

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
tricks you never know how they're going

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.920 
tricks you never know how they're going
to<00:03:47.200> turn<00:03:47.350> out<00:03:48.270> so<00:03:49.270> that's<00:03:49.420> about<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:49.660> for

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
to turn out so that's about it for

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.860 
to turn out so that's about it for
turning<00:03:50.230> left<00:03:50.640> alright<00:03:51.640> here<00:03:51.910> we<00:03:51.940> go<00:03:52.030> I'll<00:03:52.690> do

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
turning left alright here we go I'll do

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:16.250 
turning left alright here we go I'll do
it<00:03:53.020> kind<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.500> normal<00:03:53.680> speed

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.110 

now<00:04:17.260> second<00:04:17.680> time<00:04:17.830> around<00:04:18.100> that<00:04:18.310> riff<00:04:18.610> we<00:04:18.880> kind

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
now second time around that riff we kind

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:42.250 
now second time around that riff we kind
of<00:04:19.239> double<00:04:19.480> it<00:04:19.600> up

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.280 

there's<00:04:43.160> a<00:04:43.250> little<00:04:43.520> trick<00:04:43.880> that's<00:04:44.870> very

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
there's a little trick that's very

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.930 
there's a little trick that's very
subtle<00:04:45.590> with<00:04:45.920> this<00:04:46.070> because<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.670> song<00:04:46.910> is

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
subtle with this because the song is

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.450 
subtle with this because the song is
basically<00:04:47.450> a<00:04:47.570> riff<00:04:47.810> on<00:04:47.840> e<00:04:48.050> then<00:04:48.890> it<00:04:49.040> has<00:04:49.160> a<00:04:49.190> D

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
basically a riff on e then it has a D

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.690 
basically a riff on e then it has a D
chord<00:04:49.700> an<00:04:50.540> A<00:04:50.780> and<00:04:50.990> an<00:04:51.080> e<00:04:51.230> when<00:04:52.040> I<00:04:52.070> play<00:04:52.340> that<00:04:52.520> D

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
chord an A and an e when I play that D

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.430 
chord an A and an e when I play that D
chord<00:04:53.000> I<00:04:53.180> actually<00:04:53.390> hit<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.900> a<00:04:53.930> string<00:04:54.350> on

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
chord I actually hit the a string on

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.150 
chord I actually hit the a string on
purpose<00:04:54.890> so<00:04:55.220> it<00:04:55.340> goes

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.800 

so<00:05:00.730> you're<00:05:00.880> hearing<00:05:01.180> that<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:01.630> D<00:05:01.810> chord

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
so you're hearing that the D chord

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.470 
so you're hearing that the D chord
it<00:05:03.650> just<00:05:03.830> makes<00:05:04.040> it<00:05:04.160> really<00:05:04.220> wide<00:05:04.820> that<00:05:05.240> way

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
it just makes it really wide that way

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.690 
it just makes it really wide that way
and<00:05:05.990> then<00:05:06.139> when<00:05:06.290> we<00:05:06.410> go<00:05:06.560> to<00:05:06.620> the<00:05:06.800> a<00:05:06.830> it<00:05:07.340> doesn't

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
and then when we go to the a it doesn't

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.409 
and then when we go to the a it doesn't
sound<00:05:07.880> so<00:05:09.550> because<00:05:10.550> I'm<00:05:10.669> already<00:05:10.880> playing<00:05:11.210> the

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
sound so because I'm already playing the

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.330 
sound so because I'm already playing the
a<00:05:11.450> in<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:12.050> D<00:05:12.200> chord<00:05:13.840> just<00:05:14.840> gives<00:05:15.050> it<00:05:15.169> a<00:05:15.320> maybe<00:05:16.220> a

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
a in the D chord just gives it a maybe a

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.020 
a in the D chord just gives it a maybe a
sloppier<00:05:16.850> feel<00:05:17.620> but<00:05:18.620> the<00:05:18.830> whole<00:05:18.980> thing<00:05:19.190> is<00:05:19.220> to

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
sloppier feel but the whole thing is to

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.420 
sloppier feel but the whole thing is to
make<00:05:20.180> it<00:05:20.330> really<00:05:20.630> broad<00:05:21.169> very<00:05:21.500> wide<00:05:21.830> sounding

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
make it really broad very wide sounding

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.700 
make it really broad very wide sounding
