00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
made in advance bata tablespoons work

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.560 
made in advance bata tablespoons work
and<00:00:39.350> you<00:00:40.350> place<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.950> into<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.790> middle<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
and you place it into the middle of the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.520 
and you place it into the middle of the
batter<00:00:43.910> we<00:00:44.910> preheat<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.660> Onkel<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.110> little<00:00:46.379> bit

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
batter we preheat the Onkel a little bit

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.130 
batter we preheat the Onkel a little bit
so<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.890> way<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.550> batter<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.690> cooked<00:00:49.020> a

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
so that way the batter is cooked a

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.020 
so that way the batter is cooked a
little<00:00:49.289> more<00:00:49.530> evenly<00:00:55.430> don't<00:00:56.430> skimp<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
little more evenly don't skimp on the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.900 
little more evenly don't skimp on the
outcome

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:09.440

I dropped a few little better drops in
here<00:01:14.250> go<00:01:14.790> ahead<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:14.970> remove<00:01:15.180> those<00:01:15.510> before<00:01:16.050> we

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.640 

fill<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:21.619> other<00:01:22.619> side<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.190> mold<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:25.470> it's

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
fill the other side of the mold and it's

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.030 
fill the other side of the mold and it's
kind<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.100> pancakes<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:27.090> wait<00:01:27.300> till

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
kind of like pancakes you just wait till

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.760 
kind of like pancakes you just wait till
the<00:01:29.040> other<00:01:29.310> side<00:01:30.800> bubbles<00:01:31.800> stop<00:01:32.130> popping<00:01:33.770> then

the other side bubbles stop popping then

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:45.599 
the other side bubbles stop popping then
you<00:01:34.950> know<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.310> ready<00:01:35.550> to<00:01:35.670> flip

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:48.999 

now<00:01:47.350> one<00:01:48.350> of<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.530> things<00:01:48.740> that<00:01:48.890> I've<00:01:48.979> learned

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
now one of the things that I've learned

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.789 
now one of the things that I've learned
while<00:01:49.399> making<00:01:49.820> these<00:01:49.969> is<00:01:50.509> that<00:01:50.869> if<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:51.590> put

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
while making these is that if you put

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.499 
while making these is that if you put
the<00:01:51.950> batter<00:01:52.159> in<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.729> other<00:01:52.850> side<00:01:53.149> too

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
the batter in to the other side too

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.749 
the batter in to the other side too
early<00:01:53.990> sometimes<00:01:54.799> you<00:01:55.159> don't<00:01:55.340> get<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:55.549> good

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
early sometimes you don't get a good

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.480 
early sometimes you don't get a good
seal<00:01:56.119> all<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.479> way<00:01:56.780> around<00:01:57.200> or<00:01:57.439> sometimes<00:01:58.280> the

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
seal all the way around or sometimes the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.889 
seal all the way around or sometimes the
batter<00:01:58.700> will<00:01:58.850> be<00:01:58.939> so<00:01:59.149> wet<00:01:59.360> when<00:01:59.569> you<00:01:59.600> stick

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
batter will be so wet when you stick

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.350 
batter will be so wet when you stick
this<00:02:00.350> half<00:02:00.590> into<00:02:00.829> this<00:02:01.039> half<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.969> kind<00:02:02.270> of

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
this half into this half it kind of

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.099 
this half into this half it kind of
spills<00:02:02.659> out<00:02:02.959> so<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:04.069> got<00:02:04.250> to<00:02:04.340> let<00:02:04.549> it<00:02:05.109> the

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
spills out so you got to let it the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:12.759 
spills out so you got to let it the
first<00:02:06.439> side<00:02:06.679> heat<00:02:06.950> up<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.219> little<00:02:07.369> bit<00:02:11.769> and

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
first side heat up a little bit and

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.000 
first side heat up a little bit and
again<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.549> just<00:02:13.580> scoop<00:02:14.150> out<00:02:15.010> adequate

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
again you just scoop out adequate

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.280 
again you just scoop out adequate
amounts<00:02:16.579> of<00:02:16.760> pancake<00:02:17.750> batter<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:20.780> properly
