which leads of the potentiometer to so
we're<00:02:22.920> but<00:02:23.220> basically<00:02:23.610> you'll<00:02:24.060> sew<00:02:24.300> one<00:02:25.020> pin

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
we're but basically you'll sew one pin

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.650 
we're but basically you'll sew one pin
to<00:02:25.620> one<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.070> LED<00:02:26.520> pins<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.270> then<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
to one of the LED pins and then the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.510 
to one of the LED pins and then the
other<00:02:27.810> one<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.680> ground<00:02:28.980> at<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.280> other

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
other one to the ground at the other

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.490 
other one to the ground at the other
side<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.940> switch<00:02:30.300> repeat<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:31.200> for<00:02:31.440> all

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
side of the switch repeat this for all

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.630 
side of the switch repeat this for all
three<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:34.410> can<00:02:34.590> just<00:02:34.710> attach<00:02:34.860> your<00:02:35.190> pin<00:02:35.430> back

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
three you can just attach your pin back

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.370 
three you can just attach your pin back
with<00:02:35.850> hot<00:02:36.060> glue<00:02:36.240> wherever<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.840> want<00:02:37.050> on<00:02:37.230> the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
with hot glue wherever you want on the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:47.190 
with hot glue wherever you want on the
back

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.000 

then<00:02:47.860> needle<00:02:48.250> felt<00:02:48.520> a<00:02:48.700> small<00:02:49.200> white<00:02:50.200> circle<00:02:50.800> a

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
then needle felt a small white circle a

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.970 
then needle felt a small white circle a
pretty<00:02:51.400> thin<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.200> light<00:02:53.590> from<00:02:53.830> the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
pretty thin so that the light from the

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.860 
pretty thin so that the light from the
LED<00:02:54.340> will<00:02:54.550> still<00:02:54.819> shine<00:02:55.030> through<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.450> be

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
LED will still shine through and be

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:05.300 
LED will still shine through and be
diffused<00:02:56.440> so<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.920> whole<00:02:57.129> circle<00:02:57.730> lights<00:02:58.000> up

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.770 

optionally<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:06.550> can<00:03:06.610> also<00:03:06.849> felt<00:03:07.300> around<00:03:07.660> the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
optionally you can also felt around the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.839 
optionally you can also felt around the
potentiometers<00:03:08.560> right<00:03:09.160> in<00:03:09.310> place<00:03:09.580> I<00:03:09.819> used

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
potentiometers right in place I used

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.449 
potentiometers right in place I used
this<00:03:10.300> black<00:03:10.599> roving<00:03:11.050> but<00:03:11.709> be<00:03:11.830> careful<00:03:11.860> the

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
this black roving but be careful the

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:18.119 
this black roving but be careful the
felting<00:03:12.819> needles<00:03:13.090> are<00:03:13.239> really<00:03:13.660> sharp<00:03:16.500> next<00:03:17.500> so

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
felting needles are really sharp next so

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.759 
felting needles are really sharp next so
the<00:03:18.340> pieces<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:18.879> felt<00:03:19.180> down<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.140> fabric<00:03:20.590> on

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
the pieces of felt down to the fabric on

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.770 
the pieces of felt down to the fabric on
you're<00:03:21.130> covering<00:03:21.670> your<00:03:21.849> illustration<00:03:22.569> board

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
you're covering your illustration board

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:33.000 
you're covering your illustration board
use<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.830> pliers<00:03:24.010> if<00:03:24.340> necessary<00:03:31.650> for<00:03:32.650> all<00:03:32.680> up

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
use the pliers if necessary for all up

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.100 
use the pliers if necessary for all up
was<00:03:33.340> left<00:03:33.549> to<00:03:33.670> do<00:03:33.849> was<00:03:33.880> to<00:03:34.239> finish<00:03:34.540> sewing<00:03:34.780> down

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
was left to do was to finish sewing down

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.500

the<00:03:35.410> center<00:03:35.860> piece<00:03:36.040> of<00:03:36.280> felt<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.120> roving

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
the center piece of felt and roving

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.900 
the center piece of felt and roving
which<00:03:37.750> just<00:03:38.079> diffuses<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.709> LED<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.549> spread

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
which just diffuses the LED and spread

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.900 
which just diffuses the LED and spread
the<00:03:40.090> light<00:03:40.269> out<00:03:40.450> more<00:03:40.840> evenly<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:42.099> then<00:03:42.340> I<00:03:42.549> can

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
the light out more evenly and then I can

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.960 
the light out more evenly and then I can
go<00:03:43.450> ahead<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.690> turn<00:03:44.079> my<00:03:44.440> little<00:03:44.799> knobs<00:03:45.040> let's

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
go ahead and turn my little knobs let's

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:54.300 
go ahead and turn my little knobs let's
change<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:47.079> color<00:03:47.500> of<00:03:47.650> LED<00:03:52.650> so<00:03:53.650> that's<00:03:53.980> it<00:03:54.130> for

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
change the color of LED so that's it for

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.030 
change the color of LED so that's it for
this<00:03:54.639> week's<00:03:54.880> craft<00:03:55.269> video<00:03:55.780> I<00:03:56.109> hope<00:03:56.980> you

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
this week's craft video I hope you

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.989 
this week's craft video I hope you
enjoyed<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.790> I'll<00:03:58.060> see<00:03:58.329> you<00:03:58.420> again<00:03:58.540> next<00:03:58.690> time
