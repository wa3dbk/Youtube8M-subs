00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
crossover and my pattern between the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.450 
crossover and my pattern between the
snare<00:00:24.660> drum<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.590> floor<00:00:25.980> tom

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.570 
I believe meal pernt has a video out
there<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.439> person<00:00:28.769> said<00:00:28.920> hey<00:00:29.070> take<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.460> look

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
there this person said hey take a look

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.790 
there this person said hey take a look
at<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.970> anyway<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.380> my<00:00:31.619> version

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
at this and anyway so this is my version

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.049 
at this and anyway so this is my version
of<00:00:32.009> course<00:00:32.219> it's<00:00:32.399> not<00:00:32.520> going<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.759> be<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> same

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
of course it's not going to be the same

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:33.979 
of course it's not going to be the same
as<00:00:33.180> everybody<00:00:33.390> else's

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
as everybody else's

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.840 
as everybody else's
but<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.500> my<00:00:34.710> pattern<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.219> typically<00:00:35.550> use

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
but it's my pattern that I typically use

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.150 
but it's my pattern that I typically use
between<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.450> floor<00:00:36.630> tom<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.020> snare<00:00:37.290> or<00:00:37.739> I

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
between the floor tom and the snare or I

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.799 
between the floor tom and the snare or I

so<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.710> pattern<00:03:28.890> is<00:03:29.280> basically<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:30.330> pattern

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
so that pattern is basically the pattern

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.570 
so that pattern is basically the pattern
so<00:03:31.020> what's<00:03:31.530> cool<00:03:31.680> about<00:03:31.740> that<00:03:31.980> is<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:32.520> can

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
so what's cool about that is you can

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.520 
so what's cool about that is you can
