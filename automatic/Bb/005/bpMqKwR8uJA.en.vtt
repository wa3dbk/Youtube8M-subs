00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
it was nice and soft because you need to

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.650

and that's hard to do if your cream
cheese<00:00:50.220> is<00:00:50.610> really<00:00:50.909> cold<00:00:51.269> then<00:00:52.229> you're<00:00:52.440> going

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
cheese is really cold then you're going

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.829

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
you're watching and sometimes when you

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.630 
you're watching and sometimes when you
make<00:01:33.960> half<00:01:34.200> recipes<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.340> kind<00:01:35.549> of

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
make half recipes you have to kind of

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.940 
make half recipes you have to kind of
experiment<00:01:36.090> move<00:01:36.450> things<00:01:36.749> around<00:01:36.920> when<00:01:37.920> I

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
experiment move things around when I

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.010 
experiment move things around when I
poured<00:01:38.429> this<00:01:38.700> into<00:01:38.999> this<00:01:39.090> 8<00:01:39.299> by<00:01:39.509> 10<00:01:39.780> inch

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
poured this into this 8 by 10 inch

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.160 
poured this into this 8 by 10 inch
baking<00:01:40.799> dish<00:01:41.039> I<00:01:41.490> realized<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.929> eggs

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
baking dish I realized that the eggs

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.380 
baking dish I realized that the eggs
were<00:01:43.679> probably<00:01:44.159> going<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.609> too<00:01:44.850> thick<00:01:45.119> and

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
were probably going to be too thick and

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.300 
were probably going to be too thick and
you<00:01:45.450> need<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.109> roll<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.590> up<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.039> I<00:01:47.159> was

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
you need to roll this up and I was

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.499 
you need to roll this up and I was
worried<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.880> wasn't<00:01:48.060> going<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.329> roll

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
worried that it wasn't going to roll

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.660 
worried that it wasn't going to roll
that<00:01:48.749> the<00:01:48.869> eggs<00:01:49.020> are<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.439> going<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.679> crack<00:01:49.920> so

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
that the eggs are just going to crack so

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.109 
that the eggs are just going to crack so
I<00:01:50.969> chose<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> larger<00:01:52.579> container<00:01:53.579> which<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:53.939> a

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
I chose a larger container which is a

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.349 
I chose a larger container which is a
very<00:01:54.509> old<00:01:54.929> and<00:01:55.319> ugly<00:01:55.590> looking<00:01:56.340> cookie<00:01:57.119> sheet

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
to do all the time could have been a

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.470 
to do all the time could have been a
total<00:02:10.110> disaster<00:02:10.289> but<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.490> managed<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.819> transfer

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
total disaster but I managed to transfer

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.960 
total disaster but I managed to transfer

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
it without spilling a drop and I just

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.970 
it without spilling a drop and I just
kind<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.240> press<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.630> aluminum<00:02:16.050> foil<00:02:16.319> down<00:02:16.620> to

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
where it was supposed to be now once you

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.230 
where it was supposed to be now once you
pour<00:02:19.800> your<00:02:19.950> egg<00:02:20.100> mixture<00:02:20.130> in<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.819> bake<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.030> at

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
pour your egg mixture in you bake it at

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.949

375<00:02:21.780> degrees<00:02:22.170> for<00:02:22.950> 30<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.370> 35<00:02:23.400> minutes<00:02:24.120> mine

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
375 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes mine

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.450 
375 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes mine
took<00:02:25.170> considerably<00:02:25.740> less<00:02:25.920> time<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.280> course

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
took considerably less time of course

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.990 
took considerably less time of course
because<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.760> only<00:02:26.910> used<00:02:27.180> half<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.930> number<00:02:28.200> of

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
because I only used half the number of

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.710 
because I only used half the number of
and<00:02:29.710> because<00:02:30.710> I<00:02:30.740> was<00:02:31.010> using<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.580> really<00:02:32.210> old<00:02:32.330> pan

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
and because I was using a really old pan

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.890 
and because I was using a really old pan
the<00:02:33.590> pan<00:02:33.620> kind<00:02:34.370> of<00:02:34.610> flexes<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.300> warps<00:02:35.660> in<00:02:35.840> the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
the pan kind of flexes and warps in the

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.430 
the pan kind of flexes and warps in the
oven<00:02:36.320> and<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:37.040> all<00:02:37.280> my<00:02:37.610> eggs<00:02:37.880> kind<00:02:38.390> of<00:02:38.480> ran<00:02:38.780> from

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
oven and so all my eggs kind of ran from

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.070 
oven and so all my eggs kind of ran from
one<00:02:39.680> corner<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.280> other<00:02:40.430> corner<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:41.720> I<00:02:41.780> had

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
one corner to the other corner so I had

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.320 
one corner to the other corner so I had
an<00:02:42.290> edge<00:02:42.500> that<00:02:42.800> had<00:02:42.980> almost<00:02:43.400> no<00:02:43.730> egg<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.210> it

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
an edge that had almost no egg and it

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.050 
an edge that had almost no egg and it
kind<00:02:44.570> of<00:02:44.660> got<00:02:44.780> nice<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.320> brown<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.650> crispy

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
kind of got nice and brown and crispy

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.350 
kind of got nice and brown and crispy
there<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:47.390> I<00:02:47.630> had<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.470> kind<00:02:48.800> of<00:02:49.060> do<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.090> little

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
there so I had to kind of do a little

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.410 
there so I had to kind of do a little
bit<00:02:50.510> of<00:02:50.840> fixing<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.830> took<00:02:52.550> a<00:02:52.670> knife<00:02:52.880> just<00:02:53.180> cut

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
bit of fixing I took a knife just cut

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.930 
bit of fixing I took a knife just cut
off<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:54.170> overcooked<00:02:55.040> section<00:02:55.550> in<00:02:55.790> the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
off that overcooked section in the

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.350 
off that overcooked section in the
corner<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:57.610> I<00:02:58.610> hoped<00:02:58.850> that<00:02:58.940> I<00:02:59.030> could<00:02:59.180> still

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
corner and I hoped that I could still

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.300 
corner and I hoped that I could still
had<00:02:59.810> enough<00:03:00.080> left<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.500> roll<00:03:00.740> and<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:00.980> think<00:03:01.190> I

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
had enough left to roll and I think I

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.030 
had enough left to roll and I think I
did<00:03:01.490> but<00:03:02.060> I'll<00:03:02.180> let<00:03:02.300> you<00:03:02.420> be<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.570> judge<00:03:02.950> just<00:03:03.950> a
