Let's go! Tamagotchi!

00:00:10.016 --> 00:00:11.116
Yah-tchi!

00:00:15.346 --> 00:00:17.946
"Gotchi King Doesn't Laugh?! "
Wow, Gotchi King's castle is...

00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:19.486
..bigger than I ever imagined!

00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:22.986
I wonder what kind of amazing foods
they'll have to serve us-tchi! 

00:00:23.286 --> 00:00:25.086
Oh, good, you've arrived!

00:00:25.286 --> 00:00:29.086
You must be the children from Tamagotchi school
who have come to visit the King.

00:00:29.346 --> 00:00:31.986
Yes, sir! And it is a pleasure to be here,sir!

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:35.646
We'd just like to offer a word of warning
before you ente the castle.

00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:38.486
Whatever you do, don't make Gotchi King laugh.

00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:40.886
I don't understand, why can't we make him laugh?

00:00:41.216 --> 00:00:45.316
This is strictly off the record, but if
Gotchi King were to laugh, even a little..

00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:46.746
What will happen to him??

00:00:46.816 --> 00:00:49.286
His body'll crack up into hundreds of pieces!

00:00:49.346 --> 00:00:50.886
What-tchi?!

00:00:56.886 --> 00:01:00.616
Welcome, children of Tamagotchi school, 
to Gotchi King's castle.

00:01:01.216 --> 00:01:03.686
I have to say,,, I'm most honored to be invited.

00:01:03.816 --> 00:01:04.846

00:01:15.246 --> 00:01:18.846
No,no,cut it out, I think you misunderstood what
I was trying to say to him..!

00:01:18.886 --> 00:01:20.716
I just wanted to thank him for receiving us!

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:24.016
But we haven't received anything at all and
I'm getting hungry-tchi.

I promise, -

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:17.046

hard time keeping it together!

00:02:17.786 --> 00:02:19.846
I see.. so that's it!

00:02:20.116 --> 00:02:23.186

00:02:23.216 --> 00:02:25.116
My deepest apologies.

There's no need to worry.

00:02:26.816 --> 00:02:31.646
I assure you've taken the necessary measures to
insure thatI do not accidentally crack up.

00:02:31.716 --> 00:02:33.946
Oh, I'm so glad to hear that, sir!

00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:35.916
Oh, Necessary measures?

00:02:36.146 --> 00:02:38.146
To not crack up?

00:02:38.186 --> 00:02:40.116
Protection against.. cracking up? 

00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:45.016
