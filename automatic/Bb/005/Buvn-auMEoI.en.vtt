all races in each focus on I think I

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.269 
all races in each focus on I think I
said<00:00:30.029> focus<00:00:30.269> like<00:00:30.570> six<00:00:30.810> times<00:00:30.990> then<00:00:31.349> personal

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.260 
best now the reason I'm making these
videos<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.770> because<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.430> started<00:00:35.730> helping<00:00:35.850> some

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
videos is because I started helping some

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.060 
videos is because I started helping some

anything but the basics when you aren't
comfortable<00:01:19.770> with<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.430> game<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.600> since<00:01:21.990> I'm

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
comfortable with the game so since I'm

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.469 
comfortable with the game so since I'm
heavily<00:01:22.530> inspired<00:01:22.710> by<00:01:22.890> day<00:01:23.159> 9<00:01:23.610> i'll<00:01:24.210> probably

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
heavily inspired by day 9 i'll probably

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.330 
heavily inspired by day 9 i'll probably
be<00:01:24.810> pulling<00:01:25.140> him<00:01:25.290> using<00:01:25.830> phrases<00:01:26.009> here

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
be pulling him using phrases here

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.070 
be pulling him using phrases here
scoring<00:01:26.820> at<00:01:27.060> least<00:01:27.299> they<00:01:27.570> brought<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.930> my

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
scoring at least they brought to my

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.590 
scoring at least they brought to my
attention<00:01:28.850> apart<00:01:29.850> from<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.030> i<00:01:30.180> would<00:01:30.450> like

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
attention apart from that i would like

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.630 
attention apart from that i would like
to<00:01:30.750> mention<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.079> i<00:01:31.140> am<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.350> region<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.610> i

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
to mention that i am the region so i

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.219 
to mention that i am the region so i
have<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> corner<00:01:33.240> english<00:01:33.540> accent<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
have a corner english accent and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.749 
have a corner english accent and
probably<00:01:34.590> use<00:01:34.770> words<00:01:35.070> once<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.610> while<00:01:35.700> that

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
probably use words once and while that

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.870 
probably use words once and while that
make<00:01:36.090> no<00:01:36.299> sense<00:01:37.130> also<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.159> pretty<00:01:38.640> narrow

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
make no sense also I pretty narrow

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.789 
make no sense also I pretty narrow
attention<00:01:39.390> span<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:39.960> i<00:01:40.020> might<00:01:40.200> start<00:01:40.439> talking

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
attention span so i might start talking

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.350 
attention span so i might start talking
about<00:01:40.890> something<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.549> then<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.880> totally

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
about something and then just totally

hearing diddly-squat so I want to try

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.850 
hearing diddly-squat so I want to try
and<00:02:47.270> make<00:02:47.360> at<00:02:47.480> least<00:02:47.510> two<00:02:47.750> videos<00:02:48.140> a<00:02:48.170> week<00:02:48.290> but

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
and make at least two videos a week but

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.470 
and make at least two videos a week but
I<00:02:48.920> would<00:02:49.190> love<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.459> make<00:02:49.610> them<00:02:49.790> at<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.239> higher

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
I would love to make them at a higher

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.630 
I would love to make them at a higher
frequency<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:51.350> guess<00:02:51.650> it<00:02:51.769> just<00:02:51.800> all<00:02:52.070> depends<00:02:52.400> on

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
frequency I guess it just all depends on

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.390 
frequency I guess it just all depends on
