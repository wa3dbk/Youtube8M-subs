00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.940
 we can create 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:27.060
 to organize image sets without 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:29.729
 the need to duplicate the actual file 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.060
 the filter bar will help us search 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.500

 just below the content area 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.189
 the right panel helps us to perform 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.000
 quick adjustments to images and 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:01.159

 images of the content area in this 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.870
 case we are visualizing the same as 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.220
 in the grid view 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.950

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.599
 I'll just say that by hovering over 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.680
 one of the images on the strip 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:47.290
 I see it in the browser in the 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.290
 left panel if you notice 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.310

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.519
 You can choose in this triangular 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.720
 the tools that we want to visualize 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:12.710
 in the toolbar 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.990
 I want to talk to you about the window 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:18.930
 histogram in the right panel of 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:22.890
 lightroom that contains the curve of the 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:26.430
 picture the color curves and the curve of 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:31.110
 gray of the image in addition to the data 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:35.730
 exif that is the sensitivity the distance 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:41.819
 focal the diaphragm and the obturation with 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:44.760
 that each of the images was captured 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.760
 one last thing to finish the 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.879
 presentation of the panels if you look 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:57.980
 each of them has a triangular 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:57.980
 that when puncturing closes and opens 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.890
 if we close it and pass the mouse 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:09.680
 above it opens automatically and at 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.680
 remove it closes again
