there's kind of a mini puzzle type area
of<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> game<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:34.020> saw<00:01:34.229> where<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.189> like

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
of the game that we saw where it's like

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.480 
of the game that we saw where it's like
a<00:01:35.369> huge<00:01:35.880> maze<00:01:36.299> with<00:01:36.780> spikes<00:01:37.200> all<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:38.009> certain

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
a huge maze with spikes all in certain

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.240 
a huge maze with spikes all in certain
like<00:01:38.700> certain<00:01:39.659> walls<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.259> maze<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.829> you

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
like certain walls of the maze and you

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.999 
like certain walls of the maze and you
use<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.729> gyroscope<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.720> basically<00:01:43.470> turn<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
use the gyroscope to basically turn the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.249 
use the gyroscope to basically turn the
entire<00:01:44.130> maze<00:01:44.579> around<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.509> Raymond<00:01:46.049> can

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
entire maze around so that Raymond can

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.840 
entire maze around so that Raymond can
bounce<00:01:46.530> off<00:01:46.799> from<00:01:47.040> wall<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.250> wall<00:01:47.399> kind<00:01:47.759> of

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
bounce off from wall to wall kind of

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.910 
bounce off from wall to wall kind of
like<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> super<00:01:48.360> meat<00:01:48.570> boy<00:01:48.600> situation<00:01:49.049> if<00:01:49.740> you

kind of slides down this area very

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.070 
kind of slides down this area very
fast-paced<00:02:12.340> no<00:02:13.000> stopping<00:02:13.450> or<00:02:13.569> anything<00:02:13.900> and

eyeballs that open and close and when
you<00:02:18.580> see<00:02:18.790> them<00:02:18.940> open<00:02:19.269> you<00:02:19.420> tap<00:02:19.690> on<00:02:19.870> them<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.260> it

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
you see them open you tap on them and it

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.559 
you see them open you tap on them and it
makes<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:21.010> like<00:02:21.459> a<00:02:21.489> little<00:02:21.819> noise<00:02:22.090> which

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
eventually like forms kind of the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.890 
eventually like forms kind of the

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.369 
who is demoing it for me just said that
this<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.549> really<00:03:06.730> not<00:03:06.970> like<00:03:07.239> an<00:03:07.450> actual<00:03:07.930> part

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
this is really not like an actual part

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.350 
this is really not like an actual part
of<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.560> game<00:03:08.829> yet<00:03:09.099> it<00:03:09.280> could<00:03:09.549> be<00:03:09.819> but<00:03:10.239> it's

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
of the game yet it could be but it's

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.360 
of the game yet it could be but it's
more<00:03:10.599> just<00:03:10.629> sort<00:03:11.049> of<00:03:11.170> proof<00:03:11.440> of<00:03:11.620> concept<00:03:12.129> for

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
more just sort of proof of concept for

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.129 
more just sort of proof of concept for
the<00:03:12.430> wii<00:03:12.549> u<00:03:12.819> so<00:03:13.450> it<00:03:13.629> makes<00:03:13.780> me<00:03:13.900> think<00:03:14.109> that

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
the wii u so it makes me think that

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.390 
the wii u so it makes me think that
they're<00:03:14.350> kind<00:03:14.590> of<00:03:14.709> still<00:03:15.010> early<00:03:15.370> in

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
they're kind of still early in

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.220 
they're kind of still early in
development<00:03:15.720> one<00:03:16.720> of<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.840> tricks<00:03:17.019> i<00:03:17.109> was

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
development one of the tricks i was

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.440 
development one of the tricks i was
talking<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.560> here<00:03:18.010> at<00:03:18.130> ubisoft<00:03:18.609> did<00:03:19.060> say<00:03:19.269> that

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
talking to here at ubisoft did say that

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.990 
talking to here at ubisoft did say that
they<00:03:19.989> think<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.650> probably<00:03:21.310> won't<00:03:21.579> be<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:21.760> launch

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
they think it probably won't be a launch

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.550 
they think it probably won't be a launch
title<00:03:22.120> they<00:03:22.600> really<00:03:22.840> just<00:03:22.989> want<00:03:23.139> to<00:03:23.200> have<00:03:23.319> more

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
title they really just want to have more

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.930 
title they really just want to have more
time<00:03:23.829> to<00:03:24.100> incorporate<00:03:24.220> all<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.760> features

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
time to incorporate all the features

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.250 
time to incorporate all the features
that<00:03:25.120> they<00:03:25.329> want<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:25.870> just<00:03:25.900> kind<00:03:26.230> of

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
that they want and just kind of

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.930 
that they want and just kind of
experiment<00:03:26.980> with<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.220> wii<00:03:27.340> u<00:03:27.549> and<00:03:27.579> really

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
experiment with the wii u and really

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.089 
experiment with the wii u and really
find<00:03:28.209> out<00:03:28.450> you<00:03:28.840> know<00:03:28.930> how<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:29.260> utilize<00:03:29.859> its

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
find out you know how to utilize its

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.520 
find out you know how to utilize its
features<00:03:30.489> best<00:03:30.819> so<00:03:31.359> I<00:03:31.420> got<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:31.989> say<00:03:32.079> I<00:03:32.109> respect

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
features best so I got to say I respect

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.449 
features best so I got to say I respect
them<00:03:32.620> for<00:03:32.680> that<00:03:32.799> it<00:03:32.980> looks<00:03:33.130> like<00:03:33.220> they've<00:03:33.340> done

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
them for that it looks like they've done

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.580 
them for that it looks like they've done
a<00:03:33.489> really<00:03:33.579> great<00:03:33.910> job<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:34.420> far<00:03:34.450> we're<00:03:35.349> probably

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
a really great job so far we're probably

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.620 
a really great job so far we're probably
halfway<00:03:36.069> through<00:03:36.639> the<00:03:36.819> whole<00:03:37.030> show<00:03:37.299> right<00:03:37.599> now
