with the microsites the you have to put

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.469 
with the microsites the you have to put
it<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.739> compatible<00:01:05.400> lug<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
it in a compatible lug in the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.910 
it in a compatible lug in the
instruction<00:01:06.960> says<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:07.350> put<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.650> any

instruction says you can put it in any
lug<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.520> that's<00:01:08.760> not<00:01:08.970> true<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.780> look<00:01:09.960> at

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
lug but that's not true if you look at

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.469 
lug but that's not true if you look at
the<00:01:10.170> sole<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.860> compatible<00:01:11.430> shoe<00:01:11.670> these

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the sole of a compatible shoe these

gram on black they are bordered by a
little<00:01:21.000> graphic<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.600> says<00:01:21.659> spike<00:01:22.610> okay<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
little graphic that says spike okay and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.480 
little graphic that says spike okay and
the<00:01:23.970> same<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> hill<00:01:24.750> these<00:01:25.710> three<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the same on the hill these three in the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.609 
the same on the hill these three in the
center<00:01:26.759> there<00:01:27.150> they<00:01:27.600> also<00:01:27.810> have<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.380> little

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
center there they also have a little

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.230 
center there they also have a little
graphic<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.310> solid<00:01:29.729> shoe<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.030> says

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
graphic on the solid shoe that says

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.050 
graphic on the solid shoe that says
spike<00:01:30.659> okay<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.770> could<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.640> means<00:01:32.909> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
spike okay so you could that means that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.149 
spike okay so you could that means that
the<00:01:33.150> lugs<00:01:33.450> are<00:01:33.659> reinforced<00:01:34.259> inside<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.920> take

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the lugs are reinforced inside to take

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.740 
the lugs are reinforced inside to take
the<00:01:35.430> thread<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.619> little<00:01:37.619> hobnail<00:01:38.329> okay<00:01:39.329> so

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the thread of the little hobnail okay so

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.280 
the thread of the little hobnail okay so
this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.049> how<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.790> you<00:01:41.930> load<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
this is how you do you load the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.100 
this is how you do you load the
hobnailed<00:01:43.649> into<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.520> tool<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> hobnailed

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
hobnailed into the tool so the hobnailed

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.910 
hobnailed into the tool so the hobnailed
goes<00:01:46.500> down<00:01:46.829> which<00:01:47.759> leaves<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.270> thread<00:01:48.920> poking

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
goes down which leaves the thread poking

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.560 
goes down which leaves the thread poking
up<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:51.380> okay<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:53.369> then<00:01:53.549> put<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.180> point

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
up like that okay you then put the point

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.929 
up like that okay you then put the point
of<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.020> thread<00:01:56.540> just<00:01:57.540> below<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.799> middle<00:01:59.130> of

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
of the thread just below the middle of

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.649 
of the thread just below the middle of
the<00:02:00.799> lug<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.040> you're<00:02:02.159> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.369> use<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:02.909> put

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the lug that you're going to use so put

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.910 
the lug that you're going to use so put
it<00:02:03.780> line<00:02:04.140> out<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.409> middle<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.799> then<00:02:04.890> just

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
it line out of the middle and then just

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.300 
it line out of the middle and then just
move<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.640> down<00:02:05.939> two<00:02:06.540> or<00:02:06.689> three<00:02:06.930> millimeters

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
move it down two or three millimeters

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.260 
move it down two or three millimeters
okay<00:02:08.310> at<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.640> point<00:02:09.140> I've<00:02:10.140> got<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:11.060> hub<00:02:12.060> bail

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
okay at this point I've got the hub bail

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.580 
okay at this point I've got the hub bail
at<00:02:12.450> 90<00:02:12.959> degrees

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
at 90 degrees

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.160 
at 90 degrees
so<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.709> actual<00:02:15.040> sole<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.239> shoe<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.720> you

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
so the actual sole of the shoe and you

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.660 
so the actual sole of the shoe and you
push<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.680> point<00:02:17.920> in<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:19.769> begin<00:02:20.769> to<00:02:20.950> turn<00:02:21.220> lift

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
push the point in and begin to turn lift

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.750 
push the point in and begin to turn lift
up<00:02:21.879> tool<00:02:22.660> not<00:02:22.959> so<00:02:23.110> much<00:02:23.260> at<00:02:23.440> first<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:24.519> then

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
up tool not so much at first and then

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.400 
up tool not so much at first and then

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
screw that in till that flange

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.660 
screw that in till that flange
it's<00:02:49.630> just<00:02:51.540> nicely<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.890> sort<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:53.980> level<00:02:54.489> with

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
it's just nicely a sort of level with
