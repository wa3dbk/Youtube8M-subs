00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.300 

we<00:00:03.270> planted<00:00:04.110> nasturtiums<00:00:04.440> on<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.069> allotment

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
we planted nasturtiums on the allotment

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.360 
we planted nasturtiums on the allotment
for<00:00:05.879> two<00:00:06.089> reasons<00:00:06.480> one<00:00:07.020> is<00:00:07.589> they're<00:00:08.220> actually

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
for two reasons one is they're actually

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.879 
for two reasons one is they're actually
quite<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.730> good<00:00:08.940> food<00:00:09.150> source<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.960> secondly

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
quite a good food source and secondly

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.900 
quite a good food source and secondly
it's<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:12.179> encourage<00:00:13.219> bees<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:14.639> on<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.880> come

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
it's to encourage bees and so on to come

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.200 
it's to encourage bees and so on to come
to<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.690> allotment<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.820> first<00:00:17.820> light<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
to the allotment to first light the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.859 
to the allotment to first light the
flowers<00:00:18.619> on<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.650> food<00:00:19.920> site<00:00:20.510> you<00:00:21.510> can<00:00:21.630> eat<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
flowers on the food site you can eat the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.540 
flowers on the food site you can eat the
leaves<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.740> can<00:00:22.859> eat<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.039> flowers<00:00:23.490> first

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
leaves and you can eat the flowers first

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.240 
leaves and you can eat the flowers first
here's<00:00:26.550> one<00:00:26.760> here<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.689> can<00:00:27.960> actually<00:00:28.250> pick

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
here's one here you can actually pick

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.600 
here's one here you can actually pick
off<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:30.179> seeds<00:00:30.539> when<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.439> green<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:32.579> that

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
off the seeds when the green like that

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.479 
off the seeds when the green like that
and<00:00:33.739> actually<00:00:35.630> that<00:00:36.630> they<00:00:37.170> make<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.489> substitute

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
and actually that they make a substitute

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.150 
and actually that they make a substitute
for<00:00:39.110> pickled<00:00:40.309> capers<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:42.270> back<00:00:42.540> at<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.719> house

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
for pickled capers and back at the house

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.400 
for pickled capers and back at the house
I'm<00:00:44.160> going<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.370> show<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.989> how<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> pick<00:00:46.260> all

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
I'm going to show you how to pick all

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.220 
I'm going to show you how to pick all
these

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.900 

when<00:00:51.230> I<00:00:51.440> told<00:00:51.860> friends<00:00:52.190> that<00:00:52.340> I<00:00:52.460> was<00:00:52.640> going<00:00:52.850> to

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
when I told friends that I was going to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.720 
when I told friends that I was going to
be<00:00:53.000> pickling<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.540> nasturtium<00:00:53.899> seeds<00:00:54.320> I

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
be pickling the nasturtium seeds I

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.189 
be pickling the nasturtium seeds I
experienced<00:00:55.730> a<00:00:55.760> few<00:00:55.940> raised<00:00:56.180> eyebrows<00:00:56.809> from

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
experienced a few raised eyebrows from

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.700 
experienced a few raised eyebrows from
people<00:00:58.059> quite<00:00:59.059> fathom<00:00:59.690> why<00:01:00.050> I'd<00:01:00.260> want<00:01:00.290> to<00:01:00.559> do

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
people quite fathom why I'd want to do

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.660 
people quite fathom why I'd want to do
something<00:01:01.070> like<00:01:01.190> that

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
something like that

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.210 
something like that
well<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.839> certian<00:01:03.260> seeds<00:01:03.530> are<00:01:03.800> a<00:01:03.860> very<00:01:04.159> good

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
well the certian seeds are a very good

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.090 
well the certian seeds are a very good
substitute<00:01:04.909> for<00:01:05.089> these<00:01:06.040> we<00:01:07.040> go<00:01:07.540> these<00:01:08.540> are

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
substitute for these we go these are

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.139 
substitute for these we go these are
capers<00:01:10.100> and<00:01:11.830> capers<00:01:12.830> or<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.430> seed<00:01:13.729> pod<00:01:13.970> that

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
capers and capers or a seed pod that

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.120 
capers and capers or a seed pod that
grows<00:01:14.450> on<00:01:14.780> plants<00:01:15.110> in<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.560> Mediterranean

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
grows on plants in the Mediterranean

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.370 
grows on plants in the Mediterranean
area<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:16.759> can't<00:01:17.390> grow<00:01:17.540> them<00:01:17.659> here<00:01:17.780> in<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.200> UK

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
area and can't grow them here in the UK

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.889 
area and can't grow them here in the UK
certainly<00:01:18.950> not<00:01:19.130> here<00:01:19.399> in<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.240> Northeast<00:01:20.630> it's

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
certainly not here in the Northeast it's

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.380 
certainly not here in the Northeast it's
just<00:01:21.110> too<00:01:21.950> cold<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:22.550> my<00:01:22.729> green<00:01:23.000> house<00:01:23.119> isn't

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
just too cold and my green house isn't

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.940 
just too cold and my green house isn't
big<00:01:23.660> enough<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.990> grow<00:01:24.200> something<00:01:24.440> like<00:01:24.649> listen

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
big enough to grow something like listen

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.150 
big enough to grow something like listen
so<00:01:25.940> we<00:01:26.240> wanted<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.570> substitute<00:01:27.050> and<00:01:27.530> we<00:01:27.950> came<00:01:28.130> up

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
so we wanted a substitute and we came up

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.010 
so we wanted a substitute and we came up
with<00:01:28.660> mr.<00:01:29.660> sheean<00:01:29.869> seeds<00:01:30.460> here<00:01:31.460> we<00:01:31.550> have<00:01:32.020> one

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
with mr. sheean seeds here we have one

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.570 
with mr. sheean seeds here we have one
there<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:35.090> these<00:01:35.240> are<00:01:35.300> a<00:01:35.860> described<00:01:36.860> by<00:01:37.159> many

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
there and these are a described by many

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.270 
there and these are a described by many
people<00:01:37.820> as<00:01:37.909> a<00:01:38.060> good<00:01:38.479> substitute<00:01:38.869> for<00:01:39.280> for

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
people as a good substitute for for

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.029 
people as a good substitute for for
these<00:01:40.690> I'll<00:01:41.690> actually<00:01:41.899> go<00:01:42.259> one<00:01:42.440> further<00:01:42.679> I

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
these I'll actually go one further I

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.370 
these I'll actually go one further I
would<00:01:43.100> say<00:01:43.399> that<00:01:43.720> this<00:01:44.720> assertion<00:01:44.899> seeds<00:01:45.200> are

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
would say that this assertion seeds are

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.410 
would say that this assertion seeds are
a<00:01:45.409> very<00:01:45.619> good<00:01:45.800> fruit<00:01:46.130> in<00:01:46.429> their<00:01:47.030> own<00:01:47.179> right

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
a very good fruit in their own right

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.590 
a very good fruit in their own right
they've<00:01:47.659> got<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:47.810> very<00:01:48.200> very<00:01:49.130> good<00:01:49.600> peppery

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
they've got a very very good peppery

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.050 
they've got a very very good peppery
taste<00:01:50.720> to<00:01:51.440> them<00:01:51.590> which<00:01:54.280> once<00:01:55.280> you've<00:01:55.429> pickled

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
taste to them which once you've pickled

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.139 
taste to them which once you've pickled
it<00:01:56.149> or<00:01:56.450> even<00:01:56.690> use<00:01:57.080> them<00:01:57.289> raw<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:58.729> can<00:01:58.849> put<00:01:59.030> them

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
it or even use them raw you can put them

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.660 
it or even use them raw you can put them
into<00:01:59.270> suits<00:01:59.599> and<00:02:00.560> two<00:02:00.679> salads<00:02:01.160> beggars<00:02:01.580> and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
into suits and two salads beggars and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.359 
into suits and two salads beggars and
sellers<00:02:02.030> or<00:02:02.690> in<00:02:02.959> sauces<00:02:03.470> cannot<00:02:04.160> really

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
sellers or in sauces cannot really

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.520 
sellers or in sauces cannot really
fantastic<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:05.209> I<00:02:05.479> would<00:02:05.780> say<00:02:05.929> these<00:02:06.080> are<00:02:06.140> much

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
fantastic so I would say these are much

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.680 
fantastic so I would say these are much
much<00:02:06.830> better<00:02:07.099> than<00:02:07.459> capers<00:02:08.360> as<00:02:08.780> a<00:02:08.959> food<00:02:09.200> anyway

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
much better than capers as a food anyway

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.640 
much better than capers as a food anyway
typical<00:02:11.690> them<00:02:11.840> this<00:02:12.560> is<00:02:13.400> what<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.819> have<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.120> do

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
typical them this is what you have to do

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.670 
typical them this is what you have to do
well<00:02:15.650> very<00:02:15.860> briefly<00:02:16.099> you<00:02:16.550> will<00:02:16.730> need<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.680> small

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
well very briefly you will need a small

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.979 
well very briefly you will need a small
number<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.280> peppercorns<00:02:19.700> probably<00:02:20.690> in<00:02:20.810> five

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
number of peppercorns probably in five

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.600 
number of peppercorns probably in five
or<00:02:21.140> six<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:22.270> bottle<00:02:23.270> five<00:02:23.540> litre<00:02:23.870> bottle<00:02:24.230> of
