he's going to add some gravitas to that
role<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.329> early<00:00:57.660> think<00:00:57.809> he's<00:00:57.960> going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> make

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
not think Jesse Eisenberg was a very

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.660 
not think Jesse Eisenberg was a very
good<00:03:16.989> choice<00:03:17.170> but<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.590> just<00:03:17.739> I<00:03:17.980> had<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.370> process

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
good choice but it just I had to process

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.190

it<00:03:19.090> before<00:03:19.329> i<00:03:19.360> made<00:03:19.540> this<00:03:19.630> video<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:19.900> make<00:03:20.019> sure

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
it before i made this video to make sure

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.920 
it before i made this video to make sure
that<00:03:20.620> my<00:03:21.040> opinion<00:03:21.370> was<00:03:21.519> solid<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.060> firmly<00:03:22.660> in

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
that my opinion was solid and firmly in

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.120 
that my opinion was solid and firmly in
place<00:03:22.959> i<00:03:23.410> definitely<00:03:23.739> there<00:03:23.890> are<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.010> lot<00:03:24.100> of
