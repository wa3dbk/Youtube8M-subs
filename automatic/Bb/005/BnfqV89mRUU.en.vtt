00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:08.809
 Hello, good morning, I'm going to show you today 

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:12.950
 how to make a cappuccino machine and without 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:16.819
 It is very practical for the person who does not 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:21.199
 have this kind of things in the kitchen what 

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:25.480
 what we will need is a small boat 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.970
 and the most important thing with cover please 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.310
 the milk that you like the one 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.980
 you take that 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.180
 do not forget that this is for the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.110
 cream 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.830
 for half 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.460
 up to half what you find 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.460
 necessary 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:50.219
 we will fight we will need white sugar 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.200
 one 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.110
 the essence of vanilla remember that it is 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.890
 optional if you do not like it you do not know 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.890
 worry not them 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:12.390
 It gives a little more flavor and smell 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.250
 It is very rich all 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.250
 we also revolve them 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:26.260
 until sugar is not heard and this 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.100
 is what replaces the machine the 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.150
 blender or what you juice 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.340
 so it has to be very strong shake 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.920
 to replace it until the milk 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.330
 rise because this causes milk to rise 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.330
 a lot true what 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.310
 then do not worry because I 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.920
 I will explain what you need to do it 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.049
 in their cases it is very rich I have already 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.049
 done many already my family loves 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:03.689
 here is this now we leave it a 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:06.780
 little sideways and in a pretty cup 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.030
 to represent it well we will pour coffee 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.440
 this brand and we are that you like 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.180
 I now occupy in this faith 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.530
 said 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.530
 true you have to do 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:27.319
 and with the spoon after the same 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.739
 we will throw a teaspoon and a 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.739
 bit 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.190
 now boiling water 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.610
 carefully 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:44.260
 up to half more or less because the same 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.730
 the cream causes it to rise and will remain 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.330
 more or less so 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.360
 so far the cream is still missing 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.360
 Y 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.630
 the foam 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.220
 our 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.960
 is 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.960
 spectacular touch 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.010
 we will not throw to the cup 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.740
 remember that most likely 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.680
 then have to reheat the 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.720
 cappuccino because the cream makes it 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.690
 put them in and remember 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.930
 while more they kill more foam 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.780
 will now perform rovati a lot because to 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.630
 I beat minutes and minutes and I 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.870
 do in the foam is above what 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.270
 that remains in the spoon we put it as and 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.640
 we will take it out and so one can give you the 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.640
 little pictures and all the style 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:48.240
 this will be more or less like that but each 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.940
 more more more batÃ¡n more foam will be me 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.010
 have debated a lot and I still have smokes 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.090
 well but now more or less to show 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.569
 the air 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:02.780
 to the ingredient 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:10.400
 coffee that you cup 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:10.400
 white sugar boiling water 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.880
 and the cortecito counted in the teaspoon 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.549
 vanilla essence of energy to 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.580
 keep this if you like it and the 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:27.090
 Exquisite smell is skim milk 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:30.720
 what you like and cough and now you 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.259
 I'm going to ask that you please vote for 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.199

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:38.580
 councilman and well this was my video and
