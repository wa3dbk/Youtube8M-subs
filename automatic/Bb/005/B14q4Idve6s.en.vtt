another episode of cello chat in the

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.050 
another episode of cello chat in the
last<00:00:04.710> episode<00:00:05.190> we<00:00:05.310> were<00:00:05.430> talking<00:00:05.460> about

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
last episode we were talking about

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.230 
last episode we were talking about
making<00:00:06.270> smooth<00:00:06.870> bow<00:00:07.259> changes<00:00:08.000> let's<00:00:09.000> talk

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
making smooth bow changes let's talk

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.419 
making smooth bow changes let's talk
today<00:00:09.450> about<00:00:09.570> making<00:00:09.889> smooth<00:00:10.889> string

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
today about making smooth string

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.570 
today about making smooth string
crossings<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:12.750> when<00:00:13.110> we<00:00:13.200> go<00:00:13.349> from<00:00:13.620> one<00:00:13.710> string

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
crossings so when we go from one string

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.019 
crossings so when we go from one string
to<00:00:14.610> another<00:00:15.920> many<00:00:16.920> times<00:00:17.220> we<00:00:17.430> don't<00:00:17.609> want<00:00:17.789> any

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
to another many times we don't want any

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.090 
to another many times we don't want any
accents<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.289> want<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.830> be<00:00:19.920> as

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
accents in this we want this to be as

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.029 
accents in this we want this to be as
smooth<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.789> as<00:00:21.000> seamless<00:00:21.810> as<00:00:21.840> possible<00:00:22.080> and

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
smooth and as seamless as possible and

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.340 
smooth and as seamless as possible and
so<00:00:23.730> here's<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.029> few<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.390> few<00:00:24.600> things<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.140> want<00:00:25.320> to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
so here's a few a few things you want to

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.890 
so here's a few a few things you want to
consider<00:00:25.580> let's<00:00:26.580> say<00:00:26.699> for<00:00:26.910> example<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:27.689> want

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
consider let's say for example we want

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.019 
consider let's say for example we want
to<00:00:27.990> go<00:00:28.109> from<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.590> G<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.220> mean<00:00:29.250> excuse<00:00:29.670> me<00:00:29.699> from

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
to go from the G I mean excuse me from

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.229 
to go from the G I mean excuse me from
the<00:00:30.179> C<00:00:30.420> string<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.109> g<00:00:31.410> string<00:00:31.910> now<00:00:32.910> a

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the C string to the g string now a

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.700 
the C string to the g string now a
couple<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.809> things<00:00:34.020> can<00:00:34.170> really<00:00:34.410> help<00:00:34.530> us

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
couple of things can really help us

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.250 
couple of things can really help us
achieve<00:00:34.860> achieve<00:00:35.579> smoothness<00:00:36.270> one<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> is

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
achieve achieve smoothness one of the is

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.670 
achieve achieve smoothness one of the is
to<00:00:37.559> stay<00:00:37.800> as<00:00:38.070> near<00:00:38.430> as<00:00:38.489> possible<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:40.230> g

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
to stay as near as possible to the g

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.200 
to stay as near as possible to the g
string<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.430> when<00:00:41.579> we<00:00:41.700> do<00:00:41.879> make<00:00:42.059> this

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
string so that when we do make this

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.930 
string so that when we do make this
motion<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.809> extremely<00:00:43.410> minimal<00:00:43.620> if<00:00:44.160> we're<00:00:44.730> if

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
motion is extremely minimal if we're if

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.910 
motion is extremely minimal if we're if
we<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.239> our<00:00:45.270> arms<00:00:45.660> super<00:00:46.079> low<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.710> and

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
we have our arms super low like this and

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.799 
we have our arms super low like this and
we're<00:00:47.010> having<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.309> make<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.460> very<00:00:47.820> big<00:00:48.120> motion

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
we're having to make a very big motion

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.020 
we're having to make a very big motion
to<00:00:48.989> move<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> g<00:00:49.590> string<00:00:49.920> then<00:00:50.610> that's<00:00:50.820> kind

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
to move to the g string then that's kind

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.139 
to move to the g string then that's kind
of<00:00:51.059> wasted<00:00:51.570> motion<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.370> you<00:00:53.370> know<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.730> takes

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
of wasted motion and you know it takes

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.000 
of wasted motion and you know it takes
it<00:00:54.329> takes<00:00:54.570> time<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.260> not<00:00:55.379> as<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.770> not

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
it takes time and it's not as it's not

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.150 
it takes time and it's not as it's not
as<00:00:56.160> efficient<00:00:57.059> okay<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.590> other<00:00:58.800> thing<00:00:59.039> is

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
as efficient okay and the other thing is

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.760 
as efficient okay and the other thing is
we<00:00:59.309> want<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.579> kind<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.850> anticipate<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:01.289> change

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
we want to kind of anticipate the change

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.109 
we want to kind of anticipate the change
with<00:01:02.670> our<00:01:02.910> arm<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.840> long<00:01:04.549> even<00:01:05.549> before<00:01:06.000> we

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
with our arm so long even before we

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.170 
with our arm so long even before we
actually<00:01:06.840> make<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.860> change<00:01:08.220> from<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:08.850> string

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
actually make the change from one string

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.929 
actually make the change from one string
to<00:01:09.210> another<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:10.350> level<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.920> our<00:01:11.040> arm<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
to another the level of our arm is it

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.750 
to another the level of our arm is it
starts<00:01:12.570> actually<00:01:12.810> here<00:01:13.590> right<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.280> let's<00:01:14.640> say

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
starts actually here right so let's say

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.520 
starts actually here right so let's say
for<00:01:14.790> example<00:01:15.330> I'm<00:01:15.420> going<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.810> other<00:01:15.840> way<00:01:16.140> I'm

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
for example I'm going the other way I'm

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.560 
for example I'm going the other way I'm
going<00:01:16.890> from<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.159> G<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.549> C<00:01:17.880> well<00:01:18.420> I'm

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
going from the G to the C well I'm

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.260 
going from the G to the C well I'm
playing<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.890> might<00:01:20.070> lower<00:01:20.430> my<00:01:20.759> elbow<00:01:21.210> in

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
playing and I might lower my elbow in

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.240 
playing and I might lower my elbow in
order<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.600> reach<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.500> certain

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
order to reach this so a certain

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.670 
order to reach this so a certain
anticipation<00:01:24.210> with<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.750> bow<00:01:24.930> arm<00:01:25.259> will<00:01:25.530> make

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
anticipation with the bow arm will make

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.980 
anticipation with the bow arm will make
things<00:01:25.920> smoother<00:01:26.549> okay<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.509> here's<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.810> couple

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
things smoother okay so here's a couple

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.770 
things smoother okay so here's a couple
of<00:01:28.229> exercises<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.280> will<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.939> helpful<00:01:30.240> so

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
of exercises that will be helpful so

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.030 
of exercises that will be helpful so
you're<00:01:30.869> going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.020> start<00:01:31.259> off<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.799> C

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
you're going to start off on the C

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.730 
you're going to start off on the C
string<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:33.509> one<00:01:33.869> bow<00:01:34.140> you're<00:01:34.350> gonna<00:01:34.470> play

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
string and on one bow you're gonna play

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:50.100 
string and on one bow you're gonna play
all<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.009> your<00:01:35.189> open<00:01:35.610> strings<00:01:35.939> like<00:01:36.090> this

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.490 

okay<00:01:50.800> I<00:01:50.830> want<00:01:51.070> you<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.310> notice<00:01:51.520> how<00:01:51.790> smooth<00:01:52.500> the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
okay I want you to notice how smooth the

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.130 
okay I want you to notice how smooth the
motion<00:01:53.950> was<00:01:54.130> no<00:01:54.700> very<00:01:55.090> often<00:01:55.510> with<00:01:55.660> my<00:01:55.840> with<00:01:56.110> my

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
motion was no very often with my with my

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.720 
motion was no very often with my with my
beginner<00:01:56.590> students<00:01:57.070> I'll<00:01:57.190> see<00:01:57.430> something

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
beginner students I'll see something

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.580 
beginner students I'll see something
like<00:01:58.000> this<00:01:58.330> this<00:01:58.570> was<00:01:58.780> this<00:01:59.110> is<00:01:59.290> what<00:01:59.470> you

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
like this this was this is what you

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:08.740 
like this this was this is what you
don't<00:01:59.860> want<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.130> do

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.140 

it's<00:02:09.350> almost<00:02:09.530> like<00:02:09.710> the<00:02:09.950> arm<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:10.520> dropping

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
it's almost like the arm is dropping

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.500 
it's almost like the arm is dropping
depth<00:02:11.390> what<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:11.990> get<00:02:12.170> are<00:02:12.290> accents<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.550> we

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
depth what you get are accents that we

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.110 
depth what you get are accents that we
really<00:02:14.810> don't<00:02:15.260> want<00:02:15.530> right<00:02:16.220> most<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.910> time

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
really don't want right most of the time

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.720 
really don't want right most of the time
so<00:02:17.840> you<00:02:18.050> want<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.530> anticipate<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.460> want

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
so you want to anticipate and you want

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.120 
so you want to anticipate and you want
to<00:02:19.850> make<00:02:20.060> things<00:02:20.270> smoother<00:02:21.110> right<00:02:21.500> another

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
to make things smoother right another

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.980 
to make things smoother right another
exercise<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.730> can<00:02:23.060> be<00:02:23.180> rather<00:02:23.360> useful<00:02:23.810> is

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
exercise that can be rather useful is

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:33.320 
exercise that can be rather useful is
just<00:02:24.230> going<00:02:24.380> between<00:02:24.920> two<00:02:25.250> strings<00:02:25.610> like<00:02:25.880> this

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.140 

and<00:02:34.020> now<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:35.010> want<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.490> notice<00:02:35.760> for<00:02:36.120> a

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
and now I want you to notice for a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.180 
and now I want you to notice for a
second<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.780> when<00:02:36.960> you're<00:02:37.110> out<00:02:37.380> of<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.740> tip

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
second that when you're out of the tip

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.490 
second that when you're out of the tip
the<00:02:38.550> motion<00:02:39.210> going<00:02:39.450> between<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.110> strings

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
the motion going between the strings

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.710 
the motion going between the strings
with<00:02:40.830> your<00:02:41.010> hand<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.610> little<00:02:42.030> wider<00:02:42.300> and

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
with your hand is a little wider and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.930 
with your hand is a little wider and
then<00:02:43.230> when<00:02:43.470> you're<00:02:43.620> here<00:02:44.040> it's<00:02:44.190> very<00:02:44.610> minimal

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
then when you're here it's very minimal

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.590 
then when you're here it's very minimal
right<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.230> want<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.470> get<00:02:46.590> used<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.600> so

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
right so you want to get used to that so

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.790 
right so you want to get used to that so
you<00:02:48.690> want<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.960> make<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.230> distance<00:02:49.590> between

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
you want to make the distance between

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.760 
you want to make the distance between
the<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.670> D<00:02:50.910> are<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.630> two<00:02:51.870> strings<00:02:52.230> to

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
the a and the D are the two strings to

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.740 
the a and the D are the two strings to
be<00:02:52.890> extremely<00:02:53.580> small<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:54.390> want<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.660> get

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
be extremely small and you want to get

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.320 
be extremely small and you want to get
used<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.350> this<00:02:55.470> feeling<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:56.190> exactly<00:02:56.790> how<00:02:57.030> far

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
used to this feeling of exactly how far

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.630 
used to this feeling of exactly how far
your<00:02:57.600> arm<00:02:57.810> needs<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.290> travel<00:02:58.560> right<00:02:59.100> let's<00:02:59.550> try

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
your arm needs to travel right let's try

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.260 
your arm needs to travel right let's try
this<00:02:59.730> again

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
this again

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.570 
this again
now<00:03:00.420> watch<00:03:00.660> as<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:01.020> walk<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.410> tip<00:03:01.800> how<00:03:02.310> this

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
now watch as I walk to the tip how this

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:15.220 
now watch as I walk to the tip how this
naturally<00:03:03.270> must<00:03:03.570> increase

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.199 

okay<00:03:16.230> now<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.770> other<00:03:17.010> thing<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:18.030> want

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
okay now the other thing that you want

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.089 
okay now the other thing that you want
to<00:03:18.270> be<00:03:18.390> aware<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.690> was<00:03:18.959> not<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.410> change<00:03:19.470> the

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
to be aware I was not to change the

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.920 
to be aware I was not to change the
weight<00:03:20.520> how<00:03:20.880> much<00:03:21.030> weight<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:21.540> put<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.840> the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
weight how much weight you put in the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.270 
weight how much weight you put in the
string<00:03:22.170> when<00:03:22.319> you<00:03:22.349> go<00:03:22.530> from<00:03:22.709> one<00:03:22.800> to<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.160> other

string when you go from one to the other

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.100 
string when you go from one to the other
if<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:23.790> change<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.360> weight<00:03:24.569> you're<00:03:25.050> gonna

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
if you change the weight you're gonna

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.780 
if you change the weight you're gonna
change<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.650> sound<00:03:26.069> and<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:26.340> might<00:03:26.520> get<00:03:26.700> an

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
change the sound and you might get an

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.600 
change the sound and you might get an
accent<00:03:27.239> then<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:27.870> these<00:03:28.830> are<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.099> few<00:03:29.340> tricks

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
accent then so these are a few tricks

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.160 
accent then so these are a few tricks
that<00:03:29.730> should<00:03:30.060> help<00:03:30.239> with<00:03:30.540> legato<00:03:31.020> playing

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
that should help with legato playing

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.740 
that should help with legato playing
okay<00:03:32.069> and<00:03:32.280> string<00:03:32.730> crossings<00:03:33.120> thank<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.510> very

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
okay and string crossings thank you very

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.680 
okay and string crossings thank you very
much<00:03:34.019> for<00:03:34.290> your<00:03:34.349> time
