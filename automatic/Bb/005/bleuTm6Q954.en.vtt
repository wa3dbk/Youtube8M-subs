 So far, the Republic of Korea dating industry is doing to produce personal and private capacity 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.790
 Reliably 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:30.010
 But now it came to be operating by guesswork 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:31.840
 The love industry is also a time to be systematically operated by specialized personnel. 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:37.600
 I think 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:43.720
 Let's hold a department with English business and music business and train professional manpower. 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:48.909
 After that, we are planning to advance into broadcasting program production and music business. 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:54.370

 I will focus on excavation training. 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.870
 If you make 4 kills, 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:18.830
 It's a breakthrough for your love affair. 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:22.480
 My ultimate goal is to plan our fan country 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.480
 Listing on the stock market 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:33.219
 To be listed as a formula company is to conduct various audits and shareholders' 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:39.660
 I mean, you have to respond from interference. 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:42.690
 For okay That's why I want to contracts traded Shine 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.690
 There is a limit to attracting personal investment and doing business. 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.850
 As a listed company, two more people 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:53.439
 Want to do business 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:59.289
 This is what the management office here is doing . 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:02:01.270
 I think that the professional actor of the agency, the relationship, is more professional and systematic. 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.840
 So you're right. 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:11.170
 Singers and actors can focus on singing and acting 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:13.100
 From the corporate level to the image making public relations university 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.380

 Uh-huh. Liza. The person looks different. 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:50.790
 Why do you think that Anne Malleong is a completely different person when you think about it? 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:52.410
 Oh, joy in Japan, but if you learn a lot from business people 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:58.500
 Since olden times 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:02.610
 I knew this was a lucky fortune , but I did not really know what it was . 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.230
 It is not unfortunate to think that the Japanese escaped in Milyang now. 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.230
 Easy-going as near 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:15.459

 Stop it. 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:19.000
 Well, it's already settled in foreign countries 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:24.450
 The way that the actors and singers are systematically managed by the company 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.450
 Kang is the one who wants to recruit you first 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:33.690

 Why 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.130
