the stage on me so I know he likes it
too<00:04:22.560> yeah<00:04:22.919> this<00:04:23.130> is<00:04:23.250> one<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.460> those<00:04:23.610> things

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
too yeah this is one of those things

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.120 
too yeah this is one of those things
where<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:24.600> benefits<00:04:25.139> both<00:04:25.199> characters<00:04:25.650> yeah
