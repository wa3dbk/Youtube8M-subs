00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hi girls for today's video me 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.430
 I am inspired by the beautiful kim 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.010
 kardashian we're going to do the base i 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.849
 eyes and hair 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.340
 let's start with lighting up the face 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.139
 we spread our dyed sheet 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.340
 habitual 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.850
 we take a concealer or an eye shadow 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.000
 clear in cream and we go to put it 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.269
 under the eyes a little triangle shape 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.300
 and nose for the bow of cupid under the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:38.450
 instrument cheeks is at the center of the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.450
 front 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.000
 then with the light we go to illuminate 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.940
 some areas of our face while with 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.460
 a foundation much darker than yours 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.489
 incarnate we will go back to the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.660
 volumes to make her touch him turin 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.410
 put under the cheekbone allies of the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.199
 our nose 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.049
 this is just the trick for 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.180
 thin the data under the lip 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.880
 lower 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.880
 on the temples the jaw 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.450
 and on your forehead the more you have it 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.600
 high more you have to put then we go to 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.560
 first blend the points we study 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.630
 clear with a finger or a sponge 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.630
 without going to mix them with the dark ones 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.620
 then we join the points where we had done the 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.620
 with touring 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.700
 we really have to go and create some 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.700
 natural shadows 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.640
 we take the browser land and it 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.790
 we apply under the cheekbone 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.970
 this will serve to create that one 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.099
 optical effect that will hold ours 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.140
 more barbed face with powder 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.420
 clear we go to illuminate 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.450
 further the areas where we had 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.420
 passed the concealer with eyeshadow 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.599
 clear then we pass the blush on 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.630
 cheeks and defined the mother we pass 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.370
 in the eyes we light the inner corner 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.620
 of the eye with a clear eye shadow 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.560
 maybe on the side in the external destination 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.720
 of the eye we put a gold eye shadow 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.760
 in the eyelid fold an eye shadow 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.760
 brown we exclude 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.180
 always of the eyelid fold we go to 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:06.280
 put a little black eye shadow with the 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.370
 magic to say let's go to make a line 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.390
 on the upper ciliary rhyme must not 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.440
 be perfect because then it will be nuanced 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.709
 we put the black pencil also 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.930
 within the eye we fade with a 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.930
 small brush rears the black pencil 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.989
 I take an eyeliner marrying in a 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.480
 year in gel with the brush you can 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.410
 even use liner never intends later 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.980
 let's go to make a line of eyeliner 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.080
 above the eye we put false eyelashes 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.390
 do not let my children carlo because I had 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.510
 still those of carnival and we put the 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.510
 tough mascara we bang our hair 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:53.349
 then let's go and comb the area that 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:58.299
 we want to go to curl we pass 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:04:01.630
 a protective spray for the salon and with 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:06.310
 the curly hair from the tip we go to 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.280
 finished doing the bang we put it on 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.109
 heat protector both because 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.250
 precisely it protects the hair but also 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:16.870
 because it makes the hair a little more moist 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.590
 we always also pass the lacquer after having 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.590
 made the bocolo 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.300
 I think this is a very method 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.530
 fast to make the waves really want 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.560
 five minutes because then they don't have to 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:44.190
 to be perfect curls also because 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.940
 then we'll go right to break them there with the 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:53.310
 let's go a bit to break them by 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:57.360
 create the effect plus wave l infinity 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.190
 I hope you enjoyed the video and there 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.990
 see you soon 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.990
 good weekend girls hello
