00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.240 
mean beast it's easy to drive no matter
in<00:06:37.970> which<00:06:38.120> mode<00:06:38.510> you<00:06:38.540> are<00:06:38.750> but<00:06:39.620> the<00:06:39.740> suspension

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
in which mode you are but the suspension

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.570 
in which mode you are but the suspension
gets<00:06:40.550> really<00:06:41.030> hard<00:06:41.270> and<00:06:42.130> once<00:06:43.130> you<00:06:43.280> hit<00:06:43.400> the

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
gets really hard and once you hit the

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.050 
gets really hard and once you hit the
gas<00:06:43.790> it<00:06:44.210> just<00:06:44.630> jumps<00:06:45.200> forward<00:06:45.500> no<00:06:46.490> matter<00:06:46.730> what

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
gas it just jumps forward no matter what

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.240 
gas it just jumps forward no matter what
what<00:06:47.450> speed<00:06:47.900> you're<00:06:48.020> cruising<00:06:48.410> in<00:06:48.560> or<00:06:48.830> driving

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
what speed you're cruising in or driving

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.960 
what speed you're cruising in or driving
I<00:06:49.490> think<00:06:50.060> from<00:06:50.240> zero<00:06:50.510> to<00:06:50.690> 60<00:06:51.290> miles<00:06:51.530> per<00:06:51.620> hour

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
I think from zero to 60 miles per hour

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:57.310 
I think from zero to 60 miles per hour
3.9<00:06:52.970> seconds<00:06:53.920> it's<00:06:54.920> a<00:06:55.010> really<00:06:55.280> good<00:06:55.960> time<00:06:56.990> and

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:57.320 
3.9 seconds it's a really good time and

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.740 
3.9 seconds it's a really good time and
once<00:06:57.650> you<00:06:57.830> accelerate<00:06:58.220> it<00:06:58.760> feels<00:06:59.390> like<00:06:59.570> it's

00:06:59.740 --> 00:06:59.750 
once you accelerate it feels like it's

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.070 
once you accelerate it feels like it's
not<00:06:59.870> ending<00:07:00.350> you<00:07:00.560> know<00:07:00.710> I<00:07:00.980> mean<00:07:01.610> 3.9<00:07:02.510> seconds
