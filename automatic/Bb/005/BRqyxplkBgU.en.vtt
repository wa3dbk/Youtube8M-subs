00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:11.400
 Nice to meet you so I dwaeseo Video Player is the spirit I 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.349
 Many questions without God, he for the first time when they may very Loach stand again 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.890
 There were questions. 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.350
 Among them is this one these things I do not always solved iteotneundeyo 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.410
 What was it? 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.200
 There are two young people who work hard after 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.510
 Study hard and pray 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:34.340
 There the two of serving in the church, and so hard that one person is now a friend 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.460
 Pass the desired college 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.330
 One fell for the university I wanted. 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:45.890
 Now, a friend who has passed the desired college does so with the grace of God who has not done anything. 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:49.970
 It 's not that big of a problem. 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:54.890
 Despite the same hard work and prayer , 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:58.940
 Friends to remove one did not pass people really want to see how we 1 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.170
 Once we have a question, what should we be comforting? 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.040
 I was there. 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.619
 For example, a friend who passed the exam was more like God and a friend who fell 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.009
 Did God love less or 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:15.560
 Did a dropped friend pray more than a passed friend? 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:19.759
 Certainly not, but why would somebody fall and pass someone else? 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.840
 Someone else has to taste the joy of some success and fail someone 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.190
 Is there 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:30.800
 We also have to look at what we see by the same creature 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:34.610
 Shall we've posted but I happened Lim rattling over time these 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:39.470
 I could feel things . Some people 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:42.590
 Start your life in the name of success But the success that success 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.700
 I saw too many cases that ended in failure. 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.390
 And yet others start life in the name of failure, 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.470
 I've seen a lot of people standing up and going to success. 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.830
 if so 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.570
 We know that we are always blessed with what God has given us 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:05.310
 Whatever it is, then, in fact, success and failure 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:08.369
 The only other all the opposite, but I called one kind of initial obligations 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.560
 I think so success is a blessing. 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:17.580
 Failure is also a blessing . In the life of a person who starts success with success. 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:22.500
 If it ends in failure and life that started with failure ends in success 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:25.770
 The fact is that success is not success and failure is not failure. 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.790
 If you understand this, it has succeeded 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:34.320
 Do not be frustrated and do not be frustrated because you failed. 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:38.850
 Because our life is not ending now, but God 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:43.490
 Each of us have any plans iteusinji the respective programs sseusigo the plan 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:49.650
 It's different, because the way to go when you're done with the time, so I 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:50.550
 We have some success in life as we are living together and one is accompanied by success. 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.350
 When you meet 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.489
 But if you are young people who are not arrogant or frustrated when you meet failure 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.590
 I wish 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:03.150
 And what I want to share with young people personally nowadays is like this 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.489
 I want to share 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.110
 Some friends will stand by the proposal but suggests that a lot of talk about this hadeora 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:15.570
 I did. 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.709
 Wait wait as've endured much more intolerable that the money came therefore stand 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.269
 I can not. 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:24.810
 But I think that patience is not what I think. 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:27.000
 I can not stand and be relative and ask if we can not take it all 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:32.310
 It 's not patience . 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.870
 True patience is the moment when I think that true patience can not stand anymore 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.730
 I think it starts. 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.930
 Now I can not even tried the word in much more effort will require the same 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.459
 The fact is 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:49.530
 I think it is the end of the effort, not the end. 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:51.209
 I can not do it anymore and I can not do it anymore. 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:57.690
 I thought it was going to be 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:04:01.769
 Ido thing mean some difficulties now, and there's got to be a crisis group 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:05.190
 As I just said, this failure is not a failure, 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:09.180
 Dreaming of coming to you through stepping bridge 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:12.290
 I hope that you can make the future yours. 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.290
 Bless everyone
