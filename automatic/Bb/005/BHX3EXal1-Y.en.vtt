really<00:00:18.119> easy<00:00:18.529> basics<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.710> system<00:00:20.040> you<00:00:20.189> can

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
really easy basics of the system you can

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.460 
really easy basics of the system you can
get<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> two<00:00:21.300> inch<00:00:21.480> all<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.810> way<00:00:21.930> up<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.170> 12

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
get a two inch all the way up to a 12

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.339 
get a two inch all the way up to a 12
inch<00:00:22.619> number<00:00:22.950> 2<00:00:23.250> 4<00:00:23.580> 6<00:00:23.790> 8<00:00:24.180> 10<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:24.840> 12<00:00:25.140> inch

team jerseys to show you the system here

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.490 
team jerseys to show you the system here
we<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.800> our<00:00:47.070> 8<00:00:47.519> inch<00:00:47.699> number<00:00:48.090> your<00:00:48.629> six-30<00:00:49.140> is

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
we have our 8 inch number your six-30 is

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.380 
we have our 8 inch number your six-30 is
one<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:49.800> one<00:00:50.039> screen<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:51.030> through<00:00:51.210> five

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
one on one screen and one through five

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.160 
one on one screen and one through five
is<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.019> other<00:00:52.140> three<00:00:53.870> we're<00:00:54.870> gonna<00:00:54.929> print

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
is on the other three we're gonna print

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.630 
is on the other three we're gonna print
in<00:00:55.289> number<00:00:55.530> 11<00:00:55.949> because<00:00:56.100> I'm<00:00:56.309> gonna<00:00:56.399> show<00:00:56.579> you

in number 11 because I'm gonna show you

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.799 
in number 11 because I'm gonna show you
something<00:00:56.969> really<00:00:57.120> cool<00:00:57.359> that<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:57.690> with

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
something really cool that we do with

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.340 
something really cool that we do with
that<00:00:57.989> system<00:00:59.149> with<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.269> number<00:01:00.539> one<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.109> one

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
that system with the number one the one

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.720 
that system with the number one the one
problem<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.769> lot<00:01:01.890> people<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.460> it's

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
problem a lot people have is it's

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.050 
problem a lot people have is it's
narrower<00:01:03.300> than<00:01:03.570> then<00:01:04.050> 2<00:01:04.710> through<00:01:05.010> zero<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
narrower than then 2 through zero so the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.080 
narrower than then 2 through zero so the
problem<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.450> if<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.530> get<00:01:07.680> with<00:01:07.800> thirteen<00:01:08.310> one

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
problem is if you get with thirteen one

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.670 
problem is if you get with thirteen one
two<00:01:09.270> three<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.810> one's<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.230> to<00:01:10.290> push<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.590> off

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
two three the one's going to push it off

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.800 
two three the one's going to push it off
to<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> side<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.340> not<00:01:11.720> compensated<00:01:12.720> for

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
to the side if it's not compensated for

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.150 
to the side if it's not compensated for
that<00:01:12.870> narrower<00:01:13.320> one<00:01:13.620> with<00:01:14.460> our<00:01:14.610> system<00:01:15.150> each

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
that narrower one with our system each

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.710 
that narrower one with our system each
number<00:01:17.160> has<00:01:17.190> five<00:01:17.640> different<00:01:17.850> locations<00:01:18.510> so

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
number has five different locations so

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.590 
number has five different locations so
you<00:01:19.260> have<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.880> let's<00:01:20.880> take<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> three<00:01:21.390> for

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
you have a let's take a three for

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.450 
you have a let's take a three for
example<00:01:22.430> it'll<00:01:23.430> actually<00:01:23.520> show<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.910> here<00:01:25.460> our

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
example it'll actually show you here our

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.890 
example it'll actually show you here our
side<00:01:26.730> rail<00:01:26.910> will<00:01:27.090> basically<00:01:27.240> tell<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.750> where

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
side rail will basically tell you where

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.430 
side rail will basically tell you where
to<00:01:28.050> go

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
to go

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.890 
to go
the<00:01:28.890> yellow<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.400> your<00:01:29.760> site<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.300> this<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.690> for<00:01:30.840> a

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
the yellow is your site so this is for a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.690 
the yellow is your site so this is for a
three<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.230> the<00:01:31.320> center<00:01:31.650> if<00:01:32.160> you<00:01:32.280> need<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> three

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
three in the center if you need a three

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.360 
three in the center if you need a three
on<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.850> left<00:01:33.090> side<00:01:33.710> three<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.920> right<00:01:35.070> side

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
on the left side three on the right side

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.240 
on the left side three on the right side
and<00:01:35.670> now<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> one<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.560> will<00:01:37.620> compensate

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
and now for the one it will compensate

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.310 
and now for the one it will compensate
so<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:38.670> you're<00:01:38.790> doing<00:01:38.910> a<00:01:39.000> 13<00:01:39.390> that'll<00:01:39.990> bring<00:01:40.140> in

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
so if you're doing a 13 that'll bring in

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.310 
so if you're doing a 13 that'll bring in
a<00:01:40.350> little<00:01:40.560> bit<00:01:40.710> more<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:40.980> that<00:01:41.160> side<00:01:41.570> 31<00:01:42.570> it'll

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
a little bit more on that side 31 it'll

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.630 
a little bit more on that side 31 it'll
bring<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.710> from<00:01:43.980> what<00:01:44.160> you<00:01:44.250> would<00:01:44.310> normally

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
bring it in from what you would normally

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.030 
bring it in from what you would normally
have<00:01:44.760> on<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.330> left<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.080> makes<00:01:46.320> makes<00:01:46.680> up<00:01:46.860> for

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
have on the left so makes makes up for

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.220 
have on the left so makes makes up for
that<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.400> narrower<00:01:47.850> one<00:01:48.180> we're<00:01:48.840> gonna<00:01:48.900> plant

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
that that narrower one we're gonna plant

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.740 
that that narrower one we're gonna plant
an<00:01:49.470> 11

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
an 11

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.870 
an 11
just<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:52.810> show<00:01:52.990> you<00:01:53.050> where<00:01:53.350> it's<00:01:53.500> gonna<00:01:53.880> line

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
just to show you where it's gonna line

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:03.170 
just to show you where it's gonna line
up

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180
