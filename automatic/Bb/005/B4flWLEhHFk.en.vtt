00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
to imply that the bridge section really

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.120 
to imply that the bridge section really
need<00:03:05.300> those<00:03:05.540> chords

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.760 
none of the bit that we really fixed I
think<00:03:38.600> was<00:03:38.840> in<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.260> middle

this simple figure and then later

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.830 
this simple figure and then later
horrified<00:04:43.610> me<00:04:43.729> to<00:04:43.850> realize<00:04:44.240> that<00:04:44.510> someone

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
horrified me to realize that someone

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.150 
horrified me to realize that someone
might<00:04:45.020> listen<00:04:45.229> to<00:04:45.380> it<00:04:45.620> and<00:04:45.740> just<00:04:45.890> think<00:04:46.040> it's

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
might listen to it and just think it's

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.210 
might listen to it and just think it's
in<00:04:46.310> four<00:04:46.550> four<00:04:46.790> and<00:04:47.120> one<00:04:47.270> two<00:04:47.540> three<00:04:51.039> which<00:04:52.039> is

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
in four four and one two three which is

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.990 
in four four and one two three which is
terrible<00:04:52.760> I<00:04:53.710> thought<00:04:54.710> although<00:04:55.580> we've

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
terrible I thought although we've

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.430 
terrible I thought although we've
already<00:04:56.180> recorded<00:04:56.450> the<00:04:56.780> album<00:04:57.050> version<00:04:57.350> we

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
already recorded the album version we

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.409 
already recorded the album version we
probably<00:04:57.710> need<00:04:58.070> some<00:04:58.280> chords<00:04:58.700> to<00:04:59.000> stop<00:04:59.270> it

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
probably need some chords to stop it

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.350 
probably need some chords to stop it
from<00:04:59.539> sucking<00:04:59.870> and<00:05:00.700> these<00:05:01.700> are<00:05:01.880> good<00:05:02.030> courts

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
from sucking and these are good courts

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:30.040 
from sucking and these are good courts
I'm<00:05:02.510> pleased<00:05:02.720> with<00:05:02.930> this

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.859 

it<00:05:31.050> almost<00:05:31.229> resembles<00:05:31.889> music<00:05:32.249> now<00:05:32.399> so<00:05:32.869> filled

00:05:33.859 --> 00:05:33.869 
it almost resembles music now so filled

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:35.749 
it almost resembles music now so filled
with<00:05:34.080> sorrow<00:05:34.349> that<00:05:34.649> we<00:05:34.739> forgot<00:05:35.009> to<00:05:35.159> do<00:05:35.279> that<00:05:35.309> we

sense<00:06:18.269> of<00:06:18.449> it<00:06:18.599> and<00:06:18.839> then<00:06:18.959> we<00:06:19.949> did<00:06:20.099> what<00:06:20.249> ifs<00:06:20.429> I

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 
sense of it and then we did what ifs I

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.199 
sense of it and then we did what ifs I
guess<00:06:20.909> which<00:06:21.719> is<00:06:22.009> another<00:06:23.009> very<00:06:23.159> old<00:06:23.429> tune<00:06:23.879> and

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:24.209 
guess which is another very old tune and

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:27.139 
guess which is another very old tune and
that<00:06:24.839> one<00:06:24.990> was<00:06:25.110> meant<00:06:25.319> to<00:06:25.379> sound<00:06:25.649> like<00:06:26.149> 70s

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:27.149 
that one was meant to sound like 70s

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:29.749 
that one was meant to sound like 70s
analog<00:06:27.749> synth<00:06:28.079> kind<00:06:29.039> of<00:06:29.129> effects<00:06:29.369> with<00:06:29.669> the

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 
analog synth kind of effects with the

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.279 
analog synth kind of effects with the
portamento<00:06:30.209> turned<00:06:30.629> up<00:06:30.899> so<00:06:31.019> you<00:06:31.110> get<00:06:31.169> these

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:31.289 
portamento turned up so you get these

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:33.319 
portamento turned up so you get these
long<00:06:31.499> prog<00:06:32.009> melodies<00:06:32.550> so<00:06:32.759> everything<00:06:33.059> none<00:06:33.209> of

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:33.329 
long prog melodies so everything none of

00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:35.809 
long prog melodies so everything none of
light<00:06:33.599> into<00:06:33.899> the<00:06:33.990> next<00:06:34.259> note<00:06:34.459> guitars<00:06:35.459> that<00:06:35.639> do

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:35.819 
light into the next note guitars that do

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:39.439 
light into the next note guitars that do
that<00:06:36.089> at<00:06:36.869> least<00:06:37.019> when<00:06:37.169> I<00:06:37.199> wrote<00:06:37.610> this<00:06:38.610> tune<00:06:38.999> so

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:39.449 
that at least when I wrote this tune so

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:40.879 
that at least when I wrote this tune so
many<00:06:39.659> years<00:06:39.929> ago<00:06:40.050> I<00:06:40.139> didn't<00:06:40.469> have<00:06:40.589> a<00:06:40.619> fretless

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:40.889 
many years ago I didn't have a fretless

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:42.679 
many years ago I didn't have a fretless
guitar<00:06:41.039> so<00:06:41.519> these<00:06:41.669> things<00:06:41.939> we've<00:06:42.209> got<00:06:42.329> getting

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:42.689 
guitar so these things we've got getting

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:44.929 
guitar so these things we've got getting
in<00:06:42.779> the<00:06:42.869> way<00:06:42.990> I<00:06:43.289> thought<00:06:44.129> we<00:06:44.249> need<00:06:44.639> to<00:06:44.759> write

00:06:44.929 --> 00:06:44.939 
in the way I thought we need to write

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:46.339 
in the way I thought we need to write
something<00:06:45.179> that's<00:06:45.269> lighter<00:06:45.629> down<00:06:45.899> as<00:06:46.050> much<00:06:46.139> as

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:46.349 
something that's lighter down as much as

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:55.180 
something that's lighter down as much as
possible

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.190 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.200 

so<00:06:56.190> it's<00:06:56.340> not<00:06:56.520> the<00:06:56.670> most<00:06:56.820> convenient

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210 
so it's not the most convenient

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.820 
so it's not the most convenient
fingering<00:06:57.840> that's<00:06:57.990> the<00:06:58.110> only<00:06:58.260> way<00:06:58.380> to<00:06:58.440> make<00:06:58.680> it

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
fingering that's the only way to make it

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.490 
fingering that's the only way to make it
sound<00:06:59.040> so<00:06:59.580> Korean<00:06:59.820> weird

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
sound so Korean weird

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.640 
sound so Korean weird
so<00:07:02.250> that's<00:07:02.430> waste<00:07:03.080> that's<00:07:04.080> the<00:07:04.260> important

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
so that's waste that's the important

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.320 
so that's waste that's the important
part<00:07:04.830> of<00:07:04.980> wave<00:07:05.160> so<00:07:05.400> it's<00:07:05.550> one<00:07:05.670> stupid<00:07:05.970> part

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
part of wave so it's one stupid part

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.180 
part of wave so it's one stupid part
that<00:07:06.540> in<00:07:06.690> retrospect<00:07:07.080> doesn't<00:07:07.830> need<00:07:07.950> to<00:07:08.070> be

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.190 
that in retrospect doesn't need to be

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.050 
that in retrospect doesn't need to be
there<00:07:08.400> at<00:07:08.520> all<00:07:08.670> which<00:07:08.940> is<00:07:09.030> this<00:07:10.790> what<00:07:11.790> was<00:07:11.940> I

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:19.430
