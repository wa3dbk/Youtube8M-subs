00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
hit 600 for die soldier and all that I

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.210 
hit 600 for die soldier and all that I
think<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.350> think<00:01:34.500> we<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.710> do<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.920> six<00:01:35.159> hundred

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
think I think we can do it six hundred

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.920 
think I think we can do it six hundred
likes<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.670> video<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.150> usually<00:01:36.720> ask<00:01:36.840> for

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
likes on this video I usually ask for

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.690 
likes on this video I usually ask for
five<00:01:37.200> hundred<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.770> guys<00:01:37.950> always<00:01:38.220> do<00:01:38.520> that

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
five hundred and you guys always do that

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.330 
five hundred and you guys always do that
so<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.810> think<00:01:40.049> 600<00:01:40.500> would<00:01:40.590> be<00:01:40.710> too<00:01:40.890> far<00:01:41.070> off<00:01:41.130> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
so I think 600 would be too far off to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.550 
so I think 600 would be too far off to
ask<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.090> yeah<00:01:42.240> try<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.869> hit<00:01:43.170> 600

second round is as you can see if you

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.759 
second round is as you can see if you
look<00:03:24.669> at<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.819> mini-map<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.780> green<00:03:26.049> guy<00:03:26.290> the

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
look at the mini-map the green guy the

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.050 
look at the mini-map the green guy the
random<00:03:27.069> on<00:03:27.160> our<00:03:27.280> team<00:03:27.430> that's<00:03:27.730> another<00:03:27.910> thing

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
random on our team that's another thing

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.759 
random on our team that's another thing
we're<00:03:28.239> also<00:03:28.359> playing<00:03:28.569> 3v4<00:03:29.230> pretty<00:03:29.470> much<00:03:29.620> I

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
we're also playing 3v4 pretty much I

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.220 
we're also playing 3v4 pretty much I
guess<00:03:29.889> you<00:03:29.980> could<00:03:30.099> say<00:03:30.900> for<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:31.930> couple<00:03:32.169> reasons

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
guess you could say for a couple reasons

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.379 
guess you could say for a couple reasons
one<00:03:32.530> well<00:03:32.889> I<00:03:32.919> mean<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.340> is<00:03:33.489> a<00:03:33.760> three<00:03:34.120> before

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
one well I mean it is a three before

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:35.580 
one well I mean it is a three before
this<00:03:34.480> we<00:03:34.599> were<00:03:34.690> playing<00:03:34.930> solo<00:03:35.139> League<00:03:35.380> so<00:03:35.530> it

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
this we were playing solo League so it

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.800 
this we were playing solo League so it
was<00:03:35.709> me<00:03:35.859> retching<00:03:36.250> mags<00:03:36.549> and<00:03:36.910> then<00:03:37.540> we<00:03:37.690> just

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
was me retching mags and then we just

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.449 
was me retching mags and then we just
had<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.019> know<00:03:38.079> like<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.290> random<00:03:38.530> 4th<00:03:38.829> now<00:03:39.370> the

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
had you know like a random 4th now the

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.909 
had you know like a random 4th now the
problem<00:03:39.760> is<00:03:39.790> random<00:03:40.090> 4th<00:03:40.299> was<00:03:40.859> obvious<00:03:41.859> we

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
problem is random 4th was obvious we

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:42.990 
problem is random 4th was obvious we
couldn't<00:03:42.190> communicate<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.700> him<00:03:42.819> or<00:03:42.880> anything

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
couldn't communicate to him or anything

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.550 
couldn't communicate to him or anything
yeah<00:03:43.180> isn't<00:03:43.389> that<00:03:43.480> bad<00:03:43.690> I<00:03:43.720> mean<00:03:43.900> he<00:03:44.139> did<00:03:44.319> pull

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
yeah isn't that bad I mean he did pull

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.050 
yeah isn't that bad I mean he did pull
the<00:03:44.650> flags<00:03:44.889> like<00:03:45.130> he<00:03:45.220> wasn't<00:03:45.489> stupid<00:03:45.639> like<00:03:45.940> he

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
the flags like he wasn't stupid like he

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.159 
the flags like he wasn't stupid like he
knew<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.329> pull<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.510> flag<00:03:46.720> when<00:03:46.900> you're<00:03:47.019> when

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
knew to pull a flag when you're when

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:48.839 
knew to pull a flag when you're when
four<00:03:47.410> people<00:03:47.590> were<00:03:47.680> down<00:03:47.799> or<00:03:47.889> whatever<00:03:48.099> so<00:03:48.340> at

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
four people were down or whatever so at

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.240 
four people were down or whatever so at
least<00:03:48.970> he<00:03:49.150> did<00:03:49.269> that<00:03:49.680> bar<00:03:50.680> I'm<00:03:50.889> right<00:03:51.069> here

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
least he did that bar I'm right here

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.699 
least he did that bar I'm right here
he's<00:03:51.639> afk<00:03:52.000> if<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:52.660> guys<00:03:52.810> noticed<00:03:53.200> my<00:03:53.290> classic

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
he's afk if you guys noticed my classic

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.559 
he's afk if you guys noticed my classic
mini<00:03:53.919> he's<00:03:54.160> been<00:03:54.340> afk<00:03:54.760> like<00:03:54.910> he's<00:03:55.060> not<00:03:55.209> moving

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
mini he's been afk like he's not moving

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.140 
mini he's been afk like he's not moving
and<00:03:56.160> so<00:03:57.160> that's<00:03:57.340> pretty<00:03:57.459> much<00:03:57.549> why<00:03:57.790> I<00:03:57.819> think

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
and so that's pretty much why I think

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.420 
and so that's pretty much why I think
this<00:03:58.989> is<00:03:59.109> the<00:03:59.230> good<00:03:59.410> side<00:03:59.590> on<00:03:59.650> slim<00:03:59.919> CTF<00:04:00.310> like

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
this is the good side on slim CTF like

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.740 
this is the good side on slim CTF like
this<00:04:00.609> is<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.730> side<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:01.000> want<00:04:01.150> to<00:04:01.209> push<00:04:01.359> up<00:04:01.389> get

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
this is a side you want to push up get

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.990 
this is a side you want to push up get
the<00:04:01.870> trap<00:04:02.169> and<00:04:02.440> get<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.310> easy<00:04:03.459> flag<00:04:03.760> caps

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
the trap and get the easy flag caps

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.430 
the trap and get the easy flag caps
obviously<00:04:04.450> on<00:04:04.569> this<00:04:04.690> side<00:04:04.840> is<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.019> good<00:04:05.200> side

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
obviously on this side is the good side

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.680 
obviously on this side is the good side
but<00:04:06.220> since<00:04:06.639> we<00:04:06.760> only<00:04:06.790> had<00:04:07.090> three<00:04:07.299> people<00:04:07.629> and

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
but since we only had three people and

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.300 
but since we only had three people and
they<00:04:07.780> had<00:04:07.930> four<00:04:08.199> we<00:04:08.319> couldn't<00:04:08.620> exactly<00:04:09.099> push

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
they had four we couldn't exactly push

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.920 
they had four we couldn't exactly push
up<00:04:09.519> like<00:04:09.639> we<00:04:09.760> wanted<00:04:09.940> to<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:10.359> right<00:04:10.480> here<00:04:10.720> you

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
up like we wanted to so right here you

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.270 
up like we wanted to so right here you
see<00:04:11.139> that<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.349> random<00:04:11.590> start<00:04:11.769> moving<00:04:12.069> and

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
see that the random start moving and

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.800

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
the map control and as soon as that

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.709

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
here like as soon as the random starts

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.920 
here like as soon as the random starts
playing<00:04:24.219> we<00:04:24.430> can<00:04:24.580> push<00:04:25.060> up<00:04:25.270> and<00:04:25.479> play<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.659> game

you know like how you need a plate I

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.480 
you know like how you need a plate I
guess<00:04:28.000> you<00:04:28.060> could<00:04:28.180> say<00:04:28.300> I<00:04:29.139> instantly<00:04:29.949> pull<00:04:30.310> off

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
guess you could say I instantly pull off

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.830 
guess you could say I instantly pull off
like<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:30.699> full<00:04:30.970> set<00:04:31.150> of<00:04:31.180> streaks<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:31.630> we<00:04:31.690> get<00:04:31.810> a

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
like a full set of streaks and we get a

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.890 
like a full set of streaks and we get a
fly<00:04:32.050> cap<00:04:32.320> so<00:04:33.479> unfortunately<00:04:34.479> the<00:04:34.660> random

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
fly cap so unfortunately the random

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.879 
fly cap so unfortunately the random
couldn't<00:04:35.110> be<00:04:35.169> playing<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:35.470> whole<00:04:35.590> game<00:04:35.620> if

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
couldn't be playing the whole game if

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:36.749 
couldn't be playing the whole game if
you're<00:04:36.009> playing<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.280> whole<00:04:36.400> game<00:04:36.430> I'm

you're playing the whole game I'm
thinking<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:37.180> could<00:04:37.270> have<00:04:37.330> dropped<00:04:37.570> four<00:04:37.810> to

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
thinking I could have dropped four to

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.909 
thinking I could have dropped four to
you<00:04:38.020> we<00:04:38.139> probably<00:04:38.350> would've<00:04:38.590> gotten<00:04:38.710> others

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300

lecture so so basically what I'm trying
to<00:05:08.740> write<00:05:08.860> here<00:05:09.009> is<00:05:09.099> just<00:05:09.250> stay<00:05:09.460> alive<00:05:09.580> as<00:05:09.910> long

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
to write here is just stay alive as long

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.610 
to write here is just stay alive as long
as<00:05:10.240> possible<00:05:10.449> because<00:05:10.960> I<00:05:11.139> can<00:05:11.259> see<00:05:11.410> that<00:05:11.530> my

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
as possible because I can see that my

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.659 
as possible because I can see that my
teammates<00:05:11.830> all<00:05:12.039> just<00:05:12.280> spawn<00:05:12.460> and<00:05:12.580> they're

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
teammates all just spawn and they're

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:13.860 
teammates all just spawn and they're
trying<00:05:12.849> to<00:05:12.880> push<00:05:13.030> up<00:05:13.180> towards<00:05:13.330> mid<00:05:13.599> to<00:05:13.750> get

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
trying to push up towards mid to get

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.689 
trying to push up towards mid to get
control<00:05:14.110> again<00:05:14.470> so<00:05:15.039> I'm<00:05:15.160> just<00:05:15.280> trying<00:05:15.460> to<00:05:15.490> stay

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
control again so I'm just trying to stay

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.310 
control again so I'm just trying to stay
alive<00:05:15.759> called<00:05:16.210> a<00:05:16.270> distraction<00:05:16.870> and<00:05:17.050> make<00:05:17.199> them

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
alive called a distraction and make them

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.779 
alive called a distraction and make them
all<00:05:17.440> focus<00:05:17.740> on<00:05:17.889> me<00:05:17.979> let<00:05:18.160> my<00:05:18.250> teammates<00:05:18.520> pick

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
all focus on me let my teammates pick

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.550 
all focus on me let my teammates pick
them<00:05:18.880> off<00:05:19.030> so<00:05:19.599> it's<00:05:19.720> pretty<00:05:19.840> much<00:05:20.080> exactly

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
them off so it's pretty much exactly

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.370 
them off so it's pretty much exactly
what<00:05:20.860> happens<00:05:21.479> my<00:05:22.479> teammates<00:05:22.810> get<00:05:22.960> like<00:05:23.349> a

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
what happens my teammates get like a

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.930 
what happens my teammates get like a
little<00:05:23.500> bit<00:05:23.680> of<00:05:23.710> that<00:05:23.800> control<00:05:24.070> back<00:05:24.280> and<00:05:24.550> now

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
little bit of that control back and now

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
third one gets me but that's two down

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.870 
third one gets me but that's two down
right<00:06:23.320> there<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:23.740> third<00:06:23.889> one<00:06:24.099> has<00:06:24.460> shots<00:06:24.729> in

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.370 
right there the third one has shots in
him<00:06:25.000> but<00:06:25.360> my<00:06:25.479> teammate<00:06:25.840> has<00:06:25.930> already<00:06:26.289> gone

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
him but my teammate has already gone

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.710 
him but my teammate has already gone
through<00:06:26.440> blue<00:06:27.009> out<00:06:27.639> to<00:06:28.000> cap<00:06:28.150> the<00:06:28.300> third<00:06:28.449> flight

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
through blue out to cap the third flight

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.960 
through blue out to cap the third flight
so<00:06:28.840> ideas<00:06:29.139> just<00:06:29.349> a<00:06:29.800> perfect<00:06:30.370> example<00:06:30.400> of<00:06:30.789> like

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
so ideas just a perfect example of like

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.330 
so ideas just a perfect example of like
rotations<00:06:31.570> and<00:06:31.810> spawn<00:06:32.110> knowledge<00:06:32.500> of<00:06:32.620> CTF<00:06:33.070> and

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
rotations and spawn knowledge of CTF and

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.519 
rotations and spawn knowledge of CTF and
that's<00:06:34.330> why<00:06:34.450> I<00:06:34.479> believe<00:06:34.659> that<00:06:34.779> CTF<00:06:35.260> is<00:06:35.380> like<00:06:35.500> a

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:35.529 
that's why I believe that CTF is like a

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:36.690 
that's why I believe that CTF is like a
more<00:06:35.770> competitive<00:06:36.039> game<00:06:36.310> oh<00:06:36.430> because<00:06:36.550> it

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
more competitive game oh because it

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.040 
more competitive game oh because it
takes<00:06:36.880> so<00:06:37.360> much<00:06:37.479> more<00:06:37.659> than<00:06:37.779> just<00:06:37.810> like

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
takes so much more than just like

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.839 
takes so much more than just like
reactions<00:06:38.500> and<00:06:38.650> gun<00:06:38.740> skill<00:06:38.950> and<00:06:39.070> stuff

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:39.849 
reactions and gun skill and stuff

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:41.339 
reactions and gun skill and stuff
have<00:06:39.969> been<00:06:40.119> like<00:06:40.509> know<00:06:40.689> how<00:06:40.869> to<00:06:40.929> play<00:06:41.080> the<00:06:41.199> game

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:41.349 
have been like know how to play the game

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:42.839
