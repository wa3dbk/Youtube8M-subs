and therefore giving clear climbs giving

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:01.280 
and therefore giving clear climbs giving

point-to-point routes and therefore

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.100 
point-to-point routes and therefore
reducing<00:01:03.089> fuel<00:01:03.330> burn<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.720> reducing

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
reducing fuel burn and reducing

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.600 
reducing fuel burn and reducing
emissions

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.280 

we<00:01:08.610> introduced<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.240> taxi<00:01:09.600> monitoring<00:01:10.050> tool

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
we introduced a taxi monitoring tool

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.440 
we introduced a taxi monitoring tool
which<00:01:10.800> we<00:01:10.950> put<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.280> all<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.700> our<00:01:11.820> airports<00:01:12.270> that

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
which we put in all of our airports that

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.820 
which we put in all of our airports that
gives<00:01:12.660> that<00:01:12.750> air<00:01:13.170> traffic<00:01:13.380> controllers

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
gives that air traffic controllers

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.650 
gives that air traffic controllers
information<00:01:14.280> about<00:01:14.490> how<00:01:14.850> long<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.270> taking

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
information about how long it's taking

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.600 
information about how long it's taking
the<00:01:15.780> aircraft<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.350> get<00:01:16.440> on<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> stand<00:01:16.980> to<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the aircraft to get on the stand to the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.980 
the aircraft to get on the stand to the
runway<00:01:17.910> and<00:01:18.090> back<00:01:18.540> again

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
runway and back again

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.990 
runway and back again
by<00:01:19.380> monitoring<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.010> we<00:01:20.190> can<00:01:20.340> set<00:01:20.550> targets

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
by monitoring that we can set targets

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.090 
by monitoring that we can set targets
and<00:01:21.480> reduce<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.900> impact<00:01:24.740> increasingly<00:01:25.740> noise

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
and reduce the impact increasingly noise

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.250 
and reduce the impact increasingly noise
is<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> huge<00:01:26.880> issue<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.390> airports<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.110> for

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
is a huge issue for airports and for

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.750 
is a huge issue for airports and for
Airlines<00:01:28.620> that's<00:01:28.890> why<00:01:29.010> we<00:01:29.100> work<00:01:29.280> very<00:01:29.310> closely

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
Airlines that's why we work very closely

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.790 
Airlines that's why we work very closely
with<00:01:30.030> our<00:01:30.180> Airport<00:01:30.600> customers<00:01:31.050> to<00:01:31.500> try<00:01:31.710> and

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
with our Airport customers to try and

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.320 
with our Airport customers to try and
manage<00:01:31.980> that<00:01:32.280> noise<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.760> most<00:01:32.910> efficient

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
manage that noise in the most efficient

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.850 
manage that noise in the most efficient
way<00:01:39.020> improving<00:01:40.020> environmental<00:01:40.470> performance

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
way improving environmental performance

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.440 
way improving environmental performance
needs<00:01:41.070> investment<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:41.850> actually<00:01:42.240> for<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
needs investment but actually for the

needs investment but actually for the
airlines<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.380> investment<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.220> worth<00:01:44.460> it

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
airlines the investment is so worth it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.090 
airlines the investment is so worth it
from<00:01:45.210> most<00:01:45.510> airlines<00:01:45.720> 40%<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.680> cost<00:01:46.890> is

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
from most airlines 40% of the cost is

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.830 
from most airlines 40% of the cost is
fueled<00:01:47.460> if<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:47.880> reduce<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.180> fuel<00:01:48.630> as

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
fueled if we can reduce that fuel as

fueled if we can reduce that fuel as
we're<00:01:49.020> targeting<00:01:49.440> by<00:01:49.560> 10%<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.430> means

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
we're targeting by 10% and that means

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.520 
we're targeting by 10% and that means
economic<00:01:51.060> sustainability<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.380> means

economic sustainability and it means

economic sustainability and it means
environmental<00:01:53.190> sustainability<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:53.940> the
