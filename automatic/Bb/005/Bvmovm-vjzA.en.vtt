00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.570 

well<00:00:00.480> I'm<00:00:00.780> really<00:00:01.020> stumped<00:00:01.620> what<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.220> do<00:00:02.340> here

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
well I'm really stumped what to do here

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.720 
well I'm really stumped what to do here
now<00:00:02.610> we<00:00:03.240> have<00:00:03.419> our<00:00:03.629> Volkswagen<00:00:04.730> Volkswagen

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
now we have our Volkswagen Volkswagen

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.610 
now we have our Volkswagen Volkswagen
diesel<00:00:05.970> 1600<00:00:06.779> separated<00:00:07.350> from<00:00:07.470> the

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
diesel 1600 separated from the

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.209 
diesel 1600 separated from the
transmission<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.809> volkswagen<00:00:10.620> starter

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
transmission and the volkswagen starter

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.230 
transmission and the volkswagen starter
right<00:00:11.370> here's<00:00:11.670> starter<00:00:12.300> rotates<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:13.200> way

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
right here's starter rotates that way

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.000 
right here's starter rotates that way
plugs<00:00:15.240> in<00:00:15.480> right<00:00:15.509> here<00:00:16.020> which<00:00:16.230> turns<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
plugs in right here which turns the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.519 
plugs in right here which turns the
flywheel<00:00:17.480> this<00:00:18.480> way<00:00:19.369> down<00:00:20.449> and<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:22.230> that's<00:00:22.410> a

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
flywheel this way down and so that's a

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.980 
flywheel this way down and so that's a
counterclockwise<00:00:23.010> rotation<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.810> is

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
counterclockwise rotation and this is

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.679 
counterclockwise rotation and this is
our<00:00:25.140> Bobcat<00:00:25.980> lower<00:00:26.930> which<00:00:29.269> is<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.330> clockwise

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
our Bobcat lower which is a clockwise

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.209 
our Bobcat lower which is a clockwise
rotation<00:00:32.660> it's<00:00:33.660> time<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.620> blow<00:00:34.800> air<00:00:34.980> through

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
rotation it's time to blow air through

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.280 
rotation it's time to blow air through
the<00:00:35.280> radiator<00:00:35.309> suck<00:00:36.059> air<00:00:36.239> past<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> hydraulic

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
the radiator suck air past the hydraulic

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.790 
the radiator suck air past the hydraulic
pumps<00:00:38.270> so<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.600> think<00:00:40.050> we're<00:00:40.200> gonna<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.379> putting

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
pumps so I think we're gonna be putting

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.860 
pumps so I think we're gonna be putting
the<00:00:40.980> old<00:00:41.070> 10<00:00:41.520> horsepower<00:00:42.090> diesel<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.660> this

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
the old 10 horsepower diesel in this

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.380 
the old 10 horsepower diesel in this
Bobcat<00:00:44.960> it<00:00:45.960> was<00:00:46.079> originally<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> 35<00:00:47.430> horsepower

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
Bobcat it was originally a 35 horsepower

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.150 
Bobcat it was originally a 35 horsepower
Bobcat<00:00:51.350> it<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> gas<00:00:52.890> motor<00:00:54.710> essentially<00:00:55.710> my

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
Bobcat it was a gas motor essentially my

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.250 
Bobcat it was a gas motor essentially my
10<00:00:56.789> horsepower<00:00:57.090> diesel<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.609> equivalent<00:00:59.609> to<00:01:00.260> 15

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
10 horsepower diesel is equivalent to 15

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.179 
10 horsepower diesel is equivalent to 15
horsepower<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.579> gas<00:01:02.940> motor<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.799> I'm<00:01:04.799> gonna<00:01:04.949> be

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
horsepower of gas motor so I'm gonna be

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.490 
horsepower of gas motor so I'm gonna be
like<00:01:05.400> half<00:01:05.760> power<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.390> figure<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.020> gear<00:01:07.380> it

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
like half power I figure if I gear it

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.550 
like half power I figure if I gear it
down<00:01:07.770> real<00:01:08.250> low<00:01:08.990> should<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.080> able<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
down real low should be able to do the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.539 
down real low should be able to do the
same<00:01:10.799> work<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.460> twice<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.330> time<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:13.549> don't

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
same work and twice the time I don't

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.070 
same work and twice the time I don't
know<00:01:14.670> anybody<00:01:15.570> got<00:01:15.720> any<00:01:15.900> thoughts<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.350> that

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
know anybody got any thoughts on that

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.289 
know anybody got any thoughts on that
it's<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.979> kind<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.369> waste<00:01:20.610> sitting<00:01:21.119> here

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
it's it's kind of a waste sitting here

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.520 
it's it's kind of a waste sitting here
like<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.750> either<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.140> or<00:01:22.200> we'll<00:01:22.409> get

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
like this either that or we'll get

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.350 
like this either that or we'll get
another<00:01:22.830> Ford<00:01:23.689> clockwise<00:01:24.689> rotation<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:26.360> don't

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
another Ford clockwise rotation I don't

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.149 
another Ford clockwise rotation I don't
know<00:01:27.450> some<00:01:27.930> stupid<00:01:28.350> gas<00:01:28.560> motor<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.009> don't

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
know some stupid gas motor I don't

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.910 
know some stupid gas motor I don't
really<00:01:29.310> want<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.490> put<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> gas<00:01:29.909> motor<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.920> just

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
really want to put a gas motor in I just

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.770 
really want to put a gas motor in I just
took<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.310> old<00:01:34.250> Voyager<00:01:35.250> motor<00:01:35.460> apart<00:01:36.030> just

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
took the old Voyager motor apart just

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.770 
took the old Voyager motor apart just
for<00:01:37.079> scrap<00:01:37.530> aluminum<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.570> don't<00:01:39.570> know<00:01:39.630> what

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
for scrap aluminum I don't know what

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.440 
for scrap aluminum I don't know what
rotation<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.409> was<00:01:40.560> don't<00:01:40.890> really<00:01:41.040> care

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
rotation it was don't really care

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.080 
rotation it was don't really care
there's<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.509> good<00:01:42.630> runner<00:01:42.840> by<00:01:43.970> too<00:01:44.970> much

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
there's a good runner by too much

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.679 
there's a good runner by too much
computers<00:01:45.689> for<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:48.380> Bobcats<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.790> we<00:01:51.509> could

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
computers for the Bobcats so we could

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.580 
computers for the Bobcats so we could
actually<00:01:51.840> put<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.380> backwards<00:01:54.350> bolt<00:01:55.350> up

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
actually put it in backwards bolt up

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.709 
actually put it in backwards bolt up
some<00:01:55.829> sort<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.130> fly<00:01:56.399> mail<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.180> end<00:01:59.719> that's

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
some sort of fly mail to this end that's

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.800 
some sort of fly mail to this end that's
a<00:02:00.840> little<00:02:00.990> tricky<00:02:01.409> though<00:02:01.579> yeah<00:02:02.579> that's<00:02:02.880> not

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
a little tricky though yeah that's not

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.640 
a little tricky though yeah that's not
really<00:02:03.990> what<00:02:04.229> we<00:02:04.350> want<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.560> do

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
really what we want to do

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.180 
really what we want to do
less<00:02:07.400> than<00:02:07.730> ideal
