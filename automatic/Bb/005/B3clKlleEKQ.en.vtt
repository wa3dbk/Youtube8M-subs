00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:11.809
 at the time it was not just shadows to 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:13.760
 you lie to have faith for you buy 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.640
 hey it is there is a little less crowded 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.520
 the 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.520
 of this new who have sun tubes 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.880
 so who actually replaces the x 35 in 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.130
 does he actually he takes back the old sound 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.949
 name that of 2004 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.750
 because in fact the second generation 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:40.380
 it's then renamed xe 35 is so there 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.720
 we go back to the appellation of origin 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.420
 so that followed there bestseller of the 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.720
 brand it still represents more than 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.560
 30% of sales in France 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.150
 obviously we find it hours of 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.290
 santa fe family who for once and 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.510
 the group and follow and that is 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.170
 who above you have pretensions 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.050
 premium because in fact the brand 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.470
 to a desire to go upmarket 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.909
 this is already manifested by the style one to 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.140
 peter schreyer who is at the origin 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.880
 but there is German competition 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.880
 he had he made particular the summer dictates 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:24.460
 we will see them inside voice isolate 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.810
 a bit of noise but if a beige leather 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.590
 who is getting married actually very very well that 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.880
 the black I you know anyway 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.470
 much more class than pure northern years 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.250
 then after obviously there will be full 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.640
 technological equipment 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.230
 line crossing alert 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.900
 emergency braking etc 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.270
 in yet and connectivity there there is 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.630
 two of a cigarette lighter socket 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.030
 auxiliary and a usb socket 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:57.400
 we will see bluetooth and so on 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.990
 the whole party that still has some 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:05.080
 remains of high-end low-end 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:08.959
 we go the keys that are hard enough 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.910
 but well if it's still when 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.950
 even in great progress will say 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.110
 I invested that hyundai progress on on 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.920
 all points 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.459
 except maybe time to say the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.440
 motorizations since it remains in fact 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.150
 identical on which we find the 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.480
 same author so there are three particular 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.530
 115 136 diesel and 184 horsepower it 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.890
 does not evolve 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.870
 systech are there now if it's 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.700
 that now the standard euro 6 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.709
 therefore a lowering one makes 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.300
 emissions of co2 but also of engines 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.200
 gasoline 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.860
 so they have not been prices yet 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.860
 communicated a little early
