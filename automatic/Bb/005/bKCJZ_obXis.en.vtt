00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
going to start to stretch a little bit

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.950 
going to start to stretch a little bit
which<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.710> good<00:00:46.920> or<00:00:47.340> bad<00:00:47.370> depending<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.239> how

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
which is good or bad depending on how

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.330 
which is good or bad depending on how
many<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.379> want<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.649> have<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:49.920> there<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.129> if

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
many you want to have in there but if

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.889 
many you want to have in there but if

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
you put way too many I could see that

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.270 
you put way too many I could see that
being<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.260> problem<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.739> probably<00:00:52.949> wouldn't

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
being a problem so I probably wouldn't

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.220 
being a problem so I probably wouldn't
push<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.610> too<00:00:53.820> much<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.660> fit<00:00:54.960> quite<00:00:55.140> a

push it too much but you can fit quite a

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.840 
push it too much but you can fit quite a
few<00:00:55.440> credit<00:00:55.770> cards<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.160> there<00:00:56.370> you've<00:00:56.820> got
