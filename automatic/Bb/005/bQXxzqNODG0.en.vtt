00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.800
 effect the next multiplication of 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:19.160
 binary numbers let's multiply the 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:21.220
 binary number 11011 by 101 before 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.750
 develop this indicated product 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.550
 remember the tables for the 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.590
 multiplication and the sum of numbers 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.500
 binaries we're going to apply these two 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.950
 tables to the proposed exercise 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.059
 we started ordinary as we have 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.730
 known in the numbering system 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.360
 decimal only that the multiplication of 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.510
 binary numbers is much simpler 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:50.809
 let's see one by one is 1 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:52.570
 one by one is 1 1 by 0 0 1 by 1 is 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.020
 one 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:10.190
 one by one and one 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:12.830
 0 per 100 per 100 per 000 per 100 per 10 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:19.850
 now we go with the next number 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:23.260
 binary is to say one by one is 1 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.170
 one by one is one 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.810
 one for zero is zero 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.860
 one by one is one 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.940
 one by one is 1 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.900
 we go down 1 and here we are going to have in 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.000
 count the table of the sum of binaries 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.670
 since always in the multiplication of 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.020
 binary numbers will be implied the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.240
 sum of binaries 10 we apply the 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.520
 combination 3 for the sum table 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:00.460
 of binaries and gives us 1 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:09.090
 0 0 0 0 1 1 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:14.569
 10 is 1 and 11 is zero and we carry 1 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.569
 one plus one is zero 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:30.209
 and we carry the 1 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:37.130
 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 and 1 plus 1 1 is zero and 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:41.150
 we carry the 11 plus one is zero 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:44.460
 and we carry the 11 as it does not have with 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.190
 who operation ar we download it 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.350
 now the result of the 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.470
 multiplication of the two numbers 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.520
 binary dice is the binary number 1 0 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.220
 0 0 0 1 1 1 what we are going to do to 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.600
 Check if the product is really 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.660
 correct done is to convert every 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.880
 factor of the exercises given or of the 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.230
 numbers given in the system 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:17.280
 decimal numbering and then at the end 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:21.690
 we transform the result we got 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.150
 what is the binary number 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.160
 we also take it to the system of 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.160
 decimal numbering and what both results 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.360
 they must match they must be the same 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.819
 we started then with the first factor 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:39.660
 which is 1 1 0 1 1 then we have to 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:42.950
 multiply each binary number by its 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.350
 respective position in base 2 well 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:50.470
 the 1 by 2 raised 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.410
 at 4 is 16 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.319
 plus 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:59.680
 1 x 2 raised to 3 s 8 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:02.680
 more we discard the zero because it is not 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.879
 significant at the time of adding we passed 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:13.750
 to the next digit 1 by 2 raised to the 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:15.340
 1 is 2 plus 1 by 2 raised to 0 which is 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:22.490
 one 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:25.669
 and 16 plus 8 21 and 27 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.770
 now we are going to proceed the same with the 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:34.030
 factor 101 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:37.289
 we start with the first 1 1 by 2 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.289
 elevated to 24 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:43.449
 more we discard the 0 and we pass to 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:45.699
 next 1 1 by 2 raised to 0 is 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:49.130
 one 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:52.880
 415 this means then that 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.889
 we must multiply 27 by 5 to know 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.389
 in the decimal numbering system to 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.389
 what is this product equivalent 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:09.689
 27 times 5 7 times 5 is 35 53 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:13.229
 2 x 5 is 10 13 13 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:17.639
 27 out of 5 out of 135 this means 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:22.669
 so that 135 is the result that we 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:28.219
 must give when converting the binary number 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:28.219
 10000 111 let's check it 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:39.460
 we started then with the first 1 1 by 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.460
 2 raised at 7 is 128 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:48.350
 more we discard the four zeros and 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.650
 we went to the next 11 by 12 raised to 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.689
 the 24 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.529
 plus 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:58.330
 1 x 2 raised to 1 is 2 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:02.840
 plus 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:11.000
 1 x 2 raised to 0 is a 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:13.760
 128 4 2 plus 1 gives us 135 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.340
 which gives us exactly the same 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.730
 result that we got when 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:22.850
 we multiply 27 by 5 in the system 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.410
 decimal numbering therefore the product 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.510
 is done in a correct way 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.710
 well I hope that the explanation of this 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.170
 exercise has been of great benefit 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.520
 for all of you until another next 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.520
 goodbye tutorial
