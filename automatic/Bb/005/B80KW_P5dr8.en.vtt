make<00:02:12.690> little<00:02:13.049> smaller<00:02:13.349> pancakes<00:02:14.750> this<00:02:15.750> is

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
make little smaller pancakes this is

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.360 
make little smaller pancakes this is
something<00:02:16.079> that<00:02:16.319> i<00:02:16.379> usually<00:02:16.680> make<00:02:16.920> for<00:02:17.250> my

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
something that i usually make for my

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.740 
something that i usually make for my
children<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:19.250> they<00:02:20.250> like<00:02:20.579> it<00:02:20.850> we<00:02:21.269> needs<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.600> bit

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
children and they like it we needs a bit

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.289 
children and they like it we needs a bit
smaller<00:02:22.319> in<00:02:22.440> size<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:23.280> just<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.730> free-form

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
smaller in size so just a free-form

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.800 
smaller in size so just a free-form
nothing<00:02:24.810> fancy<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:26.730> looks<00:02:27.000> more<00:02:27.090> natural<00:02:27.389> I

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
nothing fancy it looks more natural I

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.340 
nothing fancy it looks more natural I
can<00:02:28.590> drop<00:02:28.739> about<00:02:29.040> three<00:02:29.840> pancakes<00:02:30.840> into<00:02:31.200> the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
can drop about three pancakes into the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.520 
can drop about three pancakes into the
pen

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
pen

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.979 
pen
let's<00:02:34.530> see<00:02:34.680> that's<00:02:34.830> bubbling<00:02:35.190> away<00:02:35.459> nicely

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
let's see that's bubbling away nicely

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:44.350 
let's see that's bubbling away nicely
just<00:02:36.989> give<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.410> flip<00:02:37.650> over
