here's step one is to measure the clamp
so<00:02:41.120> measure<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.450> thickness<00:02:41.660> of<00:02:41.989> your<00:02:42.079> table

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
so measure the thickness of your table

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.300 
so measure the thickness of your table
or<00:02:43.099> desk<00:02:43.370> or<00:02:43.790> whatever<00:02:44.060> you're<00:02:44.209> using<00:02:44.239> and

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
or desk or whatever you're using and

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.880 
or desk or whatever you're using and
choose<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.430> appropriate<00:02:47.140> size<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.560> make

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
choose the appropriate size and make

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.410 
choose the appropriate size and make
sure<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.130> tighten<00:02:49.370> these<00:02:49.519> bolts<00:02:49.760> really<00:02:50.209> tight

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
sure to tighten these bolts really tight

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.710 
sure to tighten these bolts really tight
since<00:02:51.019> it's<00:02:51.230> gonna<00:02:51.319> be<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:53.030> stem<00:02:53.360> to

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
since it's gonna be the the the stem to

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.199 
since it's gonna be the the the stem to
your<00:02:53.870> computer<00:02:54.319> so<00:02:54.980> just<00:02:55.280> bolt<00:02:55.849> a<00:02:55.970> mountain

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
your computer so just bolt a mountain

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.059 
your computer so just bolt a mountain
really<00:02:56.390> tight<00:02:56.720> make<00:02:57.530> sure<00:02:57.709> they're<00:02:57.859> really

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
really tight make sure they're really

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.870 
really tight make sure they're really
tight<00:02:58.540> alright<00:02:59.680> here<00:03:00.680> we<00:03:00.709> have<00:03:00.920> step<00:03:01.310> two<00:03:01.549> and

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
tight alright here we have step two and

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.720 
tight alright here we have step two and
it<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.569> to<00:03:03.079> pretty<00:03:03.709> much<00:03:03.829> position<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:04.459> on<00:03:04.549> your

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
it is to pretty much position it on your

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.210 
it is to pretty much position it on your
whichever<00:03:05.389> here<00:03:06.079> I'm<00:03:06.170> using<00:03:06.319> this<00:03:06.769> table<00:03:06.950> so

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
whichever here I'm using this table so

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.870 
whichever here I'm using this table so
you<00:03:07.250> can<00:03:07.370> see<00:03:07.579> it<00:03:07.639> better

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
you can see it better

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.780 
you can see it better
but<00:03:08.980> whenever<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.130> put<00:03:10.280> it<00:03:10.340> on<00:03:10.430> just<00:03:10.459> make

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
but whenever you put it on just make

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.039 
but whenever you put it on just make
sure<00:03:10.940> it's<00:03:11.090> there<00:03:11.650> make<00:03:12.650> sure<00:03:12.680> it's<00:03:12.889> tight<00:03:13.130> and

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
sure it's there make sure it's tight and

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.720 
sure it's there make sure it's tight and
hold<00:03:15.049> it<00:03:15.230> in<00:03:15.350> place<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:15.950> start<00:03:16.190> clamping<00:03:16.489> the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
hold it in place and start clamping the

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.550 
hold it in place and start clamping the
bottom<00:03:17.000> down<00:03:18.340> here<00:03:19.340> we<00:03:19.430> go<00:03:19.549> down<00:03:20.060> here<00:03:20.299> and

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
bottom down here we go down here and

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.490 
bottom down here we go down here and
yeah<00:03:21.560> just<00:03:21.829> tie<00:03:22.220> them<00:03:22.430> both<00:03:22.880> on<00:03:23.690> an<00:03:23.900> equal

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
yeah just tie them both on an equal

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.160 
yeah just tie them both on an equal
amount<00:03:25.060> make<00:03:26.060> sure<00:03:26.239> they<00:03:26.450> don't<00:03:26.569> one<00:03:26.989> of<00:03:27.079> them

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
amount make sure they don't one of them

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.599 
amount make sure they don't one of them
is<00:03:27.260> not<00:03:27.380> tighter<00:03:27.709> than<00:03:27.829> the<00:03:27.950> other<00:03:27.980> obviously

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
is not tighter than the other obviously

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.400 
is not tighter than the other obviously
if<00:03:29.329> you<00:03:29.480> want<00:03:29.720> if<00:03:29.900> you<00:03:29.989> don't<00:03:30.079> want<00:03:30.170> to<00:03:30.319> damage

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
if you want if you don't want to damage

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.530 
if you want if you don't want to damage
your<00:03:30.680> table<00:03:31.010> by<00:03:31.250> pressing<00:03:31.609> it<00:03:32.060> too<00:03:32.150> much<00:03:32.269> I

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
your table by pressing it too much I

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.270 
your table by pressing it too much I
recommend<00:03:33.170> putting<00:03:33.349> a<00:03:33.560> book<00:03:33.769> in<00:03:33.950> between

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
recommend putting a book in between

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.490 
recommend putting a book in between
that's<00:03:34.459> what<00:03:34.609> I<00:03:34.639> did<00:03:34.880> might<00:03:35.780> not<00:03:35.900> work<00:03:36.049> my<00:03:36.319> work

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
that's what I did might not work my work

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.930 
that's what I did might not work my work
for<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.769> I<00:03:36.799> don't<00:03:37.040> know<00:03:39.340> alright<00:03:40.340> guys<00:03:40.579> the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
for you I don't know alright guys the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.490 
for you I don't know alright guys the
next<00:03:41.060> step<00:03:41.329> is<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.630> get<00:03:41.780> your<00:03:41.900> washer<00:03:42.349> and

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
next step is to get your washer and

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.270 
next step is to get your washer and
screw<00:03:43.130> a<00:03:43.609> Philips<00:03:44.329> screwdriver<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:45.280> attach

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
screw a Philips screwdriver and attach

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.069 
screw a Philips screwdriver and attach
the<00:03:46.880> arms<00:03:47.269> to<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:48.410> actual<00:03:49.099> monitors<00:03:49.669> I

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
the arms to the actual monitors I

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.870 
the arms to the actual monitors I
believe<00:03:51.079> these<00:03:51.349> arms<00:03:52.160> are<00:03:52.280> compatible<00:03:52.609> with

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
believe these arms are compatible with

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.440 
believe these arms are compatible with
the<00:03:53.269> ves<00:03:54.109> a<00:03:54.489> pattern<00:03:55.489> which<00:03:55.700> is<00:03:55.730> I<00:03:56.180> don't<00:03:56.359> know

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
the ves a pattern which is I don't know

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.629 
the ves a pattern which is I don't know
I<00:03:56.480> think<00:03:56.569> most<00:03:57.079> monitors<00:03:57.349> have<00:03:57.739> them<00:03:57.859> so

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
I think most monitors have them so

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.569 
I think most monitors have them so
you're<00:03:59.060> good<00:03:59.299> pretty<00:03:59.599> much<00:04:00.070> these<00:04:01.070> are<00:04:01.220> two

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
you're good pretty much these are two

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.550 
you're good pretty much these are two
Dell<00:04:02.120> monitors<00:04:02.840> which<00:04:03.139> are<00:04:03.229> pretty<00:04:03.410> good

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
Dell monitors which are pretty good

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.260 
Dell monitors which are pretty good

have the curve to back monitors like I

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.900 
have the curve to back monitors like I
believe<00:04:20.900> some<00:04:21.080> songs<00:04:21.350> Samsung's<00:04:22.160> have<00:04:22.790> them

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
position this thing and alright guys so

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.430 
position this thing and alright guys so
the<00:04:45.590> next<00:04:45.860> step<00:04:46.070> is<00:04:46.340> to<00:04:46.670> position<00:04:47.000> the

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
the next step is to position the

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.800 
the next step is to position the
monitors<00:04:48.440> in<00:04:49.070> front<00:04:49.400> of<00:04:49.520> this<00:04:49.880> temple<00:04:50.390> or

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
monitors in front of this temple or

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.080 
monitors in front of this temple or
whatever<00:04:51.050> you<00:04:51.140> want<00:04:51.260> to<00:04:51.320> call<00:04:51.470> it<00:04:51.910> make<00:04:52.910> sure

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
whatever you want to call it make sure

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.640 
whatever you want to call it make sure
you<00:04:53.240> adjust<00:04:53.390> the<00:04:53.810> tilt<00:04:54.020> angle<00:04:54.260> of<00:04:54.560> the

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
you adjust the tilt angle of the

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.200 
you adjust the tilt angle of the
monitors<00:04:54.980> first<00:04:55.280> so<00:04:55.430> they<00:04:55.520> don't<00:04:55.700> flop<00:04:55.970> on<00:04:56.090> you

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
monitors first so they don't flop on you

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.500 
monitors first so they don't flop on you
like<00:04:56.360> this<00:04:56.480> but<00:04:57.440> yeah<00:04:57.620> and<00:04:58.370> just<00:04:58.760> carefully

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
like this but yeah and just carefully

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.070 
like this but yeah and just carefully
pick<00:04:59.960> it<00:05:00.050> up<00:05:00.170> put<00:05:00.620> it<00:05:00.650> on<00:05:00.770> top<00:05:00.950> of<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.220> pole<00:05:01.430> and

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
pick it up put it on top of the pole and

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.570 
pick it up put it on top of the pole and
adjust<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.470> height<00:05:03.500> at<00:05:03.950> which<00:05:03.980> you<00:05:04.190> want<00:05:04.310> the

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
adjust the height at which you want the

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.970 
adjust the height at which you want the
monitors<00:05:05.170> this<00:05:06.170> is<00:05:06.320> a<00:05:06.350> personal<00:05:06.740> preference
