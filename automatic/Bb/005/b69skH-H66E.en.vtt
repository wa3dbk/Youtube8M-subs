00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
let's see yeah what else can I say I

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.949 
let's see yeah what else can I say I
think<00:02:30.480> that's<00:02:30.780> about<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.319> one<00:02:31.620> thing<00:02:31.799> I<00:02:31.920> did<00:02:32.280> do

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
think that's about it one thing I did do

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.860 
think that's about it one thing I did do
that<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:34.379> have<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.859> learn<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.219> do<00:02:35.450> not<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.719> do

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
that I have to learn to do not to do

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.640 
that I have to learn to do not to do
next<00:02:37.170> time<00:02:37.500> i<00:02:38.450> bleached<00:02:39.450> labs<00:02:40.109> and<00:02:40.790> then<00:02:41.790> I

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
next time i bleached labs and then I

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.800 
next time i bleached labs and then I
dyed<00:02:43.650> my<00:02:43.680> hair<00:02:43.920> red<00:02:44.129> but<00:02:44.879> I<00:02:44.909> think<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.329> dye<00:02:45.510> got

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
dyed my hair red but I think the dye got

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.119 
dyed my hair red but I think the dye got
on<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.650> caps<00:02:46.980> or<00:02:47.669> whatnot<00:02:48.180> so<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:49.560> cap<00:02:49.859> is

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
on the caps or whatnot so the cap is

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.369 
on the caps or whatnot so the cap is
like<00:02:50.310> really<00:02:50.790> messed<00:02:51.060> up<00:02:51.359> like<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.900> coloring

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
like really messed up like the coloring

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.780 
like really messed up like the coloring
is<00:02:52.889> kind<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.340> off<00:02:53.549> so<00:02:55.310> that's<00:02:56.310> why<00:02:56.519> I'm<00:02:56.609> wearing

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
is kind of off so that's why I'm wearing

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.000 
is kind of off so that's why I'm wearing
like<00:02:56.939> a<00:02:57.060> headband<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.659> push<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.989> back<00:02:58.169> so<00:02:58.200> it

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
like a headband to push it back so it

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.830 
like a headband to push it back so it
doesn't<00:02:59.069> look<00:02:59.519> that<00:02:59.579> bad<00:02:59.819> so<00:03:00.629> I've<00:03:00.750> been

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
changed sorta I would say from when I

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:55.789

as<00:03:59.099> before<00:03:59.699> because<00:03:59.879> that's<00:04:00.689> partially<00:04:00.989> my

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
as before because that's partially my

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.879 
as before because that's partially my
fault<00:04:01.409> for<00:04:01.889> I<00:04:02.549> really<00:04:03.329> layered<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:04.379> thing<00:04:04.680> up

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
fault for I really layered this thing up

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.929 
fault for I really layered this thing up
and<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.430> mean<00:04:05.699> I<00:04:06.079> did<00:04:07.079> I<00:04:07.109> did<00:04:07.379> a<00:04:07.409> lot<00:04:07.650> so<00:04:07.979> for<00:04:08.819> it

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
and I mean I did I did a lot so for it

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.860 
and I mean I did I did a lot so for it
to<00:04:09.000> be<00:04:09.269> still<00:04:09.569> holding<00:04:09.930> up<00:04:10.019> sorta<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:11.780> feel<00:04:12.780> like

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
to be still holding up sorta I feel like

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.530 
to be still holding up sorta I feel like
it's<00:04:13.079> okay<00:04:13.379> but<00:04:13.650> I<00:04:13.799> don't<00:04:14.220> think<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.430> buy<00:04:14.729> this

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
it's okay but I don't think I buy this

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.569 
it's okay but I don't think I buy this
one<00:04:15.840> again<00:04:16.139> or<00:04:16.320> probably<00:04:16.709> if<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:16.889> do<00:04:16.949> I<00:04:17.190> don't

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
one again or probably if I do I don't

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.149 
one again or probably if I do I don't
think<00:04:17.759> I<00:04:17.880> would<00:04:18.090> process<00:04:18.750> it<00:04:19.199> so<00:04:19.470> much<00:04:19.739> like

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.159 
think I would process it so much like

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:23.959 
think I would process it so much like
how<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.340> did<00:04:21.049> right<00:04:22.049> now<00:04:22.079> I<00:04:22.229> have<00:04:22.440> like<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.969> blonde
