ball because as I come into contact
these<00:02:04.079> open<00:02:04.439> strings<00:02:04.770> are<00:02:04.890> gonna<00:02:05.009> flex<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.490> bit

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
these open strings are gonna flex a bit

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.249 
these open strings are gonna flex a bit
more<00:02:05.850> as<00:02:06.479> long<00:02:06.630> as<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.810> don't<00:02:06.869> set<00:02:07.079> them<00:02:07.140> to

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
more as long as I don't set them to

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.900 
more as long as I don't set them to
super<00:02:07.619> high<00:02:07.740> tension<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.369> that's<00:02:08.640> going<00:02:08.849> to

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
super high tension and that's going to

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.089 
super high tension and that's going to
take<00:02:09.090> some<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> shock<00:02:09.450> out<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.959> there<00:02:10.110> so

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
take some of the shock out of there so

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.640 
take some of the shock out of there so
really<00:02:11.489> cool<00:02:11.700> racket<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.209> that

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
really cool racket for that

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.979 
really cool racket for that
now<00:02:13.519> the<00:02:13.580> standard<00:02:14.000> set<00:02:14.209> up<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.510> racket<00:02:14.870> is

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
now the standard set up the racket is

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.509 
now the standard set up the racket is
six<00:02:15.290> points<00:02:15.620> headlight<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:15.980> means<00:02:16.340> if<00:02:16.430> you

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
six points headlight that means if you

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.039 
six points headlight that means if you
take<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.940> twenty<00:02:17.209> seven<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.569> half<00:02:17.690> inches

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
take the twenty seven and a half inches

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.440 
take the twenty seven and a half inches
which<00:02:18.349> means<00:02:18.580> thirteen<00:02:19.580> point<00:02:19.940> seven<00:02:20.150> five

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
which means thirteen point seven five

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.940 
which means thirteen point seven five
inches<00:02:20.840> here<00:02:21.019> if<00:02:21.170> we<00:02:21.260> kind<00:02:21.349> of<00:02:21.470> measured<00:02:21.739> right

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
inches here if we kind of measured right

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.820 
inches here if we kind of measured right
to<00:02:22.129> the<00:02:22.220> middle<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.549> the<00:02:22.610> racket<00:02:23.000> if<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.690> was

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
to the middle of the racket if it was

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.800 
to the middle of the racket if it was
zero<00:02:24.830> as<00:02:25.250> far<00:02:25.519> as<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.730> balance<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.569> would<00:02:26.690> be

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
zero as far as the balance it would be

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.539 
zero as far as the balance it would be
bouncing<00:02:27.230> right<00:02:27.409> on<00:02:27.530> my<00:02:27.620> finger<00:02:27.680> this<00:02:28.400> is<00:02:28.519> a

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
bouncing right on my finger this is a

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:29.949 
bouncing right on my finger this is a
little<00:02:28.790> bit<00:02:28.909> more<00:02:29.030> headlight<00:02:29.450> meaning<00:02:29.840> a

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
little bit more headlight meaning a

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.410 
little bit more headlight meaning a
slightly<00:02:30.590> more<00:02:30.860> weight<00:02:31.129> isn't<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.579> handle<00:02:31.940> and

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
slightly more weight isn't a handle and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.520 
slightly more weight isn't a handle and
you<00:02:32.510> can<00:02:32.540> see<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:32.989> balance<00:02:33.290> point<00:02:33.470> is

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
you can see that the balance point is

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.530 
you can see that the balance point is
gonna<00:02:33.709> be<00:02:33.829> just<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.310> little<00:02:34.640> bit<00:02:34.760> more<00:02:34.970> toward

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
gonna be just a little bit more toward

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.270 
gonna be just a little bit more toward
the<00:02:35.659> handle<00:02:35.930> end<00:02:36.140> on<00:02:36.290> this<00:02:36.470> that's<00:02:37.099> gonna

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
the handle end on this that's gonna

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.759 
the handle end on this that's gonna
allow<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:38.030> racket<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.540> feel<00:02:38.690> overall<00:02:39.110> fairly

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
allow this racket to feel overall fairly

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.979 
allow this racket to feel overall fairly
light<00:02:40.220> but<00:02:40.849> the<00:02:40.940> swing<00:02:41.180> weight<00:02:41.360> isn't<00:02:41.629> very

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
light but the swing weight isn't very

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.110 
light but the swing weight isn't very
low<00:02:42.290> you<00:02:42.650> know<00:02:42.739> whenever<00:02:43.129> we<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.670> swing<00:02:43.940> light

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
low you know whenever we the swing light

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.180 
low you know whenever we the swing light
really<00:02:44.390> is<00:02:44.690> gonna<00:02:45.290> tell<00:02:45.560> you<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.680> lot<00:02:45.859> about<00:02:46.069> how

really is gonna tell you a lot about how

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.440 
really is gonna tell you a lot about how
the<00:02:46.250> rackets<00:02:46.609> gonna<00:02:46.730> fill<00:02:47.000> in<00:02:47.120> your<00:02:47.209> hand

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
the rackets gonna fill in your hand

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.610 
the rackets gonna fill in your hand
because<00:02:47.629> they<00:02:47.720> measure<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.079> swing<00:02:48.349> weight

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
because they measure the swing weight

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.470 
because they measure the swing weight
where<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.340> would<00:02:49.489> hold<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.760> onto<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:50.090> racket

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
where you would hold it onto the racket

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.270 
where you would hold it onto the racket
this<00:02:50.840> swing<00:02:51.140> weight<00:02:51.349> is<00:02:51.500> around<00:02:51.739> three<00:02:52.069> thirty

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
this swing weight is around three thirty

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.449 
this swing weight is around three thirty
two<00:02:52.670> is<00:02:53.000> this<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:54.019> strong<00:02:54.349> swing<00:02:54.709> weight<00:02:54.950> so

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
two is this the strong swing weight so

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.770 
two is this the strong swing weight so
it's<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:55.760> bit<00:02:55.970> higher<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.420> that's<00:02:56.510> because

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
it's a bit higher and that's because

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.080 
it's a bit higher and that's because
it's<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.989> larger<00:02:57.379> head<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:58.760> was<00:02:58.909> gonna

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
it's a larger head and and it was gonna

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.479 
it's a larger head and and it was gonna
feel<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.480> little<00:02:59.750> bit<00:03:00.019> heavier<00:03:00.319> than<00:03:00.620> a<00:03:00.980> smaller

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
feel a little bit heavier than a smaller

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:02.890 
feel a little bit heavier than a smaller

headed racket that's only three hundred

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.649 
headed racket that's only three hundred
and<00:03:03.260> eleven<00:03:03.290> grams<00:03:03.799> so<00:03:04.190> overall<00:03:04.970> gives<00:03:05.569> you

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
and eleven grams so overall gives you

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:06.970 
and eleven grams so overall gives you
still<00:03:05.959> some<00:03:06.140> pretty<00:03:06.260> good<00:03:06.440> feel<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.829> have<00:03:06.920> a

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980

it's<00:03:21.079> gonna<00:03:21.200> be<00:03:21.349> wider<00:03:21.560> than<00:03:21.709> definitely<00:03:22.040> like

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
it's gonna be wider than definitely like

as power level I would consider this to
be<00:03:37.700> kind<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.209> mid-range<00:03:38.540> power<00:03:39.169> level<00:03:39.650> so

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
be kind of a mid-range power level so

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:40.960 
be kind of a mid-range power level so
it's<00:03:39.859> not<00:03:39.950> as<00:03:40.099> gonna<00:03:40.340> give<00:03:40.489> you<00:03:40.579> as<00:03:40.639> much<00:03:40.760> power

my personal opinion on this racket for a

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.509 
my personal opinion on this racket for a
stronger<00:04:15.049> player<00:04:15.290> it's<00:04:15.620> still<00:04:15.949> really<00:04:16.250> light

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
stronger player it's still really light

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.310 
stronger player it's still really light
I<00:04:16.760> had<00:04:16.910> to<00:04:16.970> put<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.150> lot<00:04:17.299> of<00:04:17.389> lead<00:04:17.539> tape<00:04:17.780> on<00:04:17.989> it<00:04:18.169> I

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
I had to put a lot of lead tape on it I

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.110 
I had to put a lot of lead tape on it I
put<00:04:18.739> some<00:04:18.859> silicone<00:04:19.070> in<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.579> grip<00:04:19.789> to<00:04:19.940> try<00:04:20.060> to

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
put some silicone in the grip to try to

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.880

to you guys I'll see y'all soon and make
this<00:06:16.690> l-type<00:06:16.900> motion<00:06:17.289> with<00:06:17.770> our<00:06:17.800> arms<00:06:18.340> and

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
this l-type motion with our arms and

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.490 
this l-type motion with our arms and
then<00:06:19.150> the<00:06:19.270> racket<00:06:19.510> needs<00:06:19.780> to<00:06:19.900> be<00:06:19.960> pointed<00:06:20.050> out

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
then the racket needs to be pointed out

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.980 
then the racket needs to be pointed out
and<00:06:20.800> basically<00:06:21.220> a<00:06:21.340> 45<00:06:21.789> degree<00:06:22.030> angle<00:06:22.180> so<00:06:22.659> the

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
and basically a 45 degree angle so the

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.050 
and basically a 45 degree angle so the
rackets<00:06:23.320> going<00:06:23.440> to<00:06:23.500> be<00:06:23.560> at<00:06:23.650> a<00:06:23.680> 45<00:06:23.710> and<00:06:24.460> the<00:06:24.820> tip

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
rackets going to be at a 45 and the tip

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.149 
rackets going to be at a 45 and the tip
of<00:06:25.180> the<00:06:25.270> racket<00:06:25.419> from<00:06:26.050> the<00:06:26.199> butt<00:06:26.229> end<00:06:26.620> will<00:06:27.039> be

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:27.159 
of the racket from the butt end will be

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:28.770 
of the racket from the butt end will be
pointing<00:06:27.580> right<00:06:27.729> over<00:06:28.000> toward<00:06:28.210> three<00:06:28.539> o'clock

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
pointing right over toward three o'clock

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.570 
pointing right over toward three o'clock
that's<00:06:29.380> the<00:06:29.620> first<00:06:29.860> motion<00:06:30.130> that<00:06:30.340> we<00:06:30.400> want<00:06:30.550> to

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
that's the first motion that we want to

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.460 
that's the first motion that we want to
get<00:06:30.699> into<00:06:30.820> so<00:06:31.120> as<00:06:31.240> we're<00:06:31.479> loading<00:06:31.690> up<00:06:31.930> the

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
get into so as we're loading up the

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.779 
get into so as we're loading up the
racket<00:06:32.500> tip<00:06:33.039> is<00:06:33.159> going<00:06:33.280> to<00:06:33.340> be<00:06:33.400> pointing<00:06:33.669> out

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789 
racket tip is going to be pointing out

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.089 
racket tip is going to be pointing out
toward<00:06:34.120> three<00:06:34.330> o'clock<00:06:34.599> and<00:06:34.810> at<00:06:35.289> about<00:06:35.440> a<00:06:35.560> 45

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:36.099 
toward three o'clock and at about a 45

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:36.870 
toward three o'clock and at about a 45
degree<00:06:36.250> angle

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
degree angle

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.719 
degree angle
now<00:06:37.240> the<00:06:37.300> second<00:06:37.779> move<00:06:37.960> is<00:06:38.320> where<00:06:38.950> the

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 
now the second move is where the

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:40.950 
now the second move is where the
the<00:06:39.849> magic<00:06:40.180> starts<00:06:40.449> to<00:06:40.479> happen<00:06:40.569> and<00:06:40.870> that's

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
the magic starts to happen and that's

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.170 
the magic starts to happen and that's
the<00:06:41.110> loading<00:06:41.199> of<00:06:41.740> the<00:06:42.159> forearms<00:06:42.309> and<00:06:42.909> this<00:06:43.059> is

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
the loading of the forearms and this is

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.629 
the loading of the forearms and this is
called<00:06:43.389> a<00:06:43.599> stretch<00:06:44.349> shortening<00:06:44.830> cycle<00:06:45.039> so

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:45.639 
called a stretch shortening cycle so

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:46.589 
called a stretch shortening cycle so
anytime<00:06:45.849> you're<00:06:46.089> going<00:06:46.120> to<00:06:46.270> have<00:06:46.360> a<00:06:46.389> lot<00:06:46.569> of

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:46.599 
anytime you're going to have a lot of

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:48.869 
anytime you're going to have a lot of
power<00:06:46.839> and<00:06:47.169> fire<00:06:47.379> your<00:06:47.620> muscles<00:06:48.069> with<00:06:48.580> good

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:48.879 
power and fire your muscles with good

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:50.519 
power and fire your muscles with good
speed<00:06:49.210> and<00:06:49.360> good<00:06:49.419> power<00:06:49.539> we<00:06:50.259> need<00:06:50.409> to<00:06:50.439> first

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:50.529 
speed and good power we need to first

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:52.890 
speed and good power we need to first
stretch<00:06:51.039> those<00:06:51.279> muscles<00:06:51.309> and<00:06:51.909> then<00:06:52.330> fire<00:06:52.389> them

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:52.900 
stretch those muscles and then fire them

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.649 
stretch those muscles and then fire them
so<00:06:53.469> what's<00:06:53.650> going<00:06:53.770> to<00:06:53.800> happen<00:06:54.159> here<00:06:54.400> from<00:06:55.120> this

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:55.659 
so what's going to happen here from this

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:57.899 
so what's going to happen here from this
first<00:06:55.960> move<00:06:56.259> we're<00:06:57.069> now<00:06:57.219> going<00:06:57.430> to<00:06:57.490> make<00:06:57.849> a

00:06:57.899 --> 00:06:57.909 
first move we're now going to make a

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:59.159 
first move we're now going to make a
motion<00:06:58.150> which<00:06:58.419> would<00:06:58.569> be<00:06:58.659> very<00:06:58.809> similar<00:06:59.050> to

00:06:59.159 --> 00:06:59.169 
motion which would be very similar to

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.409 
motion which would be very similar to
turning<00:06:59.589> a<00:06:59.680> doorknob<00:06:59.919> to<00:07:00.789> the<00:07:00.819> right<00:07:00.939> with

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:01.419 
turning a doorknob to the right with

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:03.749 
turning a doorknob to the right with
your<00:07:01.449> wrist<00:07:01.680> so<00:07:02.680> as<00:07:02.770> we're<00:07:02.979> doing<00:07:03.039> the<00:07:03.550> first
