00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
kind of a low-key event their first

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.800 
kind of a low-key event their first
project<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:28.080> be<00:00:28.170> small<00:00:28.500> one<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.010> scale<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:30.359> to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
project to be small one in scale and to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.590 
project to be small one in scale and to
save<00:00:31.019> our<00:00:31.349> exciting<00:00:32.130> big<00:00:32.430> party<00:00:32.850> for<00:00:32.880> when<00:00:33.510> the

save our exciting big party for when the
houses<00:00:33.930> are<00:00:34.110> finished<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:44.850> project<00:00:45.059> itself

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
houses are finished the project itself

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.500 
houses are finished the project itself
is<00:00:46.280> basically<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.460> idea<00:00:47.820> was<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.239> want<00:00:48.420> to

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
is basically the idea was we want to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.779 
is basically the idea was we want to
build<00:00:48.600> these<00:00:48.809> green<00:00:49.100> modern<00:00:50.100> houses<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
build these green modern houses and

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.310 
build these green modern houses and
we've<00:00:51.239> seen<00:00:51.390> people<00:00:51.629> like<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> rag<00:00:51.989> flats

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
we've seen people like the rag flats

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.200 
we've seen people like the rag flats
guys<00:00:52.649> do<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.280> they<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:53.550> wonderful<00:00:53.879> stuff

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
guys do it and they do wonderful stuff

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.209 
guys do it and they do wonderful stuff
but<00:00:54.840> what<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.079> realized<00:00:55.440> during<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.980> course

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
but what we realized during the course

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.319 
but what we realized during the course
of<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.399> beginning<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.820> project<00:00:57.000> was

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
of the beginning of this project was

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.450 
of the beginning of this project was
that<00:00:57.570> there's<00:00:58.500> no<00:00:58.559> way<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.100> afford

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
that there's no way that we can afford

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.040 
that there's no way that we can afford
the<00:00:59.670> houses<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.120> we're<00:01:00.239> trying<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.899> build

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the houses that we're trying to build

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.569 
the houses that we're trying to build
they're<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.469> know<00:01:01.500> they're<00:01:01.710> expensive<00:01:02.070> Green

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
they're you know they're expensive Green

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.070 
they're you know they're expensive Green
is<00:01:02.699> often<00:01:02.940> seen<00:01:03.030> as<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.180> pre<00:01:03.390> master<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.930> well

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
is often seen as a pre master like well

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.299 
is often seen as a pre master like well
is<00:01:04.199> there<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> way<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.860> could<00:01:05.040> build<00:01:05.159> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
is there a way that we could build a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.020 
is there a way that we could build a
house<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:06.710> we<00:01:07.710> could<00:01:07.950> afford<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.549> know<00:01:08.729> and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
house that we could afford you know and

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.359 
house that we could afford you know and
the<00:01:09.150> magic<00:01:09.450> number<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.900> modern<00:01:10.369> building

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
the magic number for a modern building

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.440 
the magic number for a modern building
seems<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> hundred<00:01:12.119> bucks<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.330> square

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
seems to be a hundred bucks a square

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.539 
seems to be a hundred bucks a square
foot<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.770> figured<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> hundred<00:01:14.310> thousand

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
foot so we figured a hundred thousand

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.010 
foot so we figured a hundred thousand
dollar<00:01:14.700> house<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.150> bought<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.420> website<00:01:15.810> got

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
dollar house we bought the website got

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.580 
dollar house we bought the website got
started<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.520> as<00:01:18.180> we've<00:01:18.930> gone<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.320> we've

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
started on it and as we've gone on we've

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.010 
started on it and as we've gone on we've
realized<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.369> know<00:01:20.659> you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.869> actually

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
realized that you know you can actually

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.880 
realized that you know you can actually
build<00:01:22.640> modern<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.970> build<00:01:24.420> green<00:01:24.869> for<00:01:25.619> about

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
build modern and build green for about

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.380 
build modern and build green for about
the<00:01:26.070> same<00:01:26.100> price<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:27.060> build<00:01:27.240> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the same price that you can build a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.899 
the same price that you can build a
standard<00:01:27.900> house<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.950> take<00:01:29.189> time<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.729> think

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
standard house if you take time to think

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.100 
standard house if you take time to think
about<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.240> design<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.570> think<00:01:30.840> about<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
about the design and think about the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.260 
about the design and think about the
process<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.520> all<00:01:32.670> about<00:01:32.909> design

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
process and so this is all about design

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.749 
process and so this is all about design
and<00:01:33.420> process<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.990> all<00:01:34.110> about<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:35.400> building

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
and process it's all about the building

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.980 
and process it's all about the building
technique<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.420> that's<00:01:36.659> actually<00:01:36.840> something

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
technique and that's actually something

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.810 
technique and that's actually something
that<00:01:37.320> we're<00:01:37.560> gonna<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.860> talking<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.640> lot<00:01:38.790> about

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
that we're gonna be talking a lot about

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.090 
that we're gonna be talking a lot about
and<00:01:39.210> dealing<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.570> lot<00:01:39.600> with<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.020> next<00:01:40.320> year

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
and dealing a lot with in the next year

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.160 
and dealing a lot with in the next year
or<00:01:41.130> two<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.180> idea<00:01:42.479> there's<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> different

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
or two is the idea there's a different

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.050 
or two is the idea there's a different
way<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.290> build<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.680> house<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:44.729> green

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
way to build a house and it's not green

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.639 
way to build a house and it's not green
it's<00:01:45.360> not<00:01:45.509> modern<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.899> sleep<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> right<00:01:46.470> way

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
it's not modern to sleep the right way

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.740 
it's not modern to sleep the right way
to<00:01:46.710> go<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:46.979> house<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:47.970> that's<00:01:48.119> sort<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.360> do

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
to go the house and so that's sort of do

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.080 
to go the house and so that's sort of do
it<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> jumping<00:01:49.619> off<00:01:49.710> point<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:50.100> so

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
it this is the jumping off point for so

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.670 
it this is the jumping off point for so
this<00:01:51.479> project<00:01:51.869> while<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.110> important<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.560> its

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680

this project while it's important in its
own<00:01:52.829> right<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.659> we<00:01:54.659> feel<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.170> beginning

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
own right is we feel just the beginning

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.499 
own right is we feel just the beginning
of<00:01:55.710> what<00:01:55.890> we're<00:01:56.040> hoping<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.399> do

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.209 

there's<00:02:01.509> not<00:02:02.170> a<00:02:02.200> lot<00:02:02.590> of<00:02:02.619> focus<00:02:02.950> on

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
there's not a lot of focus on

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.190 
there's not a lot of focus on
affordability<00:02:03.789> in<00:02:04.090> green<00:02:04.390> I<00:02:04.659> think<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:05.049> lot<00:02:05.170> of

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
affordability in green I think a lot of

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.059 
affordability in green I think a lot of
people<00:02:05.439> see<00:02:05.590> green<00:02:05.979> as<00:02:06.310> a<00:02:06.789> premium<00:02:07.920> people<00:02:08.920> say

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
people see green as a premium people say

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.350 
people see green as a premium people say
you<00:02:09.129> know<00:02:09.369> I'm<00:02:09.489> gonna<00:02:09.610> build<00:02:09.789> a<00:02:09.879> house<00:02:10.060> and

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
you know I'm gonna build a house and

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.369 
you know I'm gonna build a house and
then<00:02:10.450> I'm<00:02:10.509> gonna<00:02:10.599> build<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.869> green<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.140> then<00:02:11.319> I

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
then I'm gonna build it green and then I

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.170 
then I'm gonna build it green and then I
can<00:02:11.530> sell<00:02:11.709> for<00:02:11.739> 50<00:02:12.129> percent<00:02:12.280> 20<00:02:12.670> percent<00:02:12.700> more

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
can sell for 50 percent 20 percent more

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.490 
can sell for 50 percent 20 percent more
and<00:02:13.989> I<00:02:14.680> think<00:02:15.010> in<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:16.510> sense<00:02:16.870> that<00:02:17.230> green

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
and I think in that sense that green

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.740 
and I think in that sense that green
building<00:02:17.950> is<00:02:18.130> kind<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.640> like<00:02:18.880> green<00:02:19.180> building

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
building is kind of like green building

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.009 
building is kind of like green building
is<00:02:20.200> kind<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:21.360> detriment<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.480> sustainable

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
is kind of a detriment to sustainable

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.759 
is kind of a detriment to sustainable
