00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
when given the opportunity okay which

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.830 
when given the opportunity okay which
team<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.920> establish<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.910> run<00:00:54.090> against

team can establish the run against

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.510 
team can establish the run against
opposing<00:00:55.199> defenses<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.250> been<00:00:56.340> pretty

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
opposing defenses that have been pretty

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.580

good<00:00:56.760> against<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.120> run<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:58.079> far<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.530> season

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590

I<00:00:59.160> think<00:00:59.520> that's<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.940> be<00:01:00.059> something<00:01:00.239> to

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
I think that's going to be something to

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.240 
I think that's going to be something to
watch<00:01:00.660> also<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:03.019> Washington<00:01:04.019> Redskins

if you remember him seems like he was on

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
the Giants ages ago but you know he's a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.120 
the Giants ages ago but you know he's a
guy<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.780> Larry<00:02:18.780> Donnell<00:02:19.080> is<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.320> guy<00:02:19.470> looks

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
guy that Larry Donnell is a guy looks

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.890 
guy that Larry Donnell is a guy looks
like<00:02:20.220> he's<00:02:20.430> solidifying<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:21.270> position<00:02:21.750> the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
like he's solidifying that position the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.690 
like he's solidifying that position the
offensive<00:02:22.290> line<00:02:22.470> looked<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.980> lot<00:02:23.130> better<00:02:23.310> last

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
offensive line looked a lot better last

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.970 
offensive line looked a lot better last
week<00:02:23.910> can<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.810> offensive<00:02:25.230> line<00:02:25.440> develop

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
week can that offensive line develop

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.030 
week can that offensive line develop
consistency<00:02:26.840> give<00:02:27.840> Eli<00:02:28.170> Manning<00:02:28.620> time<00:02:28.830> to

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
consistency give Eli Manning time to

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.010 
consistency give Eli Manning time to
throw<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.670> as<00:02:29.970> Eli<00:02:30.270> Manning<00:02:30.600> turn<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:30.930> the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
throw and as Eli Manning turn in the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.900 
throw and as Eli Manning turn in the
corner<00:02:31.320> in<00:02:31.410> this<00:02:31.500> offense<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.160> think<00:02:32.610> will<00:02:32.760> go<00:02:32.880> a

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
corner in this offense I think will go a

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.940 
corner in this offense I think will go a
long<00:02:33.209> way<00:02:33.540> when<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.870> talk<00:02:34.080> about<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.350> second<00:02:34.830> a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
long way when you talk about a second a

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.840 
long way when you talk about a second a
second<00:02:35.520> game<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:36.290> short<00:02:37.290> week<00:02:37.560> do<00:02:38.459> they<00:02:38.640> get

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
second game in short week do they get

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.880 
second game in short week do they get
into<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.090> flow<00:02:39.420> are<00:02:39.780> they<00:02:40.080> able<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.410> expose<00:02:40.830> what

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
into a flow are they able to expose what

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.730 
into a flow are they able to expose what
I<00:02:41.130> think<00:02:41.459> even<00:02:41.940> with<00:02:42.300> DeAngelo<00:02:42.930> Hall<00:02:43.140> was<00:02:43.680> a

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
I think even with DeAngelo Hall was a

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.520 
I think even with DeAngelo Hall was a
very<00:02:44.070> weak<00:02:44.430> Redskin<00:02:45.270> secondary<00:02:45.900> can<00:02:46.440> they

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
very weak Redskin secondary can they

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.470 
very weak Redskin secondary can they
exploit<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:46.980> secondary<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:48.060> remains<00:02:48.360> to

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
exploit that secondary that remains to

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.710 
exploit that secondary that remains to
be<00:02:48.510> seen<00:02:48.780> here<00:02:49.110> in<00:02:49.260> week<00:02:49.920> four<00:02:50.340> Kirk<00:02:51.150> Cousins<00:02:51.390> i

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
be seen here in week four Kirk Cousins i

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.120 
be seen here in week four Kirk Cousins i
think<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.110> going<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.320> be<00:02:52.380> up<00:02:52.560> against<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.040> this

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
think is going to be up against it this

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.620 
think is going to be up against it this
week<00:02:53.370> I<00:02:53.610> don't<00:02:54.030> think<00:02:54.060> it's<00:02:54.270> going<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.450> be<00:02:54.510> as

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
week I don't think it's going to be as

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.600 
week I don't think it's going to be as
easy<00:02:54.930> for<00:02:55.050> him<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.350> throw<00:02:55.470> as<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.010> has<00:02:56.190> been<00:02:56.220> the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
easy for him to throw as it has been the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.660 
easy for him to throw as it has been the
last<00:02:56.790> two<00:02:57.060> weeks<00:02:57.330> versus<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.320> Eagles<00:02:58.770> and

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
last two weeks versus the Eagles and

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.479 
last two weeks versus the Eagles and
Jacksonville<00:03:00.650> respectively<00:03:01.650> here<00:03:02.010> so<00:03:02.280> I

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
Jacksonville respectively here so I

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.280 
Jacksonville respectively here so I
think<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:03.150> going<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.540> be<00:03:03.630> on<00:03:03.959> that

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
think it's going to be on that

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.740 
think it's going to be on that
Washington<00:03:05.160> offensive<00:03:05.700> line<00:03:05.880> can<00:03:06.420> they<00:03:06.540> run

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
Washington offensive line can they run

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.449 
Washington offensive line can they run
the<00:03:06.900> ball<00:03:07.110> can<00:03:07.590> they<00:03:07.709> control<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.220> clock

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
the ball can they control the clock

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.699 
the ball can they control the clock
because<00:03:09.239> i<00:03:09.270> think<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.720> giant<00:03:10.080> secondary<00:03:10.590> is

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
because i think the giant secondary is

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.170 
because i think the giant secondary is
going<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:10.890> rise<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.340> occasion<00:03:11.459> in<00:03:12.030> this

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
going to rise to the occasion in this

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.240 
going to rise to the occasion in this
one<00:03:12.360> against<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.500> know<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.770> likes<00:03:14.010> of

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
one against you know the likes of

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.550 
one against you know the likes of
whether<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:15.030> be<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.209> Niles<00:03:15.510> Paul<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.930> tight<00:03:16.290> end

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
whether it be a Niles Paul a tight end

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.759 
whether it be a Niles Paul a tight end
or<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.510> DeSean<00:03:18.510> Jackson<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:19.230> receiver<00:03:19.530> and

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
or a DeSean Jackson and receiver and

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.400 
or a DeSean Jackson and receiver and
obviously<00:03:20.040> Pierre<00:03:20.370> Garcon<00:03:20.880> as<00:03:21.120> well<00:03:21.410> we'll

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
obviously Pierre Garcon as well we'll

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.729 
obviously Pierre Garcon as well we'll
see<00:03:22.590> how<00:03:22.739> this<00:03:22.920> all<00:03:23.100> unfolds<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:24.470> really<00:03:25.470> look

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
see how this all unfolds I really look

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.410 
see how this all unfolds I really look
at<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.130> home<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.370> away<00:03:26.730> teams<00:03:27.060> in<00:03:27.269> these

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
at the home and away teams in these

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.030 
at the home and away teams in these
matchups<00:03:27.690> on<00:03:28.049> Thursday<00:03:28.410> night<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.620> think<00:03:28.739> it
