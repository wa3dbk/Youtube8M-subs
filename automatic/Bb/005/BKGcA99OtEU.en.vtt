which<00:00:07.919> was<00:00:08.099> built<00:00:08.309> by<00:00:08.370> bunny<00:00:08.730> jumps<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:09.900> a

which was built by bunny jumps this is a

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.499 
which was built by bunny jumps this is a
jumping<00:00:10.440> puzzle<00:00:10.830> map<00:00:10.980> which<00:00:11.820> traditionally

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
jumping puzzle map which traditionally

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.060 
jumping puzzle map which traditionally
you<00:00:12.780> would<00:00:12.900> expect<00:00:13.320> for<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.620> be<00:00:13.830> just<00:00:13.950> a

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
you would expect for it to be just a

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.230 
you would expect for it to be just a
bunch<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.340> floating<00:00:14.460> blocks<00:00:14.849> but<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.150> this

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
bunch of floating blocks but in this

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.970 
bunch of floating blocks but in this
case<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.630> map<00:00:15.750> actually<00:00:16.199> has<00:00:16.320> structure<00:00:16.800> to

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
case the map actually has structure to

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.769 
case the map actually has structure to
it<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.250> there<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> theme<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.630> actually

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
it and there is a theme so it's actually

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:19.490 
it and there is a theme so it's actually
really<00:00:19.020> great

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
really great

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.859 
really great
additionally<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:20.520> not<00:00:20.789> really<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.570> hard

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
additionally it's not really that hard

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.890 
additionally it's not really that hard
either<00:00:22.710> with<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> lot<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.880> these<00:00:23.939> maps<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.449> can't

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
either with a lot of these maps I can't

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.620 
either with a lot of these maps I can't
really<00:00:25.140> complete<00:00:25.830> them<00:00:26.010> because<00:00:26.430> I'm<00:00:27.269> not<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
really complete them because I'm not the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.179 
really complete them because I'm not the
greatest<00:00:28.019> at<00:00:28.109> jumping<00:00:28.500> however<00:00:28.830> with<00:00:29.039> this

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
greatest at jumping however with this

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.429 
greatest at jumping however with this
map<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:30.119> jumps<00:00:30.480> aren't<00:00:30.779> too<00:00:30.960> terribly

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
map the jumps aren't too terribly

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.810 
map the jumps aren't too terribly
difficult<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.070> if<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.250> just<00:00:32.399> give<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.640> enough

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
difficult and if you just give it enough

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.729 
difficult and if you just give it enough
time<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.270> will<00:00:33.450> figure<00:00:33.809> them<00:00:33.930> out<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.260> think

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
time you will figure them out I think

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.470 
time you will figure them out I think
the<00:00:34.829> most<00:00:34.980> elaborate<00:00:35.460> jump<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.910> there<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.210> is

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
the most elaborate jump that there is is

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.090 
the most elaborate jump that there is is
there's<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.780> spring<00:00:37.170> jump<00:00:37.410> or<00:00:37.559> two<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.010> then

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
there's a spring jump or two and then

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.440 
there's a spring jump or two and then
there's<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.309> couple<00:00:38.489> puzzles<00:00:38.940> too<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.390> not

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
there's a couple puzzles too so it's not

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.260 
there's a couple puzzles too so it's not
exclusively<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.879> jumping<00:00:41.879> map<00:00:42.030> there's

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
exclusively a jumping map there's

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.940 
exclusively a jumping map there's
actually<00:00:42.570> puzzle<00:00:42.899> elements<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.649> which<00:00:43.800> is

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
actually puzzle elements to it which is

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.950 
actually puzzle elements to it which is
great<00:00:44.190> as<00:00:44.370> well<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.539> progress<00:00:45.719> through

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
great as well as you progress through

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.450 
great as well as you progress through
the<00:00:46.260> map<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:46.620> recommended<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.370> be

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
the map it's recommended that you be

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.790 
the map it's recommended that you be
observant<00:00:48.180> because<00:00:48.539> again<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.230> also<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
observant because again this is also a

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.459 
observant because again this is also a
puzzle<00:00:50.489> map<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.300> not<00:00:51.390> exclusively<00:00:52.260> just

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
puzzle map so it's not exclusively just

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.290 
puzzle map so it's not exclusively just
a<00:00:52.620> bunch<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.039> jumps<00:00:53.460> or<00:00:53.610> are<00:00:53.760> areas<00:00:54.180> where

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
a bunch of jumps or are areas where

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
a bunch of jumps or are areas where
you'll<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.809> actually<00:00:55.199> think<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.800> if<00:00:56.160> you

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
you'll have to actually think and if you

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.040 
you'll have to actually think and if you
miss<00:00:56.520> something<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.210> map<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.600> might<00:00:57.780> have

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
miss something on the map you might have

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.900 
miss something on the map you might have
to<00:00:58.170> go<00:00:58.289> back<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.710> redo<00:00:59.160> some<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.640> jumps

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
to go back and redo some of the jumps

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.299 
to go back and redo some of the jumps
however<00:01:00.660> there<00:01:00.899> are<00:01:01.050> checkpoints<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.129> map

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
however there are checkpoints on the map

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.729 
however there are checkpoints on the map
so<00:01:02.640> you'll<00:01:02.820> get<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.120> areas<00:01:03.539> where<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.559> either

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
so you'll get to areas where you either

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.039 
so you'll get to areas where you either
can't<00:01:05.129> die<00:01:05.460> or<00:01:05.820> if<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.390> do<00:01:06.600> die<00:01:06.780> you'll<00:01:06.990> be

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
can't die or if you do die you'll be

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.050 
can't die or if you do die you'll be
able<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.470> get<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> teleporter<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.580> move<00:01:08.880> back

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
able to get a teleporter and move back

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.789 
able to get a teleporter and move back
to<00:01:09.090> one<00:01:09.420> specific<00:01:09.659> area<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> map<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.680> there

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
to one specific area on the map so there

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.679 
to one specific area on the map so there
are<00:01:10.890> checkpoints<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.549> if<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.270> get<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.659> a

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
are checkpoints so if you get to a

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.060 
are checkpoints so if you get to a
certain<00:01:12.840> spot<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.470> map<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.830> feel

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
certain spot on the map and you feel

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.039 
certain spot on the map and you feel
kind<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.340> nervous<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.760> go<00:01:14.909> forward<00:01:15.330> there

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
kind of nervous to go forward there

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.320 
kind of nervous to go forward there
normally<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:17.040> teleporter<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:17.850> sometimes

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
normally is a teleporter but sometimes

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.600 
normally is a teleporter but sometimes
there<00:01:18.600> isn't<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.159> got<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.400> kind<00:01:20.490> of

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
there isn't so you just got to kind of

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.550 
there isn't so you just got to kind of
be<00:01:20.700> careful<00:01:20.909> with<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.360> type<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.630> thing<00:01:21.960> again

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
be careful with that type of thing again

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.690 
be careful with that type of thing again
you<00:01:22.680> can<00:01:22.799> play<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.159> more<00:01:23.460> than<00:01:23.640> just

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
you can play this with more than just

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.490 
you can play this with more than just
yourself<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.540> played<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.869> with<00:01:25.020> two<00:01:25.229> players

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
yourself we played this with two players

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.870 
yourself we played this with two players
and<00:01:25.740> we<00:01:25.830> had<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> blast<00:01:26.189> because<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.640> kind<00:01:26.820> of

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
and we had a blast because we kind of

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.070 
and we had a blast because we kind of
work<00:01:27.060> together<00:01:27.240> through<00:01:27.659> some<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.930> rooms

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
work together through some of the rooms

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
puzzle instead of one also it's really

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.130 
puzzle instead of one also it's really
fun<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.400> do<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> jumps<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.299> mean<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> lot<00:01:37.020> of

fun just to do the jumps I mean a lot of

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.450 
fun just to do the jumps I mean a lot of
these<00:01:37.200> puzzle<00:01:37.560> maps<00:01:37.710> are<00:01:37.860> not<00:01:37.890> puzzle<00:01:38.189> map<00:01:38.280> so

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
these puzzle maps are not puzzle map so

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.550 
these puzzle maps are not puzzle map so
jumping<00:01:38.759> maps<00:01:38.939> are<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.509> floating<00:01:39.990> blocks<00:01:40.290> in

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
jumping maps are just floating blocks in

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.710 
jumping maps are just floating blocks in
the<00:01:40.650> sky<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.460> players<00:01:41.729> endlessly<00:01:42.299> try<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.570> get

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the sky and players endlessly try to get

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.999 
the sky and players endlessly try to get
to<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> top<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> ladder

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
to the top of the ladder

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.230 
to the top of the ladder
but<00:01:44.280> with<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.490> map<00:01:44.640> at<00:01:44.820> least<00:01:44.970> there's<00:01:45.149> a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
but with this map at least there's a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.620 
but with this map at least there's a
theme<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.689> on

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630

everything's<00:01:46.869> got<00:01:47.020> structure<00:01:47.409> to<00:01:47.530> it<00:01:47.590> for

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
everything's got structure to it for

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.130 
everything's got structure to it for

as puzzles and additionally have

00:01:58.659 --> 00:01:59.819 
as puzzles and additionally have
structure<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.320> them<00:01:59.439> and<00:01:59.560> this<00:01:59.649> map

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
structure to them and this map

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.249 
structure to them and this map
accomplishes<00:02:00.490> that<00:02:00.640> no<00:02:00.909> problem<00:02:01.509> again<00:02:02.140> the

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
accomplishes that no problem again the

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.690 
accomplishes that no problem again the
map<00:02:02.380> isn't<00:02:02.590> terribly<00:02:03.100> difficult<00:02:03.280> so<00:02:03.610> the

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
map isn't terribly difficult so the

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.370 
map isn't terribly difficult so the
average<00:02:04.060> player<00:02:04.299> like<00:02:04.479> myself<00:02:04.630> was<00:02:04.960> able<00:02:05.289> to

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
average player like myself was able to

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.469 
average player like myself was able to
complete<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.710> map<00:02:05.829> in<00:02:05.979> around<00:02:06.310> an<00:02:06.579> hour<00:02:06.819> or<00:02:07.179> so

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
complete the map in around an hour or so

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.449
