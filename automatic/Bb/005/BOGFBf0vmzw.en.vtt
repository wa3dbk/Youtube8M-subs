sounds absolutely fantastic the base
response<00:02:20.930> is<00:02:21.080> much<00:02:21.350> much<00:02:21.560> better<00:02:21.740> this<00:02:22.400> gives

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
a much better input signal to the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.600 
a much better input signal to the
techniques<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.350> it's<00:02:24.590> crossed<00:02:24.830> over<00:02:25.040> at<00:02:25.220> 40

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
a special for Sony format and it would

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.130 
a special for Sony format and it would
then<00:03:34.430> play<00:03:34.580> on<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.850> screen<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:35.660> if<00:03:35.810> that<00:03:35.959> out

whatever I want me if I might have them
in<00:03:45.709> my<00:03:45.830> car<00:03:46.100> a<00:03:46.160> little<00:03:46.459> piece<00:03:46.790> car<00:03:47.360> computer

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
in my car a little piece car computer

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.420 
in my car a little piece car computer
don't<00:03:48.440> go<00:03:48.590> into<00:03:48.680> them<00:03:48.890> yet<00:03:49.040> but<00:03:49.220> there's<00:03:49.340> one

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
don't go into them yet but there's one

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.890 
don't go into them yet but there's one
there<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.760> second<00:03:50.090> ones<00:03:50.209> over<00:03:50.390> there<00:03:50.600> I've

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
there the second ones over there I've

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.180 
there the second ones over there I've
yet<00:03:51.110> to<00:03:51.170> get<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.530> controller<00:03:51.830> for<00:03:51.980> that<00:03:52.070> one

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
yet to get the controller for that one

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.890 
yet to get the controller for that one
because<00:03:52.370> one<00:03:52.489> see<00:03:52.670> if<00:03:52.730> this<00:03:52.850> works<00:03:53.060> first<00:03:53.300> it's

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
because one see if this works first it's

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.509 
because one see if this works first it's
pretty<00:03:54.109> decent<00:03:54.440> actually<00:03:54.560> really<00:03:55.130> easy<00:03:55.160> to

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
pretty decent actually really easy to

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.210 
pretty decent actually really easy to
set<00:03:55.730> up<00:03:55.760> just<00:03:56.739> simply<00:03:57.739> replacing<00:03:58.160> the

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
set up just simply replacing the

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.640 
set up just simply replacing the
microchip

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
microchip

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.619 
microchip
the<00:03:58.769> back<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.730> back<00:04:00.060> light<00:04:00.269> controller

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
the back and the back light controller

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.020 
the back and the back light controller
the<00:04:01.470> v-j<00:04:01.650> control<00:04:02.099> there<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.549> this<00:04:02.790> little

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
the v-j control there and this little

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.780 
the v-j control there and this little
sort<00:04:03.269> of<00:04:03.299> power<00:04:03.659> switch<00:04:04.159> chip<00:04:05.159> there<00:04:05.400> so

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
sort of power switch chip there so

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.830 
sort of power switch chip there so
that's<00:04:05.939> nice<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.239> easy<00:04:06.329> to<00:04:06.540> do

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
that's nice and easy to do

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.100 
that's nice and easy to do
also<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:08.000> picked<00:04:09.000> up<00:04:09.150> these<00:04:09.299> from<00:04:09.540> my<00:04:09.659> old<00:04:09.780> comic

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
also I picked up these from my old comic

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.770 
also I picked up these from my old comic
store<00:04:10.319> these<00:04:10.890> are<00:04:11.220> this<00:04:11.640> is<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.819> single<00:04:12.480> CD

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
store these are this is a single CD

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.539 
store these are this is a single CD
player<00:04:13.049> Phillips<00:04:13.470> quite<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.040> piece<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.400> kit

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
player Phillips quite a piece of kit

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.759 
player Phillips quite a piece of kit
release<00:04:14.849> really<00:04:15.269> decent<00:04:15.510> player<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.079> that<00:04:16.109> is

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
release really decent player and that is

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.449 
release really decent player and that is
like<00:04:16.949> a<00:04:16.979> kind<00:04:17.190> of<00:04:17.310> mono<00:04:17.820> preamp<00:04:19.130> yeah<00:04:20.130> she<00:04:20.310> does

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
like a kind of mono preamp yeah she does

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.400 
like a kind of mono preamp yeah she does
have<00:04:20.639> speaker<00:04:21.000> outputs<00:04:21.449> it's<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.109> little<00:04:22.289> bit

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
have speaker outputs it's a little bit

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.080 
have speaker outputs it's a little bit
confusing<00:04:22.530> I'm<00:04:23.100> not<00:04:23.310> too<00:04:23.520> sure<00:04:23.729> what<00:04:23.759> I'm

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
confusing I'm not too sure what I'm

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.279 
confusing I'm not too sure what I'm
going<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.270> use<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.509> for<00:04:24.690> but<00:04:24.750> I<00:04:24.900> took<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.199> anyway

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
going to use it for but I took it anyway

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.779 
going to use it for but I took it anyway
so<00:04:25.530> it<00:04:25.740> was<00:04:25.770> free

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
so it was free

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.090 
so it was free
yeah<00:04:27.270> mono<00:04:27.600> output<00:04:28.139> now<00:04:28.289> this<00:04:28.590> is<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:29.070> think

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
yeah mono output now this is I think

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.760 
yeah mono output now this is I think
designed<00:04:29.699> definitely<00:04:30.150> for<00:04:30.330> a<00:04:30.360> store<00:04:30.780> or<00:04:31.050> for<00:04:31.710> a

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
designed definitely for a store or for a

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.980 
designed definitely for a store or for a
shop<00:04:32.039> because<00:04:32.400> there<00:04:32.639> you<00:04:32.760> see<00:04:33.030> you've<00:04:33.690> got

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
shop because there you see you've got

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.629 
shop because there you see you've got
outputs<00:04:34.560> for<00:04:35.460> for<00:04:35.910> 4<00:04:36.750> ohms

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
outputs for for 4 ohms

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.260 
outputs for for 4 ohms
swass<00:04:38.639> and<00:04:38.820> I<00:04:38.850> sorry<00:04:39.090> yeah<00:04:39.870> 4<00:04:40.139> ohms<00:04:41.060> 83<00:04:42.060> ohms

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
swass and I sorry yeah 4 ohms 83 ohms

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.860 
swass and I sorry yeah 4 ohms 83 ohms
and<00:04:42.660> 170<00:04:43.500> ohms<00:04:43.820> so<00:04:44.820> I<00:04:45.120> reckon<00:04:45.570> there<00:04:45.720> in<00:04:45.810> a

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
and 170 ohms so I reckon there in a

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.140 
and 170 ohms so I reckon there in a
store<00:04:46.229> in<00:04:46.260> a<00:04:46.530> shop<00:04:46.830> they<00:04:47.130> run<00:04:47.669> all<00:04:47.940> the

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
store in a shop they run all the

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.850 
store in a shop they run all the
speakers<00:04:48.539> in<00:04:48.660> series<00:04:49.110> which<00:04:49.289> would<00:04:49.440> total<00:04:49.830> up

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
speakers in series which would total up

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.469 
speakers in series which would total up
to<00:04:50.070> like<00:04:50.400> something<00:04:50.639> like<00:04:50.820> under<00:04:51.060> 70<00:04:51.330> homes

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
to like something like under 70 homes

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.020 
to like something like under 70 homes
and<00:04:51.780> then<00:04:52.680> literally<00:04:52.979> that<00:04:53.099> the<00:04:53.130> amplifier<00:04:53.699> is

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
and then literally that the amplifier is

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.570 
and then literally that the amplifier is
then<00:04:54.300> just<00:04:54.539> very<00:04:55.289> very<00:04:55.530> this<00:04:55.889> is<00:04:56.070> running<00:04:56.430> them

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
then just very very this is running them

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.420 
then just very very this is running them
very<00:04:57.570> inefficient<00:04:58.440> inefficiently<00:04:59.099> if<00:04:59.310> you

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
very inefficient inefficiently if you

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.420 
very inefficient inefficiently if you
like<00:05:00.229> but<00:05:01.229> yeah<00:05:01.410> all<00:05:01.680> they<00:05:01.830> pile<00:05:02.099> them<00:05:02.370> all

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
like but yeah all they pile them all

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.560 
like but yeah all they pile them all
down<00:05:02.639> to<00:05:02.820> four<00:05:03.030> times<00:05:03.180> if<00:05:03.330> they're<00:05:03.419> doing

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
down to four times if they're doing

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.480 
down to four times if they're doing
series<00:05:03.870> power<00:05:04.080> lock<00:05:04.320> I<00:05:04.349> would<00:05:04.560> in<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.710> car<00:05:04.919> be

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
series power lock I would in the car be

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.400 
series power lock I would in the car be
a<00:05:05.520> little<00:05:05.820> mono<00:05:06.000> amplifier<00:05:06.120> and<00:05:06.720> once<00:05:07.020> the

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
a little mono amplifier and once the

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.719 
a little mono amplifier and once the
power<00:05:07.650> consumption<00:05:08.099> on<00:05:08.340> it<00:05:08.430> I've<00:05:08.550> actually

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
power consumption on it I've actually

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.550 
power consumption on it I've actually
looked<00:05:08.940> at<00:05:09.090> a<00:05:09.150> it<00:05:09.389> look<00:05:10.229> at<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.380> power

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
looked at a it look at the power

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:19.909 
looked at a it look at the power
consumption<00:05:11.570> well<00:05:12.570> is<00:05:17.240> 90<00:05:18.240> watts<00:05:18.419> max<00:05:18.919> 60

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
consumption well is 90 watts max 60

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.070 
consumption well is 90 watts max 60
watts<00:05:20.150> rated<00:05:21.150> so<00:05:21.419> not<00:05:21.720> going<00:05:21.930> to<00:05:21.990> be

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
watts rated so not going to be

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.839 
watts rated so not going to be
outputting<00:05:22.500> that<00:05:22.680> much<00:05:22.830> power<00:05:23.099> to<00:05:23.370> be<00:05:23.520> honest

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
outputting that much power to be honest

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.360 
outputting that much power to be honest
but<00:05:24.539> not<00:05:25.020> bad<00:05:25.199> it<00:05:25.349> won't<00:05:25.470> fly<00:05:25.770> anyway<00:05:26.039> might

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
but not bad it won't fly anyway might

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.830 
but not bad it won't fly anyway might
want<00:05:26.550> a<00:05:26.580> little<00:05:26.610> subwoofer<00:05:27.120> or<00:05:27.270> something<00:05:27.630> so

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
want a little subwoofer or something so

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.889 
want a little subwoofer or something so
we'll<00:05:27.990> see<00:05:28.139> how<00:05:28.199> that<00:05:28.289> that<00:05:28.680> does
