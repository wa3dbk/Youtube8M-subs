00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
thought it's a little naive was going

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.710 
thought it's a little naive was going
toe<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.519> toe<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:26.910> did<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.210> honest<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.480> didn't

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
toe to toe we did to be honest I didn't

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.599 
toe to toe we did to be honest I didn't
think<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:28.019> actually<00:00:28.320> were<00:00:28.890> there<00:00:29.189> yet<00:00:29.460> you

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
think we actually were there yet you

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.710 
think we actually were there yet you
know<00:00:29.670> we're<00:00:29.910> not<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.119> don't<00:00:30.300> think<00:00:30.449> my<00:00:30.510> Matt

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
know we're not I don't think my Matt

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.540 
know we're not I don't think my Matt
Sharkey<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> didn't<00:00:31.560> think<00:00:31.679> we<00:00:31.859> played<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
Sharkey and I didn't think we played the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.069 
Sharkey and I didn't think we played the
tackle<00:00:32.850> football<00:00:32.969> quite<00:00:33.390> well<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.719> season

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
tackle football quite well this season

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.080 
tackle football quite well this season
so<00:00:34.590> actually<00:00:35.040> seeing<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.340> face<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.640> gives

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
so actually seeing that face that gives

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.250 
so actually seeing that face that gives
me<00:00:36.210> loads<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.600> confidence<00:00:36.780> because<00:00:37.110> that's

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
me loads of confidence because that's

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.889 
me loads of confidence because that's
the<00:00:37.350> best<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.770> play<00:00:37.950> going<00:00:38.219> forwards<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.450> I

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
the best we play going forwards and I

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.840 
the best we play going forwards and I
told<00:00:40.110> Alexis<00:00:40.770> Sanchez<00:00:41.250> was<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> waste<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.730> money

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
told Alexis Sanchez was a waste of money

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:56.660 
told Alexis Sanchez was a waste of money
didn't<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:54.020> he<00:00:55.020> was<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> quiet<00:00:56.070> game<00:00:56.309> by<00:00:56.489> his

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670
