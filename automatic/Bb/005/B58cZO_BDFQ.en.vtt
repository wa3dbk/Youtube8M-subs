a direct flight let's start with the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.769 
a direct flight let's start with the
sides<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.250> Xperia<00:00:20.640> Z<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> tad<00:00:21.240> more<00:00:21.270> compact

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
sides the Xperia Z is a tad more compact

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.540 
sides the Xperia Z is a tad more compact
than<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.080> note<00:00:22.230> 3<00:00:22.470> but<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> few<00:00:23.100> grams<00:00:23.340> heavier

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
than the note 3 but a few grams heavier

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.429 
than the note 3 but a few grams heavier
as<00:00:23.880> well<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.750> despite<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.170> fact<00:00:25.350> that

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
as well and that despite the fact that

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.410 
as well and that despite the fact that
you<00:00:25.590> tax<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> smaller<00:00:26.369> 5-inch<00:00:26.910> screen<00:00:27.090> as

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
you tax the smaller 5-inch screen as

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.779 
you tax the smaller 5-inch screen as
opposed<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> large<00:00:28.470> 5.7<00:00:29.160> inch<00:00:29.189> one<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
opposed to the large 5.7 inch one on the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.759 
opposed to the large 5.7 inch one on the
galaxy<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.720> there's<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.019> lot<00:00:31.109> more<00:00:31.170> screen<00:00:31.590> and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
galaxy so there's a lot more screen and

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.290 
galaxy so there's a lot more screen and
less<00:00:31.920> bezel<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.489> front<00:00:32.700> face<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.149> note
