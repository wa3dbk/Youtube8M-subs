00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:11.579
 a6 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.579

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.519
 We're going to follow part of fitch I ignored t 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.310
 the good news comments for the book 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.569
 and the 60 best matches 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:26.179
 in this position 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:27.640
 When you saw me, he said 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.589
 why not take with pmdb 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.500
 the natural catch 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.000
 yesterday where der 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.559
 I did not explain d4 life resumed at 4 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.100
 then the taking of 4 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.120
 tonight 6 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.750
 after 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.240
 and it is not 5 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.600
 because of all the magic 6 rock study the 7 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.620
 16 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.060
 I just started digging 5 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.710
 yet turkey 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.989
 dramatic 2 dramaturgy 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.980
 we accept day 2 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.330
 6 5 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.430
 bush and that discovery by retrieving the short piece excellent position for the 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.860
 girls 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.630
 are in normal capture 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.630
 It's all of you. 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.210
 and here the measures have many alternatives 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.140
 all the variants I've made and even do the ones he thinks are 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.979
 doubtful 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.110
 in the book are pure are net anticipated 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.180
 'all too much player language will pay us more for the vines 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.170
 explain it there 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.170
 to actually start immediately from 4 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.660
 in this position 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.660
 cause - production thereof 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.760
 So it's good to play rock direct. 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.670
 Of course nowadays many plays and almost also but in the opinion of the boot 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.680
 exist 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.330
 these six 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.860
 various books that can be thrown economic crisis 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.760
 today are played for example 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.440
 these seven 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.090
 the mother 6 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.619
 so appealing 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.439
 says the g4 teak mansion today that only plays a lot 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.239
 but I would not be the main actor difficult 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:22.879
 d4 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.099
 here another accident played still today I take adequate 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:29.309
 and after digging the tomato 4 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:32.669
 if he does become famous from the end since he mentioned names 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:36.329
 couple of three 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:37.929
 playwright gave 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:40.739
 toritama gave 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.689
 the bishop of 6 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:45.619
 I rode to 5 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:47.649
 out of 5 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:50.649
 c4 here too 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:53.119
 it is said that g4 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.119
 it's been brilliant fun remember 3 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.439
 this place now 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.589
 taking advantage that it can not stay all the time of the bis 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:04.329
 due to the tumult 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:05.429
 this takes 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:08.419
 h2 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.210
 the white in the mouth 5 closing the day with the hand 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.870
 earn material happened to death this is the hyundai 9 havana - the key 7 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.339
 b5 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:22.699
 st c4 horse 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:25.179
 lane 3 5 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:27.719
 it turned out 34 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:31.419
 This is how I tell you Dodô attacker of 16 seen me 5 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:32.969
 this is c5 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:35.969
 and the performance of the organized parties would fall in a short time 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:38.699
 in this game 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:40.030
 elective audience 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.579
 pour rooms 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.279
 c3 than the variant 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:49.650
 suggested by the clitoris itself, or commit another part of that game 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.699
 from tomé 5 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:53.769
 contracted dengue fever 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.459
 in 1965 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.459
 in the following years main areas 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.620
 already in the main ideas the cross generates fixed analyzed changes 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:10.120
 the complete rules you will find in the www married there are three point 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.129
 with 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.129
 are many days but the most important is that they buy my CDs 

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:19.539
 bugging bug prints we were going to explain white to the faulty structure 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.549
 best of peons 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.180
 percent official source 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.809
 after the take and almost all 4 

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:29.809
 help restricted the bishops' game 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:33.430
 women do not 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.939
 took a top 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:39.240
 with biscuit men and 3 so high but believe in tomato 4 which is a lot 

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:43.590
 dangerous behind movement eg give toritama douglas and four distant 

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:44.559

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:46.580
 and points out solving the plants year 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.349
 very large 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:50.219
 your name is very dangerous for megas 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:52.740
 Followed owner of seven 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.159

 christian story 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.590
 - the roth is expected second 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.050
 I did and I am very important to define caravan edition acts 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.500
 according to him the best continuation now to win bishop agassi 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.330
 and that it would follow that the strokes 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.300
 oak is 5 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.949
 that was played the game 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.809
 gimenes and fischer 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:18.430
 but these investments 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.199
 this is all a 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.120
 Carol, all certainty 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.090
 resumed 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.639
 toritama 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.180
 with a slight advantage 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.779
 of white 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:34.129
 shortly after the coup to 6 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:37.409
 carol is a 3 dog 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.289
 this is stayed high here should if this is played the six 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.819
 but the public reacted with the horse st 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.110
 Tunisia 1 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.439
 horses day 6 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:55.740
 Clear 3 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.960
 discuss 6 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.430
 horse to 4 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.349
 was mandatory in region 8 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:09.779
 defend the c5 hunting that ended 60 months continues to maintain some pressure and c5 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.629
 muricy took hugo this takes 3 today allowing 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:18.939
 except on day 3 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.169
 and the horse will win the cause 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:23.539
 little cousin 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.539
 You now want 5 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:31.189
 you take from 5 

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:34.430
 since then the concave b6 check 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.740
 gibbs made seven 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.740
 also to 2 with the great advantage of white 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:42.999
 38 

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:44.339
 fourteen five 

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:48.699
 6 amadeus giving the 4 with the pressure in the holland very nice 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.289
 google and coritiba can forget about kombis seul 8 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:55.039
 cheer for them 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.789
 f8 horse 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:59.199
 very uncomfortable conclusion 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:02.729
 three more recent sets of domestic violence are tomé ceast 

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:06.710
 do not talk about taking six because of tortosa to be won 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.490
 and after seen more than three months explained the fixed game accurate to 5 

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:16.110
 if it takes 5 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.559
 I lie down 5 

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:19.159
 this takes 5 

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:22.009
 if you feel check 38 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:23.919
 taken to 3 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:26.490
 t4 horse taken 4 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.139
 give me the 7 

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:30.529
 fool 3/5 

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:32.619
 damascene 2 

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:35.279
 however the collected ones go where I go 

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:39.119
 I think I had this position, your fishermen even thought I was 

00:07:39.119 --> 00:07:41.379
 landed tournament against two horses 

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:44.379
 actually forest along with two tumblers 

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:48.159
 bearing in mind that the complete analysis of this 

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:50.339
 that the fights abandoned there 

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:53.339
 we are playing or not by chance the so-called dot com 

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:56.129
 who is interested in the wanted list
