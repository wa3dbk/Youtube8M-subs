00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.870
 the truth that he has received with much 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.800
 dear affection is true that so 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.219
 important things that we have 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.450
 finished important as to the rock 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.609
 what we have finished the seven lakes 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.010
 also what the tail means today 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.769
 in the vineyard sergeant dave efe here in 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.779
 Mendoza recently completed a work in 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.180
 the refinery of luján whose very 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.180
 important and today I was 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.490
 for example and pp has reached its maximum 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.820
 production in the last 34 years 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:44.110
 so we see mendoza chubut in the 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.490
 patagonia the whole country has grown evenly 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.930
 and some have had to do it to a 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.390
 more advanced pace because there were many 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.610
 asymmetries are still missing correct 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.840
 asymmetries but what is important that 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.500
 the public policies that have been 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.239
 launched a year 2003 have taken that to 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.700
 that said the other is a person in the 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.119
 Chaco a very popular man in the Chaco 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.070
 a worker who told me you know what 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.030
 I have to thank you in addition 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.060
 from Chaco, I have felt again 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.040
 Argentine and that's what I can best 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.560
 say every province to me that I am a 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.250
 woman of the deep country that not only 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.619
 he feels Argentine and they can not say 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.530
 Mendoza chubutense osa but cruceño 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.610
 that he has also felt again 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.729
 Argentinian to be Argentine when the 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.340
 another day in the streets I saw the 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.619
 people to accompany the saber corvo the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.460
 transfer of savo corvo de san martín 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.350
 since 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.909
 while from true to place 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.820
 historical when it had been bequeathed that 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.040
 it's the national historical museum there in 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.090
 Lezama park and saw thousands of gdp and 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.190
 the thousands of whistles with the disguise per se 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.479
 say it with a report from General San 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.790
 kingfisher who had handed out paka paka 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.649
 when we also rescue the san martín 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.990
 because many times they want us 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.960
 they want to sell to an old san martín 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.580
 in mocking summers there are writing the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.229
 maximum for his girls merceditas 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.560
 because they do not want to remember the real 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.420
 san martín to san martín who fought for 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.530
 independence to san martín that with 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.869
 just be against all 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.390
 predictions to san martín that said what 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.370
 important is to be free the rest is not 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.230
 it matters nothing of that san martín that us 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.940
 they want to hide I wanted the other day 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.100
 when we moved the san corvo saber 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.630
 martín to the place where corresponded together 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.260
 to the other great swords of the fatherland 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.790
 he saw 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.290
 belgrano or delivered saber roses to which 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.060
 san martín had bequeathed roses 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.010
 also and have been hidden 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.350
 neatly by historiography 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.630
 liberal so they did not know that san 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.590
 martín considered roses a patriot 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.680
 because it's still in writing history 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.090
 when you see that you feel that then 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.340
 the symbols of the country are no longer 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.159
 symbols to become flesh of 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.379
 each one of us the truth that now 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.019
 I say San Martin was one of the things 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.659
 most emotional that I have lived in my life and 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:02.050
 to be able to touch the blade of his saber is good 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:05.500
 a unique and non-transferable experience 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.970
 It is better so maybe 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.480
 with a dozen not too much 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.480
 thank you very much thank you
