I bought this recently from a website
called<00:00:13.710> femme<00:00:14.040> fatale<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:15.049> basically<00:00:16.049> it's

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
specially made for nail art so it

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.480 
specially made for nail art so it
doesn't<00:00:18.990> smudge<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.439> our<00:00:19.619> lap<00:00:19.830> when<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.189> apply

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
it it's quite quite a thick consistency

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.330 
it it's quite quite a thick consistency
and<00:00:24.240> when<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.869> when<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.320> brush<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.220> it

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
and when you when you brush it on and it

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.000 
and when you when you brush it on and it
doesn't<00:00:26.789> smudge<00:00:27.000> you're<00:00:27.570> now<00:00:27.750> up<00:00:27.960> at<00:00:28.140> all<00:00:28.289> but

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
doesn't smudge you're now up at all but

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.769 
doesn't smudge you're now up at all but
I<00:00:29.039> did<00:00:29.340> find<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.240> took<00:00:30.480> quite<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.689> long

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
I did find that it took quite a long

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.690 
I did find that it took quite a long
time<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.260> dry<00:00:31.410> although<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:32.009> doesn't<00:00:32.189> claim<00:00:32.489> to

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
time to dry although it doesn't claim to

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.360 
time to dry although it doesn't claim to
be<00:00:32.820> fast<00:00:33.510> drying<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.010> really<00:00:35.219> good

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
be fast drying so it's a really good

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.720 
manicure not chip for a really long time
I've<00:00:58.109> found<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.530> very<00:00:58.559> useful<00:00:58.739> over<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> glitter

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
I've found it very useful over a glitter

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.029 
I've found it very useful over a glitter
nail<00:00:59.820> polish<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:01.020> often<00:01:01.500> use<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:02.010> a

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
nail polish so I often use this as a

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.280 
nail polish so I often use this as a
base<00:01:02.250> coat<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.850> over<00:01:03.510> glitter<00:01:03.780> polishes

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
base coat and over glitter polishes

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.010 
base coat and over glitter polishes
because<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.830> quite<00:01:05.100> thick<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:06.600> open<00:01:06.960> it

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
because it's quite thick I just open it

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.770 
because it's quite thick I just open it
up<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.970> it's<00:01:08.970> really<00:01:09.240> quite<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> thick

formula and it smooths out all the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.270 
formula and it smooths out all the
glitter<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:13.049> found<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> base<00:01:13.740> coat<00:01:14.130> it

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
so not all the way through and it's a

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.569 
so not all the way through and it's a
reasonably<00:02:03.000> thin<00:02:03.799> formula<00:02:04.799> compared<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
reasonably thin formula compared to the

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.490 
unbiased opinion Sally Hansen double
duty<00:04:16.519> is<00:04:16.700> another<00:04:17.060> good<00:04:17.359> one<00:04:17.479> I'd<00:04:17.840> compare<00:04:18.440> it

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
duty is another good one I'd compare it

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.640 
duty is another good one I'd compare it
to<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.739> Cutex<00:04:19.220> one<00:04:19.489> so<00:04:20.239> these<00:04:20.660> two<00:04:21.049> are<00:04:21.380> really

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
to the Cutex one so these two are really

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.980 
to the Cutex one so these two are really
quite<00:04:21.919> similar<00:04:22.190> except<00:04:22.910> that<00:04:23.000> this<00:04:23.330> double

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
quite similar except that this double

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.110 
quite similar except that this double
duty<00:04:24.260> one<00:04:24.380> is<00:04:24.500> also

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
duty one is also

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.540

good<00:04:25.510> as<00:04:25.630> a<00:04:25.660> basecoat<00:04:25.870> so<00:04:26.830> you<00:04:26.889> can<00:04:27.190> use<00:04:27.340> it<00:04:27.460> as

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
good as a basecoat so you can use it as

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.150
