was playing for each other and making it
each<00:02:03.710> person<00:02:04.100> better<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:04.790> every<00:02:04.970> time<00:02:05.150> he

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
each person better and every time he

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.910 
each person better and every time he
touched<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.600> ball<00:02:05.810> whether<00:02:06.799> it<00:02:06.890> was

want to improve

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.380 
want to improve
I<00:02:10.500> think<00:02:11.220> there's<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.490> lot<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.700> factors<00:02:12.210> that<00:02:12.240> go

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
I think there's a lot of factors that go

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.540 
I think there's a lot of factors that go
into<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.840> but<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:15.720> saw<00:02:16.470> some<00:02:16.740> quality<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.400> you

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
into it but I saw some quality in you

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.660 
into it but I saw some quality in you
and<00:02:18.510> I'm<00:02:18.870> really<00:02:19.350> serious<00:02:19.950> about<00:02:20.100> this<00:02:20.400> but<00:02:20.640> I

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
and I'm really serious about this but I

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.450 
and I'm really serious about this but I
saw<00:02:21.120> quality<00:02:21.660> in<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.560> that's<00:02:23.010> really

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
saw quality in you that that's really

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.910 
saw quality in you that that's really
unique<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.300> think<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.870> need<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.320> know<00:02:25.770> it

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
unique and I think you need to know it

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.630 
unique and I think you need to know it
in<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.640> story<00:02:28.070> besides<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.250> weird<00:02:29.460> qualities

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
in the story besides the weird qualities

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.360 
in the story besides the weird qualities
which<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.790> tells<00:02:33.060> on<00:02:33.270> those<00:02:33.450> stories<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:34.080> them

different<00:03:09.000> people<00:03:10.460> operate<00:03:11.460> it's<00:03:12.030> a

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
different people operate it's a

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.300 
different people operate it's a
different<00:03:12.300> types<00:03:13.020> of<00:03:13.170> music<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.650> guess<00:03:13.860> I

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
different types of music I guess I

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.870 
different types of music I guess I
didn't<00:03:15.110> go<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.140> different<00:03:16.500> beats<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.580> think

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
didn't go to different beats and I think

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.090 
didn't go to different beats and I think
it's<00:03:18.000> just<00:03:18.060> trying<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.630> find<00:03:18.870> that<00:03:19.230> in<00:03:19.920> each

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
it's just trying to find that in each

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.030 
it's just trying to find that in each
person<00:03:20.989> because<00:03:21.989> how<00:03:22.170> I<00:03:22.200> operate<00:03:22.500> is<00:03:23.780> great<00:03:25.040> hi
