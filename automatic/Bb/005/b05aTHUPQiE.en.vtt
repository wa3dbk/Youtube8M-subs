00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
kind of stuff and the idea here is

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.969 
kind of stuff and the idea here is
hitting<00:03:29.879> up<00:03:30.000> two<00:03:30.180> times<00:03:30.500> then<00:03:31.500> plays<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.859> two

hitting up two times then plays the two
notes<00:03:32.190> below<00:03:32.579> it<00:03:32.729> in<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:32.940> scale<00:03:33.120> that's

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
notes below it in the scale that's

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.349 
notes below it in the scale that's
basically<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.549> lick<00:03:35.549> starts<00:03:35.879> on<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.060> twelfth

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
basically it lick starts on the twelfth

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.030 
basically it lick starts on the twelfth
fret<00:03:36.419> on<00:03:36.629> the<00:03:36.690> g<00:03:36.930> string<00:03:36.959> so<00:03:37.470> use<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.739> perfect
