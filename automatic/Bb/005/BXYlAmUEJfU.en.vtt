00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:12.210
 I welcome you and today we will find out 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:15.510
 how can we change the look of our 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:21.770
 buildings for this we learn how to change 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:27.529
 color and texture of building objects begin 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:31.739
 our lessons on the wall color example 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:36.600
 I took the first floor of our building which 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:39.840
 we created in previous lessons and in his 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.649
 example today we change the color and 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.109
 texture of this object to change 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.809
 textures and colors 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:54.480
 we need to go to mode 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:56.190
 construct and select that object in 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.019
 our case it will be on that wall on 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.960
 which we will change 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:07.170
 First , choose the color of the wall 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.400
 double-clicking the left mouse button and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.910
 breakable menus 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.680
 change the color for this click on 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.080
 arrow from on this and choose 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.430
 we need the color well, for example, let 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:28.100
 it will be green to color 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.770
 displayed in the demo window need 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.040
 To change the data 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:40.140
 texture properties for this you need 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:45.050
 mix their texture color and selected 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:50.220
 colors by clicking on this inscription 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:53.750
 we all turned on mixing at 6 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.750
 put on a green 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.150
 if you turn off the texture then we 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.860
 will be displayed 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.470
 exactly the color we chose 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:13.870
 Well , let's see how it will be 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.870
 look at our house go over mode 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:27.700
 view look here is our wall 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:30.260
 it turned out bright green now 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.440
 next step we will master change 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.130
 textures for this again go to 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:44.990
 design mode choose our 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:48.650
 I am in the wall next door and in the same menu 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.130
 change choose our favorite 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.130
 texture 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.910
 either this tab select from 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.830
 listed textures moving them 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:07.720
 arrow down you can immediately view 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:10.780
 how they will look and add it 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.970
 pressed flour 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.930
 See how it will look like this 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.810
 such a brick size texture yes you 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.830
 you can see it does not correspond to 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:30.140
 real scale and want him to 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:31.970
 looked more believable for that in 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:37.430
 wall settings in mode 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:39.640
 constructing we need to change it 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.160
 scale 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.530
 it's all done by the change tool 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:51.290
 textures and clamped arrow and here 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:53.540
 select the item of the texture value and here 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.799
 changing the value of the texture varying the width and 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.070
 height or natural value can 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.690
 choose and see how it all 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.550
 looks like 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.460
 all these actions are chosen in a way 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:11.810
 cork there and mistakes you pick one 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:16.750
 the size you need but we 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:23.090
 now change in manually i will choose here 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:31.100
 half width and height again 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:34.640
 width 05 height apply and see what 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:40.720
 we got a view mode here 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:45.590
 more like a real look 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:50.510
 the next thing we can do is 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:53.330
 there are such moments when there is no 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:58.730
 we need textures in 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:02.290
 standard set we want together 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:07.520
 another kind of wall is allowed for this 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:13.760
 use the train texture in the tab 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:15.940
 menu and look for the texture that we 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.940
 needed 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.479
 using 0 and the resources that have 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:35.400
 we can game you can upload your 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:38.330
 some pictures and use them 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.330
 texture quality 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:56.240
 I will not look for long take the first 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:06:03.080
 got here this headlight bmp usually 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:08.690
 and cree open it here it turned out 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:14.510
 This texture will apply to us and see 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:19.400
 what have we got here as a result 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:22.340
 This kind of interesting all on this our 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:28.630
 lesson over thanks for your attention 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.630
 ask questions until we meet again
