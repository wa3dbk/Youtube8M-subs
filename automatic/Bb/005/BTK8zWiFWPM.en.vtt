00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
thing I do like about the clacking rap

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.030 
thing I do like about the clacking rap
is<00:02:21.000> it's<00:02:21.239> got<00:02:21.739> kind<00:02:22.739> of<00:02:22.829> like<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:23.239> clear<00:02:24.239> coating

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
is it's got kind of like a clear coating

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.990 
is it's got kind of like a clear coating
and<00:02:27.230> or<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> clear<00:02:28.799> plastic<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.609> guess<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.880> would

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
and or a clear plastic I guess you would

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.620 
and or a clear plastic I guess you would
say<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.630> that's<00:02:31.560> underneath<00:02:32.519> that<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.329> where

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
say and that's underneath that is where

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.620 
say and that's underneath that is where
the<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:37.320> shiny<00:02:37.650> element<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:39.480> could

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
the the shiny element is so it could

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.590 
the the shiny element is so it could
take<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> beating<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.620> still<00:02:41.930> keep<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.079> shine

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
take a beating and still keep it shine

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.910
