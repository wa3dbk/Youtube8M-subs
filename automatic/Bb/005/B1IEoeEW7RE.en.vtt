00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:15.380 

you

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:15.390 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.040 

William<00:00:16.390> you<00:00:16.510> know<00:00:16.600> I<00:00:16.630> think<00:00:16.779> we're<00:00:17.020> all

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
William you know I think we're all

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.929 
William you know I think we're all
looking<00:00:17.170> for<00:00:17.590> easy<00:00:17.800> projects<00:00:18.369> for<00:00:18.520> the<00:00:18.610> garden

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
looking for easy projects for the garden

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.370 
looking for easy projects for the garden
and<00:00:19.060> I<00:00:19.119> think<00:00:19.330> this<00:00:19.480> trellis<00:00:19.689> would<00:00:19.990> be<00:00:20.110> one<00:00:20.260> of

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
and I think this trellis would be one of

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.019 
and I think this trellis would be one of
them<00:00:20.590> and<00:00:20.860> you<00:00:21.130> know<00:00:21.250> the<00:00:21.490> big<00:00:21.699> thing<00:00:21.730> in

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
them and you know the big thing in

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.700 
them and you know the big thing in
gardening<00:00:22.360> now<00:00:22.509> is<00:00:22.689> structures<00:00:23.169> and<00:00:23.439> this<00:00:23.529> is

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
gardening now is structures and this is

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.230 
gardening now is structures and this is
a<00:00:23.740> great<00:00:24.039> looking<00:00:24.430> structure<00:00:24.880> that's<00:00:25.029> really

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
a great looking structure that's really

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.179 
a great looking structure that's really
very<00:00:25.480> simple<00:00:25.869> to<00:00:25.960> do<00:00:26.079> I<00:00:26.349> don't<00:00:26.680> think<00:00:26.950> it's<00:00:27.099> a

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
very simple to do I don't think it's a

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.130 
very simple to do I don't think it's a
one<00:00:27.460> weekend<00:00:27.970> monitor<00:00:28.450> but<00:00:28.660> maybe<00:00:28.840> if<00:00:29.020> you're

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
one weekend monitor but maybe if you're

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.779 
one weekend monitor but maybe if you're
more<00:00:29.320> organized<00:00:29.829> you<00:00:29.949> can<00:00:30.009> get<00:00:30.220> the<00:00:30.340> wood<00:00:30.550> cut

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
more organized you can get the wood cut

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.000 
more organized you can get the wood cut
ahead<00:00:31.029> of<00:00:31.180> time<00:00:31.360> and<00:00:31.689> then<00:00:32.259> the<00:00:32.439> cement<00:00:32.829> would

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
ahead of time and then the cement would

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.500 
ahead of time and then the cement would
just<00:00:33.160> take<00:00:33.280> a<00:00:33.309> little<00:00:33.399> bit<00:00:33.640> longer<00:00:33.790> it's<00:00:34.270> true

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
just take a little bit longer it's true

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.970 
just take a little bit longer it's true
so<00:00:34.719> why<00:00:34.899> don't<00:00:35.410> we<00:00:35.440> get<00:00:35.559> started

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
so why don't we get started

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.450 
so why don't we get started
all<00:00:36.070> right<00:00:37.559> William<00:00:38.559> I<00:00:38.649> think<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:38.950> best<00:00:39.190> thing

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
all right William I think the best thing

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.310 
all right William I think the best thing
to<00:00:39.489> do<00:00:39.700> first<00:00:40.030> is<00:00:40.360> to<00:00:40.719> make<00:00:40.750> sure<00:00:40.870> where<00:00:41.200> your

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
to do first is to make sure where your

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.780 
to do first is to make sure where your
property<00:00:41.680> line<00:00:41.860> is<00:00:41.890> where<00:00:42.309> you're<00:00:42.430> gonna<00:00:42.550> set

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
property line is where you're gonna set

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.639 
property line is where you're gonna set
up<00:00:42.879> this<00:00:43.059> trellis<00:00:43.300> and<00:00:43.870> then<00:00:44.140> you<00:00:44.200> also<00:00:44.379> want

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
up this trellis and then you also want

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.049 
up this trellis and then you also want
to<00:00:44.739> call<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:45.010> utilities<00:00:45.460> company<00:00:45.879> or<00:00:45.969> the

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
to call the utilities company or the

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:47.370 
to call the utilities company or the
city<00:00:46.300> to<00:00:46.450> make<00:00:46.600> sure<00:00:46.780> that<00:00:46.960> you're<00:00:47.110> not<00:00:47.230> gonna

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
city to make sure that you're not gonna

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.890 
city to make sure that you're not gonna
be<00:00:47.590> worrisome<00:00:48.370> with<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.760> utilities<00:00:49.270> and<00:00:49.690> then

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
be worrisome with the utilities and then

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.880 
be worrisome with the utilities and then
you<00:00:49.990> know<00:00:50.079> you<00:00:50.170> can<00:00:50.290> always<00:00:50.410> use<00:00:50.620> those<00:00:50.740> little

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
you know you can always use those little

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.170 
you know you can always use those little
landscape<00:00:51.370> flags<00:00:51.670> when<00:00:51.880> you're<00:00:52.000> doing<00:00:52.150> your

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
landscape flags when you're doing your

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.580 
landscape flags when you're doing your
measuring<00:00:52.690> you<00:00:52.780> measure<00:00:52.989> out<00:00:53.170> where<00:00:53.320> you<00:00:53.410> want

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
measuring you measure out where you want

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.780 
measuring you measure out where you want
to<00:00:53.650> put<00:00:53.800> them<00:00:53.890> stick<00:00:54.160> one<00:00:54.280> of<00:00:54.370> those<00:00:54.489> there<00:00:54.760> and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
to put them stick one of those there and

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:55.710 
to put them stick one of those there and
then<00:00:55.060> you<00:00:55.150> know<00:00:55.180> where<00:00:55.329> you<00:00:55.420> dig<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.690> hole

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
then you know where you dig the hole

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.140 
then you know where you dig the hole
that<00:00:55.989> and<00:00:56.590> then<00:00:57.370> next<00:00:57.520> we're<00:00:57.730> gonna<00:00:57.790> want<00:00:58.060> to

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
that and then next we're gonna want to

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.700 
that and then next we're gonna want to
dig<00:00:58.300> a<00:00:58.329> hole<00:00:58.450> and<00:00:58.900> we're<00:00:58.989> gonna<00:00:59.110> probably<00:00:59.380> dig

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
dig a hole and we're gonna probably dig

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.090 
dig a hole and we're gonna probably dig
it<00:00:59.800> at<00:00:59.920> least<00:01:00.070> 18<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:01.030> 24<00:01:01.510> inches<00:01:01.989> per<00:01:02.470> post

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
it at least 18 to 24 inches per post

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.340 
it at least 18 to 24 inches per post
we'll<00:01:03.489> use<00:01:03.520> a<00:01:03.700> 10<00:01:04.059> foot<00:01:04.299> post<00:01:04.659> there<00:01:04.930> are<00:01:04.989> 4<00:01:05.199> by

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
we'll use a 10 foot post there are 4 by

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.730 
we'll use a 10 foot post there are 4 by
4<00:01:05.590> treated<00:01:06.009> wood<00:01:06.220> and<00:01:06.549> when<00:01:07.000> we<00:01:07.329> mixed<00:01:07.750> up<00:01:07.869> one

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
4 treated wood and when we mixed up one

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.319 
4 treated wood and when we mixed up one
bag<00:01:08.920> of<00:01:09.100> concrete<00:01:09.280> it's<00:01:09.640> about<00:01:09.759> a<00:01:09.820> 60<00:01:10.119> pound

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
bag of concrete it's about a 60 pound

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:12.240 
bag of concrete it's about a 60 pound
bag<00:01:10.600> per<00:01:10.960> hole<00:01:11.229> so<00:01:11.530> it's<00:01:11.649> really<00:01:11.799> gonna<00:01:12.040> hold

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
bag per hole so it's really gonna hold

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.080 
bag per hole so it's really gonna hold
it<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:14.159> remember<00:01:15.159> it's<00:01:15.280> very<00:01:15.369> important<00:01:16.030> to

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
it and remember it's very important to

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.429 
it and remember it's very important to
make<00:01:16.270> sure<00:01:16.299> that<00:01:16.479> your<00:01:16.719> poles<00:01:16.990> are<00:01:17.170> level

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
make sure that your poles are level

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.050 
make sure that your poles are level
because<00:01:17.619> once<00:01:17.799> the<00:01:17.920> concrete<00:01:18.340> said<00:01:18.579> they're

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
because once the concrete said they're

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.580 
because once the concrete said they're
gonna<00:01:19.150> stay<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.510> way<00:01:19.630> they<00:01:19.780> are<00:01:19.930> so<00:01:20.229> use<00:01:20.440> your

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
gonna stay the way they are so use your

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.260 
gonna stay the way they are so use your
level<00:01:20.770> on<00:01:20.950> all<00:01:20.979> four<00:01:21.400> sides<00:01:21.430> make<00:01:22.120> sure

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
level on all four sides make sure

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.740 
level on all four sides make sure
they're<00:01:22.420> very<00:01:22.690> very<00:01:22.870> straight<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:25.450> you<00:01:25.540> can

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
they're very very straight as you can

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.960 
they're very very straight as you can
see<00:01:25.960> we<00:01:26.200> pre-cut<00:01:26.500> a<00:01:26.770> lot<00:01:27.010> of<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.190> pieces<00:01:27.729> this

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
see we pre-cut a lot of the pieces this

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.880 
see we pre-cut a lot of the pieces this
is<00:01:28.030> a<00:01:28.180> 1<00:01:28.540> foot<00:01:28.810> piece<00:01:29.080> is<00:01:29.260> going<00:01:29.409> to<00:01:29.470> be<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.710> end

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
is a 1 foot piece is going to be the end

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.010 
is a 1 foot piece is going to be the end
piece<00:01:30.159> and<00:01:30.460> then<00:01:30.940> these<00:01:31.060> are<00:01:31.119> going<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.540> be<00:01:31.780> 2

Judy and I are now putting up the long
decorative<00:02:21.730> pieces<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.240> will<00:02:22.330> support<00:02:22.540> the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
decorative pieces that will support the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.210 
decorative pieces that will support the
top<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.110> Arbor<00:02:23.440> all<00:02:23.709> we're<00:02:23.920> doing<00:02:24.130> is

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
top of the Arbor all we're doing is

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.430 
top of the Arbor all we're doing is
nailing<00:02:24.550> them<00:02:24.670> directly<00:02:25.030> into<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.540> 2x4<00:02:26.140> one

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
nailing them directly into the 2x4 one

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.230 
nailing them directly into the 2x4 one
foot<00:02:26.709> pieces<00:02:26.980> that<00:02:27.310> we<00:02:27.400> put<00:02:27.640> onto<00:02:27.790> our<00:02:28.000> 4x4

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
foot pieces that we put onto our 4x4

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.320 
foot pieces that we put onto our 4x4
posts<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.040> last<00:02:33.280> step<00:02:33.580> is<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.820> put<00:02:34.000> in

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
posts so the last step is to put in

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.720 
posts so the last step is to put in
these<00:02:34.480> 2x2<00:02:34.959> foot<00:02:35.739> pieces<00:02:36.010> there<00:02:36.340> are<00:02:36.370> one<00:02:36.550> by

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
these 2x2 foot pieces there are one by

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.910 
these 2x2 foot pieces there are one by
one<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.209> we<00:02:37.660> measured<00:02:38.110> out<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.470> six<00:02:38.709> foot

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
one and we measured out the six foot

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.340 
one and we measured out the six foot
span<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.670> we<00:02:39.760> equally<00:02:40.330> divided<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.110> they

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
span and we equally divided so that they

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.290 
span and we equally divided so that they
measure<00:02:41.590> out<00:02:41.800> equally<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.520> then<00:02:43.120> we're<00:02:43.209> gonna

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
measure out equally and then we're gonna

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.990 
measure out equally and then we're gonna
nail<00:02:43.540> them<00:02:43.720> in<00:02:43.870> here<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.110> go<00:02:44.200> William<00:02:48.000> William

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
nail them in here you go William William

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.250 
nail them in here you go William William
I<00:02:49.120> think<00:02:49.300> we<00:02:49.390> did<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.570> great<00:02:49.780> job<00:02:49.810> with<00:02:50.140> this

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
I think we did a great job with this

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.960 
I think we did a great job with this
trellis<00:02:50.500> Judy<00:02:50.920> were<00:02:51.010> like<00:02:51.160> architects<00:02:51.700> of<00:02:51.790> old

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
trellis Judy were like architects of old

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.030 
trellis Judy were like architects of old
I<00:02:52.150> agree<00:02:52.360> with<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.630> however<00:02:52.870> we<00:02:53.380> did<00:02:53.530> cut<00:02:53.739> 10

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
I agree with you however we did cut 10

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.890 
I agree with you however we did cut 10
pieces<00:02:54.310> originally<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.030> go<00:02:55.120> on<00:02:55.270> top<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.540> once

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
pieces originally to go on top and once

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.120 
pieces originally to go on top and once
we<00:02:56.050> got<00:02:56.200> them<00:02:56.380> up<00:02:56.500> there<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:56.770> measured<00:02:57.010> out

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
we got them up there and measured out

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.800 
we got them up there and measured out
they<00:02:57.280> just<00:02:57.489> didn't<00:02:57.700> quite<00:02:57.940> look<00:02:58.239> right<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:58.510> we

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
they just didn't quite look right so we

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.600 
they just didn't quite look right so we
opted<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.140> go<00:02:59.290> with<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.530> nine<00:02:59.739> and<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.400> think

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
opted to go with the nine and I think

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.920 
opted to go with the nine and I think
this<00:03:00.760> kind<00:03:00.910> of<00:03:01.030> trellis<00:03:01.270> we<00:03:01.480> can<00:03:01.600> do<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.720> lot<00:03:01.900> of

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
this kind of trellis we can do a lot of

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.600 
this kind of trellis we can do a lot of
different<00:03:02.350> things<00:03:02.530> we<00:03:02.830> can<00:03:02.950> grow<00:03:03.070> a<00:03:03.100> vine<00:03:03.400> up

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
different things we can grow a vine up
