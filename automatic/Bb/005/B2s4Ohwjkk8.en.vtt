 Hello everyone, Sitges is pleased to announce 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.200
 you good news, we expand the base 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.210
 video tutorials in addition to a number of new 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.940
 series dedicated to visual effects 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.740
 This is the whole collections named and fix pack 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.630
 which in itself will contain great 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.760
 base of lessons dedicated to a certain 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.010
 topics and specific programs 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.590
 such as 3d studio max realflow 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.330
 and houdini example on the queue will be 3d 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.310
 max with three collections 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.130
 dedicated to making fire and smoke 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.929
 destruction and simulations of fluid in 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.030
 the total is tens of the number of material 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.980
 in the language you understand from the correct 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.540
 technique and addition it will allow 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.430
 as efficiently as possible and for a small 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.350
 time will master a large number 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.000
 information and remember quite extensive 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.739
 amount of data on selected topics 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.600
 the pre-order starts today 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.370
 on the collection of all the reactions of fire and smoke 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.289
 through movie plugins fix them 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.090
 phoenix and where is he like each of 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.730
 subsequent collections includes self 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.620
 lessons of different degrees of difficulty are lessons 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.820
 for beginners allowing details 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.879
 describe the principles and tools 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.949
 used plugins they will suit people 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.439
 not having enough knowledge about them 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.030
 the next group of lessons is broken by 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.220
 sections of the scene that we will 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.950
 create from scratch studying creating that 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.689
 or other effect this series of scenes by 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.520
 simulations of different types of explosions with 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.650
 use of objects or particles 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.750
 this and the creation of a variety of flue 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.790
 effects including large-scale simulation 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.770
 volcanoes and dynamic dust from under the wheels 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.939
 car and of course where do without 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.130
 atmospheric effects 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.960
 that we learn to create whirlwinds of different 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.600
 sizes and types are beautiful realistic 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.490
 clouds awesome dust storms and 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.450
 snowy 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.700
 look at them you can not just 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.650
 repeat the same scenes but create 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.690
 using your simulations 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.700
 knowledge and there are also nice bonuses for 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.890
 Those interested in compass tuning 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.240
 render render and build later 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.310
 passed stand viewed 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.840
 final series of lessons here you 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.910
 can find available material for 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.800
 recurrence cost purchase condition 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.990
