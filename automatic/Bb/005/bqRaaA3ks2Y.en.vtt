00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.900
 hello on this occasion I will show you the step 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.139
 a step from a braid in the form of s 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.410
 I hope you like it, let's start 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.650
 taking a section which I divide into 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.380
 three and I continue weaving a braid of 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.619
 three ends like this 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.560
 as one of the directed sections 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.079
 towards the center below while I go 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.750
 weaving I'm going to increase a section of 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:36.960
 hair on one side of the braid 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.350
 I continue weaving and increasing hair 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.320
 up on only five occasions while 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.200
 I'm knitting remember what you can do 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.559
 a normal or inverted braid for this 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.230
 hairstyle is not much the difference anymore 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.720
 taken the five sections even though you 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.440
 You can increase more hair if you 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.780
 like you see here and no 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.690
 I will increase more hair just follow 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.180
 weaving the three-strand braid already without 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.720
 increase heading towards the other 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.180
 side 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.430
 taking as reference the iris of your 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.520
 eye for weaving to continue 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.550
 adding increase to the press notes 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.520
 that here you continue a little below 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.630
 where it started 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.390
 and let's add adding up in solo 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.259
 five times to our braid three 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.360
 cabos remember that before or during the 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.270
 hairstyle do not forget to go brushing the 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.810
 hair back so do not go 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.380
 sideways or you can go helping 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.020
 of some spray if you want it already 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.899
 taken the five sections I will follow 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.979
 weaving the three-strand braid already without 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.989
 increase going to the other side 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.049
 notes that this side will continue 

00:01:55.989 --> 00:02:01.989
 below taking as reference the 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.850
 Starting the braid or taking a line 

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:08.179
 imaginary that goes from the iris of the eye 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.729
 and you have knitted the braid 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.040
 undo it a bit and continue 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.160
 adding hair in only five 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.959
 sometimes remember that you can take as 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.360
 reference on the top of the 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.910
 braid to stop and continue with the 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.910
 increase of the braid 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.100
 from here on they will be the same 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.890
 only that here they will not take the 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.680
 sections that come from the head alone 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.740
 they will be taken from that same side or 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.370
 taking the back sections as well as 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:43.280
 you can observe you can see how it 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.590
 start to form a s as you go 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.090
 weaving the hair from side to side 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.680
 diagonally with this braid of 3 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.800
 increasing only five times 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.660
 hair to the braid 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.360
 remember that you can add more 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.390
 sections if you wish 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.750
 as last data as you can see the 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.230
 braid that goes from side to side without increase 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:12.989
 it's getting shorter little by little 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.989
 that is going to increase hair to these 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.310
 to finish this beautiful hairstyle ns 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.310

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.340
