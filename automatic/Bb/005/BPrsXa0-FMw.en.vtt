00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello my name is guÃ¨ye bouquet of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.710
 lime I am technical advisor to the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.090
 French federation of the mountain and 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.769
 of climbing today I 'm going to you 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.170
 explain how one can choose one's 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.440
 ice ax according to its usefulness 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.890
 so the ice axes they are made 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:23.070
 always with a blade in front of a 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.869
 hammer here or a breakdown like here 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.429
 to cut the steps in the snow 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:33.030
 of a handle is always a pike 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.880
 here to dive in the snow for the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.610
 summer classic mountain races 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.649
 there is a rather hiking ice ax 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.239
 while it looks a little like this 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.129
 puts a lot with a handle a lot 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.160
 longer is here that allows to 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.510
 serve as a sting the canes and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.000
 market as with a cane 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.180
 so here we are on a mountain ice ax 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.270
 rather light with a guard down to 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.329
 hold your hand so you can plant the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.030
 ice ax here at piau 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.320
 ice waterfalls or chute chute 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.840
 it's also ice climbing but 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.180
 sloping less steep than the waterfall 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.680
 of ice is so this ice ax y rather 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.860
 versatile for the mountain 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.009
 so we can also add a strap 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.320
 on that one a wrist strap that allows so 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.670
 never one makes a false manipulation of 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.090
 not lose the ice ax 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.490
 so we pass our hand in the wrist strap 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.049
 and that allows us to hold the ice ax and 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.780
 if ever we escape the ice ax 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.579
 he stays hanging around the hand if we have 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.250
 need to remove the strap one can 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.470
 take the clip here and we can take it off 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.020
 and at that moment we are free so there 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.360
 now a really cap ice ax 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.240
 of ice an ice ax with a curve 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.220
 really very marked and here the wrist 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.979
 because we are really hanging on 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.560
 arm this ice ax can put both 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.430
 hands but we can also change hands 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.759
 easily 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.469
 this is back on the ice ax and it 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.210
 it's a little ice ax that we 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.040
 rather call a rescue ax 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.900
 a third hand if ever 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.060
 has lost 1 to the ice ax in a race in 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.580
 mountain and that's it now you know 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.530
 that every ice ax has a utility 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.690
 privileged and it is necessary to choose 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.220
 store the ice ax that suits you in 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.220
 function of this or that race
