card<00:07:08.510> which<00:07:08.990> is<00:07:09.020> age<00:07:09.440> and<00:07:10.010> the<00:07:10.730> knockdown<00:07:11.000> book

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:11.600 
card which is age and the knockdown book

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.110 
card which is age and the knockdown book
that<00:07:12.050> martez<00:07:12.590> tends<00:07:13.490> to<00:07:14.080> suffer<00:07:15.080> from<00:07:15.260> if<00:07:16.120> he
