00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.140 
here and this one should land right on
top<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.800> flag<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.580> is<00:03:07.670> probably<00:03:07.940> the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
top of the flag and is probably the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:17.680 
top of the flag and is probably the
easiest<00:03:08.450> one<00:03:08.690> to<00:03:08.720> hit<00:03:08.930> for<00:03:09.140> C<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:16.580> last<00:03:17.570> but

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
easiest one to hit for C and last but

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.540 
easiest one to hit for C and last but
not<00:03:17.900> least<00:03:17.959> this<00:03:18.590> one<00:03:18.770> is<00:03:18.890> definitely<00:03:19.100> the

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
not least this one is definitely the

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.190 
not least this one is definitely the
hardest<00:03:19.730> one<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.060> hit<00:03:20.300> for<00:03:20.510> see<00:03:20.690> because

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
hardest one to hit for see because

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.290 
hardest one to hit for see because
depending<00:03:21.709> on<00:03:21.980> when<00:03:22.430> you<00:03:22.550> throw<00:03:22.880> it<00:03:23.000> when<00:03:23.180> you

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
depending on when you throw it when you

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.479 
depending on when you throw it when you
jump<00:03:23.630> it<00:03:23.870> male<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:24.620> bit<00:03:24.800> short<00:03:25.160> sometimes

jump it male and a bit short sometimes

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.540 
jump it male and a bit short sometimes
but<00:03:26.000> nevertheless<00:03:26.300> it's<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.870> spot<00:03:27.170> so<00:03:27.920> go<00:03:28.340> in

this building and then you may need to
practice<00:04:18.769> this<00:04:18.889> one<00:04:19.130> a<00:04:19.340> couple<00:04:19.579> times<00:04:19.940> but

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
practice this one a couple times but

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.430 
practice this one a couple times but
it's<00:04:20.329> definitely<00:04:20.509> a<00:04:20.750> great<00:04:20.989> one<00:04:21.169> once<00:04:21.349> you

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
it's definitely a great one once you

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.400 
it's definitely a great one once you
learn<00:04:21.620> how<00:04:21.680> to<00:04:21.769> do<00:04:21.979> it<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:26.690> moving<00:04:26.960> on<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.199> drop

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
learn how to do it so moving on to drop

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.110 
learn how to do it so moving on to drop

going<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.330> be<00:04:29.509> doing<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.900> first<00:04:30.139> one<00:04:30.410> by<00:04:30.979> going

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
going to be doing the first one by going

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.939 
going to be doing the first one by going
in<00:04:31.520> this<00:04:31.669> corner<00:04:32.000> off<00:04:32.210> on<00:04:32.389> this<00:04:32.570> hill<00:04:32.840> in<00:04:33.080> the

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
in this corner off on this hill in the

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.620 
in this corner off on this hill in the
front<00:04:34.160> of<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.280> map<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:34.669> look<00:04:35.120> right<00:04:35.330> over<00:04:35.360> the

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
front of the map and look right over the

front of the map and look right over the
drop<00:04:35.840> zone<00:04:35.870> jump<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:36.800> throw

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:46.569 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.129 

and<00:04:48.029> the<00:04:49.029> second<00:04:49.360> one<00:04:49.449> here<00:04:49.659> is<00:04:49.749> in<00:04:49.869> the<00:04:49.960> back

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
and the second one here is in the back

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.779 
and the second one here is in the back
of<00:04:50.289> the<00:04:50.349> map<00:04:50.559> I<00:04:50.710> think<00:04:50.919> we<00:04:51.009> use<00:04:51.159> this<00:04:51.339> spot<00:04:51.580> once

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
of the map I think we use this spot once

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.089 
of the map I think we use this spot once
before<00:04:52.149> for<00:04:52.210> be<00:04:52.539> Dom<00:04:52.749> but<00:04:53.349> this<00:04:53.409> time<00:04:53.830> just

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
before for be Dom but this time just

00:04:54.099 --> 00:05:04.159 
before for be Dom but this time just
look<00:04:54.309> right<00:04:54.490> over<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.849> drop<00:04:55.029> zone<00:04:55.059> obviously

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.899 

moving<00:05:05.169> to<00:05:05.319> the<00:05:05.439> second<00:05:05.830> drop<00:05:06.039> zone<00:05:06.309> here<00:05:06.669> just

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
moving to the second drop zone here just

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:08.040 
moving to the second drop zone here just
go<00:05:07.029> to<00:05:07.119> this<00:05:07.240> corner<00:05:07.539> in<00:05:07.659> the<00:05:07.749> middle<00:05:07.959> of<00:05:07.990> the

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
go to this corner in the middle of the

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:21.689 
go to this corner in the middle of the
map<00:05:08.289> to<00:05:08.469> the<00:05:08.559> first<00:05:08.800> one<00:05:19.289> and<00:05:20.490> for<00:05:21.490> the<00:05:21.550> next

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
map to the first one and for the next

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.279 
map to the first one and for the next
spot<00:05:21.969> just<00:05:22.240> go<00:05:22.389> over<00:05:22.509> to<00:05:22.659> this<00:05:22.809> corner<00:05:23.110> between

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
spot just go over to this corner between

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.109 
spot just go over to this corner between
the<00:05:23.589> struck<00:05:23.830> and<00:05:23.979> the<00:05:24.009> wall<00:05:24.279> and<00:05:24.520> this<00:05:24.969> is

00:05:25.109 --> 00:05:25.119 
the struck and the wall and this is

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:26.489 
the struck and the wall and this is
probably<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:25.479> easiest<00:05:25.539> one<00:05:26.020> to<00:05:26.050> hit<00:05:26.229> for<00:05:26.379> this

00:05:26.489 --> 00:05:26.499 
probably the easiest one to hit for this

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:37.379 
probably the easiest one to hit for this
drop<00:05:26.709> zone<00:05:35.520> for<00:05:36.520> these<00:05:36.639> last<00:05:36.819> couple<00:05:37.029> drop

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
drop zone for these last couple drop

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:39.119 
drop zone for these last couple drop
zones<00:05:37.659> I<00:05:37.809> could<00:05:37.959> really<00:05:38.259> only<00:05:38.379> find<00:05:38.680> one<00:05:38.769> for

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:39.129 
zones I could really only find one for
