rigging of the long line in order to

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.130 
rigging of the long line in order to
dial<00:00:24.250> it<00:00:24.430> down<00:00:24.460> and<00:00:25.090> get<00:00:25.360> that<00:00:25.540> rigging<00:00:25.900> time

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
dial it down and get that rigging time

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.410 
dial it down and get that rigging time
down<00:00:26.950> as<00:00:27.220> much<00:00:27.490> as<00:00:27.550> we<00:00:27.700> can<00:00:28.030> so<00:00:28.270> we<00:00:28.360> can

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
down as much as we can so we can

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.050 
down as much as we can so we can
maximize<00:00:29.050> our<00:00:29.200> walking<00:00:29.470> time<00:00:29.770> so<00:00:30.610> we<00:00:30.880> have<00:00:31.030> a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
maximize our walking time so we have a

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.439 
maximize our walking time so we have a
good<00:00:31.330> spot<00:00:31.660> here<00:00:31.960> with<00:00:32.200> a<00:00:32.230> nice<00:00:32.529> dip<00:00:33.239> right<00:00:34.239> now

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
good spot here with a nice dip right now

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.660 
good spot here with a nice dip right now

know<00:00:43.840> that<00:00:44.020> our<00:00:44.170> bag<00:00:44.350> is<00:00:44.739> properly<00:00:45.250> packed<00:00:45.610> and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
know that our bag is properly packed and

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.600 
know that our bag is properly packed and
the<00:00:47.230> first<00:00:47.530> thing<00:00:47.739> I<00:00:47.829> can<00:00:47.980> grab<00:00:48.160> out<00:00:48.340> of<00:00:48.460> here

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
the first thing I can grab out of here

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.220 
the first thing I can grab out of here
that's<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:48.910> first<00:00:49.180> thing<00:00:49.360> I<00:00:49.480> need<00:00:49.690> my<00:00:49.930> tree

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
that's the first thing I need my tree

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.220 
that's the first thing I need my tree
Pro<00:00:50.470> for<00:00:51.309> the<00:00:51.610> static<00:00:51.970> side<00:00:52.210> so<00:00:52.960> I'm<00:00:53.050> gonna

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
Pro for the static side so I'm gonna

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:04.200 
Pro for the static side so I'm gonna
break<00:00:53.380> that<00:00:53.559> up<00:01:00.809> necessary<00:01:01.809> items<00:01:03.210> protect

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
break that up necessary items protect

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:23.780 
break that up necessary items protect
your<00:01:04.360> trees

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.030 

now<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:24.850> next<00:01:25.210> thing<00:01:25.479> in<00:01:25.780> my<00:01:25.840> bag<00:01:25.960> is<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:26.770> span

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
now the next thing in my bag is the span

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:47.999 
now the next thing in my bag is the span
set<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.460> next<00:01:27.670> thing<00:01:27.820> I<00:01:27.939> need<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:46.860> once<00:01:47.860> again

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
set the next thing I need and once again

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.149 
set the next thing I need and once again
next<00:01:48.549> thing<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:49.360> webbing<00:01:49.690> which<00:01:50.500> already<00:01:50.770> has

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
next thing the webbing which already has

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.029 
next thing the webbing which already has
the<00:01:51.610> web<00:01:51.850> block<00:01:52.060> pre-installed<00:01:52.750> so<00:01:53.679> all<00:01:53.950> we

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
the web block pre-installed so all we

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.499 
the web block pre-installed so all we
got<00:01:54.190> to<00:01:54.220> do<00:01:54.780> unscrew<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.929> shackle<00:01:56.380> and

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
got to do unscrew the shackle and

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:05.520 
got to do unscrew the shackle and
install<00:01:58.509> it<00:01:58.600> on<00:01:58.720> our<00:01:58.750> span<00:01:59.049> say

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.609 

all<00:02:05.950> right<00:02:06.160> now<00:02:06.430> we<00:02:06.520> can<00:02:06.670> just<00:02:07.259> grab<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.440> rest

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
all right now we can just grab the rest

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.150 
all right now we can just grab the rest
of<00:02:08.800> our<00:02:08.920> stuff<00:02:10.890> grab<00:02:11.890> our<00:02:12.100> line

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
of our stuff grab our line

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.590 
of our stuff grab our line
walk<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.340> out<00:02:15.460> to<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.730> other<00:02:15.820> side<00:02:16.150> making

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
walk it out to the other side making

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.250 
walk it out to the other side making
sure<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:17.230> stays<00:02:17.530> flat<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.640> also<00:02:19.240> counting<00:02:20.140> our

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
sure it stays flat and also counting our

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.440 
sure it stays flat and also counting our
steps<00:02:20.590> like<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.700> techniques<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.270> we

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
steps like in the techniques that we

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.590 
steps like in the techniques that we
looked<00:02:22.930> at<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.140> few<00:02:23.470> weeks<00:02:23.650> ago<00:02:23.770> in<00:02:24.730> order<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:25.180> be

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
looked at a few weeks ago in order to be

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.170 
looked at a few weeks ago in order to be
able<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.959> measure<00:02:26.170> how<00:02:26.950> long<00:02:27.160> of<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.370> tensioning

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
able to measure how long of a tensioning

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:48.660 
able to measure how long of a tensioning
system<00:02:28.510> so<00:02:45.239> I<00:02:46.470> like<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.620> do<00:02:47.770> with<00:02:47.950> my<00:02:47.980> line<00:02:48.370> here

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
system so I like to do with my line here

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.050 
system so I like to do with my line here
laid<00:02:49.570> down<00:02:49.810> flat<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.530> then<00:02:51.000> find<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.090> stick<00:02:52.480> and

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
laid down flat and then find a stick and

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.710 
laid down flat and then find a stick and
kind<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.209> position<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.320> over<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.590> line<00:02:56.890> here

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
kind of position it over the line here

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.350 
kind of position it over the line here
so<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.959> it<00:02:59.080> doesn't<00:02:59.400> isn't<00:03:00.400> able<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:01.060> twist

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
so that it doesn't isn't able to twist

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.500 
so that it doesn't isn't able to twist
so<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:02.380> know<00:03:02.470> that<00:03:02.770> this<00:03:03.070> is<00:03:03.250> flat<00:03:03.520> and

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
so that I know that this is flat and

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.500 
so that I know that this is flat and
that<00:03:04.630> should<00:03:05.110> remain<00:03:05.380> there<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.850> once<00:03:07.209> again

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
that should remain there and once again

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.090 
that should remain there and once again
that<00:03:07.720> next<00:03:08.050> thing<00:03:08.230> we<00:03:08.350> need<00:03:08.530> is<00:03:08.770> right<00:03:09.040> there
