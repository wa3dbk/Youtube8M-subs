00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
to blend in so more bentonite here and

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.499 
to blend in so more bentonite here and
if<00:01:23.500> you<00:01:23.920> find<00:01:24.190> it<00:01:24.430> too<00:01:24.700> thick<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.240> can<00:01:25.420> always

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
if you find it too thick you can always

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.560 
if you find it too thick you can always
add<00:01:25.960> some<00:01:25.990> more<00:01:26.770> water<00:01:27.060> which<00:01:28.060> I<00:01:28.240> ended<00:01:28.360> up

the<00:01:35.440> consistency<00:01:36.340> that<00:01:37.270> I'm<00:01:37.479> looking<00:01:37.509> for

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
the consistency that I'm looking for

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.230 
the consistency that I'm looking for
which<00:01:38.890> is<00:01:39.160> like<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:40.270> know<00:01:40.330> yogurt<00:01:40.869> ikana

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
which is like you know yogurt ikana

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.190 
which is like you know yogurt ikana
consistency<00:01:43.240> so<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:45.220> guys<00:01:45.430> can<00:01:45.820> get<00:01:46.810> feel

consistency so you guys can get feel

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.120 
consistency so you guys can get feel
free<00:01:47.409> to<00:01:47.440> give<00:01:47.770> this<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.159> try<00:01:48.400> if<00:01:48.549> you<00:01:48.940> want<00:01:49.000> and

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
free to give this a try if you want and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.149 
free to give this a try if you want and
it's<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.490> whole<00:01:52.060> lot<00:01:52.090> lighter<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.680> reason<00:01:54.010> why

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
it's a whole lot lighter the reason why

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.930 
it's a whole lot lighter the reason why
I<00:01:54.190> did<00:01:54.549> that<00:01:54.580> was<00:01:55.150> because<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:56.350> thicker

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
I did that was because the thicker

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.789 
I did that was because the thicker
consistencies<00:01:57.940> to<00:01:58.360> me<00:01:58.510> do<00:01:58.750> not<00:01:58.960> seem<00:01:59.380> to<00:01:59.590> be

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
consistencies to me do not seem to be

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.359 
consistencies to me do not seem to be
all<00:02:00.760> that<00:02:00.820> necessary<00:02:01.590> once<00:02:02.590> you<00:02:02.860> get<00:02:03.159> to

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
all that necessary once you get to

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.870 
all that necessary once you get to
applying<00:02:03.820> it<00:02:04.150> to<00:02:04.440> all<00:02:05.440> your<00:02:05.920> hair<00:02:06.159> strands

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
applying it to all your hair strands

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.790 
applying it to all your hair strands
it<00:02:07.000> gets<00:02:07.330> pretty<00:02:07.630> heavy

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.430 

I<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:13.030> got<00:02:13.270> through<00:02:13.510> washing<00:02:14.370> here<00:02:16.440> I'm

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
I just got through washing here I'm

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.300 
I just got through washing here I'm
gonna<00:02:17.800> do<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.160> in<00:02:18.280> sections

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
gonna do it in sections

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.600 
gonna do it in sections
and<00:02:20.850> this<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.209> what<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.420> blended<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.610> to

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
and this is what I blended that to

00:02:23.610 --> 00:04:52.610 
and this is what I blended that to
yogurt<00:02:24.150> kind<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.900> consistency

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.350

okay so I'm done doing the bentonite

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.559 
okay so I'm done doing the bentonite
clay<00:04:55.630> treatment<00:04:56.530> and<00:04:56.860> as<00:04:57.310> you<00:04:57.430> can<00:04:57.610> see<00:04:57.910> it's

clay treatment and as you can see it's

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:05.570 
clay treatment and as you can see it's
all<00:04:58.750> rinsed<00:04:59.259> out<00:05:00.990> shrinkage<00:05:01.990> is<00:05:02.289> taking<00:05:02.770> over
