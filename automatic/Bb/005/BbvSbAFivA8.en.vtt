a lot of chip free bowls and things

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.550 
a lot of chip free bowls and things
which<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.909> in-form<00:02:40.209> is<00:02:40.389> also<00:02:40.719> bad<00:02:40.900> around<00:02:41.139> so

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
which the in-form is also bad around so

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.140 
which the in-form is also bad around so
why<00:02:41.739> ya<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.069> M<00:02:42.159> form<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.579> quite<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.819> bit<00:02:42.969> about<00:02:43.060> a

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
why ya the M form is quite a bit about a

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.580 
why ya the M form is quite a bit about a
cross<00:02:43.419> or<00:02:43.540> will<00:02:43.719> give<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.959> out<00:02:44.079> the<00:02:44.200> curve<00:02:44.439> and

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
cross or will give you out the curve and

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.679 
cross or will give you out the curve and
stuff<00:02:44.739> is<00:02:44.859> a<00:02:44.889> lot<00:02:44.980> better<00:02:45.099> and<00:02:45.419> the<00:02:46.419> chipper

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
stuff is a lot better and the chipper

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:47.819 
stuff is a lot better and the chipper
balls<00:02:46.840> are<00:02:47.019> better<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.349> know<00:02:47.439> it's<00:02:47.560> already

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
balls are better you know it's already

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.470 
balls are better you know it's already
passing<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.459> better<00:02:48.700> that's<00:02:48.909> that's<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.329> most

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
passing is better that's that's the most

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.569 
passing is better that's that's the most
noticeable<00:02:49.930> area<00:02:50.469> on<00:02:50.560> this<00:02:50.650> card<00:02:50.949> and<00:02:51.189> that's

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
noticeable area on this card and that's

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.159 
noticeable area on this card and that's
what<00:02:51.790> makes<00:02:52.000> probably<00:02:52.659> worth<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.930> money<00:02:53.019> if

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169 
what makes probably worth the money if

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:55.170 
what makes probably worth the money if
it<00:02:53.260> goes<00:02:53.349> below<00:02:53.500> 100<00:02:54.010> cake<00:02:54.219> but<00:02:54.760> anyway<00:02:55.000> lads

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
it goes below 100 cake but anyway lads
