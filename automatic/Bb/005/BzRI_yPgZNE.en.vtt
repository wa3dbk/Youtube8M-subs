given the simple construction and
materials<00:01:07.539> and<00:01:08.259> that's<00:01:09.009> probably<00:01:09.280> why<00:01:09.640> it's

00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:09.849 
materials and that's probably why it's

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:13.260

they're<00:05:39.889> all<00:05:40.010> pretty<00:05:40.340> decent<00:05:40.940> I<00:05:41.120> have<00:05:41.720> to<00:05:41.900> say

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
they're all pretty decent I have to say

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.990 
they're all pretty decent I have to say
the<00:05:42.169> handle<00:05:42.530> on<00:05:42.650> this<00:05:42.800> regular<00:05:43.130> sebenza<00:05:43.520> is

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
the handle on this regular sebenza is

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.879 
the handle on this regular sebenza is
less<00:05:44.659> comfortable<00:05:45.110> to<00:05:45.289> me<00:05:45.409> than<00:05:45.590> the<00:05:45.680> classic

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
less comfortable to me than the classic

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:49.149 
less comfortable to me than the classic
and<00:05:46.340> the<00:05:46.789> chrome<00:05:47.060> style<00:05:47.389> handles<00:05:47.949> just<00:05:48.949> a

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
and the chrome style handles just a

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:51.070 
and the chrome style handles just a
little<00:05:49.430> bit<00:05:49.580> of<00:05:49.729> bumpiness<00:05:50.360> here<00:05:50.750> that<00:05:50.930> just

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
little bit of bumpiness here that just

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.050 
little bit of bumpiness here that just
doesn't<00:05:51.320> always<00:05:51.830> feel<00:05:52.039> that<00:05:52.099> great<00:05:52.520> but<00:05:53.000> I

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
doesn't always feel that great but I

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.629 
doesn't always feel that great but I
guess<00:05:53.300> it<00:05:53.449> gives<00:05:53.570> you<00:05:53.750> a<00:05:54.370> little<00:05:55.370> bit<00:05:55.490> more

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
guess it gives you a little bit more

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:01.899 
guess it gives you a little bit more
grip<00:05:58.240> so<00:05:59.590> very<00:06:00.590> easy<00:06:00.800> to<00:06:01.009> take<00:06:01.190> apart<00:06:01.340> just

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:01.909 
grip so very easy to take apart just

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:04.779 
grip so very easy to take apart just
take<00:06:02.570> these<00:06:02.750> down<00:06:03.110> and<00:06:03.440> tie<00:06:04.250> thing<00:06:04.520> comes

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:04.789 
take these down and tie thing comes

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:08.170 
take these down and tie thing comes
apart<00:06:04.940> and<00:06:06.039> you<00:06:07.039> can<00:06:07.190> clean<00:06:07.430> it<00:06:07.460> and<00:06:08.060> put

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
apart and you can clean it and put

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.230 
apart and you can clean it and put
together<00:06:08.419> yourself<00:06:08.680> and<00:06:09.820> they<00:06:10.820> have<00:06:10.970> the
