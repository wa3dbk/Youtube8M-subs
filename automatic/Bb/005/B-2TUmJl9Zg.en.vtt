that<00:03:24.580> will<00:03:24.760> help<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.209> unfold<00:03:26.340> what<00:03:27.340> we're

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
that will help to unfold what we're

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.660 
that will help to unfold what we're
doing<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:29.530> is<00:03:29.709> because<00:03:30.130> these<00:03:30.459> are

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
doing and that is because these are

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.000 
doing and that is because these are
languages<00:03:31.390> that<00:03:31.450> are<00:03:31.570> much<00:03:31.780> older<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.290> the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
languages that are much older and the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.970 
languages that are much older and the
manuscripts<00:03:33.610> which<00:03:34.330> we<00:03:34.660> now<00:03:34.870> possess<00:03:35.200> in<00:03:35.740> the

manuscripts which we now possess in the
English<00:03:36.310> language<00:03:36.340> came<00:03:37.060> from<00:03:37.300> one<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.630> those

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
English language came from one of those

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.930 
English language came from one of those
language<00:03:38.230> streams<00:03:38.590> so<00:03:38.860> wouldn't<00:03:39.160> you<00:03:39.220> go<00:03:39.730> back

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
language streams so wouldn't you go back

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.240 
language streams so wouldn't you go back
to<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.270> source<00:03:40.540> if<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:40.870> could<00:03:41.230> that<00:03:42.100> would<00:03:42.220> be

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
to the source if you could that would be

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.120 
to the source if you could that would be
my<00:03:42.580> preference<00:03:42.880> so<00:03:43.240> that's<00:03:43.990> one<00:03:44.620> side<00:03:44.860> of<00:03:45.040> the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
my preference so that's one side of the

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.670 
my preference so that's one side of the
equation<00:03:45.610> and<00:03:45.850> then<00:03:46.720> when<00:03:46.959> we<00:03:47.110> talk<00:03:47.350> about

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
equation and then when we talk about

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.740 
equation and then when we talk about
English<00:03:48.280> I<00:03:48.520> must<00:03:48.940> make<00:03:49.180> this<00:03:49.390> reference

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
English I must make this reference

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.960
