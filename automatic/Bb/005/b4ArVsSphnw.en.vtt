00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
things so they kind of make the game

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.620 
things so they kind of make the game
fresh<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.610> make<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.970> same<00:01:45.149> old<00:01:45.329> same<00:01:45.479> old

fresh and make it the same old same old
which<00:01:46.049> they<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.380> pretty<00:01:46.799> well<00:01:46.979> do<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.060> most

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
which they do pretty well do in most

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.819 
which they do pretty well do in most
call<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.570> duty's<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.079> i<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.619> their<00:01:49.710> little

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
call of duty's but i like their little

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.410 
call of duty's but i like their little
bit<00:01:49.979> more<00:01:50.130> different<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.579> time<00:01:50.640> because<00:01:50.820> it

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
bit more different this time because it

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.840 
bit more different this time because it
did<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.899> actually<00:01:52.079> put<00:01:52.710> suppressors<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
did it actually put suppressors in the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.219 
did it actually put suppressors in the
guns<00:01:54.090> right<00:01:54.360> away<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.840> didn't<00:01:54.990> have<00:01:55.079> to

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
guns right away so you didn't have to

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.109 
guns right away so you didn't have to
unlock<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.610> thought<00:01:56.759> that's<00:01:56.880> kind<00:01:56.969> of

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
unlock that so I thought that's kind of

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.359 
unlock that so I thought that's kind of
cool<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.600> different<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.320> also<00:01:58.649> do<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.159> new

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
cool and different I also do like new

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.039 
cool and different I also do like new
game<00:01:59.640> modes<00:01:59.850> they<00:02:00.030> brought<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.420> blitz<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
game modes they brought like blitz and

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.080 
game modes they brought like blitz and
cranks<00:02:01.469> crank<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.189> really<00:02:02.520> do<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:02.820> because

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
cranks crank that really do like because

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.670 
cranks crank that really do like because
it<00:02:03.240> does<00:02:03.420> not<00:02:03.570> promote<00:02:03.899> camping<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.590> this

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
it does not promote camping and this

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.560 
it does not promote camping and this
game<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.219> slow<00:02:05.549> pacing<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.060> maps<00:02:06.270> are<00:02:06.420> so

every<00:02:45.239> time<00:02:45.450> they<00:02:45.630> gave<00:02:45.720> me<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:45.900> kind<00:02:46.380> of

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
every time they gave me this kind of

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.289 
every time they gave me this kind of
weird<00:02:46.650> shotgun<00:02:47.099> it's<00:02:47.250> horrible<00:02:47.700> has<00:02:47.880> no<00:02:48.030> range

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
weird shotgun it's horrible has no range

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.509 
weird shotgun it's horrible has no range
its<00:02:48.599> absolute<00:02:49.200> garbage<00:02:49.349> it's<00:02:49.920> pretty<00:02:50.190> hard<00:02:50.430> to

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
its absolute garbage it's pretty hard to

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.220 
its absolute garbage it's pretty hard to
survive<00:02:50.730> if<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.480> ask<00:02:51.660> me<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:51.900> think<00:02:51.989> they

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
survive if you ask me I think they

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.690 
survive if you ask me I think they
should<00:02:52.380> switch<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.829> up<00:02:52.920> maybe<00:02:53.069> change<00:02:53.430> that

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
should switch it up maybe change that

AR<00:03:29.639> is<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:29.940> MSBs<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:31.109> has<00:03:31.260> BS<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.799> its<00:03:31.889> name

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
AR is the MSBs and has BS and its name

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.979 
AR is the MSBs and has BS and its name
so<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.459> know<00:03:32.700> Infinity<00:03:33.299> Ward<00:03:33.480> made<00:03:33.660> this<00:03:33.780> gun

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
so I know Infinity Ward made this gun

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.930 
so I know Infinity Ward made this gun
just<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.290> BSU<00:03:34.709> because<00:03:35.130> it's<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.430> pretty<00:03:35.760> much<00:03:35.910> a

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
just to BSU because it's a pretty much a

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.819 
just to BSU because it's a pretty much a
three-round<00:03:36.450> burst<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.230> die<00:03:37.349> instantly

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
three-round burst and you die instantly

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.890 
three-round burst and you die instantly
and<00:03:38.250> concern<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:38.700> health<00:03:38.849> is<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:39.180> low<00:03:39.420> you're

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
and concern the health is so low you're

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.940 
and concern the health is so low you're
dead<00:03:40.109> like<00:03:40.349> you<00:03:40.500> don't<00:03:40.560> even<00:03:40.680> get<00:03:40.859> a<00:03:40.920> chance

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
dead like you don't even get a chance

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.220 
dead like you don't even get a chance
with<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.370> gun<00:03:41.519> i<00:03:41.549> mean<00:03:41.880> it's<00:03:42.120> it's<00:03:42.690> not<00:03:42.900> so

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230

gonna<00:03:55.049> make<00:03:55.319> something<00:03:55.590> like<00:03:55.650> that<00:03:55.829> they

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
gonna make something like that they

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.710 
gonna make something like that they
should<00:03:56.160> make<00:03:56.190> it<00:03:56.459> more<00:03:56.609> like<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:56.849> V<00:03:57.060> satyr<00:03:57.329> back

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
quickly now I'm not really sure if the

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.470 
quickly now I'm not really sure if the
guns<00:04:50.190> are<00:04:50.310> just<00:04:50.490> really<00:04:50.790> overpowered<00:04:51.360> and

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
guns are just really overpowered and

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.110 
guns are just really overpowered and
health<00:04:51.660> is<00:04:51.810> normal<00:04:52.200> or<00:04:52.680> if<00:04:52.980> the<00:04:53.340> health<00:04:53.940> is

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
health is normal or if the health is

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.000 
health is normal or if the health is
really<00:04:54.300> low<00:04:54.540> and<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.810> guns<00:04:54.990> are<00:04:55.140> normal<00:04:55.470> so<00:04:55.860> if

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
really low and the guns are normal so if

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.950
