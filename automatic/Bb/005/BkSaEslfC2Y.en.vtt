00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.319
 I always knew that I liked to do the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.059
 others laugh hours thanks to God my 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.440
 friends make joke 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.660
 and when I'm from merry port when 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.410
 I came to SÃ£o Paulo and I started to study. 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.870
 music 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.359
 but the song is very much like the song 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.100
 it was fundamental because that's when I was 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.050
 I started to study clown like bullet art 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.330
 and the clown with this improvisation not 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.019
 does flamengo 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.179
 the difficulty was the improvisation I think 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.130
 What are you having tomorrow and having serious 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.920
 because when one has an idea to carry 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.590
 its beauty since that way it's 30 per 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.780
 one hundred times 70% and do not know what 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.250
 is doing and if you sincere type I 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.000
 I go step by step and I do not have any 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.640
 but the cup in an angliru water cube 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.770
 where he is none and suddenly has a 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.100
 idea and does if you are not very sincere 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.570
 It's not like that, and no one is doing it. 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.160
 that I have a joke that tries to force 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.410
 the iron bar morgan stone had the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.910
 date of your first paying life 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.650
 I think his main input is 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.869
 he pays ticket 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.760
 we even get help there guaranteed to 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.200
 second help that he is the theme that there 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.990
 then he does things from what the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.799
 public speaks the third help and I found 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.729
 This most crazy intellectual is 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.740
 Because I think we really do. 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.060
 always creates a spectacle for that 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.439
 audience 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.200
 so we if people are 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.450
 there very willing to receive the talking 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.220
 The best potato we have ever done is with 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.360
 40 Federal Revenue Taxes 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.360
 Thus forty homes 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.990
 when there just stuck with the failure to 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.200
 catch one of the cases they so 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.580
 Congratulations, it was very funny, I thought. 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.770
 to have a life and of your face was 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.590
 funny because they do not expect an audience 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.030
 very much suffered 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:03.280
 the more the public is involved 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:05.049
 It 's good that we 're good, so I came from 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.450
 playing in the yard but nowadays I 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.880
 I do the impromptu night with marcio 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.130
 ballas driving strike is also ours 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.890
 partner in the following three 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.720
 invite and a musician who does not normally 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.299
 daniel, maybe we can do it. 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.799
 kaleidoscope at the Tucarena Theater here in 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:29.560
 SÃ£o Paulo I am unlikely to 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:31.510
 young people began to lend 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.549
 more attention on improvisation because it was 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.130
 improving it started as well as a 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.560
 experimental language in the beginning called 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.370
 the attention for being the novelty 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.200
 and today I do not think it's even 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.060
 novelty but I think it's better 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.799
 video I think in several types of 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.109
 improvisers but I think it has a 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.730
 a word that is common to all 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.670
 have generosity 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.950
 You always play with 43 people who 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.170
 try to have an idea only that sometimes you will 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.910
 realize that your idea is worse than the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.100
 another you will have to abandon 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.670
 your idea and I think without this you 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.959
 does not work together in the province 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.270
 desire to deliver the best 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.200
 pro scene independent of being with 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.200
 your idea or bad 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.920
 Hey 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.920
