I got a process through in terms of

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.380 
I got a process through in terms of
workability<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.670> said<00:01:35.850> zebra<00:01:36.150> wood<00:01:36.240> is

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390

Bini<00:02:48.569> is<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.720> much<00:02:48.900> better<00:02:49.830> wood<00:02:50.280> if<00:02:50.610> you're

doing<00:02:50.910> inlays<00:02:51.269> I<00:02:51.450> think<00:02:51.630> your<00:02:51.750> inlay<00:02:51.989> will<00:02:52.200> get

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
doing inlays I think your inlay will get

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.060 
doing inlays I think your inlay will get
lost<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:52.950> wood<00:02:53.130> so<00:02:53.370> overall<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.120> would<00:02:54.239> use

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
lost in the wood so overall I would use

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.130 
lost in the wood so overall I would use
