00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hi this is gary with macmost now today

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.340 
hi this is gary with macmost now today
let's<00:00:03.090> look<00:00:03.240> at<00:00:03.389> two<00:00:03.570> applications<00:00:04.020> for<00:00:04.290> the

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
let's look at two applications for the

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.869 
let's look at two applications for the
iphone<00:00:04.740> that<00:00:05.160> will<00:00:05.250> allow<00:00:05.430> you<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.670> share

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
iphone that will allow you to share

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.680 
iphone that will allow you to share
files<00:00:06.150> with<00:00:06.420> your<00:00:06.750> Mac

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.289 

so<00:00:11.650> old-fashioned<00:00:12.309> iPods<00:00:12.610> do<00:00:12.820> have<00:00:12.940> one

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:13.299 
so old-fashioned iPods do have one

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.629 
so old-fashioned iPods do have one
interesting<00:00:13.929> advantage<00:00:14.320> over<00:00:14.559> iPhones<00:00:15.309> is

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639 
interesting advantage over iPhones is

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.820 
interesting advantage over iPhones is
that<00:00:15.789> you<00:00:15.879> can<00:00:16.029> use<00:00:16.330> them<00:00:16.570> as<00:00:16.750> external<00:00:17.500> hard

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
that you can use them as external hard

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.440 
that you can use them as external hard
drive<00:00:18.009> you<00:00:18.279> can<00:00:18.400> say<00:00:18.550> files<00:00:18.880> to<00:00:19.119> them<00:00:19.240> you<00:00:19.329> can

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
drive you can say files to them you can

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.839 
drive you can say files to them you can
back<00:00:19.630> up<00:00:19.840> to<00:00:19.990> them<00:00:20.130> iphones<00:00:21.130> can't<00:00:21.430> do<00:00:21.669> that

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
back up to them iphones can't do that

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.240 
back up to them iphones can't do that
but<00:00:22.480> they're<00:00:22.720> to<00:00:22.990> third-party<00:00:23.680> applications

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
but they're to third-party applications

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.800 
but they're to third-party applications
now<00:00:24.400> that<00:00:24.880> allow<00:00:25.090> you<00:00:25.150> to<00:00:25.300> share<00:00:25.599> files

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
now that allow you to share files

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.600 
now that allow you to share files
directly<00:00:26.349> from<00:00:26.439> your<00:00:26.590> Mac<00:00:26.829> to<00:00:27.009> your<00:00:27.160> iPhone

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
directly from your Mac to your iPhone

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.190 
directly from your Mac to your iPhone
and<00:00:27.849> what's<00:00:28.210> even<00:00:28.419> better<00:00:28.450> is<00:00:28.719> they<00:00:29.020> don't

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
and what's even better is they don't

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.170 
and what's even better is they don't
require<00:00:29.469> that<00:00:29.950> the<00:00:30.070> to<00:00:30.189> be<00:00:30.340> connected<00:00:30.849> at

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
require that the to be connected at

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.450 
require that the to be connected at
least<00:00:31.450> not<00:00:31.629> in<00:00:31.809> a<00:00:32.169> wired<00:00:32.410> connection<00:00:32.739> you<00:00:33.309> can

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
least not in a wired connection you can

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.850 
least not in a wired connection you can
connect<00:00:33.760> them<00:00:33.879> just<00:00:34.180> via<00:00:34.360> your<00:00:34.600> local<00:00:35.260> network

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
connect them just via your local network

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.490 
connect them just via your local network
and<00:00:36.070> do<00:00:36.610> it<00:00:36.730> over<00:00:36.820> the<00:00:37.090> air<00:00:37.300> let's<00:00:37.989> take<00:00:38.200> a<00:00:38.260> look

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
and do it over the air let's take a look

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.229 
and do it over the air let's take a look
at<00:00:38.559> both<00:00:38.739> of<00:00:38.770> them<00:00:38.980> so<00:00:39.700> the<00:00:39.789> first<00:00:39.969> step<00:00:40.059> we're

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
at both of them so the first step we're

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.580 
at both of them so the first step we're
going<00:00:40.270> to<00:00:40.420> look<00:00:40.480> at<00:00:40.629> is<00:00:40.809> called<00:00:40.930> air<00:00:41.170> sharing

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
going to look at is called air sharing

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.069 
going to look at is called air sharing
now<00:00:42.070> air<00:00:42.219> sharing<00:00:42.460> is<00:00:42.670> seven<00:00:42.969> dollars<00:00:42.999> and<00:00:43.480> it

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
now air sharing is seven dollars and it

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.290 
now air sharing is seven dollars and it
allows<00:00:44.350> your<00:00:44.649> iPhone<00:00:45.129> to<00:00:45.399> be<00:00:45.730> used<00:00:45.999> as<00:00:46.179> an

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
allows your iPhone to be used as an

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.869 
allows your iPhone to be used as an
external<00:00:46.510> hard<00:00:46.870> drive<00:00:47.109> on<00:00:47.350> your<00:00:47.409> Mac<00:00:48.249> just

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
external hard drive on your Mac just

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.250 
external hard drive on your Mac just
like<00:00:49.059> you<00:00:49.149> would<00:00:49.239> any<00:00:49.449> other<00:00:49.510> external<00:00:49.989> hard

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
like you would any other external hard

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.259 
like you would any other external hard
drive<00:00:50.409> or<00:00:50.440> network<00:00:50.589> drive<00:00:51.219> all<00:00:51.819> you<00:00:52.030> need<00:00:52.179> to

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
drive or network drive all you need to

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.299 
drive or network drive all you need to
do<00:00:52.390> is<00:00:52.510> look<00:00:52.600> at<00:00:52.659> the<00:00:52.749> IP<00:00:52.929> address<00:00:53.109> of<00:00:53.440> your

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
do is look at the IP address of your

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:55.889 
do is look at the IP address of your
iPhone<00:00:54.819> make<00:00:55.210> sure<00:00:55.359> they're<00:00:55.539> both<00:00:55.719> connected

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
iPhone make sure they're both connected

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.529 
iPhone make sure they're both connected
the<00:00:56.260> same<00:00:56.469> Wi-Fi<00:00:56.649> network<00:00:56.890> and<00:00:57.399> connect<00:00:58.269> using

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
the same Wi-Fi network and connect using

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.110 
the same Wi-Fi network and connect using
the<00:00:58.749> finder<00:00:59.109> in<00:00:59.260> Mac<00:00:59.949> to<00:01:00.370> go<00:01:00.489> ahead<00:01:00.609> and<00:01:00.940> view

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
the finder in Mac to go ahead and view

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.430 
the finder in Mac to go ahead and view
the<00:01:01.210> files<00:01:01.420> there<00:01:01.659> you<00:01:01.839> can<00:01:01.960> actually<00:01:02.139> even

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
the files there you can actually even

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.350 
the files there you can actually even
connect<00:01:02.739> on<00:01:02.949> windows<00:01:03.429> as<00:01:03.609> well<00:01:03.639> and<00:01:04.059> then<00:01:04.330> you

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
connect on windows as well and then you

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.020 
connect on windows as well and then you
can<00:01:04.570> drag<00:01:04.690> and<00:01:04.839> drop<00:01:04.900> files<00:01:05.050> to<00:01:05.830> and<00:01:06.130> from<00:01:06.159> the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
can drag and drop files to and from the

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.250 
can drag and drop files to and from the
iphone<00:01:07.479> so<00:01:07.870> this<00:01:08.020> is<00:01:08.170> air<00:01:08.380> sharing<00:01:10.170> after<00:01:11.170> it

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
iphone so this is air sharing after it

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.870 
iphone so this is air sharing after it
opens<00:01:11.560> up<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:12.070> will<00:01:12.159> show<00:01:12.370> you<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:12.760> two

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
opens up it will show you the two

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
in to my mac just like i would connect

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.670 
in to my mac just like i would connect

network and these files will appear and

network and these files will appear and
once<00:01:35.560> i<00:01:35.650> transferred<00:01:36.130> files<00:01:36.400> to<00:01:36.880> hear<00:01:37.210> i<00:01:37.360> can

once i transferred files to hear i can
go<00:01:38.350> ahead<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:38.620> view<00:01:39.100> them<00:01:39.310> which<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.490> probably

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
go ahead and view them which is probably

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.360

five dollars and what drop copy does is

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.949 
five dollars and what drop copy does is
basically<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.700> same<00:02:33.730> thing<00:02:34.270> with<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.690> little

is<00:03:55.760> a<00:03:55.790> little<00:03:56.299> bit<00:03:56.389> easier<00:03:56.599> to<00:03:56.959> use<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.470> it<00:03:57.889> has

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
is a little bit easier to use and it has

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.619 
is a little bit easier to use and it has
a<00:03:58.069> big<00:03:58.310> advantage<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.819> that<00:03:58.909> you<00:03:59.450> can

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
a big advantage and that you can

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.020 
a big advantage and that you can
transfer<00:04:00.109> from<00:04:00.260> iphone<00:04:00.739> to<00:04:00.769> iphone<00:04:01.129> as<00:04:01.609> well

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
transfer from iphone to iphone as well

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.970 
transfer from iphone to iphone as well
but<00:04:02.780> it<00:04:02.959> does<00:04:03.109> take<00:04:03.260> an<00:04:03.409> additional<00:04:03.530> piece<00:04:03.829> of

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
but it does take an additional piece of

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.490 
but it does take an additional piece of
software<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.579> run<00:04:04.760> on<00:04:05.030> your<00:04:05.389> Mac<00:04:05.599> so<00:04:06.290> it's

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
software to run on your Mac so it's

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.960 
software to run on your Mac so it's
going<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.769> be<00:04:06.829> hard<00:04:07.069> to<00:04:07.159> connect<00:04:07.639> to<00:04:07.730> a<00:04:07.760> new

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
going to be hard to connect to a new

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.670 
going to be hard to connect to a new
computer<00:04:08.359> without<00:04:08.480> first<00:04:08.750> installing<00:04:09.560> that

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
computer without first installing that

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.339 
computer without first installing that
and<00:04:09.980> it<00:04:10.909> was<00:04:11.090> a<00:04:11.120> little<00:04:11.359> clunker<00:04:11.780> when<00:04:11.989> I<00:04:12.019> used

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
and it was a little clunker when I used

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.530 
and it was a little clunker when I used
it<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:12.769> there<00:04:12.919> are<00:04:13.069> two<00:04:13.340> great<00:04:13.549> options<00:04:13.760> for

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
it so there are two great options for

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.569
