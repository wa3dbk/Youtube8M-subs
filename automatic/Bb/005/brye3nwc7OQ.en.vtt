00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:17.210
 so it 's for me so I 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:20.810

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:33.469
 so they make my skin 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.540
 this for my account that others the 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.340
 people make it up, I thank you 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.410

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.240
 If yours is involved, you live in that 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.460
 so much the secret when all the 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.290

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.020
 my talent and I keep going in his mind 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.370

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.160

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.610

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.930
 small shoes but I'm staying high 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.149

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.339
 of brightness that's how I dull you this 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.259
 Dad is no longer wrong everyone has 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.729
 everything that touches him then because 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.190
 you suffocate if in the middle of the 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.880
 fight you from the opposing machine 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.570
 so this family so to me 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:25.430

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:27.410
 with what is for me so I do not know 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.690

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.970

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.150

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.260
 mention me to feel good if they 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.940

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.140
 So deep do you like me, but that's the way 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.690

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.640
 let go I will not walk 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:13.400
