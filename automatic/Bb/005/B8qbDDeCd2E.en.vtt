order it is the hbr a3 insanity which is

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.219 
order it is the hbr a3 insanity which is
another<00:01:36.299> great<00:01:36.450> gun<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.869> I've<00:01:36.960> actually

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
another great gun that I've actually

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.020 
another great gun that I've actually
only<00:01:37.409> had<00:01:37.829> once<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.310> then<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.460> had<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.759> delete

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.910 
only had once and then I had to delete
it<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.750> know<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.259> had<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.619> my<00:01:40.650> old

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
it because I know I had on my old

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.200 
it because I know I had on my old
account<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.189> didn't<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.549> delete<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.000> I

account I didn't have to delete it but I

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.660 
account I didn't have to delete it but I
did<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.990> HPR<00:01:43.409> III<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.829> sandhya<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.460> ups

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
did have the HPR III in sandhya it ups

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.310 
did have the HPR III in sandhya it ups
the<00:01:44.820> damage<00:01:45.119> once<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.570> fiery<00:01:45.899> which<00:01:46.200> is

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
the damage once in a fiery which is

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.800 
the damage once in a fiery which is
really<00:01:46.649> needed<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.220> hbr<00:01:47.670> III<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> hbr<00:01:48.479> a3

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
really needed on the hbr III the hbr a3

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.539 
really needed on the hbr III the hbr a3
is<00:01:48.840> known<00:01:49.170> for<00:01:49.380> having<00:01:49.439> sort<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.070> kind<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.430> a

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
is known for having sort of kind of a

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.940 
is known for having sort of kind of a
slower<00:01:50.790> fire<00:01:51.119> rate<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.630> when<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.229> up<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> lot

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
slower fire rate so when you up it a lot

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.560 
slower fire rate so when you up it a lot
especially<00:01:53.130> by<00:01:53.610> 2<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.000> give<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.299> little<00:01:54.420> bit

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
especially by 2 and give it a little bit

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.300 
especially by 2 and give it a little bit
more<00:01:54.689> damage<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.200> becomes<00:01:55.500> an<00:01:55.680> even<00:01:55.890> better

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
more damage it becomes an even better

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.370 
more damage it becomes an even better
gun<00:01:56.909> than<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.180> already<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:58.049> very

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
gun than it already is so that's very

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.109 
gun than it already is so that's very
good<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> number<00:01:59.159> three<00:01:59.520> spot<00:01:59.670> that<00:02:00.030> I'm

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
good and the number three spot that I'm

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.630 
good and the number three spot that I'm
giving<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.290> ASM<00:02:01.860> one<00:02:02.070> speakeasy

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
giving it to is the ASM one speakeasy

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.219 
giving it to is the ASM one speakeasy
I've<00:02:02.850> had<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.149> gun<00:02:03.360> before<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.689> had<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:03.930> my<00:02:03.960> old

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
I've had this gun before I had on my old

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.050 
I've had this gun before I had on my old
account<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.979> ups<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.340> fiery<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.700> lot<00:02:05.939> it

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
account and it ups the fiery a lot it

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.639 
account and it ups the fiery a lot it
lowers<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.390> damage<00:02:06.750> by<00:02:06.899> one<00:02:07.229> but<00:02:07.439> that

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
lowers the damage by one but that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.839 
lowers the damage by one but that
doesn't<00:02:07.950> really<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.489> know<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.670> doesn't

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
doesn't really you know it doesn't

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.279 
doesn't really you know it doesn't
really<00:02:08.940> play<00:02:09.119> out<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.479> much<00:02:09.690> put<00:02:10.020> advance

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
really play out that much put advance

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.390 
really play out that much put advance
rifling<00:02:10.739> on<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.129> then<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.370> a

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
rifling on it and then you have a

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.250 
rifling on it and then you have a
foregrip<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.330> already<00:02:12.450> comes<00:02:12.690> with

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
foregrip and it already comes with

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.690 
foregrip and it already comes with
mags<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.739> don't<00:02:13.890> know<00:02:13.980> if<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.129> come<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.370> rapid

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
mags I don't know if you come a rapid

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.250 
mags I don't know if you come a rapid
fire<00:02:14.879> because<00:02:15.180> up<00:02:15.360> sapphire<00:02:15.750> rate<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.080> much

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
fire because up sapphire rate so much

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.530 
fire because up sapphire rate so much
but<00:02:16.530> either<00:02:16.769> way<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.549> is<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.730> deadly<00:02:18.120> combo

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
but either way that is a deadly combo

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.970 
but either way that is a deadly combo
I'd<00:02:18.629> probably<00:02:18.810> put<00:02:19.049> like<00:02:19.200> quick<00:02:19.409> drawn<00:02:19.650> just

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
I'd probably put like quick drawn just

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.740 
I'd probably put like quick drawn just
so<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.099> could<00:02:20.159> get<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.579> little<00:02:20.939> bit<00:02:21.150> more<00:02:21.269> faster

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
so I could get a little bit more faster

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.569 
so I could get a little bit more faster
80s<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.409> get<00:02:22.530> those<00:02:22.650> kills<00:02:22.950> just<00:02:23.189> in<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.400> little

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
80s and get those kills just in a little

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.039 
80s and get those kills just in a little
bit<00:02:23.700> faster<00:02:24.030> but<00:02:24.150> with<00:02:24.269> having<00:02:24.569> such<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.810> good

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
bit faster but with having such a good

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.929 
bit faster but with having such a good
gun<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.860> ASM<00:02:26.250> one<00:02:26.370> already<00:02:26.549> is<00:02:26.730> and

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
gun that the ASM one already is and

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.539 
gun that the ASM one already is and
stacking<00:02:27.420> on<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.750> big<00:02:28.290> magazine<00:02:28.829> with<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.069> lot<00:02:29.400> of

really really fast fiery that it just

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.690
