00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 but 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.010
 but 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.740
 hello everyone with you rakat and today we 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.200
 let 's talk and tanks is-3 I will tell you about 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.980
 his strengths and weaknesses will tell 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.110
 how not to put perks for the crew 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.830
 I will show what module should stand on it 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.730
 and also probably talk about tactics in 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.449
 battles 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.550
 Well, let's go this weaknesses 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.550
 Tanka is his long 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.460
 recharge a very huge scatter 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.129
 guns 04 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.690
 bad mannerism you which basically 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.250
 compensated for pretty good 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.199
 dynamics and of course 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.140
 one of the most important weaknesses is 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.909
 penetrability of the tower roof when you 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.510
 get up in the clinch with a tank which 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:05.670
 pretty and above you in many ways he 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.270
 no problem will you sew here the roof 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.900
 towers 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.530
 but perhaps this ends 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.200
 cons of this tank and probably already time 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.540
 go to plus because plus here 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.000
 objectively more firstly it 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.230
 ricochet impenetrable tower which 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.020
 you will catch ricochets 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.260
 even non-penetration even from levels 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.520
 tenths of a share this is a low court silhouette 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.820
 which allows you to stay 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.520
 unnoticed to you for a long time or just 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.480
 lets run away from shots 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.900
 the opponent let's say the third is again 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:47.340
 all the same stuffing bolts that goose 3 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:50.550
 appeared in the middle with rice and which 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.410
 allow to drag because the enemy 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.530
 he must first break through the bulwark and 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.550
 already then side armor that 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.960
 rather difficult then life 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.080
 the next plus is pike nose 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.680
 two sheet guys are angled and 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.259
 and put forward what in general 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.120
 great you can catch ricochets 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.670
 penetration of tanks still quite high in 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:20.690
 Basically, but in terms of the level, I have 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:22.889
 that's why pike but older guys further 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.790
 this is a high average damage per shot 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:28.409
 which is 390 damage that 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.689
 very good results on 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:36.599
 eighth level except on perhaps 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:39.150
 which is probably t 3 4 yes t 3 4 and 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.879
 broneprobitie 225, in principle, 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.719
 non-penetration is the same as the rest 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.639
 competitors level 8 further further need 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:50.659
 note what wise it is necessary to put on 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:52.829
 This tank Well, of course, without rammer 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.719
 Nowhere on the Soviet technology in general 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.209
 on almost all the technology therefore 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:03:00.450
 first module is to send 2 stabilizer 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.579
 3 are reinforced pickups if 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.719
 you don't have just silver right away 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.670
 likes to ask further further 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.779
 Of course we'll talk a little about 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.590
 perks for 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:15.389
 crew commander commander as usual 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.950
 light bulb repair and jack of all trades 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.959
 gunner turns 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.930
 repair a smooth turn of the tower and 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.689
 master gunsmith mechanic driver 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.659
 gets repair virtuoso and king 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:29.099
 off-road charging repair 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:31.319
 contactless ammo and desperately 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.480
 guys, I probably all noticed that 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.980
 priority on this tank repair 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.379
 insofar as 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.379
 from in do not pump repair you 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:43.019
 leave from the corner without arenas set same 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:46.469
 they put you to music from the dead 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.870
 disassemble in to points and nothing to do already 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:51.719
 you can not therefore repair repair again 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.599
 repair but now it's probably time to go to 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:56.309
 tactics of warfare probably want 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.019
 say that combat power and ease in 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:04:00.180
 mastering this tank allows itself 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.849
 Feel good in both top and 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.769
 at the bottom of the list 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.499
 so I can recommend 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.980
 never lead on this passive tank 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:12.480
 battle and sometimes can be slide down to 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.859
 when nobody helps you 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.769
 well, so you have to drive your own 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.669
 ally or staff at the forefront 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.759
 Ethan tank but can not be allowed to 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.110
 airborne with tlt 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:31.590
 otherwise they unfortunately can 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.650
 principle swirl of course this tank 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.110
 created for middle and near distances 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.090
 so you will be best on it 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.219
 feel in the city is a car for 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.699
 city, unlike the same to-t 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:49.560
 which possesses an accurate gun and more 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:51.389
 less good recharge ah and perhaps 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.969
 the most important thing is not to be allowed in 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.330
 clinch a tank that can take you apart 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:58.979
 in the roof of the turrets as well in principle 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.740
 beg for any tank probably 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.289
 level eight yes and above but only 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.770
 excluding those who understand the roof 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.270
 turrets and probably it's time to let down 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.120
 total of 3 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.639
 this is a great tank which is made for 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.340
 dynamic combat it fits like 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:20.819
 novice well and the old-timers of the game he 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.650
 everyone will like him what he wants 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:24.750
 say with proper play it 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.080
 nagiborskie tanchik us nagiborskie 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:32.219
 he bends the bend random bends the bend yet 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.839
 once again, thank you, everyone was with cancer 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:34.860
 like subscribe to the channel 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:39.889
 put likes 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.889
 there will be more videos like that adios
