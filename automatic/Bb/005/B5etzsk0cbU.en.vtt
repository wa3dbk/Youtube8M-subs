first appeared on Namek for his very
first<00:01:52.659> time<00:01:52.840> when<00:01:52.990> he<00:01:53.020> was<00:01:53.110> going<00:01:53.920> around

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
first time when he was going around

bond and adore in the anime so I know to
me<00:02:01.330> I<00:02:01.630> think<00:02:02.590> this<00:02:03.250> would<00:02:03.520> be<00:02:04.049> weird<00:02:05.049> because

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
me I think this would be weird because

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.990 
me I think this would be weird because
cui<00:02:06.399> is<00:02:06.729> Vegeta's<00:02:08.310> self-proclaimed<00:02:09.310> rival

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
cui is Vegeta's self-proclaimed rival

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.240 
cui is Vegeta's self-proclaimed rival
and<00:02:10.300> by<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:10.810> mean<00:02:11.019> cui<00:02:11.470> proclaims<00:02:12.040> himself

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
and by that I mean cui proclaims himself

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.680 
and by that I mean cui proclaims himself
as<00:02:12.930> Vegeta<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.050> equal<00:02:14.769> or<00:02:15.330> lack<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.540> better

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
as Vegeta is equal or lack of a better

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.120 
as Vegeta is equal or lack of a better
term<00:02:16.840> rival<00:02:17.739> I<00:02:17.830> suppose<00:02:18.190> because<00:02:19.140> in<00:02:20.140> uh<00:02:20.500> Namek

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130

term rival I suppose because in uh Namek
you<00:02:21.850> say<00:02:22.120> Vegeta<00:02:22.600> I<00:02:22.989> think<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.410> was<00:02:23.560> he<00:02:24.519> just<00:02:24.700> I

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
you say Vegeta I think it was he just I

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.790 
you say Vegeta I think it was he just I
think<00:02:25.450> he<00:02:25.540> actually<00:02:25.900> pretty<00:02:26.319> much<00:02:26.380> two<00:02:26.620> faiths

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
think he actually pretty much two faiths

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.530 
think he actually pretty much two faiths
squee<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.519> like<00:02:27.700> in<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.870> mere<00:02:29.140> number<00:02:29.500> of<00:02:29.650> blows

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
squee and like in a mere number of blows

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.890 
squee and like in a mere number of blows
but<00:02:31.540> yeah<00:02:31.780> it's<00:02:32.019> just<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:33.150> Vegeta<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.330> Queen

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
but yeah it's just the Vegeta and Queen

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.860 
but yeah it's just the Vegeta and Queen
must<00:02:35.650> have<00:02:35.830> some<00:02:36.100> sort<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.510> history<00:02:37.510> that

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
must have some sort of history that

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.470 
must have some sort of history that
nobody<00:02:38.769> knows<00:02:39.010> of<00:02:39.220> it's<00:02:39.340> like<00:02:39.580> maybe<00:02:40.180> when

nobody knows of it's like maybe when

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.259 
nobody knows of it's like maybe when
Vegeta<00:02:41.049> was<00:02:41.340> maybe<00:02:42.340> when<00:02:42.519> Vegeta<00:02:42.790> was<00:02:42.940> younger

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
Vegeta was maybe when Vegeta was younger

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.850 
Vegeta was maybe when Vegeta was younger
he<00:02:43.480> he<00:02:44.019> and<00:02:44.170> him<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.650> cui<00:02:45.239> had<00:02:46.239> some<00:02:47.760> had<00:02:48.760> some

he he and him and cui had some had some
disagreements<00:02:50.860> as<00:02:51.459> or<00:02:51.820> something<00:02:52.810> like<00:02:52.959> that

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
disagreements as or something like that

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.150 
disagreements as or something like that
for<00:02:53.440> cui<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.519> mention<00:02:55.269> him<00:02:55.660> as<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.739> Jeter's

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
for cui to mention him as the Jeter's

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.520 
for cui to mention him as the Jeter's
rival<00:02:57.700> so<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.239> don't<00:02:58.450> know<00:02:58.510> there<00:02:58.660> may<00:02:58.780> be<00:02:58.810> may

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
rival so I don't know there may be may

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.729 
rival so I don't know there may be may
be<00:02:59.560> some<00:03:00.010> unexplained<00:03:01.590> rivalry<00:03:02.590> between

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
be some unexplained rivalry between

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.830 
be some unexplained rivalry between
these<00:03:03.130> two<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.640> was<00:03:03.910> not<00:03:04.120> explained<00:03:04.570> in<00:03:04.720> the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
these two that was not explained in the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.289 
these two that was not explained in the
anime<00:03:05.200> or<00:03:05.560> something<00:03:06.489> like<00:03:06.609> that<00:03:06.670> and

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
anime or something like that and

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.210 
anime or something like that and
someone's<00:03:08.019> transform<00:03:08.530> so<00:03:08.709> hopefully<00:03:09.040> that

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
someone's transform so hopefully that

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.849 
someone's transform so hopefully that
doesn't<00:03:09.400> hinder<00:03:10.390> me<00:03:10.600> too<00:03:10.840> much<00:03:10.989> as<00:03:11.320> he

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
doesn't hinder me too much as he

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.860 
doesn't hinder me too much as he
headbutts<00:03:12.310> me<00:03:12.489> in<00:03:12.579> the<00:03:12.700> back<00:03:12.880> like<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.570> bitch

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
headbutts me in the back like a bitch

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.690 
headbutts me in the back like a bitch
and<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.709> think<00:03:14.890> I've<00:03:14.980> got<00:03:15.130> him<00:03:15.190> down<00:03:15.310> enough<00:03:15.640> to

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
and I think I've got him down enough to

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.539 
and I think I've got him down enough to
actually<00:03:16.420> use<00:03:16.660> an<00:03:17.109> ultimate<00:03:17.680> but<00:03:17.920> he's

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
actually use an ultimate but he's

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.940 
actually use an ultimate but he's
switching<00:03:18.940> into<00:03:19.150> two<00:03:19.299> Doria<00:03:19.660> I<00:03:19.840> think<00:03:20.590> I<00:03:20.739> might

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
switching into two Doria I think I might

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.120 
switching into two Doria I think I might
switch<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:21.579> up<00:03:21.640> with<00:03:22.090> two<00:03:22.720> Qui<00:03:23.109> I'll<00:03:23.470> fight

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
switch it up with two Qui I'll fight

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.190 
switch it up with two Qui I'll fight
Quay<00:03:24.489> with<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.820> Doria<00:03:25.180> I'll<00:03:25.630> fight<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.019> Dory

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
Quay with the Doria I'll fight the Dory

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.220 
Quay with the Doria I'll fight the Dory
with<00:03:26.440> qui<00:03:26.680> sorry<00:03:27.430> and<00:03:27.700> I'll<00:03:27.790> fight<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.810> Saban

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
with qui sorry and I'll fight the Saban

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.960 
with qui sorry and I'll fight the Saban
with<00:03:29.410> Vegeta<00:03:29.650> just<00:03:29.980> just<00:03:30.549> so<00:03:30.670> it's<00:03:30.820> a<00:03:30.940> little

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
with Vegeta just just so it's a little

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.080 
with Vegeta just just so it's a little
bit<00:03:31.359> fair<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:31.959> getting<00:03:32.530> equal<00:03:33.040> equal<00:03:33.850> play

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
bit fair and getting equal equal play

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.380 
bit fair and getting equal equal play
time<00:03:34.359> with<00:03:34.570> both<00:03:34.750> of<00:03:34.959> them<00:03:35.109> and<00:03:35.700> think<00:03:36.700> he<00:03:36.880> he's

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
time with both of them and think he he's

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.810 
time with both of them and think he he's
he's<00:03:38.170> listing<00:03:38.620> away<00:03:38.829> a<00:03:38.859> bit<00:03:39.130> and<00:03:39.430> I<00:03:39.579> didn't

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
he's listing away a bit and I didn't

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.090 
he's listing away a bit and I didn't
think<00:03:39.970> did<00:03:40.600> Ori<00:03:40.840> would<00:03:41.079> be<00:03:41.200> that<00:03:41.380> scared<00:03:41.890> of

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
think did Ori would be that scared of

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.500 
think did Ori would be that scared of
Quetta<00:03:44.580> run<00:03:45.580> away<00:03:45.819> from<00:03:45.879> him<00:03:46.150> but<00:03:46.300> he's

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
Quetta run away from him but he's

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.300 
Quetta run away from him but he's
actually<00:03:46.750> landing<00:03:47.349> a<00:03:47.409> few<00:03:47.440> attacks<00:03:47.830> now<00:03:48.040> so

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
actually landing a few attacks now so

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.190 
actually landing a few attacks now so
and

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
and

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.710 
and
his<00:03:49.349> signature<00:03:49.650> skill<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.790> son<00:03:51.300> of<00:03:51.330> a<00:03:51.480> bitch

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
his signature skill you son of a bitch

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.780 
his signature skill you son of a bitch
and<00:03:52.050> I<00:03:52.680> hit<00:03:52.830> him<00:03:52.950> in<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.069> eye<00:03:53.129> really<00:03:53.489> want<00:03:53.730> to

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
and I hit him in the eye really want to

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.220 
and I hit him in the eye really want to
get<00:03:53.849> out<00:03:53.970> of<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.120> water<00:03:54.300> I<00:03:54.390> really<00:03:55.050> hate

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
get out of the water I really hate

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.630 
get out of the water I really hate
fighting<00:03:55.560> in<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.800> water<00:03:55.950> it<00:03:56.069> seems<00:03:56.220> like<00:03:56.459> it

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
fighting in the water it seems like it

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.750 
fighting in the water it seems like it
slows<00:03:57.510> down<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:58.590> fighting<00:03:59.489> and

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
slows down the fighting and

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.220 
slows down the fighting and
what-have-you<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:00.840> I'm<00:04:00.900> gonna<00:04:01.019> hit<00:04:01.110> him<00:04:01.200> with

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
what-have-you so I'm gonna hit him with

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.220 
what-have-you so I'm gonna hit him with
a<00:04:01.349> full<00:04:01.530> power<00:04:01.709> energy<00:04:02.040> wave<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:03.230> actually

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
a full power energy wave I actually

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.750 
a full power energy wave I actually
think<00:04:04.470> that's<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.800> first<00:04:05.099> super<00:04:05.640> of<00:04:05.730> the

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
think that's the first super of the

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.370 
think that's the first super of the
match<00:04:06.090> which<00:04:06.330> is<00:04:06.480> odd<00:04:06.660> considering<00:04:07.080> this<00:04:07.230> has

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
match which is odd considering this has

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.890 
match which is odd considering this has
been<00:04:07.530> like<00:04:07.910> nearly<00:04:08.910> three<00:04:09.300> minutes<00:04:09.599> I'm<00:04:09.750> going

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
been like nearly three minutes I'm going

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.650 
been like nearly three minutes I'm going
to<00:04:10.019> assume<00:04:10.500> so<00:04:10.830> and<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.970> mean<00:04:12.120> try<00:04:12.360> and<00:04:12.450> hit<00:04:12.540> him

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
to assume so and I mean try and hit him

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.020 
to assume so and I mean try and hit him
up<00:04:12.810> in<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.019> air<00:04:13.140> again<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.709> probably<00:04:14.580> with

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
up in the air again and probably with

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.300 
up in the air again and probably with
another<00:04:15.060> full<00:04:15.480> power<00:04:15.690> energy<00:04:15.870> wave<00:04:16.280> no<00:04:17.280> I

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
another full power energy wave no I

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.710 
another full power energy wave no I
don't<00:04:17.609> actually<00:04:17.700> have<00:04:17.850> enough<00:04:17.940> ki<00:04:18.269> Wow<00:04:18.450> I

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
don't actually have enough ki Wow I

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.530 
don't actually have enough ki Wow I
think<00:04:19.350> that<00:04:19.470> -<00:04:20.250> took<00:04:20.669> it<00:04:20.820> all<00:04:20.940> out<00:04:20.970> of<00:04:21.239> me<00:04:21.419> so

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
think that - took it all out of me so

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.370 
think that - took it all out of me so
I'm<00:04:21.600> gonna<00:04:21.720> try<00:04:21.959> again<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:22.729> hope<00:04:23.729> he's<00:04:23.940> gonna

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
I'm gonna try again and hope he's gonna

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.100 
I'm gonna try again and hope he's gonna
blast<00:04:25.380> me<00:04:25.590> away<00:04:25.830> with<00:04:26.040> the<00:04:26.190> pulse<00:04:26.610> from

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
blast me away with the pulse from

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.719 
blast me away with the pulse from
entering<00:04:28.110> high<00:04:28.290> tension<00:04:28.650> so<00:04:29.040> hopefully<00:04:29.700> I

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
entering high tension so hopefully I

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.820 
entering high tension so hopefully I
don't<00:04:30.060> really<00:04:30.450> want<00:04:30.660> to<00:04:30.720> get<00:04:30.830> ultimate

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
don't really want to get ultimate

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.680 
don't really want to get ultimate
attacked<00:04:32.160> or<00:04:32.460> anything<00:04:33.090> like<00:04:33.300> that<00:04:33.360> so<00:04:33.600> I'm

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
attacked or anything like that so I'm

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.930 
attacked or anything like that so I'm
gonna<00:04:33.810> have<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.080> keep<00:04:34.979> my<00:04:35.190> guard<00:04:35.430> up<00:04:35.669> and

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
gonna have to keep my guard up and

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.150 
gonna have to keep my guard up and
probably<00:04:36.540> go<00:04:36.900> in<00:04:37.050> for<00:04:37.229> a<00:04:37.260> few<00:04:37.440> hits<00:04:37.680> just<00:04:37.800> so<00:04:38.040> he

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
probably go in for a few hits just so he

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.670 
probably go in for a few hits just so he
flinches<00:04:38.700> and<00:04:38.910> doesn't<00:04:39.600> get<00:04:39.720> any<00:04:39.900> opportunity

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
flinches and doesn't get any opportunity

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.190 
flinches and doesn't get any opportunity
to<00:04:40.710> use<00:04:41.610> it<00:04:41.760> on<00:04:41.850> me<00:04:41.940> but<00:04:42.120> I've<00:04:42.419> just<00:04:42.570> been<00:04:42.720> put

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
to use it on me but I've just been put

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.510 
to use it on me but I've just been put
into<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.530> wall<00:04:43.710> so<00:04:43.889> hopefully<00:04:44.130> he<00:04:44.220> doesn't

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
into the wall so hopefully he doesn't

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.270 
into the wall so hopefully he doesn't
think<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.479> use<00:04:45.950> super<00:04:46.950> move<00:04:47.100> or<00:04:47.220> anything

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
think and use super move or anything

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.370 
think and use super move or anything
like<00:04:47.639> that<00:04:47.729> and<00:04:48.120> he<00:04:48.750> actually<00:04:49.050> hit<00:04:49.139> the<00:04:49.229> wall

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
like that and he actually hit the wall

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.320 
like that and he actually hit the wall
that's<00:04:49.560> that's<00:04:50.370> pretty<00:04:50.669> funny<00:04:50.940> because<00:04:51.120> I

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
that's that's pretty funny because I

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.460 
that's that's pretty funny because I
thought<00:04:51.479> he<00:04:51.570> would<00:04:51.690> have<00:04:51.720> been<00:04:51.900> a<00:04:51.960> little<00:04:52.380> bit

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
thought he would have been a little bit

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.300 
thought he would have been a little bit
more<00:04:52.500> direct<00:04:52.950> than<00:04:53.040> that<00:04:53.280> so<00:04:54.740> damn<00:04:55.740> signature

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
more direct than that so damn signature

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.219 
more direct than that so damn signature
skill<00:04:56.550> I<00:04:56.970> didn't<00:04:57.240> think<00:04:57.360> to<00:04:57.510> dorias<00:04:57.930> could<00:04:58.080> get

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
skill I didn't think to dorias could get

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:58.940 
skill I didn't think to dorias could get
that<00:04:58.380> annoying

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
that annoying

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.730 
that annoying
I<00:04:58.979> thought<00:04:59.250> Android<00:04:59.700> 17s<00:05:00.300> was<00:05:00.389> annoying<00:05:01.020> looks

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
I thought Android 17s was annoying looks

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.290 
I thought Android 17s was annoying looks
like<00:05:01.950> the<00:05:02.310> dory<00:05:02.550> is<00:05:02.729> up<00:05:02.910> there<00:05:03.120> with<00:05:03.240> the

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
like the dory is up there with the

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.580 
like the dory is up there with the
annoying<00:05:04.229> signature<00:05:04.919> skill<00:05:05.190> so<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:06.410> think<00:05:07.410> I've

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
annoying signature skill so I think I've

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.350 
annoying signature skill so I think I've
nearly<00:05:07.740> got<00:05:07.979> him<00:05:08.160> down<00:05:08.550> to<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.789> point<00:05:09.150> where<00:05:09.330> I

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
nearly got him down to the point where I

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.529 
nearly got him down to the point where I
can<00:05:09.680> use<00:05:10.680> Cui's<00:05:11.190> ultimate<00:05:11.850> move<00:05:12.030> but<00:05:12.270> I<00:05:12.300> think

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
can use Cui's ultimate move but I think

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:13.940 
can use Cui's ultimate move but I think
I'll<00:05:12.630> get<00:05:12.720> a<00:05:12.780> few<00:05:13.020> more<00:05:13.139> hits<00:05:13.289> on<00:05:13.530> him<00:05:13.650> first

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
I'll get a few more hits on him first

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:20.740 
I'll get a few more hits on him first
and<00:05:16.070> yep<00:05:17.070> I<00:05:17.190> think<00:05:17.750> now<00:05:18.750> we've<00:05:19.020> got<00:05:19.229> enough<00:05:19.530> to

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
and yep I think now we've got enough to

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.100 
and yep I think now we've got enough to
use<00:05:21.750> hail<00:05:22.229> Lord<00:05:22.650> Frieza<00:05:22.950> or<00:05:23.760> our<00:05:24.330> Lord<00:05:24.750> Fraser

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
use hail Lord Frieza or our Lord Fraser

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.340 
use hail Lord Frieza or our Lord Fraser
I<00:05:25.169> think<00:05:25.530> it's<00:05:25.680> called<00:05:26.010> ah<00:05:26.570> Lord<00:05:27.570> Frieza<00:05:27.750> yep

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
I think it's called ah Lord Frieza yep

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.820 
I think it's called ah Lord Frieza yep
that's<00:05:28.680> that's<00:05:29.490> the<00:05:29.700> one<00:05:29.850> I<00:05:30.350> think<00:05:31.350> he<00:05:31.470> uses

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
that's that's the one I think he uses

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.779 
that's that's the one I think he uses
this<00:05:31.950> on<00:05:32.130> Vegeta<00:05:32.520> in<00:05:32.700> the<00:05:32.789> anime<00:05:33.180> and<00:05:34.789> Vegeta

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
this on Vegeta in the anime and Vegeta

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:40.700 
this on Vegeta in the anime and Vegeta
just<00:05:36.060> like<00:05:36.440> emerges<00:05:37.440> from<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:38.370> smoke<00:05:39.710> pretty

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
just like emerges from the smoke pretty

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.810 
just like emerges from the smoke pretty
much<00:05:40.889> unscathed

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
much unscathed

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.140 
much unscathed
so<00:05:42.180> I'm<00:05:42.419> gonna<00:05:42.539> quickly<00:05:42.810> switch<00:05:43.289> back<00:05:43.530> into

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
so I'm gonna quickly switch back into

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.210 
so I'm gonna quickly switch back into
the<00:05:45.150> g2<00:05:45.510> hopefully<00:05:46.080> Saban<00:05:46.470> doesn't<00:05:46.770> intercept

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
the g2 hopefully Saban doesn't intercept

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.430 
the g2 hopefully Saban doesn't intercept
oh<00:05:47.400> we<00:05:47.580> didn't<00:05:47.789> have<00:05:47.940> to<00:05:48.120> I<00:05:48.330> actually<00:05:49.020> really

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
oh we didn't have to I actually really

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.990 
oh we didn't have to I actually really
like<00:05:49.650> that<00:05:49.680> feature<00:05:50.039> that<00:05:50.190> if<00:05:50.669> you've

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
like that feature that if you've

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.730 
like that feature that if you've
switched<00:05:51.750> out<00:05:51.990> you<00:05:52.110> don't<00:05:52.229> need<00:05:52.380> to<00:05:52.500> do<00:05:52.620> it

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
switched out you don't need to do it

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.409 
switched out you don't need to do it
again<00:05:52.830> and<00:05:53.160> same<00:05:53.400> with<00:05:53.550> transformations<00:05:54.300> if

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
again and same with transformations if

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.330 
again and same with transformations if
you've<00:05:54.599> transformed<00:05:55.590> into<00:05:55.830> a<00:05:55.919> Super<00:05:56.310> Saiyan

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
you've transformed into a Super Saiyan

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.120 
you've transformed into a Super Saiyan
and<00:05:56.760> then<00:05:56.990> reverted<00:05:57.990> and<00:05:58.110> then<00:05:58.830> you<00:05:58.919> want<00:05:59.070> to

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
and then reverted and then you want to

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.830 
and then reverted and then you want to
transform<00:05:59.460> back<00:05:59.669> it'll<00:05:59.880> do<00:06:00.030> that<00:06:00.210> quick

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
transform back it'll do that quick

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.900 
transform back it'll do that quick
little<00:06:01.640> transforming

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
little transforming

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.910 
little transforming
which<00:06:03.090> is<00:06:03.240> actually<00:06:03.600> I<00:06:03.870> like<00:06:04.050> I<00:06:04.290> sort<00:06:04.650> of<00:06:04.710> like

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
which is actually I like I sort of like

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.980 
which is actually I like I sort of like
that<00:06:05.070> better<00:06:05.280> than<00:06:05.400> the<00:06:05.580> whole<00:06:05.990> yellow

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
that better than the whole yellow

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.650 
that better than the whole yellow
background<00:06:07.790> charging<00:06:08.790> up<00:06:08.910> sort<00:06:09.180> of<00:06:09.270> thing<00:06:09.510> and

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
background charging up sort of thing and

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.870 
background charging up sort of thing and
actually<00:06:10.020> it<00:06:10.620> actually<00:06:10.650> puts<00:06:11.100> more<00:06:11.250> flow<00:06:11.550> into

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
actually it actually puts more flow into
