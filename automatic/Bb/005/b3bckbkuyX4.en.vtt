00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.130 

okay<00:00:11.670> I'm<00:00:11.850> back<00:00:12.030> with<00:00:12.210> another<00:00:12.450> quick<00:00:12.660> video<00:00:12.930> I

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.140 
okay I'm back with another quick video I

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.750 
okay I'm back with another quick video I
have<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.560> little<00:00:13.830> bit<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.190> dilemma<00:00:14.460> that<00:00:14.610> I

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760 
have a little bit of a dilemma that I

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.270 
have a little bit of a dilemma that I
ran<00:00:14.940> into<00:00:15.350> and<00:00:16.350> came<00:00:16.619> up<00:00:16.770> with<00:00:16.950> a<00:00:16.980> little

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
ran into and came up with a little

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.040 
ran into and came up with a little
solution<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.450> it<00:00:18.540> was<00:00:18.660> kind<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.900> nifty

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
solution to it and it was kind of nifty

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.359 
solution to it and it was kind of nifty
so<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.380> thought<00:00:19.590> I'd<00:00:19.680> go<00:00:19.800> ahead<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:19.950> shoot<00:00:20.220> it

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
so I thought I'd go ahead and shoot it

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.190 
so I thought I'd go ahead and shoot it
and<00:00:20.550> share<00:00:21.180> it's<00:00:21.420> not<00:00:21.570> really<00:00:21.869> rocket<00:00:21.990> science

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
and share it's not really rocket science

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.019 
and share it's not really rocket science
pretty<00:00:22.680> easy<00:00:22.860> sure<00:00:23.279> some<00:00:23.520> of<00:00:23.610> you<00:00:23.700> have<00:00:23.820> done

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
pretty easy sure some of you have done

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.880 
pretty easy sure some of you have done
some<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.779> before<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.140> essentially<00:00:25.680> what

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
some of this before but essentially what

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.100 
some of this before but essentially what

product known as no leak about at
Walmart<00:01:01.650> and<00:01:01.860> this<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.000> what<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.210> used<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
Walmart and this is what I used for the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.509 
Walmart and this is what I used for the
engine<00:01:04.290> oil<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> different<00:01:04.949> car<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.220> had<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
engine oil on a different car I had a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.730 
engine oil on a different car I had a
rear<00:01:05.729> main<00:01:05.880> oil<00:01:05.909> seal<00:01:06.390> leak<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.470> seemed<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
rear main oil seal leak and it seemed to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.929 
rear main oil seal leak and it seemed to
have<00:01:07.890> worked<00:01:08.070> pretty<00:01:08.250> well<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.520> took<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> while

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
have worked pretty well it took a while

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.450 
have worked pretty well it took a while
but<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.869> sure<00:01:10.079> beats<00:01:10.380> pulling<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.799> transaxle

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
but it sure beats pulling the transaxle

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.219 
but it sure beats pulling the transaxle
out<00:01:11.579> I'm<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.540> we're<00:01:12.630> gonna<00:01:12.750> do<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:12.990> power

really<00:01:44.340> take<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.729> fluid<00:01:45.180> out<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.450> there<00:01:45.570> and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
really take that fluid out of there and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.980 
really take that fluid out of there and
refill<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.200> with<00:01:46.620> the<00:01:46.860> sealing<00:01:47.400> agent<00:01:48.210> so

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
refill that with the sealing agent so

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.630 
refill that with the sealing agent so
that<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.320> she<00:01:49.560> drives<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.100> it'll<00:01:50.370> start<00:01:50.549> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
that as she drives it it'll start to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.250 
that as she drives it it'll start to
seal<00:01:50.909> up<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> rack<00:01:51.330> unit<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.750> seals<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
seal up the rack unit the seals on the

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.870 
seal up the rack unit the seals on the
ends<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.100> outboard<00:01:53.369> ends<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.700> what's

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
ends on the outboard ends is what's

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.539 
ends on the outboard ends is what's
leaking<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.690> my<00:01:54.810> turkey<00:01:55.140> baster<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:56.100> bought

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
leaking but my turkey baster I bought

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.789 
leaking but my turkey baster I bought
one<00:01:56.700> for<00:01:56.729> five<00:01:57.030> bucks<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.690> used<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.770> a

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
one for five bucks and used it on a

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.670 
one for five bucks and used it on a
brake<00:01:59.040> system<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.909> car<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:01.170> pretty

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
brake system on this car and it pretty

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.609 
brake system on this car and it pretty
much<00:02:01.940> decayed<00:02:02.940> and<00:02:03.240> broke<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:04.020> turkey<00:02:04.470> baster

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
much decayed and broke the turkey baster

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.300 
much decayed and broke the turkey baster
the<00:02:04.890> chemicals<00:02:06.200> ruined<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.320> plastic<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.979> part

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
the chemicals ruined the plastic of part

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.210 
the chemicals ruined the plastic of part
of<00:02:08.519> the<00:02:08.670> turkey<00:02:09.629> baster<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.709> went<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.069> try<00:02:11.189> to

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
of the turkey baster so I went to try to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.130 
of the turkey baster so I went to try to
get<00:02:11.400> another<00:02:11.640> turkey<00:02:11.909> baster<00:02:12.299> and<00:02:12.540> for<00:02:12.959> five

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
get another turkey baster and for five

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.050 
get another turkey baster and for five
dollars<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.680> can<00:02:13.799> get<00:02:13.920> another<00:02:14.129> plastic<00:02:14.700> one

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
dollars I can get another plastic one

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.900 
dollars I can get another plastic one
that'll<00:02:15.269> just<00:02:15.390> break<00:02:16.140> again<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:16.799> I<00:02:17.069> decided<00:02:17.819> to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
that'll just break again so I decided to

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.970 
that'll just break again so I decided to
come<00:02:18.090> up<00:02:18.209> with<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> different<00:02:18.660> way<00:02:19.470> they<00:02:19.770> say

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
come up with a different way they say

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.650 
come up with a different way they say
that<00:02:20.099> they<00:02:20.220> sell<00:02:20.430> glass<00:02:20.670> ones<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.240> I'm<00:02:21.510> sure

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
that they sell glass ones and I'm sure

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.760 
that they sell glass ones and I'm sure
they<00:02:21.780> do<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:21.959> I<00:02:22.170> don't<00:02:22.290> want<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.440> spend<00:02:22.590> much

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
they do but I don't want to spend much

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.070 
they do but I don't want to spend much
money

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
money

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.650 
money
so<00:02:23.230> here's<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.980> bulb<00:02:24.220> off<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.180> turkey<00:02:25.480> baster

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
so here's the bulb off the turkey baster

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.790 
so here's the bulb off the turkey baster
that<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:27.970> wasted<00:02:28.450> it's<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:28.660> brand<00:02:28.900> new<00:02:28.990> bulb

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
that that I wasted it's a brand new bulb

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.610 
that that I wasted it's a brand new bulb
fanni<00:02:30.220> turkey<00:02:30.550> baster<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.290> my<00:02:32.470> old

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
fanni turkey baster and this is my old

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.400 
fanni turkey baster and this is my old
bottle<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:34.330> just<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:34.570> happens<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.200> size

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
bottle it just so happens that the size

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.180 
bottle it just so happens that the size
of<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:35.680> neck<00:02:36.010> fits<00:02:36.790> perfectly<00:02:37.830> this<00:02:38.830> bulb

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
of this neck fits perfectly this bulb

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.760 
of this neck fits perfectly this bulb
onto<00:02:39.880> here<00:02:40.240> so<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.750> can<00:02:40.870> wrap<00:02:41.050> wrapped<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.740> with

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
onto here so I can wrap wrapped it with

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.470 
onto here so I can wrap wrapped it with
electrical<00:02:42.250> tape<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.460> further<00:02:42.820> seal<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.330> and

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
electrical tape to further seal it and

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.790 
electrical tape to further seal it and
then<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:43.840> can<00:02:43.930> take<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.140> apart<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.440> change<00:02:44.680> it

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
then I can take it apart and change it

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.380 
then I can take it apart and change it
out<00:02:44.890> if<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.070> need<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.370> but<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:45.820> just<00:02:46.090> basically

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
out if I need to but I just basically

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.020 
out if I need to but I just basically
drilled<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.960> hole<00:02:46.990> in<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.290> bottom<00:02:47.590> of<00:02:47.740> it<00:02:48.030> let

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
drilled a hole in the bottom of it let

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.810 
drilled a hole in the bottom of it let
me<00:02:49.180> see<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.470> that's<00:02:50.470> maybe<00:02:51.430> just<00:02:51.730> slightly

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
me see that that's maybe just slightly

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.390 
me see that that's maybe just slightly
smaller<00:02:52.150> than<00:02:52.510> this<00:02:52.810> piece<00:02:53.020> of<00:02:53.170> hose<00:02:53.320> here<00:02:53.680> so

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
smaller than this piece of hose here so

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.380 
smaller than this piece of hose here so
I'm<00:02:54.520> going<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.670> do<00:02:54.760> is<00:02:54.880> I'm<00:02:55.000> going<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.150> put<00:02:55.270> this

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
I'm going to do is I'm going to put this

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.000 
I'm going to do is I'm going to put this
together<00:02:55.570> and<00:02:55.990> then<00:02:56.320> I'll<00:02:56.470> shoot<00:02:56.710> another

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
together and then I'll shoot another

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.590 
together and then I'll shoot another
quick<00:02:57.220> video<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.610> haven't<00:02:57.970> tried<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.150> yet<00:02:58.270> see

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
quick video I haven't tried it yet see

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.390 
quick video I haven't tried it yet see
how<00:02:58.690> it's<00:02:58.810> going<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.990> work<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.890> we'll<00:03:00.100> see<00:03:00.310> if

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
how it's going to work and we'll see if

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.470 
how it's going to work and we'll see if
it's<00:03:00.520> going<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.700> work<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:01.030> ways<00:03:01.180> kind<00:03:01.420> of

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
it's going to work that ways kind of

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.060 
it's going to work that ways kind of
more<00:03:01.570> disposable<00:03:02.020> and<00:03:02.320> I<00:03:02.410> just<00:03:02.590> have<00:03:02.740> to<00:03:02.890> if<00:03:02.950> it

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
more disposable and I just have to if it

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.710 
more disposable and I just have to if it
wastes<00:03:03.550> that<00:03:03.580> plastic<00:03:04.180> bottle<00:03:04.540> then<00:03:04.660> I'll

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
wastes that plastic bottle then I'll

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.790 
wastes that plastic bottle then I'll
just<00:03:04.840> find<00:03:05.020> another<00:03:05.110> bottle<00:03:07.470> okay<00:03:08.470> here<00:03:08.680> we

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
just find another bottle okay here we

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.990 
just find another bottle okay here we
are<00:03:08.830> back<00:03:09.100> again<00:03:09.280> with<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:11.020> homemade<00:03:12.000> turkey

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
are back again with the homemade turkey

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.550 
are back again with the homemade turkey
baster<00:03:13.300> put<00:03:13.450> together<00:03:13.570> there's<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.110> bottle<00:03:14.410> I

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
baster put together there's the bottle I

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.190 
baster put together there's the bottle I
did<00:03:15.520> put<00:03:15.820> some<00:03:15.850> electrical<00:03:16.360> tape<00:03:16.390> on<00:03:16.900> that

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
did put some electrical tape on that

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.600 
did put some electrical tape on that
seal<00:03:17.470> there<00:03:18.630> seems<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.720> be<00:03:20.100> quite<00:03:21.100> quite<00:03:21.370> good

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
seal there seems to be quite quite good

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.660 
seal there seems to be quite quite good
I<00:03:21.640> guess<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.600> then<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.320> can<00:03:23.500> see<00:03:23.709> here<00:03:24.490> the

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
I guess and then you can see here the

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.910

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
aren't long enough to do this but let's

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.330 
aren't long enough to do this but let's
give<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.320> try<00:03:32.440> or<00:03:32.560> see<00:03:32.830> if<00:03:32.890> it'll<00:03:33.010> work<00:03:33.130> I

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
give it a try or see if it'll work I

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.190 
give it a try or see if it'll work I
haven't<00:03:33.489> tried<00:03:33.670> this<00:03:33.760> yet<00:03:33.820> so<00:03:34.209> let<00:03:35.080> me

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
haven't tried this yet so let me

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.640 
haven't tried this yet so let me
position<00:03:36.540> position<00:03:37.540> this<00:03:37.930> for<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.230> camera

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
position position this for the camera

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.960 
position position this for the camera

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
to squeeze squeeze the bulb let's see

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.399 
to squeeze squeeze the bulb let's see
what<00:03:43.570> we<00:03:43.660> got<00:03:43.870> here<00:03:47.940> yeah

what we got here yeah
bulbs<00:03:51.040> letting<00:03:51.310> loose<00:03:52.799> still<00:03:53.799> letting<00:03:54.099> loose

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
bulbs letting loose still letting loose

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.190 
bulbs letting loose still letting loose
it's<00:03:54.790> coming<00:03:55.120> out<00:03:55.269> coming<00:03:55.900> out<00:03:57.689> okay<00:03:58.689> there<00:03:59.109> we

00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 
go

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.800 
go
huh<00:03:59.859> I<00:04:00.280> can't<00:04:00.700> tell<00:04:00.909> how<00:04:00.969> much<00:04:01.120> is<00:04:01.299> in<00:04:01.450> there

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
huh I can't tell how much is in there

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.140 
huh I can't tell how much is in there
but<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.680> level<00:04:03.010> has<00:04:03.129> gone<00:04:03.219> down<00:04:03.639> pretty<00:04:04.060> well

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
but the level has gone down pretty well

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.530 
but the level has gone down pretty well
so<00:04:04.599> we're<00:04:04.870> gonna<00:04:05.549> put<00:04:06.549> this<00:04:06.670> in<00:04:06.730> an<00:04:06.969> old<00:04:07.120> olive

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
so we're gonna put this in an old olive

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:18.920 
so we're gonna put this in an old olive
jar<00:04:15.660> mercs<00:04:16.660> good<00:04:16.959> let's<00:04:17.590> do<00:04:17.739> some<00:04:17.919> more<00:04:18.039> here<00:04:18.250> I

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
jar mercs good let's do some more here I

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.689 
jar mercs good let's do some more here I
can<00:04:20.009> there's<00:04:21.009> still<00:04:21.190> some<00:04:21.340> lip<00:04:21.489> in<00:04:21.609> there

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
can there's still some lip in there

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:23.520 
can there's still some lip in there
because<00:04:21.820> of<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.120> way<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:22.930> bottle<00:04:23.259> is<00:04:23.320> made

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
because of the way the bottle is made

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:31.969 
because of the way the bottle is made
but<00:04:24.780> it<00:04:25.780> goes<00:04:28.470> no<00:04:29.470> leaks<00:04:29.800> no<00:04:30.330> air<00:04:31.330> leaks<00:04:31.599> well

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
but it goes no leaks no air leaks well

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.620 
but it goes no leaks no air leaks well
advantage<00:04:32.979> to<00:04:33.130> this<00:04:33.250> is<00:04:33.460> if<00:04:33.639> that<00:04:34.180> chemical

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
advantage to this is if that chemical

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.810 
advantage to this is if that chemical
gets<00:04:34.720> in<00:04:34.900> there<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:36.090> trashes<00:04:37.090> that<00:04:37.270> bottle

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
gets in there and trashes that bottle

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.210 
gets in there and trashes that bottle
I'll<00:04:39.820> just<00:04:39.940> find<00:04:40.150> another<00:04:40.240> bottle<00:04:40.979> that<00:04:41.979> same

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
I'll just find another bottle that same

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.719 
I'll just find another bottle that same
size<00:04:42.460> neck<00:04:42.789> so<00:04:43.830> speaking<00:04:44.830> of<00:04:44.949> neck<00:04:45.220> this<00:04:45.580> is

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
probably a could be considered a redneck
