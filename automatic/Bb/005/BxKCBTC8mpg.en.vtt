00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:04.500
 from the historic building in Berlin to a construction in Munich in the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.830
 The Allianz Arena will certainly also make history last week 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.330
 In the stadium, the two giant video panels were hung up 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.219
 Europe's largest inner workings and how the gigantic 17 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.289
 Tons of heavy screens are attached 50 feet above the ground 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.439
 show now 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.830
 Snow as far as the eye can see with one 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.109
 Hardt winter, the builders did not expect 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.659
 For weeks, chronic fatigue has made new working conditions difficult 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.110
 Munich Stadium 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.640
 but the schedule must be met the fitters work between 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.640
 Bunch down 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.640
 Meanwhile, the two huge video panels from Taiwan are in the stadium 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.710
 arrived 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.050
 At a height of seven meters, around twelve meters wide, they are the largest in the world 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.400
 Whole europe 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.160
 600,000 tiny LEDs form the surface 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.370
 and ensure perfect picture reproduction 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.310
 During assembly, the bulbs can be easily damaged 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.420
 Christopher Bankhaus is convinced that all are here in order 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.030
 A little later on there is no problem settling down 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.070
 the concept explains Jürgen Pfaff becomes in principle as on earth 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.910
 flat 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.500
 but also at home 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.440
 Percent I have 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.610
 The moth 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.460
 from this 2 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.460
 Rainer Brüderle still loud "Telegraaf" 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.840
 but full of luminosity 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.740
 that on 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.580
 that's for riot 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.580
 Keep at least 1 meter apart 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.010
 the 17 ton flat screen is still standing on a scaffolding 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.000
 overthrown 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.970
 the nearly one hundred square meter screen consists of 72 individual ones 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:43.920
 months 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.460
 Every single Bethmann supplies her own state power cable 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.250
 a man in the factory consumes the screen so much power every hour 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.250
 the 8 one 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.470
 now comes the most dangerous part 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.830
 when the scaffolding on the back is removed and the heavy load 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.560
 hanging on the crane oscillates uncontrollably back and forth 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.560
 and may be damaged at the last moment 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.879
 while the blackboard becomes tight in the direction of the roof in slow motion 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.040
 Parking garage and his team prepare the computers in the technology directly under 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.199
 stone 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:29.519
 now it turns out that the structural engineer was right with her calculations 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.900
 three to a maximum of nine inches allowed to lower the roof 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.529
 in the end it is just under 2 3 centimeters 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:40.139
 The assembling and mounting of the two screens has a total of almost two 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:41.459
 Weeks again 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.609
 the next step requires extreme concentration 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.869
 At about 20 meters, the table will be posted and attached to two huge ones 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:50.319
 Walls attached 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.319
 the ten millimeters by millimeter towards the roof Fr 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:06.929
 On the back of the screens you can also after the installation at 50 meters 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:08.609
 Height still work 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.139
 via a so-called cap knoke-kahner the modules from behind 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.449
 Here above, Christoph r Parkhaus establishes the connection to the technical center 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.750
 is Rochau Outdoors before everything becomes 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.939
 also the Spurs briefly connected 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.129
 a total of 8000 euros from where he 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.459
 that she does with it 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.819
 In the new arena, viewers will be able to watch at least one of the seats from any seat 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.489
 optimally use both screens 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.429
 thinking in the technician rocky 

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:54.729
 at the screens in the south curve and in the north curve of the future one 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:58.129
 wm-stadions next to perfect pictures 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.009
 The finest algae can be seen exactly 

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:04.639
 The premiere in the stadium has passed the test image with success 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:11.429
 as it is with the Bernerzeit ch, they do not see far here PS
