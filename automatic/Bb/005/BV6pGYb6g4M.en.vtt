00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.930
 so I present you specialty is 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.019
 the new machine marketed by 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.789
 NestlÃ© since September 2010 in France 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.420
 it is a machine that has been developed 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.730
 exclusively for the summer so its 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.210
 peculiarity is that on the one hand there is 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.250
 a filter that allows 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.790
 filter the water and remove all the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.649
 bad taste of chlorine and limestone 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.739
 then she has a system of 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:52.190
 capsule recognition that allows for 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.350
 the rocket each tea to perfection in 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.720
 perfectly controlling the temperature 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.079
 the high degree of infusion time and at the 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.629
 close second 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.579
 its shape has been studied also for 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.340
 allow the leaves to open 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.369
 completely when the water enters the 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.439
 capsule is also it's a capsule 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.570
 Aluminum helps preserve the 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.509
 out of any outside influence 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.560
 know the air the light the moisture that 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:22.700
 could alter the taste of summer hear and 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.220
 so it's for tea conservation 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.479
 to make the machine work it's 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.479
 very simple just turn it on 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.700
 then just choose the tea so 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.799
 we have a range of over 25 t 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.820
 today so summer summer origin 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.200
 scented organic herbal teas and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.429
 limited editions like this 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.070
 of today that we present at 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.920
 green 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.380
 so I hope the capsule in the machine 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.649
 just close to put the cup 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.940
 and just press the button 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.100
 so the machine first recognizes the 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.869
 capsule and determines the temperature and 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.880
 the brewing time so here it is 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.319
 of a green tea so it's a temperature 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.269
 which is close to 80 degrees 3 then 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.489
 the water arrives in the capsule moistens 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.530
 the leaves the leaves open and 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.090
 then start the merger slowly that's 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.470
 an infusion that is dynamic there is a 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.810
 water movement in the capsule it's 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.769
 for that the water comes out little by little 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.840
 in the Cup 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.720
 because it was any 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.600
 car it changes yes in fact it's 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.880
 really to reveal all the aromas 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.310
 the flavors of tea as it is a 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.910
 leaf tea can be seen here in 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.900
 the in the green of which cdt in leaves 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.609
 must know that she was actually 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.489
 represents less than 1% of the production 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:45.030
 world tea so we chose summer 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.609
