but you kind of want to use light
pressure<00:01:59.100> now<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.610> just<00:01:59.729> apply<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.200> all

not<00:02:35.390> but<00:02:36.530> it's<00:02:37.530> gonna<00:02:37.650> keep<00:02:37.830> going<00:02:37.950> in<00:02:38.100> small

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
not but it's gonna keep going in small

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.170 
not but it's gonna keep going in small
circles<00:02:39.290> now<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.350> might<00:02:40.560> think<00:02:40.590> again<00:02:41.340> more

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
circles now you might think again more

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.880 
circles now you might think again more
so<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.360> just<00:02:42.540> wait<00:02:42.630> till<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.840> gets<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.020> shine<00:02:43.260> no

around here yeah I get all the areas I

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.360 
around here yeah I get all the areas I
have<00:03:45.720> yet<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:45.989> try<00:03:46.350> this<00:03:46.410> technique<00:03:46.890> on<00:03:47.130> the

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
have yet to try this technique on the

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.610 
have yet to try this technique on the
sides<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.270> shoe<00:03:48.480> but<00:03:49.260> I'm<00:03:49.380> sure<00:03:49.530> it

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
probably works just as well I still need

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.430 
probably works just as well I still need
to<00:03:52.590> shine<00:03:52.770> up<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:53.040> sides<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.400> my<00:03:53.489> shoe<00:03:57.440> just
