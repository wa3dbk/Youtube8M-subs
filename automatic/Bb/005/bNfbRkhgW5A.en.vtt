00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.390
 for hundreds of thousands of years the 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.910
 man has dreamed of living forever 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.700
 before the invention of writing this 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.340
 it was impossible 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.110
 thanks to her we know of the existence 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.180
 of people who lived thousands of years ago 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.310
 years people who used the 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.840
 writing to tell us their stories and 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.840
 share your knowledge 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.609
 that's why I decipher the writings 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:39.370
 old has fascinated the man during 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:43.440

 we can not decipher something so strange 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.070
 known as codex voynich the book 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.900
 most mysterious of the world was discovered 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.840
 by the New Yorker wilfried voynich to 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.970
 early 20th century it was 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.790
 on one of his trips in europe looking 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.559
 of strange books but never imagined 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.870
 that in his visit to the mondragón village 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.390
 would find the strangest book of the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.430
 history 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.890
 this book written by hand with 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.650
 approximately 200 sheets fascinated the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.869
 american voynich it was a text 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.479
 medieval in a very strange language 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.640
 and stranger so strange that voynich 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.920
 I spend the rest of your days trying 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.440
 decipher it and died without even 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.630
 get closer to it 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.790
 but what is it that makes this book so 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.130
 strange that mysteries contains 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.600
 after the death of voynich the book 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.130
 I finish in the library of the 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.160
 yale university and has been analyzed 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.200
 for years by experts from the CIA the 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.780
 book has been described by many as 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.870
 the most impressive and mysterious seems 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.960
 a book written in another world 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.420
 It is divided into six sections 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.070
 herbalism astronomy biology 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.860
 pharmaceutical cosmology and a section 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.990
 with recipes you know this thanks to the 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.880
 illustrations that has illustrations 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.250
 with nonexistent plants 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.899
 or even astronomical images that 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.899
 they seem made from another planet 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.579
 the book contains illustrations of 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.040
 astronomy and cosmology extremely 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:19.019
 detailed in antiquity was prescribed 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.750
 medicinally to the people in agreement 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.700
 to his zodiac sign it is believed that the book 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.099
 It is a medicinal herbal treatise 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.110
 this has led the researchers to 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.629
 specify the approximate age of the manu 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.209
 written that it would be about 500 years of 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.090
 unfortunately, it has not been 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.860
 could decipher this mysterious book 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.780
 It is written in a kind of Arabic 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.569
 encrypted and until now it has not been possible 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.030
 decipher 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.799
 for many this is just a fraud of the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.749
 middle age but the truth is that the 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.560
 cryptographers argue that it is a language 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:54.269
 real but unknown 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.980
 fifa rule known as this is a 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.959
 rule which present all 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.969
 languages ​​in which short words 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.030
 they are repeated more frequently in the 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:05.099
 texts this written hand contains all 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.319
 the linguistic laws that a 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.780
 real language but it is encrypted from a 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.790
 simply amazing way so 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.109
 surprising that possibly never 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.109
 let's know what it says 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.660
 recently some cryptographers 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.520
 many of them fans claim to have 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.440
 deciphered some words from the book 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.200
 but they are simply deductions that 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.330
 do with the drawings surely these 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.970
 people say this to be able to study 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.220
 the book personally today 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.080
 not even the largest cryptographers 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.840
 have come to approach decipher the 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.000
 language 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.069
 the first time I heard the story 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.440
 from the manu written voynich impressed me
