00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
pros and cons of that is that my system

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.459 
pros and cons of that is that my system
very<00:00:30.269> quickly<00:00:32.840> cycled<00:00:33.840> which<00:00:34.020> was<00:00:34.230> good<00:00:34.440> I

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
very quickly cycled which was good I

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.760 
very quickly cycled which was good I
never<00:00:34.590> really<00:00:35.010> had<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.489> major<00:00:36.469> ammonia<00:00:37.469> spike

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
never really had a major ammonia spike

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.959

or anything like that

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.000 
or anything like that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
so I got some pretty good quality rock

so I got some pretty good quality rock
the<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.730> downfall<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.550> did

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
issues and critters that I'm a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
issues and critters that I'm a
necessarily<00:00:57.000> would<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.239> introduced<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.899> my

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
necessarily would have introduced to my

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.549 
necessarily would have introduced to my
tank<00:00:58.430> by<00:00:59.430> my<00:00:59.640> choice<00:01:00.020> you<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.140> see<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.350> do<00:01:01.440> have

a<00:01:01.680> little<00:01:01.800> bit<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.129> diatom<00:01:02.850> issue<00:01:03.149> which

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
a little bit of a diatom issue which

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.109 
a little bit of a diatom issue which
seems<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.229> be<00:01:04.379> revolved<00:01:04.890> getting<00:01:05.790> better

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
seems to be revolved getting better

seems to be revolved getting better
it<00:01:07.080> was<00:01:07.229> definitely<00:01:07.740> worse<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.400> as<00:01:08.970> i've

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it was definitely worse but as i've

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.840 
it was definitely worse but as i've
switched<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.840> an<00:01:09.990> RO<00:01:10.170> di<00:01:10.590> unit<00:01:11.250> it's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
switched to an RO di unit it's

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.440 
switched to an RO di unit it's
definitely<00:01:12.780> gotten<00:01:12.990> better<00:01:13.880> inside<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.150> tank

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
definitely gotten better inside the tank

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.600 
definitely gotten better inside the tank

they<00:02:42.500> moved<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:42.860> water<00:02:43.150> quite<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.180> bit<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:44.450> got

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
they moved the water quite a bit I got

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.680 
they moved the water quite a bit I got
good<00:02:44.810> circulation<00:02:45.260> in<00:02:46.010> around<00:02:46.250> my<00:02:46.430> live<00:02:47.300> rock

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
good circulation in around my live rock

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
carbon in there which seems to do quite

I'm doing some Foss guard in there as

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.990 
I'm doing some Foss guard in there as
well<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.620> kind<00:04:43.770> of<00:04:43.890> keep<00:04:44.040> my<00:04:44.190> phosphates<00:04:44.760> under

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
well to kind of keep my phosphates under

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.930 
well to kind of keep my phosphates under
control<00:04:45.390> my<00:04:45.570> algae<00:04:45.960> growth<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.940> that's

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
control my algae growth and that's

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.400 
control my algae growth and that's
definitely<00:04:48.150> come<00:04:48.540> down<00:04:48.750> since<00:04:49.080> I<00:04:49.200> started

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
definitely come down since I started

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.300 
definitely come down since I started
using<00:04:49.650> that<00:04:49.830> Foss<00:04:50.220> guard<00:04:51.950> obviously<00:04:52.950> just<00:04:53.160> a

marine land heater in there as well

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.040 
marine land heater in there as well
which<00:04:56.400> keeps<00:04:56.670> my<00:04:56.850> temperature<00:04:57.240> quite<00:04:57.570> regular

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
which keeps my temperature quite regular

update and we'll see how it looks in a

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:38.649 
update and we'll see how it looks in a
few<00:06:38.159> months
