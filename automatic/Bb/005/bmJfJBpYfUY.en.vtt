00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello friends of the frame welcome to 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.930
 dvd criticism and now everything about mel 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.150
 gibson's last movie is now going to the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.610
 movie theaters did not really work out so well 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.020
 But these days in the home cinema appears 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.529
 and by that I mean get the gringo love 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.810
 times 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.310
 I had a lot of stress at work so 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.140
 I decided that for a long time 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.949
 to make planned mexico holidays 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.660
 You can hear the contrary but me 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.170
 I have the limit without any problems 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.170
 happens 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.800
 He gives me a cheap accommodation 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.930
 recommended I have some great 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.710
 snapshots of me i had a lot 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.710
 contact to the 1 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.950
 but we can see that something is going on 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.570
 pretty lazy 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.970
 because you feel completely comfortable 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.660
 where is my money and still there is 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:05.030
 problems 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:05.449
 next to a ca of the already done well 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.710
 to 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.710
 we will not let it come 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.979
 when my holidays run smoothly 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.460
 I have to do that right now 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.460
 Companies 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.580
 I was really homesick right only 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.580
 a joke 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.850
 I will not come back 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.420
 gary gray 0 96 minutes is from 18 years 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.980
 Released tells the story of one 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.630
 mannes first of the man first 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.970
 not at all his name after celebrated 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.280
 while driving his ambulance with 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.020
 about two million dollars loot 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.280
 board exactly how he got it 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.710
 not so sure but he 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.000
 trying to escape to mexico 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.100
 and to make it even just as 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.960
 to break through the fence because of that 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.970
 on the mexican side arrested 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.740
 that is partly because of that 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.600
 the bulls are mutually corrupt but 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.890
 the mexicans as they see the prey 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.240
 say we'll take care of that 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.640
 himself in custody 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.410
 and so it is just this thief in 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.120
 a prison again where he almost the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.670
 only american is and fast the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.500
 legamen gets ringo or lg ingo 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.750
 and tries to work his way up there 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.460
 because in this prison everything is 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.230
 somehow a little different people 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.180
 can actually live there voluntarily 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.740
 during the day the prison leave it 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.450
 flourishes its own drug but also 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.760
 food market within this 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.870
 prison and the whole packed with 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.340
 the story of this man of 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.410
 try to work one up 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.670
 Meet little boy and his 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.680
 story and the legs one 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.870
 strange friendship connects 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.660
 funny is very action-heavy 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.310
 partly also bloody just fsk18 and 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.270
 somehow the basic story and comes 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.430
 different, therefore 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.350
 which is why gringo really likes it 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.970
 but looks quite good a rather disposable 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.260
 Number is played neatly by mel 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.450
 gibson cabbage talked 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.890
 with voiceover in the original quite good 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.989
 the strip is like that 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.850
 mediocre interesting has just 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.380
 bock on it or you can leave it and 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.940
 once you have seen the movie then it is 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.959
 the number by the way gibson gives it 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.850
 also one or the other known 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.280
 Face especially on American 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.470
 side but it is this strip the way 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.700
 you can see in the gray area 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.380
 you do not have to see anything is nothing 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.610
 but missed bad is not synonymous 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.780
 Worrying the good times 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.400
 one and a half hours and takes the 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.410
 heat to watch movie there after so 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.360
 I like the actor lately 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.230
 almost the hella is deeply unemployed in 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.850
 it has one or the other 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.370
 public escapade with his 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.840
 There should be political orientation 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.940
 watch the movie in any case and 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.560
 otherwise only to say the money 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.260
 want gringo from me as an action 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.730
 quotes friller six out of ten 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.680
 get possible points 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.360
 the evaluation also shows the total 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.780
 film can be unacceptable you can 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.370
 do 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.010
 that has always been this short one 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.659
 review on red bull racing also burden 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.980
 thumb that we do not plan creates 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.629
