would<00:00:03.179> like<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.449> further<00:00:03.750> your<00:00:04.319> study<00:00:04.710> on<00:00:04.950> some

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
would like to further your study on some

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.049 
would like to further your study on some
rhythm<00:00:05.609> ideas<00:00:05.970> by<00:00:06.600> talking<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:07.290> about

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:08.059 
rhythm ideas by talking to you about

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.030 
rhythm ideas by talking to you about
dynamics<00:00:09.059> okay<00:00:09.750> up<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.469> this<00:00:10.590> point<00:00:10.710> with<00:00:11.010> our

rhythm different rhythm things that
we've<00:00:12.900> been<00:00:13.019> doing<00:00:13.200> we've<00:00:13.500> been<00:00:13.889> talking

we've been doing we've been talking

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.589 
we've been doing we've been talking
about<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.730> know<00:00:14.820> quarter<00:00:15.120> notes<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.540> eighth

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
about you know quarter notes and eighth

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.320 
about you know quarter notes and eighth
notes<00:00:15.870> or<00:00:16.260> down<00:00:17.190> strumming<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.789> up<00:00:17.940> strumming

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
notes or down strumming and up strumming

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.910 
notes or down strumming and up strumming
missing<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.750> down<00:00:18.869> here<00:00:19.140> missing<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.560> up<00:00:19.680> here

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
missing it down here missing it up here

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.769 
missing it down here missing it up here
creating<00:00:20.760> different<00:00:20.910> patterns<00:00:21.449> which<00:00:21.630> is

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
creating different patterns which is

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.060 
creating different patterns which is
great<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.289> need<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.529> learn<00:00:22.650> how<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.890> do

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
great and you need to learn how to do

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.279 
great and you need to learn how to do
that<00:00:23.220> it's<00:00:23.400> very<00:00:23.490> important<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.660> next<00:00:25.109> step

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
that it's very important the next step

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.320 
that it's very important the next step
is<00:00:25.350> once<00:00:26.039> you've<00:00:26.189> developed<00:00:26.550> some<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.119> those

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
is once you've developed some of those

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.810 
is once you've developed some of those
things<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.560> want<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.890> do<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.670> want

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
things what you want to do is you want

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.330 
things what you want to do is you want
to<00:00:30.150> start<00:00:30.390> trying<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.900> utilize<00:00:31.170> what<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.040> refer

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
to start trying to utilize what we refer

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.450 
to start trying to utilize what we refer
to<00:00:32.369> as<00:00:32.520> dynamics<00:00:33.649> for<00:00:34.649> instance<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:35.370> you

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
to as dynamics for instance like if you

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.030 
to as dynamics for instance like if you
know<00:00:35.550> what<00:00:35.700> accent<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.989> accent<00:00:37.590> something

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
know what accent is to accent something

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.400 
know what accent is to accent something
or<00:00:38.219> make<00:00:38.460> certain<00:00:39.000> things<00:00:39.300> sound<00:00:39.629> louder<00:00:40.050> or

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
or make certain things sound louder or

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.150 
or make certain things sound louder or
softer<00:00:40.850> than<00:00:41.850> other<00:00:42.059> things<00:00:42.390> okay<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.950> can

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
softer than other things okay we can

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160 
softer than other things okay we can
create<00:00:44.370> dynamics<00:00:45.059> by<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.930> instance

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
create dynamics by for instance

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.569 
create dynamics by for instance
strumming<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> lot<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.190> then<00:00:47.309> all<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.550> sudden

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
strumming a lot and then all of a sudden

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.880 
strumming a lot and then all of a sudden
we<00:00:47.879> strum<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.480> little<00:00:48.750> bit<00:00:48.930> or<00:00:49.469> strumming

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
we strum just a little bit or strumming

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.380 
we strum just a little bit or strumming
really<00:00:50.100> hard<00:00:50.370> then<00:00:50.579> strumming<00:00:50.940> really<00:00:51.149> soft

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
really hard then strumming really soft

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.430 
really hard then strumming really soft
there's<00:00:51.570> lots<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.870> different<00:00:51.930> ways<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.350> we

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
there's lots of different ways that we

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.080 
there's lots of different ways that we
can<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.430> what<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.579> want<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.820> do<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.030> I

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
can do this so what I want to do is I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.700 
can do this so what I want to do is I
want<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.300> take<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> chord<00:00:54.840> progression<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.469> want

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
want to take a chord progression I want

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.139 
want to take a chord progression I want
to<00:00:55.739> play<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.280> right<00:00:56.430> now<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.000> then<00:00:57.120> I

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
was doing to try and create some sort of

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.310 
was doing to try and create some sort of
environment<00:01:02.670> or<00:01:03.120> attitude<00:01:03.960> when<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.140> was

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
environment or attitude when I was

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.929 
environment or attitude when I was
playing<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.650> song<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.460> I'm<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.700> going<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
playing the song so I'm just going to

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.750 
playing the song so I'm just going to
play<00:01:06.770> GDC<00:01:07.770> I'm<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.130> kind<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.369> sticking<00:01:08.580> with

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
play GDC I'm just kind of sticking with

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.210 
play GDC I'm just kind of sticking with
GQ<00:01:09.000> g<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.470> i'm<00:01:10.560> using<00:01:10.740> g<00:01:11.070> d<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.119> c<00:01:12.869> ok<00:01:13.799> so

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
GQ g here so i'm using g d and c ok so

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.070 
GQ g here so i'm using g d and c ok so
here's<00:01:14.430> my<00:01:14.490> song

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:45.010 

you

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.270 

see<00:01:46.020> how<00:01:46.109> it's<00:01:46.289> kind<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.189> out

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
see how it's kind of going in and out

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.870 
see how it's kind of going in and out
the<00:01:48.500> dynamic<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.619> my<00:01:49.799> playing<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.340> accent

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
the dynamic of my playing the accent

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.730 
the dynamic of my playing the accent
Inge<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.179> kind<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.659> moving<00:01:51.929> in<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.350> moving<00:01:52.380> out

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
Inge is kind of moving in and moving out

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.800 
Inge is kind of moving in and moving out
moving<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.490> moving<00:01:53.520> out<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.539> really

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
moving in and moving out and I really

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.690 
moving in and moving out and I really
like<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.110> use<00:01:55.289> thicker<00:01:55.770> guitar<00:01:56.219> picks<00:01:56.490> for

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
like to use thicker guitar picks for

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.950 
like to use thicker guitar picks for
that<00:01:56.819> because<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.179> night<00:01:57.299> when<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.509> really<00:01:57.780> want

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
that because I night when I really want

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.149 
that because I night when I really want
to<00:01:58.020> get<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.289> there<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:58.679> strike<00:01:59.009> those

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
to get in there I can strike those

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.010 
to get in there I can strike those
strings<00:01:59.429> really<00:01:59.610> hard<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.539> sounds<00:02:00.990> really

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
strings really hard and it sounds really

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.649 
strings really hard and it sounds really
loud<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.439> then<00:02:01.709> I<00:02:01.799> can<00:02:01.950> back<00:02:02.130> up<00:02:02.429> a<00:02:02.700> lot<00:02:03.569> of

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
loud and then I can back up a lot of

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.029 
loud and then I can back up a lot of
times<00:02:03.810> when<00:02:03.869> people<00:02:03.929> use<00:02:04.259> guitar<00:02:04.590> picks<00:02:04.829> for

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
times when people use guitar picks for

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.770 
times when people use guitar picks for
instance<00:02:05.369> if<00:02:05.459> you<00:02:05.549> use<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.759> thinner<00:02:06.329> pick<00:02:06.600> it

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
instance if you use a thinner pick it

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.330 
instance if you use a thinner pick it
doesn't<00:02:07.469> matter<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:07.890> use<00:02:08.009> whatever<00:02:08.160> you

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
doesn't matter you can use whatever you

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.309 
doesn't matter you can use whatever you
want<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:09.119> what<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.269> found<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.780> thinner<00:02:10.019> pics

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
want but what I found is thinner pics

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.170 
want but what I found is thinner pics
when<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.890> really<00:02:11.280> want<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.519> get<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:11.970> strum

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
when you really want to get in and strum

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.120 
when you really want to get in and strum
those<00:02:12.360> strings<00:02:12.660> they<00:02:13.110> just<00:02:13.319> bend<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:14.069> you

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
those strings they just bend so you

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.589 
those strings they just bend so you
don't<00:02:14.310> really<00:02:14.400> get<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.670> lot<00:02:14.819> of<00:02:14.880> volume<00:02:15.120> off<00:02:15.450> of

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
don't really get a lot of volume off of

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.900 
don't really get a lot of volume off of
them<00:02:15.860> medium<00:02:16.860> pics<00:02:17.099> again<00:02:17.549> whatever<00:02:17.760> is

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
them medium pics again whatever is

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.150 
them medium pics again whatever is
comfortable<00:02:18.120> for<00:02:18.329> you<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:19.349> heavier<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.920> pic

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
comfortable for you the heavier the pic

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.920 
comfortable for you the heavier the pic
the<00:02:20.610> more<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:20.819> can<00:02:21.090> get<00:02:21.269> in<00:02:21.420> there<00:02:21.569> but<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.810> also

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
the more I can get in there but you also

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.930 
the more I can get in there but you also
have<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.230> understand<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.799> with<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.579> heavier

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
have to understand that with a heavier

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.050 
have to understand that with a heavier
pic<00:02:24.239> I<00:02:24.450> have<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.140> be<00:02:25.290> available<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.160> make

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
pic I have to be available to make

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.089 
pic I have to be available to make
things<00:02:27.390> sound<00:02:27.630> quieter<00:02:28.260> by<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.709> way<00:02:28.950> I'm

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
things sound quieter by the way I'm

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.680 
things sound quieter by the way I'm
strumming<00:02:29.579> for<00:02:30.150> instance<00:02:30.390> if<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.540> use<00:02:30.660> a

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
strumming for instance if you use a

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.940 
strumming for instance if you use a
thinner<00:02:31.019> pick<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.380> could<00:02:31.530> kind<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.769> beat<00:02:31.920> the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
thinner pick you could kind of beat the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.190 
thinner pick you could kind of beat the
heck<00:02:32.190> out<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.370> those<00:02:32.549> strings<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.150> it's<00:02:34.019> still

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
heck out of those strings and it's still

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.900 
heck out of those strings and it's still
going<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.380> sound<00:02:34.530> fairly<00:02:34.799> quiet<00:02:35.190> with<00:02:35.880> a

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
going to sound fairly quiet with a

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.089 
going to sound fairly quiet with a
heavier<00:02:36.390> pick<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:36.959> have<00:02:37.079> to<00:02:37.230> learn<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.739> back

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
heavier pick you have to learn to back

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.979 
heavier pick you have to learn to back
off<00:02:38.400> otherwise<00:02:39.299> everything's<00:02:39.690> just<00:02:39.810> going<00:02:39.900> to

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
off otherwise everything's just going to

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.670 
off otherwise everything's just going to
be<00:02:40.110> overbearing<00:02:40.560> when<00:02:40.829> you<00:02:40.920> strum<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:42.319> mean<00:02:43.319> you

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
be overbearing when you strum I mean you

00:02:43.680 --> 00:03:02.900 
be overbearing when you strum I mean you
got<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:43.890> learn<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.069> back<00:02:44.310> off

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.240 

see<00:03:03.910> what<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.060> mean<00:03:04.090> so<00:03:04.900> here's<00:03:05.830> kind<00:03:06.040> of<00:03:06.160> the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
see what I mean so here's kind of the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.590 
see what I mean so here's kind of the
progression<00:03:06.700> we've<00:03:06.820> taken<00:03:07.060> we've<00:03:07.330> talked

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
progression we've taken we've talked

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.980 
progression we've taken we've talked
about<00:03:07.870> how<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.770> begin<00:03:08.970> strumming<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.090> how<00:03:10.930> we

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
about how to begin strumming and how we

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.600 
about how to begin strumming and how we
can<00:03:11.140> miss<00:03:11.440> certain<00:03:11.590> things<00:03:11.740> to<00:03:12.100> create<00:03:12.400> either

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
can miss certain things to create either

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.190 
can miss certain things to create either
an<00:03:12.790> actual<00:03:13.120> strumming<00:03:13.450> pattern<00:03:13.840> or<00:03:14.050> we're

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
an actual strumming pattern or we're

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.770 
an actual strumming pattern or we're
improvising<00:03:14.740> we're<00:03:15.640> just<00:03:15.850> creating<00:03:16.120> strums

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
improvising we're just creating strums

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.660 
improvising we're just creating strums
by<00:03:17.050> moving<00:03:17.350> our<00:03:17.530> hand<00:03:17.770> away<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.100> moving<00:03:18.550> it

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
by moving our hand away and moving it

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.970 
by moving our hand away and moving it
back<00:03:18.700> in<00:03:19.150> maybe<00:03:19.840> we<00:03:20.050> hear<00:03:20.320> something<00:03:20.740> and<00:03:20.830> we

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
back in maybe we hear something and we

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.470 
back in maybe we hear something and we
replicate<00:03:21.490> that<00:03:21.520> with<00:03:21.700> our<00:03:21.850> hand<00:03:22.180> or<00:03:22.330> maybe

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
replicate that with our hand or maybe

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.630 
replicate that with our hand or maybe
we're<00:03:23.140> just<00:03:23.170> moving<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.010> groove<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.460> the

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
we're just moving to the groove of the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.920 
we're just moving to the groove of the
song<00:03:24.850> and<00:03:24.880> we're<00:03:25.180> just<00:03:25.300> kind<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.570> missing

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
song and we're just kind of missing

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.560 
song and we're just kind of missing
things<00:03:26.140> and<00:03:26.290> hitting<00:03:26.560> it<00:03:27.000> from<00:03:28.000> there<00:03:28.270> what<00:03:28.450> we

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
things and hitting it from there what we

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.210 
things and hitting it from there what we
do<00:03:28.690> is<00:03:28.810> we<00:03:28.930> start<00:03:29.170> learning<00:03:29.560> how<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.770> create

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
do is we start learning how to create

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.700 
do is we start learning how to create
dynamics<00:03:30.880> by<00:03:31.330> hitting<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.810> strings<00:03:32.080> softer

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
dynamics by hitting the strings softer

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.070 
dynamics by hitting the strings softer
or<00:03:32.740> louder<00:03:33.100> or<00:03:33.670> hitting<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.090> strings<00:03:34.330> more<00:03:34.780> or

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
or louder or hitting the strings more or

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.950 
or louder or hitting the strings more or
less<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:37.000> me<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.450> really<00:03:37.630> is<00:03:37.810> the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
less and to me that really is the

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.720 
less and to me that really is the
essence<00:03:38.290> of<00:03:38.410> learning<00:03:38.770> how<00:03:38.890> to<00:03:38.950> play<00:03:39.130> music<00:03:39.580> is

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
essence of learning how to play music is

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.590 
essence of learning how to play music is
what<00:03:39.880> we're<00:03:40.000> talking<00:03:40.180> about<00:03:40.210> right<00:03:40.360> now

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
what we're talking about right now

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.510 
what we're talking about right now
because<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.590> rest<00:03:41.770> of<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.070> kind<00:03:42.340> of<00:03:42.430> like

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
because the rest of it is kind of like

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.070 
because the rest of it is kind of like
exercises<00:03:43.330> you<00:03:43.480> know<00:03:43.570> you're<00:03:43.720> learning<00:03:43.990> how

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
exercises you know you're learning how

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.900 
exercises you know you're learning how
to<00:03:44.140> put<00:03:44.380> point<00:03:44.650> A<00:03:44.770> to<00:03:44.800> point<00:03:44.920> B<00:03:45.190> together<00:03:45.580> and

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
to put point A to point B together and

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.030 
to put point A to point B together and
that<00:03:46.150> whole<00:03:46.330> thing<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.690> we<00:03:47.050> need<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.350> we<00:03:47.620> can't

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
that whole thing and we need to we can't

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.220 
that whole thing and we need to we can't
play<00:03:48.220> without<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:48.640> but<00:03:49.270> this<00:03:49.630> is<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:49.990> part

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
play without it but this is the part

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.650 
play without it but this is the part
that<00:03:50.470> I<00:03:50.620> think<00:03:50.890> really<00:03:50.950> sells<00:03:51.490> when<00:03:52.240> you<00:03:52.390> play

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
that I think really sells when you play

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.110 
that I think really sells when you play
for<00:03:52.960> other<00:03:53.080> people<00:03:53.700> it's<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.910> thing<00:03:55.090> that

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
for other people it's the thing that

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.450 
for other people it's the thing that
people<00:03:55.480> realize<00:03:55.660> I<00:03:56.500> worked<00:03:56.890> in<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.130> music<00:03:57.430> store

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
people realize I worked in a music store

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.520 
people realize I worked in a music store
for<00:03:57.790> many<00:03:57.940> many<00:03:58.090> years<00:03:58.240> and<00:03:58.810> one<00:03:59.200> thing<00:03:59.350> that<00:03:59.380> I

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
for many many years and one thing that I

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.260 
for many many years and one thing that I
was<00:03:59.680> thought<00:03:59.890> was<00:03:59.920> really<00:04:00.130> cool<00:04:00.400> was<00:04:00.700> when

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
was thought was really cool was when

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.520 
was thought was really cool was when
somebody<00:04:01.660> would<00:04:01.810> come<00:04:01.930> in<00:04:02.080> it<00:04:02.170> doesn't<00:04:02.410> matter

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
somebody would come in it doesn't matter

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.660 
somebody would come in it doesn't matter
what<00:04:02.680> instrument<00:04:03.130> they<00:04:03.190> would<00:04:03.340> play<00:04:03.460> whether

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
what instrument they would play whether

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.630 
what instrument they would play whether
it's<00:04:03.760> piano<00:04:04.150> or<00:04:04.480> guitar<00:04:05.010> you<00:04:06.010> know<00:04:06.040> trumpet

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
it's piano or guitar you know trumpet

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.440 
it's piano or guitar you know trumpet
for<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:06.880> matter<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.150> doesn't<00:04:07.270> make<00:04:07.390> any

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
for that matter it doesn't make any

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.150 
for that matter it doesn't make any
difference<00:04:07.600> what<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.020> instrument<00:04:08.350> was<00:04:08.470> but

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
difference what the instrument was but

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.550 
difference what the instrument was but
sometimes<00:04:09.550> when<00:04:09.700> they<00:04:09.820> go<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.090> play<00:04:10.440> you<00:04:11.440> would

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
sometimes when they go to play you would

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.680 
sometimes when they go to play you would
just<00:04:11.800> you<00:04:12.760> would<00:04:12.880> just<00:04:13.000> stop<00:04:13.300> and<00:04:13.480> you<00:04:13.540> just

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
just you would just stop and you just

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.360 
just you would just stop and you just
want<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:13.930> listen<00:04:14.170> you<00:04:14.950> don't<00:04:15.040> want<00:04:15.250> to<00:04:15.310> be

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
want to listen you don't want to be

bothered and you know you just want to
you<00:04:17.650> know<00:04:17.680> absorb<00:04:18.430> what<00:04:18.609> they're<00:04:18.760> doing<00:04:19.030> it

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
you know absorb what they're doing it

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.330 
you know absorb what they're doing it
sounded<00:04:19.480> so<00:04:19.660> cool<00:04:19.900> and<00:04:20.170> that<00:04:20.830> to<00:04:21.040> me<00:04:21.070> is<00:04:21.190> what

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
sounded so cool and that to me is what

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.770 
sounded so cool and that to me is what
feel<00:04:21.820> is<00:04:22.000> all<00:04:22.150> about<00:04:22.360> that's<00:04:22.540> what<00:04:22.660> we're

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
feel is all about that's what we're

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.180 
feel is all about that's what we're
talking<00:04:23.080> about<00:04:23.110> right<00:04:23.290> now<00:04:23.470> is<00:04:23.770> that<00:04:23.890> dynamic

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
talking about right now is that dynamic

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.310 
talking about right now is that dynamic
when<00:04:25.180> somebody<00:04:25.510> just<00:04:25.690> comes<00:04:25.870> in<00:04:26.020> and<00:04:26.140> you<00:04:26.230> know

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
when somebody just comes in and you know

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.960 
when somebody just comes in and you know
plays<00:04:26.530> GCD<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:27.280> they're<00:04:27.370> just<00:04:27.520> hammering<00:04:27.850> on

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
plays GCD and they're just hammering on

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.580 
plays GCD and they're just hammering on
their<00:04:28.120> strumming<00:04:28.750> it<00:04:28.900> sounds<00:04:29.380> like<00:04:29.410> you're

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
their strumming it sounds like you're

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.460 
their strumming it sounds like you're
playing<00:04:29.710> an<00:04:29.890> exercise<00:04:30.930> when<00:04:31.930> in<00:04:32.020> reality<00:04:32.140> I

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
playing an exercise when in reality I

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.660 
playing an exercise when in reality I
suppose<00:04:32.800> everything<00:04:33.070> that<00:04:33.250> we<00:04:33.310> do<00:04:33.430> is<00:04:33.580> an

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
suppose everything that we do is an

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.520 
suppose everything that we do is an
exercise<00:04:33.970> it's<00:04:34.330> just<00:04:34.510> as<00:04:34.660> we<00:04:35.080> get<00:04:35.200> better<00:04:35.320> we

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
exercise it's just as we get better we

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.950 
exercise it's just as we get better we
don't<00:04:35.560> think<00:04:35.860> of<00:04:35.950> it<00:04:36.040> that<00:04:36.070> way<00:04:36.220> but<00:04:36.810> when<00:04:37.810> you

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
don't think of it that way but when you

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.840 
don't think of it that way but when you
start<00:04:38.230> dealing<00:04:38.590> with<00:04:38.860> dynamics<00:04:39.520> when<00:04:39.700> you're

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
start dealing with dynamics when you're

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.390 
start dealing with dynamics when you're
playing<00:04:40.120> it<00:04:40.420> begins<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.110> sound<00:04:41.410> more<00:04:41.710> organic

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
playing it begins to sound more organic

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.250 
playing it begins to sound more organic
and<00:04:42.550> more<00:04:42.700> real<00:04:42.970> to<00:04:43.150> people<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:43.600> they<00:04:43.960> tend<00:04:44.200> to

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
and more real to people and they tend to

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.570 
and more real to people and they tend to
want<00:04:44.470> to<00:04:44.500> listen<00:04:44.680> to<00:04:44.890> you<00:04:44.980> play<00:04:45.010> a<00:04:45.220> little<00:04:45.370> bit

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
want to listen to you play a little bit

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.580 
want to listen to you play a little bit
more<00:04:45.730> so<00:04:46.510> that's<00:04:46.840> what<00:04:46.990> I<00:04:47.020> want<00:04:47.230> you<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:47.410> focus

more so that's what I want you to focus

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.350 
more so that's what I want you to focus
