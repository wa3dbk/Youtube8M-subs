the yellow war bonnet I like the looks
of<00:00:19.920> them<00:00:20.660> and<00:00:21.660> although<00:00:22.560> they<00:00:22.710> don't<00:00:22.830> have<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
of them and although they don't have the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.529 
of them and although they don't have the
detail<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.410> inter-mountain<00:00:25.410> version<00:00:26.189> I

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
detail of the inter-mountain version I

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.050 
detail of the inter-mountain version I
kind<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.570> like<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.080> my<00:00:28.230> layout<00:00:28.439> because

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
kind of like that on my layout because

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.550 
kind of like that on my layout because
that<00:00:30.060> kind<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.269> stuff<00:00:30.480> gets<00:00:30.720> broken<00:00:31.050> off<00:00:31.320> if

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
that kind of stuff gets broken off if

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.830 
that kind of stuff gets broken off if
you<00:00:31.710> actually<00:00:31.890> run<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.369> locomotives<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.270> just

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
you actually run the locomotives I just

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.220 
you actually run the locomotives I just
they're<00:00:34.800> not<00:00:34.980> as<00:00:35.130> fragile<00:00:35.870> so<00:00:36.870> let's<00:00:37.050> take<00:00:37.200> a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
they're not as fragile so let's take a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.389 
they're not as fragile so let's take a
look<00:00:37.469> at<00:00:37.649> them<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:37.950> see<00:00:38.250> what<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.489> think<00:00:39.800> okay

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
look at them and see what you think okay

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.299 
look at them and see what you think okay
here<00:00:41.790> they<00:00:41.940> are<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.809> change<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.649> number<00:00:43.770> boards

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
here they are I change the number boards

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.340 
here they are I change the number boards
on<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.379> this<00:00:46.379> lead<00:00:46.620> unit<00:00:47.010> here<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:48.149> 331<00:00:49.050> and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
on the this lead unit here to 331 and

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.340 
on the this lead unit here to 331 and
you<00:00:49.860> will<00:00:50.010> find<00:00:50.280> those<00:00:50.489> numbers<00:00:51.170> within<00:00:52.170> a

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
you will find those numbers within a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.680 
you will find those numbers within a
little<00:00:52.590> packet<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.250> B<00:00:53.640> unit<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.270> B<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.600> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
little packet in the B unit the B and it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.380 
little packet in the B unit the B and it
actually<00:00:54.870> has<00:00:55.199> two<00:00:55.620> extra<00:00:56.520> numbers<00:00:56.910> for<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
actually has two extra numbers for the a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.130 
actually has two extra numbers for the a
units<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.550> I<00:00:59.550> didn't<00:01:00.329> really<00:01:00.600> check<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.109> I

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
units and I didn't really check but I

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.260 
units and I didn't really check but I
think<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> units<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.280> two<00:01:02.670> numbers<00:01:03.000> as

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
think the a units have two numbers as

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.600 
think the a units have two numbers as
well<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.739> make<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> variety<00:01:05.189> of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
well so you can make a variety of

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
well so you can make a variety of
numbers<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:07.170> particular<00:01:08.119> lead<00:01:09.119> one<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.510> I

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
numbers the particular lead one that I

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.730 
numbers the particular lead one that I
got<00:01:09.930> here<00:01:10.580> 331<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.909> went<00:01:12.659> ahead<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.869> put<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> Mars

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
got here 331 I went ahead and put a Mars

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.190 
got here 331 I went ahead and put a Mars
light<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.509> let's<00:01:15.509> take<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.689> look<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.049> see

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
light in it let's take a look and see

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:30.940 
light in it let's take a look and see
what<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.409> looks<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> lights<00:01:17.850> off

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.310 

I<00:01:33.670> don't<00:01:34.670> know<00:01:34.759> how<00:01:34.880> well<00:01:35.119> this<00:01:35.270> will<00:01:35.509> show<00:01:36.079> up

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
I don't know how well this will show up

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.440 
I don't know how well this will show up
but<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:37.119> get<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.270> idea<00:01:38.299> of<00:01:40.179> how<00:01:41.179> that<00:01:41.240> looks

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
but you get the idea of how that looks

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:52.200 
but you get the idea of how that looks
let<00:01:41.990> me<00:01:42.079> turn<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:42.380> light<00:01:42.530> back<00:01:42.740> on

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.390 

now<00:01:52.840> let's<00:01:53.080> just<00:01:53.290> try<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.650> take<00:01:53.830> a<00:01:53.890> quick<00:01:54.160> walk

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
now let's just try and take a quick walk

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.359 
now let's just try and take a quick walk
around<00:01:54.460> here

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.760 

the<00:01:59.670> decoders<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.329> put<00:02:00.539> in<00:02:00.689> our<00:02:00.840> digit<00:02:01.530> tracks

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
the decoders I put in our digit tracks

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.399 
the decoders I put in our digit tracks
ko<00:02:02.100> B's<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.720> really<00:02:06.990> think<00:02:07.140> they're<00:02:07.380> a

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
ko B's and I really think they're a

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.650 
ko B's and I really think they're a
pretty<00:02:07.770> nice-looking<00:02:07.979> locomotive<00:02:08.880> let<00:02:09.539> me

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
exhaust the tips of the exhaust let's

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.900 
exhaust the tips of the exhaust let's
see<00:02:50.700> what<00:02:51.000> else<00:02:51.150> did<00:02:51.299> I<00:02:51.420> do<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:52.700> guess<00:02:53.700> that's

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
see what else did I do I guess that's

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.729 
see what else did I do I guess that's
about<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.390> other<00:02:54.599> than<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.140> light

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
about it other than the light

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.440 
about it other than the light
installation<00:02:56.430> but<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.819> big<00:02:57.000> thing<00:02:57.239> is

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
installation but the big thing is

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.280 
installation but the big thing is
painting<00:02:58.019> down<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.560> horn<00:02:59.220> I<00:03:00.140> used<00:03:01.140> a

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
painting down the horn I used a

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.190 
painting down the horn I used a
combination<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:02.510> pardon<00:03:03.510> me<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.750> used<00:03:04.109> a

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
combination of pardon me I used a

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.819 
combination of pardon me I used a
combination<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.890> BNSF<00:03:05.549> yellow<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.680> just<00:03:07.680> a

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
combination of BNSF yellow and just a

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.979 
combination of BNSF yellow and just a
tiny<00:03:08.459> tiny<00:03:08.940> tiny<00:03:09.150> bit<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:10.190> atsf<00:03:11.190> red<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:12.209> you

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
tiny tiny tiny bit of atsf red and you

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.840 
tiny tiny tiny bit of atsf red and you
just<00:03:13.170> mix<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.590> on<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.709> butter<00:03:14.010> dish<00:03:14.250> until<00:03:14.670> you

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
just mix it on a butter dish until you

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.990 
just mix it on a butter dish until you
can<00:03:15.030> come<00:03:15.239> up<00:03:15.269> with<00:03:15.389> the<00:03:15.750> correct<00:03:16.579> or<00:03:17.579> close<00:03:17.790> to

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
can come up with the correct or close to

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.460 
can come up with the correct or close to
the<00:03:18.120> correct<00:03:18.450> yellow<00:03:19.160> but<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.790> can<00:03:21.470> certainly

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
the correct yellow but you can certainly

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.780 
the correct yellow but you can certainly
see<00:03:22.859> I<00:03:22.889> don't<00:03:23.130> know<00:03:23.190> if<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.310> can<00:03:23.459> see<00:03:23.579> in<00:03:23.700> the

see I don't know if you can see in the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.030 
see I don't know if you can see in the

video but in a still picture you'd be
able<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.280> certainly<00:03:26.670> see<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.540> difference

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
able to certainly see the the difference

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.800 
able to certainly see the the difference

the logo right here I don't know which

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.140 
the logo right here I don't know which
is<00:04:48.690> prototypical<00:04:49.650> but<00:04:49.889> this<00:04:50.520> is<00:04:50.669> just<00:04:50.849> a<00:04:50.940> plain

is prototypical but this is just a plain
a<00:04:51.180> nice<00:04:51.419> looking<00:04:51.780> unit<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:54.180> that's<00:04:54.479> really

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
a nice looking unit and that's really

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.570 
a nice looking unit and that's really
about<00:04:55.080> all<00:04:55.139> I<00:04:55.320> have<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.800> say<00:04:55.830> about<00:04:56.099> them<00:04:56.460> I

give you it just a general comparison

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.279 
give you it just a general comparison
the<00:05:05.550> inter-mountain<00:05:05.789> units<00:05:06.300> now<00:05:06.509> like<00:05:07.139> i<00:05:07.259> said

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
the inter-mountain units now like i said

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.730 
the inter-mountain units now like i said
i<00:05:07.560> realize<00:05:08.159> that<00:05:08.190> they<00:05:08.699> don't<00:05:09.199> compare<00:05:10.199> detail

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
i realize that they don't compare detail

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.980 
i realize that they don't compare detail
wise<00:05:12.680> but<00:05:13.680> I<00:05:14.009> like<00:05:14.729> the<00:05:14.909> yellow<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:15.539> mustard<00:05:15.900> a

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
wise but I like the yellow the mustard a

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.170 
wise but I like the yellow the mustard a
yellow<00:05:16.289> on<00:05:16.530> these<00:05:16.800> much<00:05:17.250> better<00:05:17.550> than<00:05:17.789> I<00:05:17.880> do<00:05:17.940> on

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
yellow on these much better than I do on

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.580 
yellow on these much better than I do on
the<00:05:18.270> intermountain<00:05:18.840> which<00:05:18.990> has<00:05:19.169> a<00:05:19.199> more

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
the intermountain which has a more

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.330 
the intermountain which has a more
bright<00:05:19.949> yellow<00:05:21.380> so<00:05:22.380> that's<00:05:22.620> it<00:05:22.830> on<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:23.130> Cato

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
bright yellow so that's it on the Cato

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.120 
bright yellow so that's it on the Cato
the<00:05:24.060> new<00:05:24.210> Cato<00:05:24.419> yellow<00:05:24.750> bonnets<00:05:25.229> I<00:05:25.530> hope<00:05:25.949> you

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
the new Cato yellow bonnets I hope you
