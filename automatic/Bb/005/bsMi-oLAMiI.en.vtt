00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.610 
Wow oK you've gotten a chance to see

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.759 
Wow oK you've gotten a chance to see
close-ups<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.910> body<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.990> interior

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
close-ups of the body and the interior

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.860 
close-ups of the body and the interior
now<00:00:11.130> let's<00:00:11.460> take<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.790> look<00:00:12.030> at<00:00:12.210> these<00:00:12.330> engines

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
now let's take a look at these engines

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.200 
now let's take a look at these engines
notice<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.830> hood<00:00:14.040> difference<00:00:14.519> now<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.120> these

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
notice the hood difference now in these

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.710 
notice the hood difference now in these
two<00:00:15.450> early<00:00:16.010> 53<00:00:17.010> models<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.820> grille<00:00:18.119> stays<00:00:18.480> in

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
two early 53 models the grille stays in

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.900 
two early 53 models the grille stays in
place<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.500> hood<00:00:19.650> opens<00:00:19.980> up<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.490> actually

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
place and the hood opens up you actually

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.090 
place and the hood opens up you actually
it's<00:00:21.240> actually<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.720> little<00:00:21.900> bit<00:00:21.990> easier<00:00:22.320> to

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
it's actually a little bit easier to

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.160 
it's actually a little bit easier to
work<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.760> engines<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.300> these<00:00:24.539> two<00:00:24.750> now<00:00:25.019> on

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170

these<00:00:53.640> engines<00:00:54.120> were<00:00:54.239> common<00:00:54.780> they<00:00:54.930> ran<00:00:55.199> all

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
these engines were common they ran all

these engines were common they ran all
over<00:00:55.500> Europe<00:00:56.219> during<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.730> 50s<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.329> early<00:00:57.420> 60s

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
over Europe during the 50s and early 60s

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.760 
over Europe during the 50s and early 60s
as<00:00:58.199> taxicabs<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.510> that<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.960> not<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.379> most

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
as taxicabs and that is not the most

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.759 
as taxicabs and that is not the most
powerful<00:01:02.070> diesel<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.910> will<00:01:03.059> ever<00:01:03.270> drive<00:01:03.769> but

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
powerful diesel you will ever drive but

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.399 
powerful diesel you will ever drive but
in<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.979> early<00:01:05.250> 50s<00:01:05.930> mercedes<00:01:06.930> introduced

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
in the early 50s mercedes introduced

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.250 
in the early 50s mercedes introduced
their<00:01:07.680> first<00:01:07.880> six<00:01:08.880> cylinder<00:01:09.270> gasoline<00:01:09.540> engine

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
their first six cylinder gasoline engine

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.539 
their first six cylinder gasoline engine
in<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:11.270> 1953<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.689> 20<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.290> these<00:01:13.770> engines<00:01:14.340> had

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
in this 1953 to 20 and these engines had

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.820 
in this 1953 to 20 and these engines had
overhead<00:01:15.090> camshafts<00:01:15.720> they<00:01:15.990> were<00:01:16.140> carbureted

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
overhead camshafts they were carbureted

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.800 
overhead camshafts they were carbureted
but<00:01:17.549> they<00:01:17.670> had<00:01:17.820> quite<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> bit<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.360> power<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
but they had quite a bit of power and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.810 
but they had quite a bit of power and
they<00:01:18.930> would<00:01:19.080> keep<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.500> with<00:01:19.740> modern<00:01:20.460> traffic

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
they would keep up with modern traffic

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.749 
they would keep up with modern traffic
today<00:01:21.350> now<00:01:22.350> moving<00:01:22.619> over<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.189> black<00:01:23.430> car

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
today now moving over to the black car

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.620 
today now moving over to the black car
this<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.930> also<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.409> diesel<00:01:26.240> that's<00:01:27.240> very

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
this is also a diesel that's very

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.050 
this is also a diesel that's very
similar<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.470> was<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.680> 180<00:01:29.250> d<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.880> was<00:01:29.970> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
similar but it was a 180 d so it was a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.450 
similar but it was a 180 d so it was a
little<00:01:30.240> bit<00:01:30.450> larger<00:01:30.960> displacement<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
little bit larger displacement but the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.960 
little bit larger displacement but the
engine<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.090> very<00:01:33.740> similar<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> engine<00:01:35.820> in

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
engine is very similar to the engine in

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.590 
engine is very similar to the engine in
the<00:01:36.119> 170<00:01:37.079> d<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:38.009> also<00:01:38.280> would<00:01:38.850> not<00:01:39.000> snap<00:01:39.329> your

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the 170 d this also would not snap your

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.319 
the 170 d this also would not snap your
neck<00:01:39.630> back<00:01:40.110> during<00:01:40.619> acceleration<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:42.210> then

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
neck back during acceleration and then

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.560 
neck back during acceleration and then
finally<00:01:42.899> one<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.259> my<00:01:43.350> favorite<00:01:43.829> cars<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.399> drive

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
finally one of my favorite cars to drive

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.090 
finally one of my favorite cars to drive
because<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.600> can<00:01:45.899> actually<00:01:46.290> keep<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.770> with

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
because I can actually keep up with

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.340 
because I can actually keep up with
modern<00:01:47.430> traffic<00:01:47.850> today<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> freeway<00:01:49.079> is

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
modern traffic today on the freeway is

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.139 
modern traffic today on the freeway is
my<00:01:50.210> 1959<00:01:51.210> 220<00:01:51.960> se<00:01:52.560> that's<00:01:53.009> right<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.549> an<00:01:53.700> S<00:01:53.909> II

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
my 1959 220 se that's right it's an S II

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.950 
my 1959 220 se that's right it's an S II
it<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.189> 6-cylinder<00:01:56.450> fuel-injected<00:01:57.450> engine

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
it is a 6-cylinder fuel-injected engine

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.980 
it is a 6-cylinder fuel-injected engine
and<00:01:58.219> this<00:01:59.219> thing<00:01:59.579> really<00:02:00.090> gets<00:02:00.630> with<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
and this thing really gets with the
