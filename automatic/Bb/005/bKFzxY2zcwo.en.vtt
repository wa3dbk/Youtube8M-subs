development going into the project I

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.110

mean<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.559> rarely<00:00:40.800> got<00:00:41.070> any<00:00:41.340> information<00:00:42.030> about

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
mean we rarely got any information about

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.330 
mean we rarely got any information about
it<00:00:42.239> at<00:00:42.420> all<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:43.020> most<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.590> what<00:00:43.710> we<00:00:43.860> saw<00:00:44.100> were

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
it at all and most of what we saw were

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.549 
it at all and most of what we saw were
just<00:00:44.370> cinematic<00:00:45.090> trailers<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.750> such<00:00:45.960> it

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
just cinematic trailers and such it

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.319 
just cinematic trailers and such it
definitely<00:00:47.039> seemed<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.000> was<00:00:48.090> at<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
definitely seemed like it was at the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.869 
definitely seemed like it was at the
bottom<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.899> squares<00:00:49.350> priority<00:00:50.039> list<00:00:50.250> however

bottom of squares priority list however

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.180 
bottom of squares priority list however
all<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.480> kind<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.960> changed<00:00:52.680> when<00:00:52.860> Square

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
all that kind of changed when Square

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.810 
all that kind of changed when Square

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
comparing the frame rates of the demo on

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.399 
comparing the frame rates of the demo on
both<00:01:44.759> consoles<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.479> while<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.780> ps4<00:01:46.020> is

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
both consoles and while the ps4 is

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.440 
both consoles and while the ps4 is
clearly<00:01:47.100> doing<00:01:47.369> better<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.880> terms<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.240> frame

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
clearly doing better in terms of frame

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.109 
clearly doing better in terms of frame
rates<00:01:48.659> it's<00:01:49.500> basically<00:01:50.220> only<00:01:50.460> about<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.790> for

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
rates it's basically only about a for

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.289 
rates it's basically only about a for
FPS<00:01:51.420> difference<00:01:51.899> all<00:01:52.049> around<00:01:52.079> anyways<00:01:52.799> I

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
FPS difference all around anyways I

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.880 
FPS difference all around anyways I
don't<00:01:54.299> know<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:54.990> pretty<00:01:55.259> sad<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.740> see

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
don't know it's just pretty sad to see

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.590 
don't know it's just pretty sad to see
both<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.369> current<00:01:56.549> gen<00:01:56.729> consoles<00:01:57.090> struggling

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
both the current gen consoles struggling

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.990 
both the current gen consoles struggling
to<00:01:57.750> keep<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.049> game<00:01:58.290> playable<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.219> what's

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
to keep this game playable and what's

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.520 
to keep this game playable and what's
even<00:02:00.090> worse<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.869> game<00:02:01.020> isn't<00:02:01.229> even

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
even worse is that the game isn't even

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.289 
even worse is that the game isn't even
running<00:02:01.710> at<00:02:02.009> native<00:02:02.310> 1080p<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.969> actually

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
running at native 1080p it's actually

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.840 
running at native 1080p it's actually
900p<00:02:04.200> upscale

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
900p upscale

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.050 
900p upscale
which<00:02:05.570> is<00:02:05.750> really<00:02:06.200> bad<00:02:06.700> Square<00:02:07.700> Enix<00:02:07.850> is

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
which is really bad Square Enix is

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.730 
which is really bad Square Enix is
actually<00:02:08.450> planning<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:09.080> release<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.560> whole

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
game at 1080p 30fps and to be honest

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.470 
game at 1080p 30fps and to be honest
unless<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.010> game<00:02:13.160> sees<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:13.520> greater<00:02:13.880> downgrade

unless the game sees a greater downgrade
in<00:02:14.630> graphical<00:02:14.990> quality<00:02:15.110> it's<00:02:15.560> just<00:02:15.830> not<00:02:16.040> going

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
in graphical quality it's just not going

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.080 
in graphical quality it's just not going
to<00:02:16.430> happen

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
to happen

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.060 
to happen
there's<00:02:17.660> only<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:18.140> much<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.350> can<00:02:18.500> get<00:02:18.860> out<00:02:19.040> of

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
there's only so much you can get out of

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.760 
there's only so much you can get out of
a<00:02:19.220> $400<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:20.180> $500<00:02:20.780> piece<00:02:20.990> of<00:02:21.170> machinery<00:02:21.500> and

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
a $400 to $500 piece of machinery and

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.530 
a $400 to $500 piece of machinery and
don't<00:02:22.550> get<00:02:22.670> me<00:02:22.730> wrong<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:23.060> game<00:02:23.180> still<00:02:23.480> looks

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
don't get me wrong the game still looks

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.560 
don't get me wrong the game still looks
great<00:02:23.990> in<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.380> demo<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.830> it's<00:02:25.040> playable<00:02:25.850> but

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
great in the demo and it's playable but

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.060 
great in the demo and it's playable but
it's<00:02:26.750> not<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.050> smoothest<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:27.709> gaming

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
it's not the smoothest of gaming

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.620 
it's not the smoothest of gaming
experiences<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.850> I<00:02:28.880> really<00:02:29.360> think<00:02:29.570> that

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
experiences and I really think that

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.930 
experiences and I really think that
Square<00:02:30.020> is<00:02:30.260> biting<00:02:30.860> off<00:02:31.100> way<00:02:31.400> more<00:02:31.430> than<00:02:31.820> they

can chew with this game running on
consoles<00:02:33.770> in<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:33.980> way<00:02:34.100> that<00:02:34.250> they<00:02:34.340> want<00:02:34.930> now

the progress of their Lumino studio

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.860 
the progress of their Lumino studio

which is the engine the game is running
on<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.890> engine<00:02:43.220> is<00:02:43.370> really<00:02:43.760> incredible<00:02:44.420> with

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
on the engine is really incredible with

on the engine is really incredible with
what<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:44.840> can<00:02:44.989> do<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:45.320> how<00:02:45.410> versatile<00:02:45.980> they've

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
what it can do and how versatile they've

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.400 
what it can do and how versatile they've
claimed<00:02:46.550> it<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:47.000> would<00:02:47.690> even<00:02:47.870> compare<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.260> to

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
claimed it is I would even compare it to

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.990 
claimed it is I would even compare it to
the<00:02:48.530> Unreal<00:02:48.860> Engine<00:02:48.980> 4<00:02:49.160> it's<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:49.850> awesome

the Unreal Engine 4 it's that awesome

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.750 
the Unreal Engine 4 it's that awesome
but<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.290> weird<00:02:51.530> thing<00:02:51.800> is<00:02:51.950> about<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.610> whole

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
but the weird thing is about the whole

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.890 
but the weird thing is about the whole
development<00:02:53.180> of<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.330> game<00:02:53.480> is<00:02:53.660> that<00:02:53.750> it's

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
development of the game is that it's

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.080 
development of the game is that it's
actually<00:02:54.050> being<00:02:54.500> originally<00:02:55.070> developed<00:02:55.340> at<00:02:55.730> a

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
much higher graphical quality the game

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.120

downgraded version of that the original

downgraded version of that the original

running at a much better stable
framerate<00:03:16.070> I<00:03:16.600> presume<00:03:17.600> that<00:03:17.780> this<00:03:17.900> original

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
framerate I presume that this original

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.440 
framerate I presume that this original
version<00:03:19.010> is<00:03:19.220> really<00:03:19.489> only<00:03:19.790> there<00:03:20.030> so<00:03:20.269> they<00:03:20.390> can

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
version is really only there so they can

it a $400 PC could run it better so they

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.770

right<00:05:00.570> see<00:05:01.570> my<00:05:02.230> fear<00:05:02.560> is<00:05:02.830> that<00:05:03.040> when<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.400> game

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
right see my fear is that when the game

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.030 
right see my fear is that when the game
releases<00:05:04.000> for<00:05:04.120> PC<00:05:04.570> it<00:05:04.780> will<00:05:04.930> be<00:05:05.080> locked<00:05:05.440> at<00:05:05.770> Mac

some<00:05:10.840> people<00:05:10.930> would<00:05:11.140> argue<00:05:11.200> that<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.860> game

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
some people would argue that the game

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.620 
some people would argue that the game
would<00:05:12.220> still<00:05:12.580> be<00:05:12.730> at<00:05:12.820> its<00:05:12.940> highest<00:05:13.000> quality

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
would still be at its highest quality

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.409 
would still be at its highest quality
but<00:05:13.930> to<00:05:14.350> be<00:05:14.500> honest<00:05:14.860> a<00:05:15.070> PC<00:05:15.760> game<00:05:15.940> is<00:05:16.150> still<00:05:16.360> a

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
but to be honest a PC game is still a

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.510 
but to be honest a PC game is still a
bad<00:05:16.720> release<00:05:17.140> if<00:05:17.410> it<00:05:17.590> dis<00:05:17.770> cludes<00:05:18.100> the<00:05:18.340> vast

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
bad release if it dis cludes the vast

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.550 
bad release if it dis cludes the vast
majority<00:05:18.669> of<00:05:19.000> what<00:05:19.150> PC<00:05:19.510> players<00:05:19.780> can<00:05:20.020> handle<00:05:20.350> I

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
majority of what PC players can handle I

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.800 
majority of what PC players can handle I
don't<00:05:21.490> know<00:05:21.550> perhaps<00:05:22.030> the<00:05:22.180> Luminess<00:05:22.510> engine

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
don't know perhaps the Luminess engine

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.150 
don't know perhaps the Luminess engine
isn't<00:05:22.960> optimized<00:05:23.560> for<00:05:23.770> graphical

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160

customization<00:05:24.850> which<00:05:25.450> would<00:05:25.600> really<00:05:25.780> suck

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
customization which would really suck

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.310 
customization which would really suck
and<00:05:26.350> would<00:05:26.560> also<00:05:26.740> be<00:05:26.979> really<00:05:27.280> really<00:05:27.550> dumb<00:05:27.940> but

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
and would also be really really dumb but

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.630 
and would also be really really dumb but
that's<00:05:29.320> just<00:05:29.470> kind<00:05:29.770> of<00:05:29.890> my<00:05:29.950> fear<00:05:30.310> about<00:05:30.490> the

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
that's just kind of my fear about the

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.790 
that's just kind of my fear about the
whole<00:05:30.820> thing<00:05:31.060> maybe<00:05:31.840> what<00:05:32.080> they<00:05:32.200> said<00:05:32.470> about

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
whole thing maybe what they said about

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.890 
whole thing maybe what they said about
it<00:05:33.100> is<00:05:33.220> just<00:05:33.250> Square<00:05:33.729> Enix<00:05:33.940> being<00:05:34.240> dumb<00:05:34.479> not

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
it is just Square Enix being dumb not

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.719 
it is just Square Enix being dumb not
understanding<00:05:35.530> how<00:05:35.620> pcs<00:05:36.010> really<00:05:36.370> are<00:05:36.550> these

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
understanding how pcs really are these

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:38.250 
understanding how pcs really are these
days<00:05:36.940> which<00:05:37.180> honestly<00:05:37.390> wouldn't<00:05:37.810> surprise<00:05:38.080> me

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
days which honestly wouldn't surprise me

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.850 
days which honestly wouldn't surprise me
at<00:05:38.470> all

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
at all

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.159 
at all
because<00:05:39.490> being<00:05:39.669> a<00:05:39.790> PC<00:05:40.180> gaming<00:05:40.390> really<00:05:40.780> doesn't

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
because being a PC gaming really doesn't

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.840 
because being a PC gaming really doesn't
have<00:05:41.320> a<00:05:41.350> following<00:05:41.740> in<00:05:41.890> Japan<00:05:42.190> and<00:05:42.490> they<00:05:42.669> don't

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
same time as consoles but all this is

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.740 
same time as consoles but all this is
way<00:05:48.040> too<00:05:48.100> early<00:05:48.310> to<00:05:48.580> tell<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:49.090> Lumino<00:05:49.390> studio

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
way too early to tell the Lumino studio

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.960 
way too early to tell the Lumino studio
does<00:05:50.140> support<00:05:50.590> Windows<00:05:50.919> and<00:05:51.280> we've<00:05:51.550> even<00:05:51.790> seen

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
does support Windows and we've even seen

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.610 
does support Windows and we've even seen
a<00:05:52.030> Windows<00:05:52.510> tab<00:05:52.780> show<00:05:53.080> up<00:05:53.169> in<00:05:53.260> one<00:05:53.410> of<00:05:53.440> their

a Windows tab show up in one of their
demos<00:05:53.919> so<00:05:54.610> that's<00:05:54.790> pretty<00:05:54.940> cool<00:05:55.120> anyways<00:05:56.080> that

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290
