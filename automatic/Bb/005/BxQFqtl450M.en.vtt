out<00:03:52.220> to<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.460> fragrance<00:03:52.790> but<00:03:52.880> it's<00:03:53.030> not<00:03:53.270> like

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
out to the fragrance but it's not like

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.500 
out to the fragrance but it's not like
overly<00:03:54.710> honey<00:03:56.170> um<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:58.580> I<00:03:58.790> think<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.180> middle

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
overly honey um the I think the middle

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.330 
overly honey um the I think the middle
kind<00:03:59.900> of<00:03:59.990> just<00:04:00.170> blends<00:04:00.530> really<00:04:00.800> quick<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.250> the

top<00:04:01.580> and<00:04:02.210> there's<00:04:02.360> not<00:04:02.510> a<00:04:02.570> whole<00:04:02.630> lot<00:04:02.900> there<00:04:03.020> I

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
top and there's not a whole lot there I

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.630 
top and there's not a whole lot there I
think<00:04:03.350> you<00:04:03.500> can<00:04:03.650> smell<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:03.950> orange<00:04:04.220> blossom

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
and a honeysuckle really well but I

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
don't think that it really has a stand

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.700 
don't think that it really has a stand
out<00:04:12.730> middle<00:04:13.730> um<00:04:14.030> it<00:04:14.720> really<00:04:14.990> kind<00:04:15.170> of<00:04:15.260> goes

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
out middle um it really kind of goes

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.470 
out middle um it really kind of goes
down<00:04:15.950> to<00:04:16.070> that<00:04:16.100> base<00:04:16.370> really<00:04:16.850> really<00:04:17.060> quick

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
down to that base really really quick

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.400 
down to that base really really quick
which<00:04:18.580> prominently<00:04:19.580> is<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.120> honey<00:04:20.299> note<00:04:20.570> but

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
which prominently is the honey note but

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.000 
which prominently is the honey note but

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
fragrance even though it's called honey

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.000 
fragrance even though it's called honey
doesn't<00:04:29.300> smell<00:04:30.170> like<00:04:30.830> honey<00:04:31.130> it<00:04:31.370> has<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.090> like<00:04:32.420> a

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
doesn't smell like honey it has a like a

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.680 
doesn't smell like honey it has a like a
floral<00:04:34.010> aspect<00:04:34.310> with<00:04:34.910> a<00:04:35.030> little<00:04:35.300> bit<00:04:35.420> of<00:04:35.510> honey

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
floral aspect with a little bit of honey

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.800 
floral aspect with a little bit of honey
thrown<00:04:36.380> in<00:04:36.530> there<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:36.740> round<00:04:36.920> it<00:04:37.040> off<00:04:37.810> but

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
thrown in there to round it off but

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.780 
thrown in there to round it off but
overall<00:04:39.050> I<00:04:39.170> think<00:04:39.410> it's<00:04:39.740> really<00:04:40.070> floral<00:04:40.610> I

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790

overall I think it's really floral I
think<00:04:41.690> that's<00:04:42.080> really<00:04:42.560> kind<00:04:43.400> of<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.640> little<00:04:43.940> bit

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
think that's really kind of a little bit

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.909 
think that's really kind of a little bit
sweet<00:04:44.360> not<00:04:44.780> very<00:04:45.460> fruity<00:04:47.260> it's<00:04:48.260> really<00:04:48.650> light
