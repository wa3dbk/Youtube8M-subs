00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
obviously

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.540 
obviously
more<00:04:24.810> experience<00:04:25.290> in<00:04:25.410> between<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:26.370> levels

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
more experience in between the levels

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.610 
more experience in between the levels
now<00:04:26.880> and<00:04:27.150> because<00:04:28.020> of<00:04:28.050> that<00:04:28.170> obviously

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
now and because of that obviously

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.770 
now and because of that obviously
slowing<00:04:29.070> down<00:04:29.220> and<00:04:29.490> just<00:04:29.760> because<00:04:30.120> your

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780
