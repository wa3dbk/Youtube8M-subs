Mills<00:00:00.599> mess<00:00:00.870> this<00:00:01.500> is<00:00:01.650> named<00:00:01.860> after<00:00:02.010> Steve

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
Mills mess this is named after Steve

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.390 
Mills mess this is named after Steve
Mills<00:00:02.700> and<00:00:03.410> it's<00:00:04.410> it's<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:05.040> pattern<00:00:05.370> that

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
Mills and it's it's a pattern that

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.550 
Mills and it's it's a pattern that
everybody<00:00:06.359> wants<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.720> learn<00:00:06.899> as<00:00:07.140> soon<00:00:07.319> as<00:00:07.410> they

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
everybody wants to learn as soon as they

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.110 
everybody wants to learn as soon as they
see<00:00:07.620> it<00:00:07.830> because<00:00:08.189> it<00:00:08.309> looks<00:00:08.519> so<00:00:08.610> cool

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
see it because it looks so cool

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.419 
see it because it looks so cool
what<00:00:10.050> Mills<00:00:10.260> mess<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.710> broken<00:00:11.160> into<00:00:11.309> its

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
what Mills mess is broken into its

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.110 
what Mills mess is broken into its
simplest<00:00:11.910> form<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.509> it's<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.259> false<00:00:13.559> shower

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
simplest form is it's the false shower

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:21.519 
simplest form is it's the false shower
in<00:00:15.230> both<00:00:16.230> directions<00:00:17.750> alternating<00:00:19.279> like<00:00:20.279> this

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
in both directions alternating like this

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.720 
in both directions alternating like this
so<00:00:22.529> I'm<00:00:22.650> doing<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.010> fall<00:00:23.189> shower<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.580> this

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
so I'm doing the fall shower in this

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.390 
so I'm doing the fall shower in this
direction<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.300> then<00:00:25.109> in<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.380> direction<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
direction and then in this direction and

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.630 
direction and then in this direction and
I'm<00:00:26.519> doing<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:27.000> for<00:00:27.210> two<00:00:27.900> throws<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.710> each

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
I'm doing it for two throws in each

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.080 
I'm doing it for two throws in each
direction<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.750> snakes<00:00:31.140> back<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.679> forth

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
direction and it snakes back and forth

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.690 
direction and it snakes back and forth
this<00:00:33.090> pattern<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.630> broken<00:00:33.780> down<00:00:34.200> into<00:00:34.700> two

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
this pattern is broken down into two

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.900 
this pattern is broken down into two
parts<00:00:36.320> one<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.649> u<00:00:38.129> ball<00:00:38.370> which<00:00:38.850> is

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
parts one is the u ball which is

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.630 
parts one is the u ball which is
represented<00:00:39.690> by<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.050> white<00:00:40.440> ball<00:00:40.800> if<00:00:41.579> you

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
represented by the white ball if you

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.280 
represented by the white ball if you
follow<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.239> white<00:00:42.420> ball<00:00:42.629> you'll<00:00:42.840> notice<00:00:43.140> that

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
follow the white ball you'll notice that

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.319 
follow the white ball you'll notice that
all<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.590> does<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.950> travel<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.520> u<00:00:44.789> pattern

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
all it does is travel in a u pattern

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.850 
all it does is travel in a u pattern
back<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.350> forth<00:00:47.090> underneath<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.590> it<00:00:49.590> never

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
back and forth underneath and it never

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.869 
back and forth underneath and it never
does<00:00:50.250> anything<00:00:50.520> other<00:00:50.910> than<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:52.879> where

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
does anything other than that so where

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.850 
does anything other than that so where
most<00:00:54.090> people<00:00:54.390> run<00:00:54.570> into<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.840> problem<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.590> what's

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
most people run into a problem is what's

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.110 
most people run into a problem is what's
going<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.340> with<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.090> top<00:00:57.300> balls<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:59.670> two<00:00:59.850> red

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
going on with the top balls the two red

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.560 
going on with the top balls the two red
ones<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:02.690> when<00:01:03.690> you're<00:01:03.840> doing<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:06.330> have

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
ones so when you're doing this you have

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.640 
ones so when you're doing this you have
to<00:01:07.189> remember<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.630> trick<00:01:09.930> consists<00:01:10.530> of

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
to remember that the trick consists of

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.030 
to remember that the trick consists of
your<00:01:10.860> arms<00:01:11.310> going<00:01:12.119> back<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.630> forth<00:01:13.040> crossing

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
your arms going back and forth crossing

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.469 
your arms going back and forth crossing
over<00:01:14.310> top<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.580> each<00:01:14.820> other<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:17.299> what<00:01:18.299> you're

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
over top of each other so what you're

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.910 
over top of each other so what you're
doing<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.350> regular<00:01:19.680> cascade

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
doing is just like in regular cascade

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.590 
doing is just like in regular cascade
you're<00:01:20.369> throwing<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.759> two<00:01:20.939> balls<00:01:21.180> up<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
you're throwing the two balls up and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.510 
you're throwing the two balls up and
they're<00:01:21.720> switching<00:01:22.110> hands<00:01:22.409> but<00:01:23.400> you're

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
they're switching hands but you're

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520 
they're switching hands but you're
starting<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.060> your<00:01:24.299> hands<00:01:24.659> crossed<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
starting with your hands crossed and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.990 
starting with your hands crossed and
you're<00:01:25.619> going<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.920> throw<00:01:26.130> with<00:01:26.280> your<00:01:26.460> top<00:01:26.700> hand

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
you're going to throw with your top hand

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.679 
you're going to throw with your top hand
first<00:01:27.500> this<00:01:28.500> way<00:01:30.740> okay<00:01:32.030> your<00:01:33.030> hands<00:01:33.270> will<00:01:33.540> then

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
first this way okay your hands will then

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.230 
first this way okay your hands will then
uncross<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.799> you'll<00:01:35.460> throw<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.909> other<00:01:36.090> ball

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
uncross and you'll throw the other ball

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.819 
uncross and you'll throw the other ball
from<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.020> same<00:01:37.290> direction<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:39.439> catch<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.680> on

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
from the same direction and catch it on

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.569 
from the same direction and catch it on
the<00:01:40.860> other<00:01:41.430> side<00:01:42.890> with<00:01:43.890> your<00:01:44.040> hands<00:01:44.220> crossed

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
the other side with your hands crossed

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.300 
the other side with your hands crossed
the<00:01:45.119> other<00:01:45.329> direction<00:01:45.750> first<00:01:46.590> ball<00:01:46.829> goes<00:01:47.070> up

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
the other direction first ball goes up

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.810 
the other direction first ball goes up
and<00:01:48.229> you<00:01:49.229> catch<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.470> with<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.070> other<00:01:50.369> hand<00:01:51.259> so

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
and you catch it with the other hand so

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
and you catch it with the other hand so
I'm<00:01:53.820> just<00:01:53.970> doing<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.270> with<00:01:54.360> one<00:01:54.420> ball<00:01:54.659> I'm

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
I'm just doing it with one ball I'm

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.320 
I'm just doing it with one ball I'm
doing<00:01:55.079> this

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.420 

it's<00:01:59.170> going<00:01:59.410> up<00:01:59.500> I'm<00:01:59.620> catching<00:01:59.950> it<00:02:00.010> and

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
it's going up I'm catching it and

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.760 
it's going up I'm catching it and
catching<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.150> second<00:02:01.540> ball<00:02:01.660> underneath<00:02:02.530> with

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
catching the second ball underneath with

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.210 
catching the second ball underneath with
the<00:02:02.800> other<00:02:03.070> hand<00:02:04.560> once<00:02:05.560> you<00:02:05.710> can<00:02:05.860> get<00:02:05.980> that

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
the other hand once you can get that

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.300 
the other hand once you can get that
down<00:02:06.580> back<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.240> forth<00:02:08.040> smoothly<00:02:09.040> just<00:02:11.310> like

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
down back and forth smoothly just like

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.970 
down back and forth smoothly just like
that<00:02:12.570> you'll<00:02:13.570> kind<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:14.080> start<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.440> see<00:02:14.560> where

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
that you'll kind of start to see where

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:27.150 
that you'll kind of start to see where
the<00:02:15.100> third<00:02:15.430> ball<00:02:15.730> fits<00:02:16.060> in<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:26.230> Mills

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
the third ball fits in and that is Mills

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.370 
the third ball fits in and that is Mills
