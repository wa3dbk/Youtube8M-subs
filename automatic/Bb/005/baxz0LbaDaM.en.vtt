00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.090
 hello my name is maxim and today 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.660
 just talk update from the company 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.900
 all content 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.299
 model d50 38 by and large take 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.880
 previous model c 5036 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.939
 changed the processor from 4th and 1st place 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.140
 dual-core angel i'm here last 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.570
 version 44 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.699
 no more changes 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.619
 And now let's see how 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.869
 impact on performance 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.059
 changes in our new model drove 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.670
 sold an updated model of the exact 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.670
 same boxes as previous c 5036 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.180
 equipment similar to the charger 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.640
 device on 055 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:53.219
 milliamper network cable and headset 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.070
 ordinary non vacuum under cover 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.030
 battery we find battery capacity 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.219
 1800 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:05.700
 milliampere two slots for micro sim card 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.380
 and slot for micro sd memory expansion 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.140
 very sorry key 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.450
 unlocking is on top they are in 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.490
 more convenient side location here with us 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.680
 is the volume rocker but on 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.259
 on the back we see an LED 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.229
 flash and speaker remove the protective film 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.090
 we find that there is nothing behind it 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.920
 will have to shell out on 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.720
 additional full protective 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.409
 film display no resolution 854 by 480 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.600
 points 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.119
 4 and a half inches 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.780
 pixel density is 240 pixels 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.470
 per inch 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.799
 The screen is very budget tft hd with 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.530
 the slopes of the colors are distorted for this 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.270
 cost we already used to see 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.970
 quality ips-matrix competitors 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.530
 here we have to be content 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.049
 state employees tft screen 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.350
 when scrolling through desktops we do not 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:03.329
 see no slowdown vlogs that 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.729
 here we have everything works smoothly without 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.299
 brakes let's run antutu 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.670
 benchmark 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.300
 check smartphone performance 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.120
 synthetic dough 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:19.280
 so here gives out about seven frames 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:22.840
 second principle picture pretty yet 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.840
 routine considering the cost of a smartphone 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.820
 that is, nothing unusual of some kind 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:37.420
 good or bad we are not here 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:37.420
 watch and again antutu crashes 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.900
 Now we will run and he will show you 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:48.200
 how many parrots are gaining our 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:50.180
 smartphone 14,651 points, in principle, this 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.300
 not bad considering the cost of this 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.590
 the device in more detail let's go over 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.960
 characteristics of android 4 4 version 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.800
 mediatek 6582 processor 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:09.010
 3d accelerator mali-400 resolution 854 on 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:12.350
 480 camera here 5 and 3 megapixels 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.240
 RAM 512 megabytes for this 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.530
 competitors cost we often already 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.910
 see 1 gigabyte of RAM 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.990
 quad-core clock processor 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:27.560
 maximum frequency of 13 gigahertz 240 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.459
 dots per inch and front camera 0 3 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.250
 megapixels 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.390
 now run a couple of peas check 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.390
 real performance 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.690
 Avramiy we have a problem to run itself 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:04.340
 play when you click on play nothing 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:10.270
 d3 happens and also does not start 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.270
 the game freezes during authentication 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.220
 smartphone to buy than to the Internet speed 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.130
 up to 100 megabits 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.350
 try to clear all applications with 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:29.600
 RAM try again 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:31.810
 run as you see nothing further not 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.810
 happens 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:44.069
 so lay out a few minutes though 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.069
 internet works 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:59.370
 much to my surprise he is 8 bedroom 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.370
 started up and running without any complaints 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:15.510
 the best smartphone is very good but not 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:18.780
 Enough brightness and by the way on the screen 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:24.470
 camera dwarf display looks more accurate 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:27.000
 rather than check the camera in reality 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.060
 here we have it 5 megapixels 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.960
 unfortunately does not have autofocus though 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.930
 this cost 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:40.250
 among competitors we already see autofocus 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:45.150
 that is, when photographing text 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:48.800
 some small details clearly 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.640
 nothing can be read 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.530
 front camera with spring 3 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:59.970
 megapixel budget but more 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:02.100
 demand for the cost and do not just 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:06.060
 that made a few calls checked 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:08.070
 the sound of speech dynamics its sound 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.370
 everyday a little lack of volume 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:15.120
 And so no complaints on quality 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:17.010
 connection I have Well interesting 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.150
 picture we are seeing with one 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.680
 the parties here have increased 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.050
 performance improved 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.790
 characteristics but appreciate the very 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.920
 gaming performance we donâ€™t 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.380
 It turns out because those games are simply 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.290
 does not start the game remained on the same 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.270
 The level of the test with it is very budget although 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.230
 for this cost competitors already have 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.620
 Pace Matrix 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.900
 RAM remains the same 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.180
 not 512 megabytes though the same 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.419
 competitors have long been gigabytes 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.760
 the camera here without autofocus is pretty 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.930
 Such budget although competitors already 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.240
 there is autofocus 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.310
 if you just need a phone with two 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.180
 sim cards you like this design 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.620
 I advise you to purchase if you want 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.110
 better pair with good 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.350
 display with a large amount of operational 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.419
 memory or less sane camera 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.729
 this acquisition level model 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:11.620
 advise if the video liked put 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:11.620
 likes subscribe and bye
