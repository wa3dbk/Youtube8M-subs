00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 before sexy how are my loves I hope 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.060
 and I know I have missed making 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.519
 time that a video of 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.679
 makeup and I hope you like this makes 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.300
 something quite simple I want to teach them 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.490
 How to apply a lipstick correctly 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.400
 rather how to make your lipstick them 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.890
 last all day and the truth to 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.480
 perfect the red lip because the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.490
 red color is one of the colors of 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.740
 more dangerous lipsticks despite being 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.930
 one of the colors that most calls us the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.480
 attention I think I was a woman but 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.719
 red labial session is a light of 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.850
 Algiers side aside I noticed that many 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.520
 women are afraid to use it well 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.879
 red I do not know why maybe it's because of 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.760
 margin of error or I do not know I hope to see if 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.690
 like the video by the way, it's not 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.210
 the one with the shadows 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.040
 because it's quite simple, it's just 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.520
 a yellow color 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:59.060
 with the cat line that I always apply and 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.060
 some tabs that are the number 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.830
 118 bile 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.830
 ah 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:15.170
 of smurf or what do you say that preferably 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.170
 our lips are already spoiled 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.000
 the description of the video I will put the 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.820
 video in which I teach them how to 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.909
 exfoliate your lips begin I'll 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.770
 apply a little bit of carmen you put it on 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.479
 the time they are very invented 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.479
 the excess of meats 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.580
 so that only what is needed is what 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.229
 that observes my lips very important 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.409
 that if we want our lipstick 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.509
 last all day we apply a base 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.940
 in this case it's going to be a delineator the 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.990
 pen is money is mix and you 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.790
 I recommend that if you do not have a 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.729
 eyeliner take a shadow of it 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.780
 color of your lipstick and use it as the 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.390
 base, the only thing we are going to do is take 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.790
 a brush diet and you will take the 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.360
 same color of lipstick in shade and you the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.360
 you are going to apply 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.490
 I'm going to do it with the 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.330
 eyeliner because I have it 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.330
 continuous 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:20.150
 keep in mind that you have to get the point 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.629
 that points are taken as battle but we 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.629
 we aligned 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.960
 If what you want is for your lips to 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.090
 they give a little thicker more 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.730
 voluptuous only that they have them 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.530
 You can look at yourself just a little outside of 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.480
 your lips so that they look more 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.690
 great and create the illusion that they are 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.690
 bigger 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.280
 although there is one time that we delineate 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.270
 out of the baby or line 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.270
 inside 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.000
 here 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.019
 ok now I'm just going to take a 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:44.379
 red lipstick this is also mix 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.359
 olavide red usually at 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:50.519
 people who are skin a little bit more 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:53.769
 dark and they have veins with a 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.349
 with a greenish hue it is recommended that 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.900
 Use warmer red colors than 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.959
 they would be the colors that are 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.299
 like oranges and yellows but in 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.900
 the red and the people who are more 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:11.319
 white with more numerous veins 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.859
 jealousy it is recommended that they use a 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.709
 red lipstick with more or less shades 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:19.419
 blue which is the base of the color that is not 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.120
 is going to look blue but pick up does 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:26.229
 with more than a touch that is cold the 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:29.320
 skin people with green veins shades 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:32.349
 warm for yellow and the most 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.780
 white with blue veins shades more 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:37.320
 blue 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:41.790
 I mean, it's cooler, I'm taking this 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:45.590
 of anise that the name is chic red 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.590
 I'm going to apply it gently 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.789
 in my lips 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.569
 Personally, I like it more where 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:09.509
 vÃ©lez with a cold base or with shades 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:12.770
 blue because they make you see the teeth 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.770
 whiter the truth 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.180
 very important that if you committed some 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.580
 mistakes or you got a little bit of the 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.070
 fence is very important to correct 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.870
 Of course you can correct the only thing that 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.700
 let's do is take your compact powder 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.740
 your concealer some shade that 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.780
 look like your sky works take a 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.690
 small gross brushes that can be the 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.520
 concealer brush and let's move on 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.830
 around the contour of the lips to 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:41.300
 the time that is going to create this is that 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:45.639
 be more perfect that it seems as if 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.639
 were painted like a doll 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.319
 to give the final touch we can 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.930
 finish the red lips with thousands of 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:16.490
 ways we can if we want if what 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.650
 we want is our time to last us 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.930
 a lot of time what I 'm going to do is take 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.479
 a red shade and I'm going to apply it 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:27.189
 where the vega already applies, that's what 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:27.189
 what you are going to do is empty the lip 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.889
 and it will lengthen its duration at the same time 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.930
 we can add another color in the part 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:39.620
 of the medium if we want to perfect the 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:44.169
 color add a little bit of gloss 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.169
 so that the red is more brightly quoted 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:54.379
 or if we want something sexier for the 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:56.209
 night we can add the pigment 

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:58.189
 Shiny that always added for everything 

00:06:56.209 --> 00:07:01.029
 that now ready and I will add the 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:01.029
 contribution of the medium 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:08.759
 and top 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:17.809
 and it's going to lower a bit more drama 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:20.299
 our lips everything depends on the 

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:23.719
 occasion girls what I recommend them 

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:25.909
 is that they perfect with dust Thursday 

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:27.709
 the end came to this video I hope that 

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:29.869
 you liked me I am that it is something very 

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:32.329
 very simple basic provided that the 

00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:34.579
 most women will leave a 

00:07:32.329 --> 00:07:36.589
 disaster on their lips when they apply the 

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:39.199
 red color remember that you can apply 

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:41.239
 in red crossbreed because being pink can be 

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:43.249
 any color that you want this 

00:07:41.239 --> 00:07:46.159
 it can be a blue color a green I do not know 

00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:48.499
 you of people profit your creativity 

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:50.300
