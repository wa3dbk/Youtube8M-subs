00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.099
 2003 was already the year in which 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.599
 Peugeot surprised us with the 206 sw and 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.700
 compact station car the b-segment 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.139
 and in my opinion a very successful one 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.330
 car 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.020
 then it was time for the 207 we got 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.119
 this device but now we are at 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.410
 the 208 arrived and the world is one 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.300
 changed a bit because at the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:32.070
 In today's competition we see cars 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:33.809
 like this and this and this and this so that 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.860
 Peugeot attach great with the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.250
 speed of nations and come with this 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.250
 busy 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.239
 I have to admit you very honestly myself 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.309
 I am not such a huge fan of me 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.920
 small SUVs need some higher hassle 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.780
 not really as far as I am concerned but I have to 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.429
 say this is a bigger device 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.129
 we have a lot of them 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:00.019
 Clasie frivolous details see here 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.510
 frutseltje a headlight 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.810
 lots of chrome all lines and 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.430
 here and kind of bubble in the roofline that 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.810
 then again does not run into it 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.789
 passenger compartment 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.220
 do not shock why it is here then 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.320
 let's say you get that again 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.320
 characteristic is the sure 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.180
 yes a character is nowadays 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.970
 A magic word is cared more and more 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.370
 the shape in car country nowadays min 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.960
 the interior runs up a lot 208 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.190
 see it here and it all looks neat 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.040
 from 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.530
 yet it remains a little nibble 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.040
 for me this asked more than 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.790
 a 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.790
 208 esmee 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.790
 mean take the space the back of the car 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.210
 is very reasonable I can not do otherwise 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.310
 say 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.270
 but I'm just trying to get behind myself 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.350
 sit and well that is quite difficult 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.660
 but if you are a smaller driver 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.310
 then it falls reasonable can 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.910
 I didn't have to say good but that 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.980
 succeeded in a 207 sw also does fine 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.420
 the other side you indeed see something 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.979
 higher so you have a better view 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.630
 about the other traffic 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.620
 yes that is what the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.620
 people are there to want 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.910
 a high one is certainly and you will notice that too 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.510
 in the turns 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.080
 so a comfortable out of you this 2008 and 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.500
 in curves yes it simply hangs more 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.760
 on one ear than a lower car on the other 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.630
 I think most customers think so 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.360
 not so bad at all 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.190
 go find it because he sends he relaxed 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.720
 four the next 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.590
 I think this is a car that whole 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.590
 made many people happy 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.940
 However, don't expect too much if you have one 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.940
 once a heart farmer wants 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.610
 black will be available with four in 2008 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.670
 motorizations and driving today in the 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.409
 for a while vti the fastest and for the time being 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.900
 thickest gasoline engine 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.390
 I need some now likes to sit on 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.730
 despite the fact that the 2008 is relatively compact 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.489
 it is also relatively free 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.849
 heavy and you can feel it 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:32.340
 120hp team life but certainly uphill 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.959
 it does not come out yes that makes anyway 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.760
 I kind of hold my heart 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.700
 tomorrow because then we are going to drive with 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.090
 the entry motor and a point waiting 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.090
 3-cylinder 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.020
 so that clearly a three-cylinder is the one 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.150
 point two 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.170
 vti with 82 whole tickets and I can 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.840
 be clear about that 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:22.340
 You should really see this if there is an entry-level motor 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.690
 mean as long as the landscape is flat 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.620
 actually fell very well ahead 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.480
 just got me up 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.690
 but now here are a little bit in the Alsace 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.330
 playing in the hills and then falls 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.420
 really merciless by the basket 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.920
 just very few couple tell you 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.000
 must continuously return to the lower 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.620
 gears 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.320
 so in conclusion I think that for 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.540
 the netherlands absolutely do as much as if 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.680
 you want to go to Kaalberg once 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.680
 you will have to go back to one 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.980
 well we are now behind that there 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.830
 Peugeot 2008 and car is not whole 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.300
 trying very hard to disguise 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.670
 that he actually just a neat 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.250
 family car is all we outward 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.470
 embellish very almost modern things 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.180
 board but you go beyond all those details 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.910
 look then you just see this car 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.710
 is a great mid-engine 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.300
 reasonable interior space and driving behavior 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.910
 then a bit between the nissan juke 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.260
 the Opel mocha you actually are 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.490
 not too many things that I really like 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.600
 criticize 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.800
 except those powertrains 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.770
 has become very clear 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.870
 this car performs at a push 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.490
 oh shit because it is secretly deep 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.490
 really normal inside 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.040
 Yes
