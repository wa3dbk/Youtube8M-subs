you a couple of cool things you can do
with<00:00:29.939> them<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.480> first<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.720> all<00:00:30.779> I'm<00:00:30.869> going<00:00:30.990> to

with them so first of all I'm going to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.299 
with them so first of all I'm going to
talk<00:00:31.170> about<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.500> enhanced<00:00:31.890> moves<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.219> how

talk about the enhanced moves and how

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.970 
talk about the enhanced moves and how
the<00:00:32.369> different<00:00:32.579> before<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.719> would<00:00:33.930> have<00:00:34.829> you

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the different before you would have you

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.770 
the different before you would have you
enhanced<00:00:35.430> move<00:00:35.690> and<00:00:37.250> you<00:00:38.250> know<00:00:38.629> you<00:00:39.629> would

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
enhanced move and you know you would

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.930 
enhanced move and you know you would
have<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.079> enhance<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.190> use<00:00:41.460> diff<00:00:41.700> so

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
have to enhance it as you use diff so

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.610 
have to enhance it as you use diff so
for<00:00:42.120> example<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.540> slide<00:00:42.840> if<00:00:43.200> I'm<00:00:43.350> hitting<00:00:43.530> my

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
for example the slide if I'm hitting my

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.440 
for example the slide if I'm hitting my
enhanced<00:00:43.860> button<00:00:44.250> doesn't<00:00:45.239> look<00:00:45.329> like

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
enhanced button doesn't look like

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.029 
enhanced button doesn't look like
anything's<00:00:45.840> happening<00:00:46.170> I'm<00:00:46.350> not<00:00:46.530> losing<00:00:46.739> any

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
anything's happening I'm not losing any

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.500 
anything's happening I'm not losing any
meter<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.610> nothing's<00:00:47.910> getting<00:00:48.090> enhanced

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
meter so nothing's getting enhanced

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.290 
meter so nothing's getting enhanced
quickly<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.289> happens<00:00:49.620> with<00:00:50.059> all<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
quickly and this happens with all the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.720 
quickly and this happens with all the
moves<00:00:51.510> except<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.379> exception<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.129> sort<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.610> my

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
moves except the exception of sort of my

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.119 
moves except the exception of sort of my
ranged<00:00:54.180> attack<00:00:54.480> there<00:00:54.870> which<00:00:55.410> will<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:55.980> i

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
ranged attack there which will if i

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.639 
ranged attack there which will if i
enhance<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.910> will<00:00:57.149> explode<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.530> know

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
enhance it will explode so you know

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.260 
enhance it will explode so you know
until<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.129> actually<00:00:59.160> lands<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.000> player

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
until it actually lands on the player

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.830 
until it actually lands on the player
you<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.840> enhance<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:02.100> majority<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.840> special

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
you can enhance the majority of special

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.020 
you can enhance the majority of special
moves<00:01:04.049> now<00:01:04.379> pretty<00:01:05.040> much<00:01:05.159> moves<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.970> be

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
moves now pretty much moves have to be

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.690 
moves now pretty much moves have to be
enhanced<00:01:06.450> afterwards<00:01:06.900> some<00:01:07.170> moves<00:01:08.040> are<00:01:08.310> in

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
enhanced afterwards some moves are in

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.330 
enhanced afterwards some moves are in
exception<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.450> said<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.740> example<00:01:10.770> let's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
exception like I said for example let's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.820 
exception like I said for example let's
get<00:01:12.210> myself<00:01:12.360> another<00:01:12.659> meeting<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.439> show<00:01:13.770> you

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
get myself another meeting so I show you

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.789 
get myself another meeting so I show you
some<00:01:13.950> stuff<00:01:14.040> for<00:01:14.880> example<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.540> can<00:01:16.259> blow<00:01:16.619> these

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
some stuff for example I can blow these

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.640 
some stuff for example I can blow these
off<00:01:17.210> using<00:01:18.210> me<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.360> make<00:01:18.600> them<00:01:18.900> explode<00:01:19.140> way

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
off using me to make them explode way

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.530 
off using me to make them explode way
before<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.369> they<00:01:20.820> even<00:01:21.030> get<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.299> place<00:01:21.509> that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
before I they even get to the place that

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.270 
before I they even get to the place that
they<00:01:21.750> don't<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.229> actually<00:01:22.470> land<00:01:22.770> whereas

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
they don't have to actually land whereas

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.649 
they don't have to actually land whereas
the<00:01:23.880> slide<00:01:25.640> actually<00:01:26.640> let's<00:01:26.939> use<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.330> string

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the slide actually let's use this string

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.120 
the slide actually let's use this string
once<00:01:27.900> again<00:01:29.810> slide<00:01:30.810> does<00:01:31.170> wow<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.770> can't

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
once again slide does wow I can't

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.289 
once again slide does wow I can't
believe<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.430> hit<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> runway<00:01:32.850> input<00:01:33.150> there

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
believe I hit the runway input there

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.289 
believe I hit the runway input there
there<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.049> go<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.380> slide<00:01:34.619> does<00:01:34.829> okay<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.520> like

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
there we go the slide does okay so like

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.679 
there we go the slide does okay so like
I<00:01:36.420> showed<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:37.560> wouldn't<00:01:37.890> enhance<00:01:38.329> if<00:01:39.329> I

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
I showed you it wouldn't enhance if I

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.010 
I showed you it wouldn't enhance if I
was<00:01:39.979> using

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
was using

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.620 
was using
it's<00:01:42.649> just<00:01:42.859> normally<00:01:43.280> out<00:01:43.549> here<00:01:43.909> but<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:44.479> will

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
it's just normally out here but it will

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.630 
it's just normally out here but it will
enhance<00:01:44.750> when<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.229> actually<00:01:45.469> land<00:01:46.219> on<00:01:46.399> the

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
enhance when I actually land on the

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.639 
enhance when I actually land on the
player<00:01:46.909> so<00:01:47.240> that's<00:01:47.780> how<00:01:47.929> it<00:01:48.049> works<00:01:48.259> you<00:01:48.469> hit

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
player so that's how it works you hit

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.039 
player so that's how it works you hit
your<00:01:48.740> right<00:01:48.950> trigger<00:01:49.340> as<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:50.420> land<00:01:50.840> the

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
your right trigger as you land the

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.800 
your right trigger as you land the
special<00:01:51.439> move<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:52.610> wouldn't<00:01:53.240> use<00:01:53.329> it<00:01:53.360> now<00:01:53.600> as

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
special move so I wouldn't use it now as

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.209 
special move so I wouldn't use it now as
i'm<00:01:53.960> as<00:01:54.380> i'm<00:01:54.679> doing<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.130> output<00:01:55.509> but<00:01:56.509> i<00:01:56.539> use<00:01:56.869> it

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
i'm as i'm doing the output but i use it

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.139 
i'm as i'm doing the output but i use it
just<00:01:58.219> now<00:01:58.460> no<00:02:00.100> slight<00:02:01.100> different<00:02:01.520> timing<00:02:01.850> but

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
just now no slight different timing but

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.969 
just now no slight different timing but
you<00:02:02.299> know<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:03.200> does<00:02:03.380> make<00:02:03.560> all<00:02:03.709> the<00:02:03.860> difference

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
you know it does make all the difference

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.809 
you know it does make all the difference
because<00:02:05.140> it<00:02:06.140> does<00:02:06.469> mean<00:02:06.770> that<00:02:06.799> if<00:02:07.280> you<00:02:07.399> get<00:02:07.579> hit

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
because it does mean that if you get hit

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.699 
because it does mean that if you get hit
out<00:02:07.939> of<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.179> special<00:02:08.599> move<00:02:08.750> whilst<00:02:09.349> you<00:02:09.500> doing

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
out of a special move whilst you doing

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.400 
out of a special move whilst you doing
it<00:02:09.830> for<00:02:09.950> example<00:02:10.340> superman<00:02:11.090> if<00:02:11.450> Wonder<00:02:12.170> Woman

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
it for example superman if Wonder Woman

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.559 
it for example superman if Wonder Woman
was<00:02:12.500> to<00:02:12.799> throw<00:02:13.069> projector<00:02:13.489> at<00:02:13.580> me<00:02:13.700> as<00:02:13.849> i<00:02:14.030> used

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
was to throw projector at me as i used

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.809 
was to throw projector at me as i used
the<00:02:14.780> grapple<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.950> would<00:02:16.099> knock<00:02:16.310> me<00:02:16.340> out<00:02:16.519> of<00:02:16.730> it

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
the grapple it would knock me out of it

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.670 
the grapple it would knock me out of it
but<00:02:17.000> i<00:02:17.060> can't<00:02:17.299> actually<00:02:17.480> enhance<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.140> until

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
but i can't actually enhance it until

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.280 
but i can't actually enhance it until
I'm<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.700> know<00:02:19.819> in<00:02:20.000> front<00:02:20.209> of<00:02:20.480> her<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:20.780> that

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
I'm you know in front of her and that

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.740 
I'm you know in front of her and that
because<00:02:21.560> his<00:02:21.799> enhanced<00:02:22.340> grapple<00:02:22.940> is<00:02:23.120> canceled

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
because his enhanced grapple is canceled

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.229 
because his enhanced grapple is canceled
so<00:02:25.269> yeah<00:02:26.269> I<00:02:26.510> mean<00:02:26.870> with<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.860> being<00:02:28.040> said<00:02:28.239> you

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
so yeah I mean with that being said you

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.059 
so yeah I mean with that being said you
know<00:02:30.200> what<00:02:30.410> we're<00:02:30.590> basically<00:02:30.709> saying<00:02:31.220> here<00:02:31.610> is

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
know what we're basically saying here is

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.680 
know what we're basically saying here is
you<00:02:34.069> know<00:02:34.190> we're<00:02:34.459> not<00:02:34.610> going<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.849> see<00:02:35.150> me<00:02:35.660> a

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
you know we're not going to see me a

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.229 
you know we're not going to see me a
wastage<00:02:36.380> as<00:02:36.680> much<00:02:36.890> like<00:02:37.190> in<00:02:37.340> what<00:02:37.519> cometic<00:02:38.090> it

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
wastage as much like in what cometic it

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.759 
wastage as much like in what cometic it
could<00:02:38.480> be<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:38.930> know<00:02:39.049> you<00:02:39.260> could<00:02:39.410> be<00:02:39.560> knocked

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
could be you know you could be knocked

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.380 
could be you know you could be knocked
out<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.099> an<00:02:40.190> enhanced<00:02:40.610> move<00:02:40.819> if<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.180> didn't

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
out of an enhanced move if it didn't

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.100 
out of an enhanced move if it didn't
have<00:02:41.510> armor<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:43.209> you<00:02:44.209> could<00:02:44.420> waste<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:45.079> by

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
have armor and you could waste it by

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.629 
have armor and you could waste it by
accidentally<00:02:45.769> enhancements<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:46.430> didn't

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:46.639 
accidentally enhancements and you didn't

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.300 
accidentally enhancements and you didn't
want<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.850> or<00:02:47.269> using<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.900> at<00:02:48.139> at<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.769> wrong<00:02:49.010> time

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
want to or using it at at the wrong time

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.120 
want to or using it at at the wrong time
so<00:02:49.989> basically<00:02:50.989> what<00:02:51.380> we're<00:02:51.500> seeing<00:02:51.650> here<00:02:51.799> is<00:02:52.010> a

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
so basically what we're seeing here is a

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.180 
so basically what we're seeing here is a
lot<00:02:52.370> less<00:02:52.639> nita<00:02:53.180> wastage<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:53.959> actually<00:02:54.799> kind

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
lot less nita wastage and actually kind

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.860 
lot less nita wastage and actually kind
of<00:02:55.250> indicates<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:55.819> me<00:02:56.299> is<00:02:56.510> going<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:56.810> be

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
of indicates that me is going to be

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.190 
of indicates that me is going to be
quite<00:02:57.230> important<00:02:57.769> in<00:02:57.859> this<00:02:58.010> game<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:59.209> you<00:03:00.079> know

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
quite important in this game so you know

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.650 
quite important in this game so you know
that<00:03:00.470> is<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:01.400> know<00:03:01.459> my<00:03:01.850> sort<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.180> take<00:03:02.389> on<00:03:02.569> it

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
that is you know my sort of take on it

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.680 
that is you know my sort of take on it
anyway<00:03:03.049> for<00:03:03.410> EXO<00:03:04.370> ue<00:03:05.060> x<00:03:05.420> your<00:03:05.630> move<00:03:05.980> after<00:03:06.980> you

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
anyway for EXO ue x your move after you

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.550 
anyway for EXO ue x your move after you
land<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.930> not<00:03:09.519> you<00:03:10.519> know<00:03:10.639> whilst<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:11.900> actually

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
land it not you know whilst you actually

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.500 
land it not you know whilst you actually
use<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:12.950> enhanced<00:03:13.370> move<00:03:13.549> so<00:03:13.849> there's<00:03:14.329> the

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
use the enhanced move so there's the

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.440 
use the enhanced move so there's the
difference<00:03:15.340> now<00:03:16.340> this<00:03:16.639> is<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.819> little<00:03:17.150> more<00:03:17.299> of

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
difference now this is a little more of

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.390 
difference now this is a little more of
a<00:03:17.540> difficult<00:03:17.989> subject<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.650> talk<00:03:18.799> about<00:03:18.859> here

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
a difficult subject to talk about here

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.629 
a difficult subject to talk about here
but<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.090> is<00:03:20.299> in<00:03:20.599> fact<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:21.260> just<00:03:21.889> buildings<00:03:22.549> to

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
but it is in fact and just buildings to

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.710 
but it is in fact and just buildings to
meet<00:03:22.819> both<00:03:23.150> of<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.510> characters<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:23.989> bit<00:03:24.290> it<00:03:25.160> is

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
meet both of the characters a bit it is

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.130 
meet both of the characters a bit it is
what<00:03:27.530> is<00:03:27.680> a<00:03:28.610> bounce<00:03:29.240> Council<00:03:30.310> basically<00:03:32.140> what

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
what is a bounce Council basically what

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.810 
what is a bounce Council basically what
we're<00:03:33.230> going<00:03:33.320> to<00:03:33.410> see<00:03:33.590> here<00:03:34.010> is<00:03:36.580> one<00:03:37.580> of<00:03:37.700> these

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
we're going to see here is one of these

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.340 
we're going to see here is one of these
things<00:03:38.120> we<00:03:38.420> can<00:03:38.570> either<00:03:38.690> do<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.930> full<00:03:39.140> bounce

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
things we can either do a full bounce

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.470 
things we can either do a full bounce
there<00:03:40.070> we<00:03:40.130> go<00:03:40.250> a<00:03:40.280> bit<00:03:40.460> longer<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:41.090> bit<00:03:41.360> of<00:03:41.420> a

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
there we go a bit longer a bit of a

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.600 
there we go a bit longer a bit of a
longer<00:03:41.660> combo<00:03:42.080> or<00:03:42.410> we<00:03:42.560> can<00:03:42.680> do<00:03:42.800> a<00:03:43.070> ground

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
longer combo or we can do a ground

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.050 
longer combo or we can do a ground
bounce<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:44.180> you<00:03:44.900> know<00:03:45.050> sort<00:03:45.470> of<00:03:46.030> you<00:03:47.030> know

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
bounce and you know sort of you know

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.000 
bounce and you know sort of you know
extend<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.780> combo<00:03:48.110> they're<00:03:48.500> just<00:03:48.530> basically

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
extend the combo they're just basically

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.770 
extend the combo they're just basically
different<00:03:49.580> ways<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.940> extend<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.390> combo<00:03:50.690> and

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
different ways to extend the combo and

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.450 
different ways to extend the combo and
let's<00:03:50.930> just<00:03:51.080> waste<00:03:51.500> away<00:03:51.680> this<00:03:51.950> white<00:03:52.250> bar

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
let's just waste away this white bar

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.090 
let's just waste away this white bar
here<00:03:52.850> so<00:03:53.330> I<00:03:53.360> can<00:03:53.450> show<00:03:53.690> you<00:03:53.830> you'll<00:03:54.830> have<00:03:54.860> to

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
here so I can show you you'll have to

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.630 
here so I can show you you'll have to
burn<00:03:55.250> two<00:03:55.550> meters<00:03:55.880> now<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:57.190> do<00:03:58.190> one<00:03:58.370> of<00:03:58.400> these

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
burn two meters now to do one of these

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.880 
burn two meters now to do one of these
and<00:03:58.940> now<00:03:59.270> normally<00:03:59.690> it<00:03:59.840> would<00:03:59.930> be<00:04:00.050> back<00:04:00.530> in<00:04:00.740> a

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
and now normally it would be back in a

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.850 
and now normally it would be back in a
or<00:04:01.700> back<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:02.630> heavy<00:04:02.840> back<00:04:03.170> and<00:04:03.350> one<00:04:03.560> what<00:04:03.830> a

back three or four three would do a

way<00:04:56.090> you<00:04:56.120> can<00:04:56.479> use<00:04:56.720> this<00:04:56.900> is<00:04:57.140> if<00:04:57.350> you're<00:04:57.530> quite

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
way you can use this is if you're quite

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.690 
way you can use this is if you're quite
close<00:04:58.190> to<00:04:58.550> a<00:04:59.479> level<00:05:00.260> transition<00:05:00.919> or<00:05:01.070> if<00:05:01.220> even

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
close to a level transition or if even

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.790 
close to a level transition or if even
you're<00:05:01.880> right<00:05:02.150> up<00:05:02.300> against<00:05:02.540> the<00:05:02.720> wall<00:05:02.900> where

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
you're right up against the wall where

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.130 
you're right up against the wall where
you<00:05:03.890> can<00:05:04.070> level<00:05:04.310> transit<00:05:04.880> you<00:05:05.330> can<00:05:05.540> get<00:05:05.990> off<00:05:06.110> a

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
you can level transit you can get off a

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.659 
you can level transit you can get off a
hell<00:05:06.590> of<00:05:06.620> a<00:05:06.740> lot<00:05:06.860> of<00:05:06.950> damage<00:05:07.130> and<00:05:07.250> those<00:05:07.460> two

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
hell of a lot of damage and those two

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.820 
hell of a lot of damage and those two
bars<00:05:07.910> but<00:05:08.180> you<00:05:08.270> can<00:05:08.419> do<00:05:08.570> a<00:05:08.600> lot<00:05:09.020> of<00:05:09.080> damage<00:05:09.500> if

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
bars but you can do a lot of damage if

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.320 
bars but you can do a lot of damage if
you<00:05:10.390> cancel<00:05:11.390> out<00:05:11.780> of<00:05:11.960> your<00:05:12.110> combo<00:05:13.180> just<00:05:14.180> before

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
you cancel out of your combo just before

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.909 
you cancel out of your combo just before
you<00:05:14.510> sort<00:05:14.780> of<00:05:14.810> end<00:05:15.020> the<00:05:15.169> combo<00:05:15.500> and<00:05:15.590> that<00:05:15.740> if

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
you sort of end the combo and that if

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.710 
you sort of end the combo and that if
you<00:05:16.040> have<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.310> timing<00:05:16.760> right<00:05:16.790> you<00:05:17.390> can<00:05:17.540> cancel

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
you have the timing right you can cancel

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.060 
you have the timing right you can cancel
out<00:05:17.960> of<00:05:18.110> it<00:05:18.260> and<00:05:18.380> put<00:05:19.130> them<00:05:19.220> through<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:21.070> put

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
out of it and put them through the put

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.070 
out of it and put them through the put
them<00:05:22.190> through<00:05:22.460> the<00:05:22.820> actual<00:05:23.390> environment

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
them through the actual environment

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.840 
them through the actual environment
taking<00:05:24.590> them<00:05:24.680> up<00:05:24.800> to<00:05:24.979> nearly<00:05:25.370> forty<00:05:25.640> percent

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
taking them up to nearly forty percent

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.159 
taking them up to nearly forty percent
damage<00:05:26.030> as<00:05:26.330> you<00:05:26.360> saw<00:05:26.600> there<00:05:26.630> thirty-eight

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
damage as you saw there thirty-eight

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.290 
damage as you saw there thirty-eight
percent<00:05:27.260> damage<00:05:27.560> is<00:05:27.919> a<00:05:27.950> lot<00:05:28.160> of<00:05:28.220> damage<00:05:28.430> and

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
percent damage is a lot of damage and

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.140 
percent damage is a lot of damage and
then<00:05:30.140> of<00:05:30.260> course<00:05:30.470> you<00:05:30.590> can<00:05:30.770> do<00:05:30.950> all<00:05:31.729> sorts<00:05:31.790> of

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
then of course you can do all sorts of

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.990 
then of course you can do all sorts of
things<00:05:32.300> with<00:05:32.510> this<00:05:32.660> so<00:05:32.870> I<00:05:32.900> could

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
things with this so I could

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.850 
things with this so I could
bounce<00:05:34.480> them<00:05:34.690> off<00:05:34.780> of<00:05:34.840> walls<00:05:35.170> I<00:05:35.350> can<00:05:35.470> pop<00:05:35.680> them

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
bounce them off of walls I can pop them

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.010 
bounce them off of walls I can pop them
off<00:05:36.010> I<00:05:36.190> can<00:05:36.370> if<00:05:36.910> I<00:05:37.060> can<00:05:37.090> actually<00:05:37.330> get<00:05:37.630> it<00:05:37.810> so

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
off I can if I can actually get it so

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.410 
off I can if I can actually get it so
let's<00:05:38.740> just<00:05:38.950> take<00:05:39.160> a<00:05:39.190> short<00:05:39.850> combo<00:05:40.090> you<00:05:40.210> can<00:05:40.330> do

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
let's just take a short combo you can do

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.750 
let's just take a short combo you can do
this<00:05:40.540> with<00:05:40.750> any<00:05:40.780> size<00:05:41.230> combo<00:05:41.680> as<00:05:41.830> well<00:05:42.010> it

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
this with any size combo as well it

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.450 
this with any size combo as well it
doesn't<00:05:43.090> have<00:05:43.330> to<00:05:43.510> be<00:05:43.540> a<00:05:44.440> massively<00:05:45.190> long

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
doesn't have to be a massively long

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.490 
doesn't have to be a massively long
combo<00:05:45.940> although<00:05:46.870> it's<00:05:47.050> probably<00:05:47.140> not<00:05:47.470> worth

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
combo although it's probably not worth

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.230 
combo although it's probably not worth
it<00:05:47.860> if<00:05:47.980> you're<00:05:48.070> not<00:05:48.250> extending<00:05:48.550> something

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
it if you're not extending something

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.260 
it if you're not extending something
worthwhile<00:05:49.510> but<00:05:50.260> I<00:05:50.440> can<00:05:50.680> quite<00:05:51.100> literally<00:05:51.400> pop

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
worthwhile but I can quite literally pop

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.630 
worthwhile but I can quite literally pop
you<00:05:52.450> up<00:05:52.600> from<00:05:52.780> the<00:05:52.900> start<00:05:53.200> of<00:05:53.290> my<00:05:53.410> combo<00:05:53.830> I<00:05:54.040> can

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
you up from the start of my combo I can

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.700

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
level transition which is doing a lot

more damage so if you use these wisely
and<00:06:27.220> if<00:06:27.580> you<00:06:27.730> practice<00:06:28.860> practice<00:06:29.860> these<00:06:30.010> and

and if you practice practice these and

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.220 
and if you practice practice these and
I'm<00:06:30.669> sure<00:06:30.880> they'll<00:06:31.030> be<00:06:31.120> very<00:06:31.210> very<00:06:31.720> effective

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.230 
I'm sure they'll be very very effective

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.360 
I'm sure they'll be very very effective

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:12.700 
so i thought i'd make a video on that i

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.630
