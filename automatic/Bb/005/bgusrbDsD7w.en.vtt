Distronic TPU the only reason I can

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.399 
Distronic TPU the only reason I can
think<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.299> someone<00:01:27.540> may<00:01:27.689> not<00:01:27.990> want<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.290> pick

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409

think that someone may not want to pick
up<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.650> case<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.070> because<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.790> doesn't

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
up this case is because it doesn't

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.609 
up this case is because it doesn't
supply<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> protection<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.229> may<00:01:31.380> like
