auger belt idler pulley on your Honda
snowblower<00:00:06.390> some<00:00:07.379> of<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.560> symptoms<00:00:07.859> you<00:00:08.099> may

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
snowblower some of the symptoms you may

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.799 
snowblower some of the symptoms you may
have<00:00:08.400> when<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.730> idler<00:00:09.059> pulley<00:00:09.090> needs<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.690> be

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
have when the idler pulley needs to be

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.540 
have when the idler pulley needs to be
adjusted<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:11.010> when<00:00:11.190> you're<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.490> to

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
adjusted is that when you're going to

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.879 
adjusted is that when you're going to
move<00:00:11.790> some<00:00:12.030> snow<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:13.049> engage<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.650> auger

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
move some snow and you engage the auger

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.160 
move some snow and you engage the auger
it's<00:00:14.639> not<00:00:14.880> really<00:00:15.120> sure<00:00:15.299> how<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.450> snow<00:00:15.809> like<00:00:16.020> it

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
it's not really sure how to snow like it

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.410 
it's not really sure how to snow like it
should<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.340> other<00:00:17.460> words<00:00:17.730> when<00:00:17.910> engage<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
should so in other words when engage the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.910 
should so in other words when engage the
augers<00:00:18.779> they're<00:00:18.990> going<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.199> turn<00:00:19.350> perfectly

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
augers they're going to turn perfectly

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.830 
augers they're going to turn perfectly
fine<00:00:20.189> when<00:00:20.550> there<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.789> no<00:00:20.939> snow<00:00:21.180> going<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.600> or

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
fine when there is no snow going in or

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.840 
fine when there is no snow going in or
no<00:00:22.020> load<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.710> what's<00:00:23.220> going<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.460> happen<00:00:23.699> when

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
no load and what's going to happen when

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.310 
no load and what's going to happen when
you<00:00:23.880> get<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.240> under<00:00:24.480> load<00:00:24.660> like<00:00:25.050> when<00:00:25.199> you're

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
you get it under load like when you're

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.990 
you get it under load like when you're
blowing<00:00:25.410> some<00:00:25.740> snow<00:00:25.980> they're<00:00:26.609> gonna<00:00:26.699> stop

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
blowing some snow they're gonna stop

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.390 
blowing some snow they're gonna stop
turning<00:00:27.330> because<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.199> belt<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.619> slipping<00:00:29.160> off

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
turning because the belt is slipping off

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.279 
turning because the belt is slipping off
the<00:00:29.609> engine<00:00:29.910> pulley<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.420> again<00:00:31.080> that's

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
the engine pulley and again that's

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.229 
the engine pulley and again that's
because<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.769> idler<00:00:32.099> pulley<00:00:32.160> needs<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.090> be

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
because the idler pulley needs to be

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.750 
because the idler pulley needs to be
adjusted<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:34.020> put<00:00:34.320> more<00:00:34.500> tension<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.579> belt

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
adjusted to put more tension on the belt

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.569 
adjusted to put more tension on the belt
that<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.690> grabbing<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.380> engine<00:00:37.680> pulley<00:00:37.890> so

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
that is grabbing on the engine pulley so

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.780 
that is grabbing on the engine pulley so
the<00:00:38.700> blower<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.210> today<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.719> Honda<00:00:40.140> HS

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
the blower I have today is a Honda HS

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.310 
the blower I have today is a Honda HS
928<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.059> even<00:00:42.540> though<00:00:42.660> I'm<00:00:42.719> doing<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.290> a

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
928 and even though I'm doing this on a

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.350 
928 and even though I'm doing this on a
Honda<00:00:43.620> snowblower<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.370> same<00:00:44.640> principle<00:00:45.180> will

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
Honda snowblower the same principle will

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.810 
Honda snowblower the same principle will
apply<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.690> most<00:00:46.079> snowblowers<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.640> only

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
apply to most snowblowers the only

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.010 
apply to most snowblowers the only
difference<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.420> I'm<00:00:48.629> going<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> show<00:00:48.989> you

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
difference that is I'm going to show you

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.750 
difference that is I'm going to show you
exactly<00:00:49.410> how<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
exactly how to do it on this on the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.520 
exactly how to do it on this on the
snowblower<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.960> there's<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.230> lot<00:00:52.410> of

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
snowblower because there's a lot of

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.340 
snowblower because there's a lot of
stuff<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.890> remove<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.309> do<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:55.110> what<00:00:55.260> I'm

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
stuff to remove to do this so what I'm

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.750 
stuff to remove to do this so what I'm
going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> start<00:00:55.649> by<00:00:55.890> doing<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.280> removing<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
going to start by doing is removing the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.080 
going to start by doing is removing the
two<00:00:57.030> screws<00:00:57.059> over<00:00:57.539> here<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.820> there<00:00:59.820> are<00:00:59.910> the

to<00:01:50.180> remove<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.630> 12<00:01:50.899> millimeter<00:01:51.350> bolt<00:01:51.710> here

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
to remove the 12 millimeter bolt here

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:01.029 
to remove the 12 millimeter bolt here
that<00:01:52.159> holds<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.490> headlight<00:01:53.000> bracket<00:01:59.679> and<00:02:00.679> you

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
that holds the headlight bracket and you

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.469 
that holds the headlight bracket and you
can<00:02:01.220> leave<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.520> bracket<00:02:01.939> on<00:02:02.030> here<00:02:02.299> because

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
can leave the bracket on here because

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.590 
can leave the bracket on here because
it's<00:02:02.780> in<00:02:02.960> there<00:02:03.140> with<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.409> rubber<00:02:03.619> grommet

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
it's in there with the rubber grommet

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.880 
it's in there with the rubber grommet
and<00:02:05.600> now<00:02:05.840> you<00:02:05.899> can<00:02:06.200> lift<00:02:06.350> up<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.590> whole

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
and now you can lift up the whole

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.710 
and now you can lift up the whole
plastic<00:02:07.399> cover<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:07.909> just<00:02:08.030> be<00:02:08.209> careful<00:02:08.390> when

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
plastic cover and just be careful when

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.029 
plastic cover and just be careful when
you<00:02:08.810> do<00:02:08.959> this<00:02:08.989> because<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.649> don't<00:02:09.830> want<00:02:09.979> to

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
you do this because you don't want to

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:18.780 
you do this because you don't want to
break<00:02:10.190> any<00:02:10.519> part<00:02:10.819> of<00:02:10.910> it

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.370 

and<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.030> auger<00:02:20.330> idler<00:02:20.690> pulley<00:02:20.930> I'm<00:02:21.019> talking

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
and the auger idler pulley I'm talking

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.680 
and the auger idler pulley I'm talking
about<00:02:21.410> is<00:02:21.739> this<00:02:21.920> pulley<00:02:22.250> right<00:02:22.610> here<00:02:23.060> if

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
about is this pulley right here if

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.600 
about is this pulley right here if
you're<00:02:24.260> not<00:02:24.380> sure<00:02:24.590> which<00:02:24.799> one<00:02:24.860> is<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.430> auger

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
you're not sure which one is the auger

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.059 
you're not sure which one is the auger
belt<00:02:25.910> what<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:26.930> can<00:02:27.110> do<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.500> push<00:02:27.739> down<00:02:27.769> the

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
belt what you can do is push down the

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.370 
belt what you can do is push down the
auger<00:02:28.430> lever<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.660> can<00:02:29.810> see<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.110> parts

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
auger lever and you can see the parts

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.140 
auger lever and you can see the parts
moving<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.130> you'll<00:02:31.310> know<00:02:31.459> you're<00:02:31.610> working<00:02:31.970> on

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
moving so you'll know you're working on

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.240 
moving so you'll know you're working on
the<00:02:32.299> right<00:02:32.420> pulley<00:02:32.750> now<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:33.769> I<00:02:33.830> can<00:02:34.010> show<00:02:34.190> you

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
the right pulley now so I can show you

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.039 
the right pulley now so I can show you
better<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:34.760> make<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:34.910> easier<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.480> adjust<00:02:35.900> that

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
better and make it easier to adjust that

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.080 
better and make it easier to adjust that
pulley<00:02:36.380> I'm<00:02:36.709> gonna<00:02:37.010> remove<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.519> two<00:02:37.760> 10

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
pulley I'm gonna remove the two 10

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.300 
pulley I'm gonna remove the two 10
millimeter<00:02:38.120> bolts<00:02:39.019> here<00:02:39.320> that<00:02:39.859> hold<00:02:40.160> this

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
millimeter bolts here that hold this

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.830 
millimeter bolts here that hold this
bracket<00:02:40.880> it's<00:02:41.120> going<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.329> come<00:02:41.480> out<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.630> the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
bracket it's going to come out of the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.349 
bracket it's going to come out of the
way<00:02:41.989> then<00:02:42.739> we<00:02:42.890> can<00:02:43.040> access<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.579> idler<00:02:44.030> pulley

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
way then we can access that idler pulley

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.110 
way then we can access that idler pulley
much<00:02:44.780> easier<00:02:45.430> it's<00:02:46.430> gonna<00:02:46.549> grab<00:02:46.790> my<00:02:46.940> ratchet

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
much easier it's gonna grab my ratchet

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:59.800 
much easier it's gonna grab my ratchet
with<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.510> 10<00:02:47.810> millimeter<00:02:48.079> socket<00:02:58.630> I'm<00:02:59.630> gonna

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
with a 10 millimeter socket I'm gonna

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.569 
with a 10 millimeter socket I'm gonna
grab<00:03:00.049> the<00:03:00.230> bracket<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:00.769> just<00:03:01.010> move<00:03:01.160> it<00:03:01.310> out<00:03:01.430> of

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
grab the bracket and just move it out of

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.610 
grab the bracket and just move it out of
the<00:03:01.670> way<00:03:01.819> there's<00:03:02.540> stuff<00:03:02.870> attached<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.590> so

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
the way there's stuff attached to it so

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.289 
the way there's stuff attached to it so
don't<00:03:03.980> pull<00:03:04.160> too<00:03:04.190> hard<00:03:04.579> we<00:03:04.760> just<00:03:04.790> want<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.180> get

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
don't pull too hard we just want to get

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.210 
don't pull too hard we just want to get
it<00:03:05.420> out<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:05.750> we<00:03:05.870> can<00:03:05.900> access<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.739> pulley<00:03:06.980> much

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
it out so we can access the pulley much

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.599 
it out so we can access the pulley much
easier<00:03:08.019> so<00:03:09.019> basically<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.709> major<00:03:09.859> problem<00:03:10.459> is

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
easier so basically the major problem is

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.180 
easier so basically the major problem is
that<00:03:11.150> when<00:03:11.299> this<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:11.720> engaged<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.739> belt<00:03:12.950> is

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
that when this is engaged the belt is

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.280 
that when this is engaged the belt is
still<00:03:13.430> too<00:03:13.640> loose<00:03:13.819> on<00:03:14.030> this<00:03:14.480> pulley<00:03:14.780> over<00:03:15.079> here

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
still too loose on this pulley over here

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.500 
still too loose on this pulley over here
so<00:03:15.530> like<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:15.829> said<00:03:15.889> when<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.880> blower<00:03:17.090> is<00:03:17.209> under

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
so like I said when the blower is under

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.080 
so like I said when the blower is under
load<00:03:17.690> this<00:03:18.380> belt<00:03:18.709> here<00:03:18.980> will<00:03:19.340> slip<00:03:19.700> off<00:03:19.880> this

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
load this belt here will slip off this

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.190 
load this belt here will slip off this
pulley<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:21.350> augers<00:03:21.739> just<00:03:22.160> can't<00:03:22.370> keep<00:03:22.579> up

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
pulley and the augers just can't keep up

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.870 
pulley and the augers just can't keep up
but<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.350> adjust<00:03:24.470> that<00:03:24.859> pulley<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.340> make<00:03:25.549> it<00:03:25.700> so

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
but to adjust that pulley and make it so

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.250 
but to adjust that pulley and make it so
that<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.150> belt<00:03:26.359> is<00:03:26.510> tighter<00:03:26.810> when<00:03:27.049> it's

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
that the belt is tighter when it's

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.319 
that the belt is tighter when it's
engaged<00:03:27.650> you<00:03:27.980> have<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.280> loosen<00:03:28.519> this<00:03:28.970> 12

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
engaged you have to loosen this 12

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.330 
engaged you have to loosen this 12
millimeter<00:03:29.840> nut<00:03:30.139> right<00:03:30.680> here<00:03:30.709> where<00:03:31.130> my

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
millimeter nut right here where my

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.420 
millimeter nut right here where my
finger<00:03:31.370> is<00:03:32.530> now<00:03:33.530> this<00:03:33.709> is<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:33.920> back<00:03:34.160> of<00:03:34.190> the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
finger is now this is the back of the

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.890 
finger is now this is the back of the
pulley<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:34.940> as<00:03:35.209> you<00:03:35.359> can<00:03:35.510> see<00:03:35.690> where<00:03:35.870> my

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
pulley and as you can see where my

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.199 
pulley and as you can see where my
finger<00:03:36.440> is<00:03:36.470> there's<00:03:37.370> like<00:03:37.579> a<00:03:37.609> groove<00:03:37.940> here

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
finger is there's like a groove here

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.180 
finger is there's like a groove here
that<00:03:38.389> you<00:03:38.480> can<00:03:38.630> slide<00:03:38.870> this<00:03:39.139> whole<00:03:39.350> bolt<00:03:39.709> this

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
that you can slide this whole bolt this

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.969 
that you can slide this whole bolt this
has<00:03:40.430> probably<00:03:40.910> never<00:03:41.150> been<00:03:41.449> adjusted<00:03:42.109> with<00:03:42.829> it

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:42.979 
has probably never been adjusted with it

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.009 
has probably never been adjusted with it
adjusted<00:03:43.459> in<00:03:43.549> this<00:03:43.669> position<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.660> pulley<00:03:44.900> is

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
adjusted in this position the pulley is

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.780 
adjusted in this position the pulley is
that<00:03:45.260> it's<00:03:45.440> farthest<00:03:45.859> from<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.400> bail

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
that it's farthest from the bail

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.179 
that it's farthest from the bail
when<00:03:46.939> you<00:03:47.060> engage<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.750> auger<00:03:47.959> system<00:03:48.189> it's

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:49.189 
when you engage the auger system it's

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:50.679 
when you engage the auger system it's
still<00:03:49.370> going<00:03:49.549> to<00:03:49.580> tighten<00:03:49.879> up<00:03:49.939> the<00:03:50.120> belt<00:03:50.269> but

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:50.689 
still going to tighten up the belt but

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.270 
still going to tighten up the belt but
not<00:03:50.900> as<00:03:51.049> tight<00:03:51.230> as<00:03:51.379> it<00:03:51.560> should<00:03:51.590> especially

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
not as tight as it should especially

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.740 
not as tight as it should especially
over<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.430> years<00:03:52.760> when<00:03:53.000> your<00:03:53.120> belt<00:03:53.299> gets<00:03:53.540> worn

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
over the years when your belt gets worn

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.350 
over the years when your belt gets worn
out<00:03:53.900> a<00:03:53.930> bit<00:03:54.430> so<00:03:55.430> as<00:03:55.549> you<00:03:55.640> can<00:03:55.760> see<00:03:55.819> we<00:03:56.120> still

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
out a bit so as you can see we still

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.420 
out a bit so as you can see we still
have<00:03:56.420> quite<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:56.900> bit<00:03:57.140> of<00:03:57.230> play<00:03:57.439> here<00:03:57.739> to<00:03:58.099> adjust

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
have quite a bit of play here to adjust

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.339 
have quite a bit of play here to adjust
that<00:03:58.549> pulley<00:03:58.879> so<00:03:59.659> I'm<00:03:59.750> going<00:03:59.900> to<00:03:59.959> loosen<00:04:00.110> the

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
that pulley so I'm going to loosen the

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.500 
that pulley so I'm going to loosen the
front<00:04:00.560> nut<00:04:00.829> on<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.250> pulley<00:04:01.489> then<00:04:02.180> I'm<00:04:02.329> going

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
front nut on the pulley then I'm going

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.880 
front nut on the pulley then I'm going
to<00:04:02.569> slide<00:04:02.840> it<00:04:03.019> forward

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
to slide it forward

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.190 
to slide it forward
toward<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.670> engine<00:04:04.819> and<00:04:05.239> then<00:04:05.930> when<00:04:06.079> the

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
toward the engine and then when the

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.140 
toward the engine and then when the
auger<00:04:06.349> is<00:04:06.560> engaged<00:04:06.980> that<00:04:07.430> belt<00:04:07.670> will<00:04:07.730> be<00:04:07.970> much

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
auger is engaged that belt will be much

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.420 
auger is engaged that belt will be much
tighter<00:04:08.560> okay<00:04:09.560> so<00:04:09.620> when<00:04:09.860> I'm<00:04:09.920> going<00:04:10.129> to<00:04:10.159> go<00:04:10.340> in

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
tighter okay so when I'm going to go in

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.759 
tighter okay so when I'm going to go in
with<00:04:10.670> a<00:04:10.700> quarter<00:04:11.150> inch<00:04:11.329> ratchet<00:04:11.720> and<00:04:12.290> a<00:04:12.470> twelve

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
with a quarter inch ratchet and a twelve

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.759 
with a quarter inch ratchet and a twelve
millimeter<00:04:13.040> socket<00:04:14.109> now<00:04:15.109> you<00:04:15.170> don't<00:04:15.440> need<00:04:15.560> to

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
millimeter socket now you don't need to

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.370 
millimeter socket now you don't need to
hold<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.459> back<00:04:16.669> side<00:04:17.000> of<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.449> bolt<00:04:17.690> because

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
hold the back side of the bolt because

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.979 
hold the back side of the bolt because
it's<00:04:18.709> kind<00:04:18.919> of<00:04:19.010> locked<00:04:19.250> in<00:04:19.519> there<00:04:19.760> so<00:04:20.750> all<00:04:20.780> you

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
it's kind of locked in there so all you

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.840 
it's kind of locked in there so all you
have<00:04:21.109> to<00:04:21.139> do<00:04:21.410> is<00:04:21.560> loosen<00:04:21.799> it<00:04:22.160> you<00:04:22.190> do<00:04:22.460> not<00:04:22.610> have

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
have to do is loosen it you do not have

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.230 
have to do is loosen it you do not have
to<00:04:23.000> take<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.330> nut<00:04:23.510> right<00:04:23.750> off<00:04:24.850> you<00:04:25.850> just<00:04:26.000> want

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
to take the nut right off you just want

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.640 
to take the nut right off you just want
to<00:04:26.360> loosen<00:04:26.510> the<00:04:26.720> nut<00:04:26.900> enough<00:04:27.169> so<00:04:27.380> you<00:04:27.470> can

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
to loosen the nut enough so you can

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.740 
to loosen the nut enough so you can
slide<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:28.070> pulley<00:04:28.310> forward<00:04:28.880> in<00:04:29.090> that<00:04:29.330> group<00:04:29.600> I

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
slide the pulley forward in that group I

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.189 
slide the pulley forward in that group I
showed<00:04:29.990> you<00:04:30.199> in<00:04:30.289> the<00:04:30.350> back<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:31.990> now<00:04:32.990> as<00:04:33.169> you

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
showed you in the back and now as you

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.260 
showed you in the back and now as you
can<00:04:33.470> see<00:04:33.710> I<00:04:33.740> can<00:04:33.949> move<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:34.250> pulley<00:04:34.550> forward

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
can see I can move the pulley forward

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.950 
can see I can move the pulley forward
very<00:04:35.750> easily<00:04:36.139> once<00:04:36.710> that<00:04:36.919> nut<00:04:37.130> is<00:04:37.310> loose<00:04:37.960> so

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
very easily once that nut is loose so

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.990 
very easily once that nut is loose so
the<00:04:39.139> pulley<00:04:39.350> was<00:04:39.560> right<00:04:39.800> here<00:04:40.130> I'm<00:04:40.490> gonna<00:04:40.699> put

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
the pulley was right here I'm gonna put

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.460 
the pulley was right here I'm gonna put
it<00:04:41.090> about<00:04:41.380> halfway<00:04:42.380> up<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:44.050> then<00:04:45.050> tighten<00:04:45.289> up

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
it about halfway up and then tighten up

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.400 
it about halfway up and then tighten up
the<00:04:45.620> nut<00:04:46.389> now<00:04:47.389> reach<00:04:47.630> down<00:04:47.900> with<00:04:47.930> your<00:04:48.229> toe

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
the nut now reach down with your toe

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.070 
the nut now reach down with your toe
millimeter<00:04:48.889> socket<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:49.639> your<00:04:49.820> ratchet<00:04:50.080> make

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
sure you hold the pulley where you set

00:04:52.669 --> 00:05:02.730 
sure you hold the pulley where you set
it<00:04:52.820> earlier<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:54.130> now<00:04:55.130> tighten<00:04:55.490> up<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:55.699> nut

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.050 

now<00:05:03.740> that<00:05:03.949> you're<00:05:04.160> done<00:05:04.340> adjusting<00:05:04.520> that

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
now that you're done adjusting that

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.029 
now that you're done adjusting that
pullian<00:05:05.539> and<00:05:05.690> that<00:05:05.810> is<00:05:05.930> tightened<00:05:06.320> up<00:05:06.380> put<00:05:06.889> the

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
pullian and that is tightened up put the

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.939 
pullian and that is tightened up put the
bracket<00:05:07.580> back<00:05:07.729> up<00:05:08.060> where<00:05:08.270> it<00:05:08.330> should<00:05:08.360> be<00:05:08.949> line

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
bracket back up where it should be line

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.219 
bracket back up where it should be line
it<00:05:10.130> up<00:05:10.220> with<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:10.550> holes<00:05:10.789> put<00:05:11.599> the<00:05:11.720> two<00:05:11.870> bolts

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
it up with the holes put the two bolts

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:28.610 
it up with the holes put the two bolts
back<00:05:12.410> on<00:05:17.740> and<00:05:19.780> now<00:05:20.780> tighten<00:05:21.110> up<00:05:21.169> the<00:05:21.349> two<00:05:21.500> bolts

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.990 

and<00:05:29.620> now<00:05:29.800> when<00:05:29.950> you<00:05:29.980> press<00:05:30.250> down<00:05:30.430> on<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.730> auger

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
and now when you press down on the auger

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.820 
and now when you press down on the auger
lever<00:05:31.240> you're<00:05:31.930> going<00:05:32.110> to<00:05:32.200> see<00:05:32.350> that<00:05:32.500> the<00:05:32.620> belt

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
lever you're going to see that the belt

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.670 
lever you're going to see that the belt
is<00:05:33.040> much<00:05:33.370> tighter<00:05:33.820> around<00:05:34.030> the<00:05:34.300> pulley<00:05:34.540> as<00:05:34.900> you

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
is much tighter around the pulley as you

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.500 
is much tighter around the pulley as you
can<00:05:35.830> see<00:05:36.040> there<00:05:36.250> it's<00:05:36.370> not<00:05:36.640> going<00:05:36.970> to<00:05:37.060> slip<00:05:37.360> off

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
can see there it's not going to slip off

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.600 
can see there it's not going to slip off
the<00:05:37.870> pulley<00:05:40.920> previously<00:05:41.920> what<00:05:42.070> was<00:05:42.220> going<00:05:42.490> on

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
the pulley previously what was going on

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.060 
the pulley previously what was going on
is<00:05:42.940> because<00:05:43.300> the<00:05:43.420> idler<00:05:43.750> pulley<00:05:43.860> wasn't<00:05:44.860> going

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
is because the idler pulley wasn't going

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.370 
is because the idler pulley wasn't going
in<00:05:45.370> enough<00:05:45.670> that<00:05:45.910> way<00:05:46.120> the<00:05:46.750> belt<00:05:46.930> was<00:05:47.140> still

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
in enough that way the belt was still

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.410 
in enough that way the belt was still
loose<00:05:47.590> on<00:05:47.830> the<00:05:47.950> pulley<00:05:48.190> so<00:05:49.090> it's<00:05:49.210> pretty

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420 
loose on the pulley so it's pretty

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.420 
loose on the pulley so it's pretty
simple<00:05:49.840> all<00:05:50.050> you<00:05:50.350> have<00:05:50.380> to<00:05:50.620> do<00:05:50.710> sometimes<00:05:50.980> is

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
simple all you have to do sometimes is

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.900 
simple all you have to do sometimes is
just<00:05:51.460> adjust<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.270> idler<00:05:52.630> pulley<00:05:53.730> if<00:05:54.730> you

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
just adjust the idler pulley if you
