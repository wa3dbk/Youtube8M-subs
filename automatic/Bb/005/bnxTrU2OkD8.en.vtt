00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
inside the burn chamber you're gonna see

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.520 
inside the burn chamber you're gonna see
a<00:00:52.340> removable<00:00:52.760> tray<00:00:52.910> that's<00:00:53.210> laser-cut<00:00:53.809> the

holes are gonna allow air to go to the

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:57.729 
holes are gonna allow air to go to the
fuel<00:00:56.420> which<00:00:56.750> is<00:00:56.780> it<00:00:56.960> going<00:00:57.079> to<00:00:57.170> allow<00:00:57.379> for<00:00:57.410> a

fuel which is it going to allow for a
nice<00:00:57.949> clean<00:00:58.160> burn<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:01.760> top<00:01:01.940> laps<00:01:02.269> secures

nice clean burn the top laps secures
three<00:01:03.140> laser-cut<00:01:03.980> pot<00:01:04.220> supports<00:01:04.670> which<00:01:05.570> are

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
three laser-cut pot supports which are

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.830 
three laser-cut pot supports which are
neatly<00:01:05.930> secured<00:01:06.440> inside<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:06.950> chimney

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.319 

on<00:01:13.929> the<00:01:14.530> outside<00:01:14.920> is<00:01:15.219> a<00:01:15.250> support<00:01:15.670> brace<00:01:15.880> this

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
on the outside is a support brace this

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.149 
on the outside is a support brace this
also<00:01:16.570> doubles<00:01:16.899> as<00:01:17.140> a<00:01:17.229> carry<00:01:17.439> handle<00:01:17.560> to<00:01:18.009> make

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
also doubles as a carry handle to make

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.980 
also doubles as a carry handle to make
life<00:01:18.369> a<00:01:18.520> little<00:01:18.729> bit<00:01:18.909> easier<00:01:21.659> starting<00:01:22.659> up<00:01:22.899> the

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
life a little bit easier starting up the

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.020 
life a little bit easier starting up the
stove<00:01:23.200> is<00:01:23.319> pretty<00:01:23.560> easy<00:01:23.770> with<00:01:24.399> the<00:01:24.520> handful<00:01:24.880> of

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
stove is pretty easy with the handful of

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.969 
stove is pretty easy with the handful of
feather<00:01:25.179> sticks<00:01:25.509> I<00:01:25.719> went<00:01:25.929> ahead<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:26.500> ignited

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
feather sticks I went ahead and ignited

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.840 
feather sticks I went ahead and ignited
them<00:01:27.159> and<00:01:27.399> put<00:01:27.729> them<00:01:27.819> into<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.179> burn<00:01:28.329> chamber

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.039 

after<00:01:33.850> that<00:01:34.000> I<00:01:34.030> took<00:01:34.209> a<00:01:34.360> bundle<00:01:34.750> of<00:01:34.810> sticks

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
after that I took a bundle of sticks

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.679 
after that I took a bundle of sticks
that<00:01:35.469> were<00:01:35.619> small<00:01:35.979> and<00:01:36.240> put<00:01:37.240> them<00:01:37.420> through<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
that were small and put them through the

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.270 
that were small and put them through the
chimney<00:01:37.840> now<00:01:38.530> this<00:01:38.709> isn't<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.039> way<00:01:39.250> you

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
chimney now this isn't the way you

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.910 
chimney now this isn't the way you
normally<00:01:39.579> load<00:01:40.270> fuel<00:01:40.869> but<00:01:41.200> it's<00:01:41.409> a<00:01:41.530> good<00:01:41.709> way

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
normally load fuel but it's a good way

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.919 
normally load fuel but it's a good way
to<00:01:41.950> heat<00:01:42.340> up<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.939> chamber<00:01:43.209> really<00:01:43.509> easily

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
to heat up the chamber really easily

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:45.330 
to heat up the chamber really easily
without<00:01:44.140> smothering<00:01:44.740> your<00:01:44.890> feather<00:01:45.069> sticks

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
without smothering your feather sticks

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.130 
without smothering your feather sticks
heating<00:01:46.090> up<00:01:46.179> the<00:01:46.299> burn<00:01:46.479> chamber<00:01:46.720> is<00:01:46.929> pretty

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
heating up the burn chamber is pretty

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.109 
heating up the burn chamber is pretty
easy<00:01:47.349> and<00:01:47.619> because<00:01:48.159> of<00:01:48.189> the<00:01:48.459> burn<00:01:48.640> chambers

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
easy and because of the burn chambers

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.630 
easy and because of the burn chambers
rather<00:01:49.569> small<00:01:49.989> size<00:01:50.289> it's<00:01:50.950> really<00:01:51.280> easy<00:01:51.489> to

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
rather small size it's really easy to

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.209 
rather small size it's really easy to

likely sticks on fire once the sticks
started<00:01:54.489> to<00:01:54.579> burn<00:01:54.729> down<00:01:54.939> I<00:01:55.239> had<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.479> good<00:01:55.719> bed<00:01:55.959> of

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.260 
started to burn down I had a good bed of
coals<00:01:56.289> on<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.619> inside<00:01:56.979> so<00:01:57.729> I<00:01:57.789> went<00:01:58.030> ahead<00:01:58.090> and

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
coals on the inside so I went ahead and

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:11.230 
coals on the inside so I went ahead and
put<00:01:58.539> on<00:01:58.659> the<00:01:58.689> pot<00:01:58.989> sports

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.600 

the<00:02:11.780> fuel<00:02:11.990> port<00:02:12.260> is<00:02:12.380> a<00:02:12.410> nice<00:02:12.680> diameter<00:02:13.220> which

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
the fuel port is a nice diameter which

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.490 
the fuel port is a nice diameter which
allows<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.120> use<00:02:14.390> larger<00:02:14.810> pieces<00:02:15.020> of<00:02:15.260> fuel

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
allows you to use larger pieces of fuel

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.320 
allows you to use larger pieces of fuel
which<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.040> nice<00:02:16.430> because<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:17.000> means<00:02:17.120> you

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
which is nice because that means you

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.940 
which is nice because that means you
don't<00:02:17.420> have<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.810> process<00:02:18.080> wood<00:02:18.590> down<00:02:18.800> to

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
don't have to process wood down to

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.640 
don't have to process wood down to
smaller<00:02:19.220> sizes<00:02:19.520> like<00:02:20.150> another<00:02:20.510> wood<00:02:20.720> stoves

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.190 
a special room is because as you can see
here<00:03:12.890> that<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.160> do<00:03:13.220> in<00:03:13.460> this<00:03:13.550> demo<00:03:13.880> even<00:03:14.720> with

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
here that I do in this demo even with

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.200 
here that I do in this demo even with
the<00:03:15.350> wet<00:03:15.560> match<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:16.370> things<00:03:16.640> light<00:03:16.880> on<00:03:17.000> fire

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
the wet match the things light on fire

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.720 
the wet match the things light on fire
but<00:03:18.170> I<00:03:18.290> don't<00:03:18.440> want<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.620> be<00:03:18.710> that<00:03:18.890> once<00:03:19.580> you

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
but I don't want to be that once you

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.820 
but I don't want to be that once you
dunk<00:03:19.970> them<00:03:20.090> into<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:20.420> water<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:21.320> they<00:03:21.470> still

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
dunk them into the water and they still

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.250 
dunk them into the water and they still
stay<00:03:22.100> ignited<00:03:22.610> so<00:03:23.060> it's<00:03:23.510> pretty<00:03:23.780> important

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
stay ignited so it's pretty important

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.600 
stay ignited so it's pretty important
that<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.410> keep<00:03:24.590> these<00:03:24.800> things<00:03:24.860> safe<00:03:25.340> and

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
that you keep these things safe and

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.420
