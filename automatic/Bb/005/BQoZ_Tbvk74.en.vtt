00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
I've ever made that made that ride how

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.090 
I've ever made that made that ride how
will<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.410> change<00:00:47.180> Kevin<00:00:48.210> knowing<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
will you change Kevin knowing that the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.279 
will you change Kevin knowing that the
the<00:00:50.489> playoffs<00:00:50.879> are<00:00:51.149> here<00:00:51.420> will<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.960> change

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
the playoffs are here will you change

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.020 
the playoffs are here will you change
what's<00:00:52.559> your<00:00:52.680> approach<00:00:52.829> well<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> don't<00:00:54.000> think

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
what's your approach well I don't think

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.639 
what's your approach well I don't think
it<00:00:54.239> can<00:00:54.329> really<00:00:54.390> change<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.989> think<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.469> to

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
it can really change I think you have to

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.250 
it can really change I think you have to
approach<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:57.199> for<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
approach it just as you have for the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.689 
approach it just as you have for the
rest<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> year<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.160> how<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.340> prepare

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
rest of the year and and how you prepare

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.040 
rest of the year and and how you prepare
the<00:00:59.820> car<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.120> how<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.270> prepare<00:01:00.570> yourself<00:01:00.660> I

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the car and how you prepare yourself I

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.599 
the car and how you prepare yourself I
think<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.320> one<00:01:01.469> thing<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.800> does<00:01:01.980> change<00:01:02.340> is

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
think the one thing that does change is

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.630 
think the one thing that does change is
you<00:01:03.239> can't<00:01:03.510> just<00:01:03.750> go<00:01:04.290> for<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> win<00:01:04.830> every<00:01:05.430> time

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
you can't just go for a win every time

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.060 
you can't just go for a win every time
something<00:01:06.090> happens<00:01:06.140> you<00:01:07.140> know<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.380> if<00:01:07.920> you're

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
something happens you know if if you're

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.469 
something happens you know if if you're
in<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.220> situation<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:08.939> were<00:01:09.060> at<00:01:09.180> Atlanta

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
in a situation like we were at Atlanta

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.060 
in a situation like we were at Atlanta
you're<00:01:09.600> gonna<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.049> let<00:01:10.320> out<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> gas<00:01:10.770> let

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
you're gonna have to let out the gas let

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.950 
you're gonna have to let out the gas let
things<00:01:11.250> situate<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.970> take<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.630> fifth<00:01:12.840> or

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
things situate and take that fifth or

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.570 
things situate and take that fifth or
sixth<00:01:13.200> place<00:01:13.380> finish<00:01:13.409> because<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.100> know<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
sixth place finish because you know the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
sixth place finish because you know the
consequences<00:01:15.299> are<00:01:15.869> there<00:01:16.140> at<00:01:16.350> this

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
consequences are there at this

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.679 
consequences are there at this
particular<00:01:16.950> point<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.580> maybe<00:01:18.180> not<00:01:18.390> winning<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
particular point of maybe not winning a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.999 
particular point of maybe not winning a
championship<00:01:18.900> something<00:01:19.710> that's

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
championship something that's

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.890 
championship something that's
interesting<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:21.060> hasn't<00:01:21.450> been<00:01:21.540> done<00:01:21.689> since

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
interesting it hasn't been done since

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.249 
interesting it hasn't been done since

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
sponsorship you even have sponsor

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.680 
sponsorship you even have sponsor
stickers<00:02:18.640> under<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.150> hood<00:02:19.300> which<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.540> tell

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
stickers under the hood which you tell

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:20.760 
stickers under the hood which you tell
me<00:02:19.780> are<00:02:19.870> different<00:02:20.200> from<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.380> ones<00:02:20.530> on<00:02:20.680> the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
me are different from the ones on the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.800 
me are different from the ones on the
regular<00:02:21.130> car<00:02:21.370> yeah<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:21.940> these<00:02:22.120> stickers<00:02:22.450> have

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
regular car yeah so these stickers have

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.449 
regular car yeah so these stickers have
to<00:02:22.959> be<00:02:23.080> heat-resistant<00:02:23.890> so<00:02:24.130> these<00:02:24.250> are

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
to be heat-resistant so these are

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.430 
to be heat-resistant so these are
probably<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:24.940> most<00:02:25.090> expensive<00:02:25.810> stickers<00:02:26.290> on

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
probably the most expensive stickers on

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.990 
probably the most expensive stickers on
the<00:02:26.530> car<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:27.040> they<00:02:27.160> don't<00:02:27.280> fall<00:02:27.550> off<00:02:27.760> when

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.580 
season of Derek Jeter's career will end
how<00:03:41.709> I<00:03:42.090> would<00:03:43.090> say<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:43.540> last<00:03:43.750> season<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.320> his

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
how I would say the last season of his

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.300 
how I would say the last season of his
career<00:03:45.070> would<00:03:45.370> probably<00:03:46.209> end<00:03:46.829> in<00:03:47.829> the<00:03:48.160> last

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
career would probably end in the last

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.530 
career would probably end in the last
game<00:03:48.640> that<00:03:48.670> they<00:03:48.880> play<00:03:49.060> of<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.239> regular

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.150 
game that they play of the regular
season<00:03:49.840> I<00:03:49.930> think<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:50.920> know<00:03:51.010> they're

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
season I think that you know they're

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.830

just<00:03:51.190> gonna<00:03:51.370> run<00:03:51.610> out<00:03:51.730> of<00:03:51.790> time<00:03:52.030> as<00:03:52.299> they<00:03:52.690> get

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
just gonna run out of time as they get

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.150 
just gonna run out of time as they get
towards<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.140> end<00:03:53.200> of<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.410> season<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:53.799> I<00:03:53.920> hate

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
towards the end of the season and I hate
