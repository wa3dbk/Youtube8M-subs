it<00:01:37.650> but<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.829> hadn't<00:01:38.100> really<00:01:38.280> put<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.640> too<00:01:38.850> much

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
it but I hadn't really put in too much

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.719 
it but I hadn't really put in too much
time<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.689> figure<00:01:39.869> out<00:01:40.020> how<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> beat<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:41.490> I'm
