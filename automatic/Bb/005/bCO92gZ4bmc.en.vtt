00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.980
 so good evening 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.080
 it's a real pleasure to have you here 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.960
 good evening good evening we wanted to know that 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.940
 konate scammed a story to commit 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.600
 kings a story out of the wes and that's 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.630
 it's a story 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.699
 it's like ceasing in fact that and 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.019
 one day it came like that we said to ourselves 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.830
 why not the kings of coconuts 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.420
 in France m 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.000
 but well yeah it fell it fell 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.480
 like that and you are known how 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.250
 does how the group was formed then 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.780
 step by step we actually got a little 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.230
 all met we are all a bit of 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.390
 same blade and then once a person 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.640
 decided to do something so we 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.930
 we found ourselves a little like that and we 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.090
 founded this group 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.860
 today we are quite happy with this 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.460
 that it can give then you say the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.500
 even bled 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.910
 so we have no more account and if we 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.770
 speak around we're all a little bit of 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.760
 was actually the style of music that 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.190
 you do is it really is 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.589
 specific where there is a mix of styles 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.180
 which is done then there are a lot of 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.420
 mix a little bit everything but it's true that 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.780
 we say we do a little smoking blues 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.820
 a little rock'n'roll that debunks 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.960
 rythm'n'blues we are not bad in this 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:23.100
 sauce there and we were spun a lot at this 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.119
 rockabilly band or whatever but we 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.369
 can not give some grow 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.400
 really give a label here 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.500
 exactly we are we are not bad we are 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.450
 all from very different backgrounds and 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.850
 we made a nice team people of all that 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.070
 and it gives something downright 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.960
 cool and do you compose your 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.090
 music you write it you wrote them the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.110
 texts that are occupied by engineers whose 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.420
 well it's a bit all together but 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.700
 it is true that the subject we approach the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.190
 music and lyrics that would rather 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.810
 mega voice I am a guitarist 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.840
 in fact the band started playing in 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.140
 duo as he said we are all a little 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.720
 mates for a long time and then it was 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.190
 grafted on the turn but we bring 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.860
 ideas of things then after we do all 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.480
 in common what so the guitarist and 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.580
 the interpreter actually you meet 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.140
 to write music is his voice 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.870
 only what do I mean we have stuff 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.770
 we see each other we see together or not 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.830
 have to read things that happen they 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.820
 are already well torch home times 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.430
 we just have an idea that we spend together 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.390
 then it's okay like that okay and 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.570
 the tags what are you talking about 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.760
 usually it's either things 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.660
 quite innocuous these boats it speaks of 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.120
 girls often it's talking about disappointment 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.660
 that's the end of love songs 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.580
 between sad often sad and 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.340
 otherwise sometimes it's a little bit more 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.950
 a little more absurd to inspire you with your 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.180
 own life at all or you are looking for 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.549
 rather outside 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.769
 yeah yeah yeah when someone has a 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.799
 idea when someone that kankan's 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.350
 texts when he felt inspired 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.700
 after I do not normally have to say 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.510
 it is often after an ordeal that 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.950
 is inspired thank you very much and then I 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.819
 wish you a wonderful concert on 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.120
 can not wait to discover on stage 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.120
