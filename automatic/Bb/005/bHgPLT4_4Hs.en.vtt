interestingly<00:00:58.969> you<00:00:59.270> can<00:00:59.390> put<00:00:59.539> 100%<00:01:00.020> of<00:01:00.379> the

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
interestingly you can put 100% of the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.979 
interestingly you can put 100% of the
power<00:01:00.680> down<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:01.699> one<00:01:01.940> wheel<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:02.540> that<00:01:02.660> makes<00:01:02.870> it

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
power down to one wheel so that makes it

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.689 
power down to one wheel so that makes it
pretty<00:01:03.079> much<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:03.440> perfect<00:01:03.620> don't<00:01:04.010> think

the Ferrari f40 looks very nice
it's<00:01:19.220> a<00:01:19.280> little<00:01:19.490> bit<00:01:19.610> toned<00:01:19.909> down<00:01:20.060> from<00:01:20.540> the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
it's a little bit toned down from the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.330 
it's a little bit toned down from the
previous<00:01:20.990> generation<00:01:21.020> which<00:01:21.950> i<00:01:22.070> think<00:01:22.130> is

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
previous generation which i think is

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.460 
previous generation which i think is
probably<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.670> very<00:01:22.820> good<00:01:22.909> thing<00:01:23.090> it's<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.659> little

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
probably a very good thing it's a little

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.130 
probably a very good thing it's a little
more<00:01:24.740> every<00:01:24.979> day<00:01:25.159> but<00:01:25.399> still<00:01:26.140> spectacularly

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
more every day but still spectacularly

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.560 
more every day but still spectacularly
good<00:01:27.500> we<00:01:28.340> haven't<00:01:28.580> had<00:01:28.670> any<00:01:28.790> official<00:01:29.090> word<00:01:29.420> on

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
good we haven't had any official word on

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.600 
good we haven't had any official word on
performance<00:01:30.020> figures<00:01:30.200> but<00:01:30.979> I<00:01:31.009> think<00:01:31.369> you<00:01:31.460> can

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
performance figures but I think you can

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.490 
performance figures but I think you can
probably<00:01:31.729> get<00:01:32.240> around<00:01:32.810> maybe<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.170> four<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:33.440> a

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
probably get around maybe the four and a

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.469 
probably get around maybe the four and a
half<00:01:33.590> second<00:01:34.039> mark<00:01:34.220> to<00:01:34.340> sixty<00:01:34.759> so<00:01:35.119> just<00:01:35.300> to<00:01:35.390> put

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
half second mark to sixty so just to put

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.240 
half second mark to sixty so just to put
that<00:01:35.600> into<00:01:35.840> perspective<00:01:35.990> that's<00:01:36.920> a<00:01:37.039> focus

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
that into perspective that's a focus

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.160 
that into perspective that's a focus
that<00:01:37.520> goes<00:01:37.759> naught<00:01:37.940> to<00:01:38.060> 60<00:01:38.210> quicker<00:01:38.600> than<00:01:38.810> a<00:01:38.899> v8

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
that goes naught to 60 quicker than a v8

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.960 
that goes naught to 60 quicker than a v8
r8<00:01:40.420> it's<00:01:41.420> really<00:01:41.869> good<00:01:42.020> around<00:01:42.200> front<00:01:42.560> though

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
r8 it's really good around front though

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.850 
r8 it's really good around front though
