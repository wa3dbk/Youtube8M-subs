00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
hey guys how you going this is Billy

hey guys how you going this is Billy
Edwards<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.490> today<00:00:05.640> we're<00:00:05.759> gonna<00:00:05.850> take<00:00:06.060> a

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
Edwards and today we're gonna take a

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.700 
Edwards and today we're gonna take a
look<00:00:06.359> at<00:00:06.480> controller<00:00:06.870> button<00:00:07.200> layout<00:00:07.500> and

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
look at controller button layout and

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.560 
look at controller button layout and
which<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:07.980> better<00:00:08.189> for<00:00:08.370> bf4<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.120> advanced

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
which is better for bf4 and advanced

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.810 
which is better for bf4 and advanced
warfare<00:00:10.019> so<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.980> reason<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.400> thought<00:00:11.639> I'd

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
warfare so the reason that I thought I'd

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.400 
warfare so the reason that I thought I'd
make<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.210> quick<00:00:12.450> video<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:13.049> because<00:00:13.290> I've

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
make this quick video is because I've

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.259 
make this quick video is because I've
been<00:00:13.440> playing<00:00:13.799> advanced<00:00:14.340> warfare<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.820> fair<00:00:15.089> bit

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
been playing advanced warfare a fair bit

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.240 
been playing advanced warfare a fair bit
recently<00:00:15.750> after<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.260> long<00:00:16.470> break<00:00:16.710> from<00:00:16.980> Cod

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
recently after a long break from Cod

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.429 
recently after a long break from Cod
altogether<00:00:17.910> when<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.600> booted<00:00:19.020> up<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.260> game<00:00:19.410> for

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
altogether when I booted up the game for

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.439 
altogether when I booted up the game for
the<00:00:19.680> first<00:00:19.830> time<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.340> instinctively<00:00:20.760> changed

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
the first time I instinctively changed

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.880 
the first time I instinctively changed
my<00:00:21.630> button<00:00:21.900> layout<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.320> what<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.500> would<00:00:22.740> call

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
my button layout to what I would call

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.439 
my button layout to what I would call
the<00:00:23.039> battlefield<00:00:23.460> classic<00:00:23.910> layout<00:00:24.240> and

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the battlefield classic layout and

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.420 
the battlefield classic layout and
realized<00:00:25.050> fairly<00:00:25.500> quickly<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.980> probably

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
realized fairly quickly this probably

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.769 
realized fairly quickly this probably
wasn't<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.970> good<00:00:27.000> idea

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
wasn't a good idea

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.779 
wasn't a good idea
the<00:00:28.199> thing<00:00:28.410> about<00:00:28.439> cod<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.340> although<00:00:29.550> it

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the thing about cod is that although it

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.490 
the thing about cod is that although it
has<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> lot<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.300> common<00:00:30.330> with<00:00:30.630> battlefield<00:00:31.080> and

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
has a lot in common with battlefield and

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.229 
has a lot in common with battlefield and
although<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.009> two<00:00:32.160> franchises<00:00:32.430> are<00:00:33.030> slowly

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
although the two franchises are slowly

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.090 
although the two franchises are slowly
starting<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.809> become<00:00:33.989> even<00:00:34.469> more<00:00:34.500> similar

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
starting to become even more similar

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.400 
starting to become even more similar
Call<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.700> Duty<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.239> still<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.690> very<00:00:36.930> different

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
Call of Duty is still a very different

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.319 
Call of Duty is still a very different
game<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.340> lot<00:00:38.520> faster<00:00:38.670> pace<00:00:39.090> than

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
game it's a lot faster pace than

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.090 
game it's a lot faster pace than
battlefield<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.110> probably<00:00:40.500> easier<00:00:40.890> for

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
battlefield and it's probably easier for

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.799 
battlefield and it's probably easier for
aggressive<00:00:41.489> players<00:00:41.730> with<00:00:42.000> quick<00:00:42.210> reflexes

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
aggressive players with quick reflexes

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.510 
aggressive players with quick reflexes
than<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.469> for<00:00:43.649> players<00:00:43.829> who<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.219> think

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
than it is for players who like to think

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.310 
than it is for players who like to think
tactically<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.210> move<00:00:45.420> cautiously<00:00:45.660> around

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
tactically and move cautiously around

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.619 
tactically and move cautiously around
the<00:00:46.440> map<00:00:46.649> now<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.760> quickly<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.149> explain<00:00:48.480> the

the map now just quickly to explain the

difference between what most people

battlefield 4 shifted over to this

default layout too considering how

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.000

popular<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> cod<00:01:11.610> franchise<00:01:12.119> has<00:01:12.390> become

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
popular the cod franchise has become

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.320 
popular the cod franchise has become
previously<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.220> battlefield<00:01:14.729> 3<00:01:14.790> these<00:01:15.150> two

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
previously in battlefield 3 these two

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.670 
previously in battlefield 3 these two
buttons<00:01:15.570> were<00:01:15.780> switched<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> bad

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
buttons were switched and in the bad

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.320 
buttons were switched and in the bad
company<00:01:17.100> games<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.580> was<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.759> little<00:01:18.030> different

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
company games it was a little different

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.999 
company games it was a little different
again<00:01:18.390> but<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.200> general<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> console

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
again but in general the console

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.499 
again but in general the console
versions<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.460> these<00:01:20.640> games<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.090> always<00:01:21.270> had

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
versions of these games have always had

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.179 
versions of these games have always had
crouched<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> thumbstick<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.070> is

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
crouched on the thumbstick so this is

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.499 
crouched on the thumbstick so this is
what<00:01:23.340> most<00:01:23.520> people<00:01:23.880> would<00:01:23.939> consider<00:01:24.060> classic

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
what most people would consider classic

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.080 
what most people would consider classic
battlefield<00:01:25.170> controls<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.400> how<00:01:26.729> much<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.030> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
battlefield controls so how much of a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.490 
battlefield controls so how much of a
difference<00:01:27.390> does<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.600> really<00:01:27.869> make<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.409> it

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
difference does it really make and is it

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.660 
difference does it really make and is it
really<00:01:28.770> something<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.220> should<00:01:29.400> consider

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
really something you should consider

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.999 
really something you should consider
changing<00:01:29.900> well<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.930> think<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.439> layout<00:01:31.770> works

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
