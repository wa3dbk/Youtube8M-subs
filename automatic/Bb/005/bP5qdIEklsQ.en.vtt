00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:04.000 
okay so if I said name the bike you'd

okay so if I said name the bike you'd
say<00:00:04.259> GSXR<00:00:05.259> but<00:00:06.189> which<00:00:06.399> DSX<00:00:06.939> are<00:00:07.180> you'd<00:00:07.569> have<00:00:07.689> a

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:07.720 
say GSXR but which DSX are you'd have a

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
the distinctive GSXR shape and the

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.520 
the distinctive GSXR shape and the
bodywork<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.940> believe<00:01:47.270> it<00:01:47.390> or<00:01:47.479> not<00:01:47.600> exactly

over 7,000 rpm to get anything like
decent<00:02:15.019> performance<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:15.910> reckon<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.030> could

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
decent performance I reckon you could

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.180 
decent performance I reckon you could

all day it may be below 6,000 rpm they

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.270 
all day it may be below 6,000 rpm they
bring<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.320> back<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.650> they<00:02:24.739> wonder<00:02:25.010> what<00:02:25.130> all

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280

the<00:02:25.310> fuss<00:02:25.459> was<00:02:25.640> about<00:02:25.820> because<00:02:26.570> below<00:02:26.870> that

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
the fuss was about because below that

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.300 
the fuss was about because below that
you<00:02:27.230> really<00:02:27.530> don't<00:02:27.650> get<00:02:27.830> any<00:02:27.980> kind<00:02:28.190> of

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
you really don't get any kind of

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.949 
you really don't get any kind of
performance<00:02:28.489> but<00:02:29.420> if<00:02:29.540> you're<00:02:29.660> willing<00:02:29.930> to

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
performance but if you're willing to

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.110 
performance but if you're willing to
push<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.380> revs<00:02:30.560> hard<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:31.100> really<00:02:31.700> does<00:02:31.850> come

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
push the revs hard it really does come

00:02:32.120 --> 00:03:02.200 
push the revs hard it really does come
to<00:02:32.269> life

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.760 

so<00:03:03.210> how<00:03:03.360> does<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.630> compare<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:04.260> other<00:03:04.440> six

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
so how does it compare to other six

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.100 
so how does it compare to other six
hundreds<00:03:05.160> you'd<00:03:06.120> have<00:03:06.270> to<00:03:06.390> say<00:03:06.540> it's<00:03:06.780> not<00:03:06.960> as

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
hundreds you'd have to say it's not as

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.010 
hundreds you'd have to say it's not as

work the engine hard then it's a good

something<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.430> you'll<00:03:23.550> notice<00:03:23.790> when<00:03:24.060> you

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
something that you'll notice when you

the latch and remove the pillion pad and

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.260 
the latch and remove the pillion pad and
you<00:03:54.990> can<00:03:55.110> replace<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.440> with<00:03:55.680> a<00:03:56.370> rear<00:03:56.820> cowl<00:03:57.090> in

there convert it into a single seat and
makes<00:03:59.160> it<00:03:59.280> look<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.430> bit<00:03:59.520> more<00:03:59.670> racetrack<00:04:00.300> II

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
makes it look a bit more racetrack II

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.510 
makes it look a bit more racetrack II
and<00:04:00.990> let's<00:04:01.170> face<00:04:01.320> it<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:01.740> wouldn't<00:04:01.920> want<00:04:02.100> too

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
and let's face it you wouldn't want too
