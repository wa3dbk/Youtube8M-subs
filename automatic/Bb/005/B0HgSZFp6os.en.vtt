mercury<00:00:52.260> vapor<00:00:52.469> bulb<00:00:52.800> they<00:00:53.129> will<00:00:53.340> all<00:00:53.579> fit

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
mercury vapor bulb they will all fit

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.709 
mercury vapor bulb they will all fit
into<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.930> zoo<00:00:55.500> Med<00:00:55.770> deep<00:00:56.550> dome<00:00:56.850> lamp<00:00:57.239> fixture

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
into the zoo Med deep dome lamp fixture

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.360 
into the zoo Med deep dome lamp fixture
so<00:00:57.960> I'll<00:00:58.230> give<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> example<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:59.039> how<00:00:59.190> this

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
so I'll give the example of how this

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.000 
so I'll give the example of how this
works

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
works

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.579 
works
this<00:01:02.010> type<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.309> bulb<00:01:02.789> if<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.989> put<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.290> into<00:01:04.439> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
this type of bulb if you put it into a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.190 
this type of bulb if you put it into a
regular<00:01:04.860> fixture<00:01:05.810> basically<00:01:06.810> what<00:01:07.020> would

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
regular fixture basically what would

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.940 
regular fixture basically what would
happen<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.460> will<00:01:08.610> stick<00:01:09.030> out<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.799> will

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
happen is it will stick out and you will

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.530 
happen is it will stick out and you will
have<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> little<00:01:11.400> bit<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> edge<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
have a little bit of the edge of the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.929 
have a little bit of the edge of the
bulb<00:01:12.750> sticking<00:01:13.290> out<00:01:13.500> from<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> fixture

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
bulb sticking out from the fixture

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.920 
bulb sticking out from the fixture
that's<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.540> regular<00:01:16.080> 10-inch<00:01:16.979> dome<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.930> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
that's a regular 10-inch dome and the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.660 
that's a regular 10-inch dome and the
problem<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.100> can't<00:01:20.400> put

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
problem with that is that you can't put

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.310 
problem with that is that you can't put
it<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.820> top<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.299> screen<00:01:21.509> top<00:01:21.869> or<00:01:22.110> pretty

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
it on top of the screen top or pretty

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.719 
it on top of the screen top or pretty
much<00:01:22.500> anything<00:01:22.799> at<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.369> point<00:01:23.580> you'll<00:01:23.700> have

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
much anything at that point you'll have

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.580 
much anything at that point you'll have
to<00:01:23.970> hang<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.360> what's<00:01:24.869> great<00:01:25.140> about<00:01:25.170> this

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
to hang it what's great about this

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.740 
to hang it what's great about this
fixture<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.250> particularly<00:01:26.909> wonderful<00:01:27.540> about

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
fixture and particularly wonderful about

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.030 
fixture and particularly wonderful about
mercury<00:01:28.200> vapor<00:01:28.439> bulbs<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:30.060> fixture<00:01:31.040> it

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
mercury vapor bulbs is this fixture it

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.080 
mercury vapor bulbs is this fixture it
fits<00:01:32.460> really<00:01:33.150> deep<00:01:33.920> inside<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.610> when<00:01:35.970> you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
fits really deep inside so that when you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.539 
fits really deep inside so that when you
do<00:01:36.329> put<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.020> top<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> screen<00:01:37.950> it's

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
do put it on top of the screen it's

nowhere<00:01:39.030> near<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.750> screen<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.229> fact<00:01:40.470> it's

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
nowhere near the screen in fact it's

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.649 
nowhere near the screen in fact it's
about<00:01:40.829> an<00:01:40.979> inch<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> half<00:01:41.400> up<00:01:41.790> inch<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
half up so that's fantastic because it's

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.179 
half up so that's fantastic because it's
not<00:01:45.060> going<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.329> superheat<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.899> bulb<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.409> it

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
not going to superheat the bulb and it
