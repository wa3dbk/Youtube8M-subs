00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.879
 Now you see the unboxing of the ipad 4 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.330
 Here you can see the packaging of the 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:19.869
 ipad with retina display on the left 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.320
 ipad stands if you recognize it 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.860
 can 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.140
 Below is the apple logo on the right 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:30.310
 page is ipad again and above is 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.040
 again the apple logo is still standing behind 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.550
 the specifications i have the 16gb 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.710
 wifi only variant in white the cheapest 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.540
 version 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.230
 that's enough for me and now we had 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.350
 the whole out of public unpack yet 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.320
 a few small dates the ipad of 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:55.930
 fourth generation has a 9 7 inches 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:01.230
 Retina display of the A66 dual core 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:03.489
 processor so the whole is conceivable 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.040
 you can imagine that 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.100
 that's twice as fast as the ipad 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.610
 is the third generation and that is 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.549
 already huge and yes it has the new one 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.540
 connect the 27th 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:24.340
 facetime camera and yes the a 66 now 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:29.140
 the whole unpacked and there is the good 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:32.890
 piece in foil wrapped down is one 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:42.340
 tab to take off because you lift the ipad 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:46.930
 out it looks like from the back now 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.939
 I'll take the foil off that's always 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.030
 a good feeling as a sheet at 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.320
 an apple device to take that down 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.909
 has somehow really great 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.350
 if you are of the same opinion 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.600
 please write me in the 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.430
 Comments 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.280
 Now it is finally looking forward to the film 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.630
 Now let's look at the rest of 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.690
 in front are the home button and the 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.690
 facetime camera on the side is the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.130
 quietly bet down for quieter up 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.130
 for louder and there is the mute switch 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:25.020
 below you can see the ipad lettering 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.780
 apple logo 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.470
 because you can see the 35 mm jack connection 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.740
 for headphones, a microphone 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.640
 the 5 megapixel isight camera and the 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.260
 sleep and like button 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.340
 then we find the bottom of the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:50.200
 new lightning connection and the 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.530
 ipad speaker really good 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.530
 is 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.260
 yes in the packaging we still find the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:03.020
 usb power adapter for the ipad to 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.480
 of course, then recharge the booklet 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:11.060
 if you open that you will find a few 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.290
 little cards that show the ipad 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.210
 in different languages 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:20.250
 because information and apples ticker 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.580
 is when you pack up for it 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:28.920
 only one left and the usb too 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:32.010
 lead cable to sync and 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.650
 if you connect it to the power supply to 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.020
 charge everything in the scope of delivery 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.790
 everything is still there 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.760
 in the back of the information 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.950
 yes that was it with the unboxing though 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.230
 I like it, I like it 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.690
