frustrated because they spent eighty to
eighty<00:00:33.030> five<00:00:33.090> thousand<00:00:33.600> dollars<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> lot

reputation<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.149> guess<00:00:39.329> that's<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.629> good

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.770 
reputation and I guess that's a good
thing<00:00:40.460> but<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:42.000> really<00:00:42.030> doesn't<00:00:42.540> show<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
thing but it really doesn't show the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.049 
thing but it really doesn't show the
long-term<00:00:43.200> effects<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.670> this

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
long-term effects like is this

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.310 
long-term effects like is this
eventually<00:00:45.329> going<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.629> lead<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.840> more<00:00:46.020> funding

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
eventually going to lead to more funding

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.190 
eventually going to lead to more funding
and<00:00:46.649> if<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.920> how<00:00:47.390> it's<00:00:48.390> not<00:00:48.570> really<00:00:48.780> explained

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
and if so how it's not really explained

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.020 
and if so how it's not really explained
well<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.770> maybe<00:00:49.920> that's<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.340> problem<00:00:50.820> but<00:00:50.969> I

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
well and maybe that's the problem but I

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.209 
well and maybe that's the problem but I
was<00:00:51.210> wondering<00:00:51.660> what<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.379> guys<00:00:52.410> thought<00:00:52.829> on

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
was wondering what you guys thought on

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.459 
was wondering what you guys thought on
this<00:00:53.460> issue<00:00:53.899> well<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.020> interesting<00:00:55.170> because

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
this issue well it's interesting because

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.350 
this issue well it's interesting because
you<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:55.949> people<00:00:56.370> will<00:00:56.640> make<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.940> argument

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
you know people will make the argument

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.849 
you know people will make the argument
that<00:00:57.390> eighty<00:00:57.629> five<00:00:57.840> thousand<00:00:58.379> isn't<00:00:58.649> really

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
that eighty five thousand isn't really

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.709 
that eighty five thousand isn't really
that<00:00:58.890> much<00:00:59.100> money<00:00:59.579> relatively<00:01:00.270> speaking<00:01:00.510> but

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
that much money relatively speaking but

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.750 
that much money relatively speaking but
at<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.109> same<00:01:01.289> time<00:01:01.530> eighty-five<00:01:02.219> thousand

at the same time eighty-five thousand

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.880 
at the same time eighty-five thousand
can<00:01:03.000> pay<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.510> salary<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.110> professor<00:01:04.559> for<00:01:04.860> a

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
got to keep in mind what the priorities

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.109 
got to keep in mind what the priorities
are<00:01:13.110> for<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.500> university<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.310> rebranding

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
are for the university is rebranding

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.310 
are for the university is rebranding
really<00:01:15.360> something<00:01:15.659> that's<00:01:15.750> important<00:01:16.229> for

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
really something that's important for

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.499 
really something that's important for
the<00:01:16.439> university<00:01:16.950> I'm<00:01:17.100> not<00:01:17.340> sure<00:01:17.670> maybe<00:01:18.270> they

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
the university I'm not sure maybe they

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.100 
the university I'm not sure maybe they
think<00:01:18.830> rebranding<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.390> using<00:01:21.390> new<00:01:21.509> colors<00:01:21.930> or

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
think rebranding it using new colors or

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.570 
think rebranding it using new colors or
something<00:01:22.439> will<00:01:22.560> attract<00:01:22.890> more<00:01:23.130> students<00:01:23.430> to

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
something will attract more students to

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.570 
something will attract more students to
enroll<00:01:24.320> if<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.770> maybe<00:01:26.009> they'll<00:01:26.220> make<00:01:26.369> more

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
enroll if so maybe they'll make more

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.920 
enroll if so maybe they'll make more
money<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.970> don't<00:01:27.240> know<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.360> don't<00:01:27.689> know<00:01:27.780> what

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
money I don't know I don't know what

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.450 
money I don't know I don't know what
their<00:01:28.080> reasoning<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.619> behind<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:29.310> I

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
their reasoning is behind it but I

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.399 
their reasoning is behind it but I
understand<00:01:29.970> her<00:01:30.090> concerns<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.110> be<00:01:31.229> quite

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
understand her concerns and to be quite

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.020 
understand her concerns and to be quite
honest<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.950> would<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.220> annoyed<00:01:32.430> with<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.700> too

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
honest I would be annoyed with that too

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.420 
honest I would be annoyed with that too
maybe<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.840> an<00:01:34.110> attempt<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:35.130> make

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430

know what that school is so I haven't

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.700 
know what that school is so I haven't
really<00:02:13.170> had<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.349> deal

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
really had a deal

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.370 
really had a deal
with<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:13.950> but<00:02:14.850> for<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.240> smaller<00:02:15.690> university

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
with that but for a smaller university

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.090 
with that but for a smaller university
that<00:02:16.530> doesn't<00:02:16.950> have<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.430> reputation<00:02:18.890> first<00:02:19.890> off

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
that doesn't have a reputation first off

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.440 
that doesn't have a reputation first off
it<00:02:20.250> could<00:02:20.400> be<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.760> greater<00:02:21.000> amount<00:02:21.210> of<00:02:21.300> money

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
it could be a greater amount of money

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.790 
it could be a greater amount of money
for<00:02:21.690> them<00:02:21.780> than<00:02:21.960> it<00:02:21.990> is<00:02:22.080> for<00:02:22.260> big<00:02:22.440> university

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
for them than it is for big university

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.500 
for them than it is for big university
maybe<00:02:22.950> $85,000<00:02:23.880> for<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.090> very<00:02:24.270> small

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
maybe $85,000 for a very small

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.840 
maybe $85,000 for a very small
university<00:02:24.960> it's<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.080> lot<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.290> money<00:02:25.440> but<00:02:26.160> we

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
university it's a lot of money but we

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.090 
university it's a lot of money but we
should<00:02:27.000> also<00:02:27.150> bear<00:02:27.420> in<00:02:27.450> mind<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.870> one<00:02:28.260> reason

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
should also bear in mind that one reason

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.290 
should also bear in mind that one reason
they<00:02:29.220> might<00:02:29.340> want<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.550> do<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:29.730> rebranding<00:02:30.210> is

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
they might want to do this rebranding is

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.430 
they might want to do this rebranding is
not<00:02:30.450> just<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.690> get<00:02:30.780> more<00:02:30.900> students<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.290> enroll

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
not just to get more students to enroll

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.260 
not just to get more students to enroll
but<00:02:31.770> it<00:02:31.860> could<00:02:32.100> also<00:02:32.220> bring<00:02:32.580> in<00:02:32.760> more<00:02:33.000> money

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
but it could also bring in more money

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.990 
but it could also bring in more money
from<00:02:33.750> alumni<00:02:34.710> or<00:02:35.280> just<00:02:35.580> people<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
from alumni or just people in the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.610 
from alumni or just people in the
community<00:02:36.450> like<00:02:36.690> if<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.900> university<00:02:37.380> seems

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
community like if the university seems

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.040 
community like if the university seems
more<00:02:37.860> professional<00:02:38.460> or<00:02:38.580> more<00:02:39.330> modern<00:02:39.630> or

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
more professional or more modern or

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
more professional or more modern or
something<00:02:40.290> like<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.530> maybe<00:02:40.680> they<00:02:40.830> can<00:02:40.950> raise

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
something like that maybe they can raise

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.750 
something like that maybe they can raise
more<00:02:41.250> money<00:02:41.280> off<00:02:41.490> of<00:02:41.610> that

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
more money off of that

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.550 
more money off of that
so<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:42.630> don't<00:02:42.930> think<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.260> they<00:02:43.350> should<00:02:43.470> expect

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
so I don't think that they should expect

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.350 
so I don't think that they should expect
the<00:02:43.860> students<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.340> really<00:02:44.490> care<00:02:44.790> although

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
the students to really care although

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.060 
the students to really care although
maybe<00:02:45.690> it'll<00:02:45.990> generate<00:02:46.200> some<00:02:46.620> more<00:02:46.770> sort<00:02:46.980> of

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
maybe it'll generate some more sort of

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.770 
maybe it'll generate some more sort of
school<00:02:47.310> pride<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.850> think<00:02:48.090> that's<00:02:48.270> a<00:02:48.450> part<00:02:48.690> of

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
school pride I think that's a part of

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.990 
school pride I think that's a part of
this<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.140> kind<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.470> puzzles<00:02:50.190> me<00:02:50.430> why<00:02:50.640> are

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
this that kind of puzzles me why are

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.210 
this that kind of puzzles me why are
they<00:02:51.360> making<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:52.080> such<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.380> big<00:02:52.530> deal<00:02:52.590> and

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
they making it such a big deal and

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.010 
they making it such a big deal and
advertising<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.390> students<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.990> see

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
advertising it to the students you see

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.230 
advertising it to the students you see
what<00:02:55.230> I'm<00:02:55.320> saying<00:02:55.560> like<00:02:55.740> if<00:02:55.950> they<00:02:56.370> had<00:02:56.850> created

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
what I'm saying like if they had created

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.910 
what I'm saying like if they had created
a<00:02:57.330> new<00:02:57.480> department<00:02:57.630> within<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.350> university

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
a new department within the university

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.320 
a new department within the university
that's<00:02:59.160> gonna<00:02:59.280> actually<00:02:59.520> benefit<00:03:00.210> the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
that's gonna actually benefit the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.730 
that's gonna actually benefit the
students<00:03:00.690> then<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:00.870> can<00:03:00.990> understand<00:03:01.440> them

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
students then I can understand them

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.560 
students then I can understand them
bringing<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.310> their<00:03:02.460> attention<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:03.210> also

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
bringing it to their attention and also

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.660 
bringing it to their attention and also
John<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:03.930> do<00:03:04.050> make<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.260> good<00:03:04.470> point<00:03:04.650> about<00:03:04.920> you

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
John you do make a good point about you

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.730
