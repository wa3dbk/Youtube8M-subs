00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.179
 hello together and welcome 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.010
 to a small tutorial about enhance 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.750
 I have two portals for you today 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.400
 I have prepared that, but I mean that 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.990
 Names built here to show what you are 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.960
 with this they can do anything portal 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.330
 So you can beat the best 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.539
 shapes give and all that through 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.890
 Things need this portal modifier 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.840
 this portal modifier then you can even 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.369
 not that hard to produce actually 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.109
 would have prepared the theme you need 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.520
 now all changes ok I have a long time 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.690
 wanted in my single let's play but 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.760
 enter legally barren redstone diamond 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.059
 obsidian and a flint in style 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.950
 however, care from enhance portals 2 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.350
 and that sits down like this 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.700
 together, namely, here two angry anger and 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.289
 a normal flint in style so me 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.000
 I'm in turn with it to me 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.309
 and you can do it but you can do it too 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.399
 with this flint in style from the one 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.960
 hands portals at the moment 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.589
 This portal still runs normally 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.180
 the hell 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.799
 even if now topix postage is written 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.119
 that is total nonsense is leads into the 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.580
 hell and what we need about that 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.220
 To network portals is this map 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.080
 here this this people's upgrade 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.220
 but we need this upgrade 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.189
 card and I have it here 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.470
 you really need prepared for that 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.820
 only purple the ok can be hard sometimes 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.280
 to be found depending on how that looks 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.189
 the map is but usually finds 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.909
 you make it relatively quickly then you do it 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:40.049
 from for example aires or lapis lazuli 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.040
 and rose red or purple can calm 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.930
 you extract it 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.610
 yes, there are many possibilities 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.409
 then we need gold nuggets and 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.810
 of course a bit of paper 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.520
 if we have this card then go 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.220
 we need to get to the next station then 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.040
 an ender pearl four iron ingots 1 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.630
 redstone and two gold in the net and then 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.860
 we have this of the people upgrade 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.420
 card gives me now simply times 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.490
 steak where else do I have the all 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.350
 build and take over here now 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.770
 to the portal modifier clique once 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.239
 right 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.929
 if you now right click you see 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.969
 bottom left 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.760
 the corner that is already installed 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:16.950
 and here we are doing the same thing 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.019
 it then again so then we take the 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.359
 from the hand click here on the right 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.409
 and if you do not have daimler what 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.930
 I explained in the next tutorial 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.129
 then you would have to use the portals 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.629
 connect to a network 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.819
 and you need a network 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.560
 identifier since poschen feeling like that 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.209
 They do not really light up, I'll take it now 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.920
 just twice the diamond 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.200
 Once I also take enough time in 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.319
 Accept and buy diamonds repurchase 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.829
 do the same with escape out here 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.349
 I also have a diamond here 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.689
 and now these two portals are in 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.040
 a network we see up here 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.780
 all the upgrades that are still building 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.109
 you can, among other things, too 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:00.030
 here that is what found control and 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.560
 particle control update then has 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.859
 you do not hold the typical one anymore 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.510
 noise of this portal and not this 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.680
 little flex around here outside 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.319
 fly because I'm not that bad now 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.480
 find again in the middle of the house has been ok 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.000
 then maybe you do not want something 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.810
 you nor I have done this to me 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.489
 the sound control was okay then hears the 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.729
 Just press me now 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.470
 here in every single one and now 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:27.919
 I also do the particle updater 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.169
 tenants then see how it works like that 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:32.519
 zack-zack but I think that is now 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:37.129
 if i have the portal the next time 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:43.280
 start again when I say I'm off 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:45.709
 Particle way goes on like this 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.490
 and you see no particles no sound 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.110
 not so much 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.550
 that's the first time no matter the portal 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.470
 We'll take care of the two first 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.850
 they are already here in the diamond 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.720
 network are when I'm here now 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.530
 stand in 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.850
 yes I can get out of the back one can 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.810
 Of course, more distant 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:09.430
 make a stretch yes so I jump sc and 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.530
 I'm always horny and that's how easy it is 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.780
 Be easy with enhanced portals 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.549
 quick and easy a shortcut too 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.140
 So I hope it has you 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.489
 like it if that's it 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.620
 has done and in the next episode 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.550
 shows you then again that works 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:28.570
 and yes that was already great here 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.570
 easy skin in
