back<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.129> forth<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.489> whatnot<00:00:59.879> anyway<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.629> had

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
back and forth and whatnot anyway I had

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.479 
back and forth and whatnot anyway I had
those<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.440> decided<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.859> was<00:01:01.949> going<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.129> save<00:01:02.309> them

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
those I decided I was going to save them

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.280 
those I decided I was going to save them
because<00:01:02.760> maybe<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.149> have<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> future<00:01:03.750> use<00:01:03.899> for

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
because maybe I have a future use for

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.260 
because maybe I have a future use for
the<00:01:04.680> whole<00:01:04.890> setup<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.460> not<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> wheels

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the whole setup it's not just the wheels

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.480 
the whole setup it's not just the wheels
because<00:01:06.840> they<00:01:06.990> are<00:01:07.080> pneumatic<00:01:07.470> wheels<00:01:07.500> well

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
because they are pneumatic wheels well

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.190 
because they are pneumatic wheels well
the<00:01:08.939> other<00:01:09.060> day<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.240> my<00:01:09.299> way<00:01:09.479> home<00:01:09.630> from<00:01:09.689> work<00:01:09.840> I

the other day on my way home from work I

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.410 
the other day on my way home from work I
found<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.920> full-size<00:01:11.310> steel<00:01:11.729> bed<00:01:11.970> frame<00:01:12.240> that

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
found a full-size steel bed frame that

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.700 
found a full-size steel bed frame that
somebody<00:01:12.689> had<00:01:12.869> put<00:01:13.049> out<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> road<00:01:13.530> for

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
somebody had put out to the road for

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.920 
somebody had put out to the road for
garbage<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.420> don't<00:01:15.420> know<00:01:15.479> why<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.689> would<00:01:15.900> want

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
garbage I don't know why you would want

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.810 
garbage I don't know why you would want
to<00:01:16.110> throw<00:01:16.259> out<00:01:16.320> steel<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.040> I'm<00:01:17.460> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> take

to throw out steel but I'm going to take

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.969 
to throw out steel but I'm going to take
full<00:01:18.030> advantage<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.960> saw<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.770> last

full advantage of that I saw this last
night<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.369> thought<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.700> know<00:01:20.790> what<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.930> bed

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
night and thought you know what this bed

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200 
night and thought you know what this bed
frame<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.740> can<00:01:22.890> take<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.340> angle<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.060> can

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
frame I can take this angle and I can

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.300 
frame I can take this angle and I can
use<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:25.140> make<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.380> frame<00:01:25.890> for<00:01:26.189> this

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
use this to make the frame for this

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.370 
use this to make the frame for this
wagon<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.030> that's<00:01:27.509> what<00:01:27.630> today's<00:01:27.840> episode<00:01:28.320> is

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380
