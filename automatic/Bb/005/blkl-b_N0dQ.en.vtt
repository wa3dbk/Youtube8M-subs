00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
at a place so we actually did try having

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.020 
at a place so we actually did try having
a<00:00:44.350> some<00:00:45.350> type<00:00:45.500> of<00:00:45.530> disguise<00:00:46.010> system<00:00:46.430> where<00:00:46.910> you

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
a some type of disguise system where you

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.010 
a some type of disguise system where you
get<00:00:47.180> different<00:00:47.329> costumes<00:00:48.520> but<00:00:49.630> it<00:00:50.630> didn't

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
get different costumes but it didn't

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.770 
get different costumes but it didn't
work<00:00:51.140> out<00:00:51.260> that<00:00:51.320> well<00:00:51.590> it<00:00:52.460> was<00:00:52.670> when<00:00:53.360> it<00:00:53.390> script

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
work out that well it was when it script

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.479 
work out that well it was when it script
it<00:00:53.960> when<00:00:54.170> it's<00:00:54.320> more<00:00:54.530> scripted<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.100> narrative

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
it when it's more scripted and narrative

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.340 
it when it's more scripted and narrative
it<00:00:55.850> was<00:00:56.000> working<00:00:56.300> really<00:00:56.390> well<00:00:56.540> when<00:00:57.050> was<00:00:57.170> more

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
it was working really well when was more

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.650 
it was working really well when was more
systemic<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:58.399> problem<00:00:58.730> with<00:00:58.820> it<00:00:58.940> was<00:00:59.090> we<00:00:59.360> you

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
systemic the problem with it was we you

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.540 
systemic the problem with it was we you
know<00:00:59.780> was<00:00:59.989> it<00:01:00.260> made<00:01:00.559> detection<00:01:01.070> rules<00:01:01.309> very

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
know was it made detection rules very

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.180 
know was it made detection rules very
complicated<00:01:02.090> and<00:01:02.360> unclear<00:01:02.989> we<00:01:03.500> we<00:01:03.680> tried<00:01:03.920> some

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
complicated and unclear we we tried some

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.310 
complicated and unclear we we tried some
prototyping<00:01:04.879> with<00:01:05.030> it<00:01:05.149> and<00:01:05.390> it<00:01:05.509> just<00:01:05.540> through

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
prototyping with it and it just through

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.040 
prototyping with it and it just through
play<00:01:06.500> tests<00:01:06.920> nobody<00:01:07.550> really<00:01:07.850> enjoyed<00:01:08.119> it<00:01:08.240> the

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
play tests nobody really enjoyed it the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.290 
play tests nobody really enjoyed it the
concept<00:01:09.410> was<00:01:09.590> really<00:01:09.619> cool<00:01:10.009> but<00:01:10.430> just<00:01:10.820> in

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
concept was really cool but just in

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.240 
concept was really cool but just in
gameplay<00:01:11.810> it<00:01:11.930> wasn't<00:01:12.200> working<00:01:12.320> very<00:01:12.470> well<00:01:12.680> so

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
gameplay it wasn't working very well so

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.770 
gameplay it wasn't working very well so
we<00:01:13.310> kind<00:01:13.490> of<00:01:13.549> we<00:01:13.790> kind<00:01:13.820> of<00:01:14.090> let<00:01:14.210> it<00:01:14.240> go<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:14.479> we

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
we kind of we kind of let it go and we

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.539 
we kind of we kind of let it go and we
just<00:01:14.960> decided<00:01:15.260> okay<00:01:15.440> we'll<00:01:16.100> do<00:01:16.250> it<00:01:16.280> a<00:01:16.430> couple

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
just decided okay we'll do it a couple

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.310 
just decided okay we'll do it a couple
times<00:01:16.790> in<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.060> missions<00:01:17.330> just<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:18.110> get<00:01:18.229> the

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
times in the missions just to get the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.530 
times in the missions just to get the
flavor<00:01:18.560> of<00:01:18.740> it<00:01:18.920> but<00:01:19.670> it's<00:01:19.820> not<00:01:19.940> a<00:01:20.000> full<00:01:20.180> system

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
flavor of it but it's not a full system

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.330 
flavor of it but it's not a full system
having<00:01:21.350> said<00:01:21.500> that<00:01:21.530> there<00:01:21.770> are<00:01:21.890> tons<00:01:22.159> of
