LP the Sega CD version for its
questionable<00:01:06.900> voice<00:01:07.229> acting<00:01:08.030> even<00:01:09.030> though

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
questionable voice acting even though

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.480 
questionable voice acting even though
the<00:01:09.380> Sega<00:01:10.380> CD<00:01:10.530> version<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.010> little<00:01:11.040> harder

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the Sega CD version is a little harder

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.980 
the Sega CD version is a little harder
and<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> few<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> bullshit<00:01:12.420> scenes<00:01:12.780> that

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
and a few of the bullshit scenes that

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.149 
and a few of the bullshit scenes that
come<00:01:13.140> up<00:01:13.260> later<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.710> game<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:14.100> the

come up later in the game like the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.240 
come up later in the game like the
babysitter<00:01:14.900> because<00:01:15.900> that's<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.070> whole

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
babysitter because that's just a whole

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.920 
babysitter because that's just a whole
lot<00:01:17.430> easier<00:01:17.549> with<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> mouse<00:01:18.210> as<00:01:18.479> opposed<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
lot easier with a mouse as opposed to a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.010 
lot easier with a mouse as opposed to a
controlled<00:01:19.290> hood<00:01:21.439> but<00:01:23.659> it's<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.750> game<00:01:24.900> that

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
controlled hood but it's a game that

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.450 
controlled hood but it's a game that
should<00:01:25.200> be<00:01:25.350> finished<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:25.979> nobody<00:01:26.159> else

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
should be finished just so nobody else

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.980 
should be finished just so nobody else
has<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.759> deal<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.210> because<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.720> not

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
has to deal with it because it's not

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.050 
has to deal with it because it's not
good<00:01:28.320> at<00:01:28.650> all<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:32.460> people<00:01:32.610> haven't<00:01:32.909> had<00:01:33.000> a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
chance to see me really suffer in a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.219 
chance to see me really suffer in a
while<00:01:34.770> because<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.100> kind<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.430> cheaped<00:01:35.939> out<00:01:36.119> on

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
while because I kind of cheaped out on

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.730 
while because I kind of cheaped out on
mighty<00:01:37.229> bomb<00:01:37.439> jack<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> little<00:01:38.070> bit<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.220> admit<00:01:39.740> so

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
let me know if you think that'd be a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.730 
let me know if you think that'd be a
good<00:01:42.180> idea<00:01:42.270> or<00:01:42.479> not<00:01:42.570> because<00:01:43.140> I'm<00:01:43.439> more<00:01:43.649> than

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
good idea or not because I'm more than

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.560 
good idea or not because I'm more than
willing<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.070> do<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:45.030> been<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> really<00:01:45.479> long

willing to do it it's been a really long

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.420 
willing to do it it's been a really long
time<00:01:45.930> since<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.229> beat<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.619> one<00:01:46.799> but<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.100> think<00:01:47.399> I

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
time since I beat that one but I think I

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.010

and death count of one there will

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.980 
and death count of one there will
probably<00:03:14.580> not<00:03:14.730> be<00:03:14.790> any<00:03:15.000> more<00:03:15.270> because<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.780> won't

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
probably not be any more because I won't

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.660 
probably not be any more because I won't
do<00:03:16.140> things<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.620> will<00:03:16.740> do<00:03:17.220> stupid<00:03:17.520> things

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
do things that will do stupid things

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.140 
do things that will do stupid things
like<00:03:17.940> I<00:03:18.120> did<00:03:18.270> at<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.420> beginning<00:03:18.510> their<00:03:20.150> horned

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
like I did at the beginning their horned

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.460 
like I did at the beginning their horned
which<00:03:21.390> is<00:03:21.630> actually<00:03:21.780> one<00:03:22.020> of<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.140> harder

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
which is actually one of the harder

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.710 
which is actually one of the harder
bosses<00:03:22.830> in<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:22.980> game<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.570> that's<00:03:24.570> where

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
bosses in the game and that's where

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.940
