around this way you're going to see this

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:40.559 
around this way you're going to see this
is<00:01:39.399> kind<00:01:39.609> of<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.729> same<00:01:39.880> position<00:01:40.299> that<00:01:40.329> we

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
is kind of the same position that we
