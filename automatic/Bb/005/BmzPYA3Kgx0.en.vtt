00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and then the maximum all we do is put

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.820

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.310 
however many queens we have at that time
and<00:01:26.250> then<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.820> can't<00:01:27.090> get<00:01:27.360> players<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.259> we

and then we can't get players that we

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.539 
and then we can't get players that we

honest I didn't actually struggled this
team<00:05:11.810> at<00:05:12.020> all<00:05:12.260> and<00:05:12.590> i<00:05:12.650> found<00:05:12.950> that<00:05:13.040> weird<00:05:13.340> i

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
team at all and i found that weird i

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.790 
team at all and i found that weird i
actually<00:05:14.419> found<00:05:14.570> it<00:05:14.780> quite<00:05:14.900> simple<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:15.560> i<00:05:15.650> was

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
actually found it quite simple and i was

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.770 
actually found it quite simple and i was
genuinely<00:05:16.130> enjoying<00:05:16.820> myself<00:05:17.030> playing<00:05:17.540> with

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
genuinely enjoying myself playing with

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.940 
genuinely enjoying myself playing with
this<00:05:17.930> starter<00:05:18.320> team<00:05:18.470> i<00:05:18.590> don't<00:05:18.740> know<00:05:18.800> why<00:05:18.919> but

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
this starter team i don't know why but

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.129 
this starter team i don't know why but
the<00:05:19.250> defenders<00:05:19.760> were<00:05:19.880> really<00:05:20.090> solid<00:05:20.300> even

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
the defenders were really solid even

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.810 
the defenders were really solid even
though<00:05:21.320> they're<00:05:21.860> completely<00:05:22.460> out<00:05:22.789> of

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
though they're completely out of

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.550 
though they're completely out of
position<00:05:23.150> i<00:05:23.419> think<00:05:23.630> i'm<00:05:23.690> not<00:05:23.810> right<00:05:24.020> backs<00:05:24.289> in

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
position i think i'm not right backs in

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.440 
position i think i'm not right backs in
the<00:05:25.010> center<00:05:25.370> back<00:05:25.520> but<00:05:25.760> it's<00:05:25.880> just<00:05:26.030> working

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
the center back but it's just working

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.960 
the center back but it's just working
like<00:05:26.630> I<00:05:26.840> find<00:05:27.530> it<00:05:27.740> quite<00:05:27.860> easy<00:05:28.160> to<00:05:28.280> defend<00:05:28.729> with

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
like I find it quite easy to defend with

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.450 
like I find it quite easy to defend with
and<00:05:29.150> I'm<00:05:29.840> getting<00:05:30.410> really<00:05:30.620> used<00:05:30.740> to<00:05:31.010> using<00:05:31.160> two

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
and I'm getting really used to using two

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.520 
and I'm getting really used to using two
star<00:05:31.729> skills<00:05:32.000> because<00:05:32.270> I<00:05:32.450> quite<00:05:32.900> simply<00:05:33.289> have

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
star skills because I quite simply have

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.750 
star skills because I quite simply have
to<00:05:33.740> use<00:05:33.860> them<00:05:34.039> because<00:05:34.130> they<00:05:34.370> have<00:05:34.550> nothing

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
to use them because they have nothing

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.000 
to use them because they have nothing
else<00:05:35.120> i<00:05:35.270> don't<00:05:35.419> think<00:05:35.510> i<00:05:35.870> have<00:05:36.320> a<00:05:36.530> single

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
else i don't think i have a single

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.950 
else i don't think i have a single
player<00:05:37.220> that<00:05:37.850> can<00:05:37.970> actually<00:05:38.390> do<00:05:38.539> the<00:05:38.660> roulette

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
player that can actually do the roulette

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.500 
player that can actually do the roulette
so<00:05:39.169> I'm<00:05:39.320> just<00:05:39.560> completely<00:05:40.180> abusing<00:05:41.180> the<00:05:41.300> step

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
so I'm just completely abusing the step

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.300 
so I'm just completely abusing the step
overs<00:05:41.870> not<00:05:42.320> like<00:05:42.470> don't<00:05:42.770> anyway<00:05:43.130> because

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
overs not like don't anyway because

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.940 
overs not like don't anyway because
pretty<00:05:43.760> much<00:05:43.850> all<00:05:44.120> my<00:05:44.330> gameplay<00:05:44.840> is<00:05:45.080> abusing

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
pretty much all my gameplay is abusing

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.529 
pretty much all my gameplay is abusing
the<00:05:46.160> stepper<00:05:46.490> it's<00:05:46.640> because<00:05:46.850> it's<00:05:46.970> so<00:05:47.240> so

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
the stepper it's because it's so so

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.659 
the stepper it's because it's so so
effective<00:05:47.990> especially<00:05:48.590> in<00:05:49.100> Division<00:05:49.490> five

now<00:05:50.150> this<00:05:50.270> goal<00:05:50.539> I<00:05:50.810> don't<00:05:51.020> really<00:05:51.260> know<00:05:51.470> what<00:05:51.590> I

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650
