00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.870
 I see only positive for the tifo 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.389
 him since he can find the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.490
 champion's league the positive also for 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.809
 for the psg because it's a 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.360
 complicity he with the coach in 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.190
 presence of white laurent who had re 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.199
 since he was under his command in 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.119
 team of France and that's the fact that you 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.800
 recruits a player who is very 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.119
 intelligent but in addition he knows but 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.340
 wonderfully league 1 so 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.289
 I imagine that the adaptation time and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.330
 should be much faster than 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.980
 any other player is so 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.989
 yeah I find that very very interesting 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.750
 it will give a French connotation 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.770
 a little more French still psg I 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.739
 find that cabaye is also a very 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.200
 beautiful image of the player itself is 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.040
 a good representative of French football 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.550
 because he's a player 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.989
 smart it's a stylish player and 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.809
 I suffer a lot of things very 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.239
 positive to his coming to the park of princes 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.920
 will say yes to the pg very good thing we 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.170
 we do not forget the beginning of the season that 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.510
 to have lost both singing at the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.680
 once bodmer and cissokho did that when 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.210
 even three players in midfield 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.809
 which is missing and we saw it as soon as 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.880
 detroit 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.590
 kébé it's mostly with the injury of 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.170
 radio you find yourself practically just 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.189
 with 2000 ciena ground that stand 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.130
 panel during the match you do not have 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.840
 our place was forced to play with 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.430
 pastore which is more false attack and 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.049
 an attacking midfielder and that can 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.240
 unbalance the team so it's a 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.070
 very good choice especially knowing that 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.450
 cabaye can play I think the champions 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.920
 league and maybe that's why they 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.479
 can recruit him and knows very very 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.920
 well the championship of France so he 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.659
 will not need time to adapt 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.549
 as a parent is a player like thiago 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.509
 Motta warned and matuidi the difference 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.340
 it's that they strike very well 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.470
 free kicks and he has a very very good 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.750
 knock so he will bring this a lot 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.520
 more to finish his offensive that goes 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.770
 maybe helped an ibrahimovic and a 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.049
 cavani to score a lot more goals 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.579
 for the psg or to decant the matches 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.250
 as we saw against against guingamp 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.259
 or against against evian on a good 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.390
 hit the famous zero that can do the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.770
 difference if both ibrahimovic 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.590
 cavani can not do it what does 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.179
 quite seldom 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.659
 players like thiago motta like 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.659
 open to all
