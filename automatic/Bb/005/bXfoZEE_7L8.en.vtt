 Y 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.900
 i 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.900
 Y 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.710
 i 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.890
 ah 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.240
 how about friends of youtube today I come to you 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.660
 presenting a new video 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.870
 on how to remove copyright from 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.500
 music using the adobe program 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.290
 Audition 16 can use any grade 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.370
 of acquisition hearing forgiveness of 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.550
 any version that is of it seems to me 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.150
 which is from 73 to the cc but good 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.129
 I have gotten this which is the CS 6 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.970
 well I'll open it to execute the good 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.530
 that appears to me with 5 and good this 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.650
 afterwards we load the program 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.220
 this one we're going I'm going to put a song 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.070
 Either way this truth 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.900
 set up the study capital so that 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.540
 when I already play the song you 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.420
 listen to him too and well we're going to 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.840
 go file or if they have it in English it 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.020
 they go to file 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.320
 and they put open or in this case open or 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.750
 you can press on the access that is 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.230
 control more or that would be control 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.110
 as well as being right now 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.630
 but it's not charging and well here I already 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.060
 it seems a repertoire of music and good 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:43.660
 here I'm going to put is not going to put this 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.660
 visible the name 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.619
 well I'm going to advance a little 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.640
 or overtake as per minute and good 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.909
 you will see how they are heard 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.700
 listen to your problem without any problem 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.619
 and well the only thing that will affect when 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.960
 we inhabit in this program is going to be the 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.920
 song to look for the understood version 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.680
 of being the equalizer 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.010
 this is all the sound and the effect of 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.439
 low 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.439
 well here we take a little 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.010
 I heard the sound 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.500
 now we 're going to pass it and then we're going 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.920
 to go to effects equally for the one who does not 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.110
 I have in English is the effect 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.390
 and we put it where it says amplitude and 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.880
 compression and put mixer 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.550
 channels in this is going to be mixer 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.550
 channels the channel mixer forgiveness 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.520
 we are going to put stereo with matrix 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.890
 and we will play it again as 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.620
 you will see almost I was affected by the change only 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.540
 came down a little bit the good invasion we're going to 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.330
 happen and we're going to put it to apply I was going to 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.330
 load as you will see effect as 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.640
 we had before affected now what we 're going 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.420
 to go is equal to the effect and let's go 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.940
 special and we will put 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.200
 vocal amplification 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:15.480
 we put him as a man and we reproduce him and 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.300
 we advance it here like 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.220
 You see the volume down a little you 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.410
 we can apply 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.340
 and we wait for him to load all the 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.020
 program that finishes processing it good 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.480
 here I finish processing it and they will see and 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.310
 already as the volume went down now we 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.770
 we 're going to go to this tab to come 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.450
 by default it's going to come off going to 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.940
 I think I get seems so good 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.310
 arrives until the 16th of effects and good 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.980
 here we are going to press the little arrow 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.069
 and we are going to put delay and erc or 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.060
 let's put an echo 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.060
 and we are going to put 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.250
 an infinite loop 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.860
 and we are going to close it connect and without 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.340
 problems are saved here and we put it to 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.340
 play 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.740
 but that I do not recommend 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.890
 wrong and good here we are going to put 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.340
 in turn off let's go back to modify and 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:16.130
 then we see the same in particular and it was 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.410
 the forgiveness of channel creation and 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.630
 we put subtle clarity now yes what 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.020
 we close without problems and reproduce the 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.020
 song 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.970
 as you will see the batting down the only 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.280
 it sucks but in itself when when they put in 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.289
 songs in buffer or in stereo things and 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.599
 does not affect the nothing now to save them 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.879
 let's go to file today equally for 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.460
 those who do not have English in fire and you 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:45.789
 we put save how and in English it would be 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.310
 in six ace we put it save as you 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.669
 we accept accept this has not been 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.100
 We are going to put a lot of importance 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:56.580
 modified 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.550
 we are not going to save the mp3 file we 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.080
 are going to have mp3 mp2 or what can 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.360
 save any of these formats not 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.260
 there is a problem and we accept and 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.889
 safeguard him 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.240
 in music 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.099
 let's save 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.099
 let's examine and let's put it in the 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:17.220
 accept desk and we can accept it 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:21.090
 and we say yes and a copy will be made already 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:23.610
 that the original music will not affect 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.889
 this good sense let's hear them 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.110
 Well, well, let's put that 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.419
 is now here when our 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.430
 desk we press it right click and 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.020
 we will go after properties 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.289
 properties we're going to go to the 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.639
 security can be in security we 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.080
 let's go to details and details 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.840
 let's put here ironically remove 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.759
 properties personal information you 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.710
 we put remove the following 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.440
 properties of this file and we can 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.900
 select everything we put you accept and 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.860
 accept and well let's hear the 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.090
 difference 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.520
 I'm going to open my player 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:01.490
 and we are going to treat you over here 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.270
 well there listen now I side of the 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.270
 music victims 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.280
 have 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.360
 with soccer 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:13.469
 ah 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:21.099
 as you will see that it changes a little 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.509
 and well that was part of me of everything and 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:24.879

 Video is not my property 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:33.879
 program but the program works well 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:37.000
 and aside the instructions come good 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:40.469
