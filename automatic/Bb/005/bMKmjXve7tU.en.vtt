similar to that and I've got to figure

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.499 
similar to that and I've got to figure
out<00:01:49.079> how<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> stop<00:01:50.100> it

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
out how to stop it

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.590 
out how to stop it

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
even though they're really really short

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.410 
even though they're really really short
I<00:03:09.609> try<00:03:09.879> to<00:03:09.940> keep<00:03:10.150> them<00:03:10.329> polished<00:03:12.180> but<00:03:13.180> they<00:03:13.299> are

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
I try to keep them polished but they are

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.069 
I try to keep them polished but they are
growing<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:14.220> it's<00:03:15.220> only<00:03:15.670> been<00:03:16.090> it<00:03:16.450> is<00:03:16.720> what

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
growing and it's only been it is what

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.039 
growing and it's only been it is what
may<00:03:17.410> actually<00:03:18.340> Cinco<00:03:19.150> DeMayo<00:03:19.389> so<00:03:19.690> it's<00:03:19.840> made

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
may actually Cinco DeMayo so it's made

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.940 
may actually Cinco DeMayo so it's made
fit<00:03:20.319> so<00:03:20.470> it's<00:03:20.680> February<00:03:21.160> March<00:03:21.459> April<00:03:21.760> May<00:03:22.950> and

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
fit so it's February March April May and

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.309 
fit so it's February March April May and
it's<00:03:24.790> what's<00:03:25.090> been<00:03:25.329> almost<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.780> full<00:03:25.989> three

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
it's what's been almost a full three

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.120 
it's what's been almost a full three
months<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:27.030> I'm<00:03:28.030> noticing<00:03:28.239> just<00:03:29.169> such<00:03:29.829> a

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
months and I'm noticing just such a

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.170 
months and I'm noticing just such a
difference<00:03:31.859> so<00:03:32.859> I'm<00:03:33.340> figuring<00:03:33.730> it's<00:03:34.030> gonna

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
difference so I'm figuring it's gonna

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.770 
difference so I'm figuring it's gonna
take<00:03:34.510> another<00:03:34.989> month<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.980> -<00:03:36.609> maybe<00:03:37.120> it'll<00:03:37.569> be<00:03:37.750> a

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
take another month to - maybe it'll be a

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.479 
take another month to - maybe it'll be a
total<00:03:38.049> of<00:03:38.260> maybe<00:03:38.380> six<00:03:38.769> months<00:03:38.950> before<00:03:39.280> I

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
total of maybe six months before I

total of maybe six months before I
really<00:03:39.819> really<00:03:40.120> see<00:03:40.389> any<00:03:40.660> kind<00:03:41.049> of<00:03:41.169> length<00:03:42.069> on

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
really really see any kind of length on

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.839
