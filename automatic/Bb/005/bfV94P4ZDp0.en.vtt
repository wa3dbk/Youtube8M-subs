00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.210
 good throughout this early August 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.759
 which areas of Brazil will have more rain and 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.009
 Does this dryness continue under areas 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.990
 central Brazil is the personal news is 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.449
 What can we still see? 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.730
 here in this map 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.199
 forecast that until the 8th of 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.019
 August the situation is not encouraging 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.119
 for central areas of Brazil I have the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.039
 The predominance of dry air 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.070
 prevalence of low rainfall in these areas 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.960
 in the white tones we see that here 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.120
 Where I understood red we have to 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.190
 to subsidize the presence that is 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.219
 organized by the high pressure system 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.290
 atmospheric levels 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.820
 prevents the arrival of cold fronts 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.530
 the forecast of some blows on 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.270
 areas of the rio grande do sul region 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.370
 due to the passage of some fronts 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.070
 and even some areas of the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.410
 center of Santa Catarina and some areas 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.420
 of the parana coast is also forecast 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.059
 that by the end of this first 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.949
 fortnight of the month of August the forecast of 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.840
 a little more rain on areas of the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.760
 region of rio grande do sul 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.979
 the volumes of rainfall in these areas can 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.930
 reach close to 100 millimeters 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.240
 accrued during this period 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.250
 especially on campaign areas 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.750
 areas of the western border areas in the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.490
 border with uruguay 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.619
 the central region of the state also with 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.200
 rainfall forecast some areas of the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.330
 South Central region of Santa Catarina also 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.890
 is forecasting a little more rain at 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.840
 forecast for some rain showers 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.909
 also in the east side of são paulo 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.650
 indicating that the Japanese forecast gives the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.049
 passage of some cold fronts but 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.689
 who can not completely break the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.090
 atmospheric block even on 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.650
 areas of the northeast region are expected to 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.659
 some rainfall due to the 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.700
 circulation of moisture from the 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.579
 These wind currents wind up 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.079
 leaving the sea towards the mainland 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.990
 favoring the formation of large clouds 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.000
 loaded and therefore have forecast that 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.880
 some strokes but strokes should 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.890
 happen punctually I should not 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.590
 have a comprehensive rainfall condition and 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.810
 on areas of the mato grosso region 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.360
 goiás and federal district 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.190
 the predominance is air subsistence air 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.250
 marking their presence in the 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.680
 of cloudiness and also the circulation of 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.810
 moisture than any other to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.069
 because of this the drier air of the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.620
 higher layers 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.659
 drops to the lower layers and 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.269
 also favors the fall of humidity 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:26.310
 air in these areas along the 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.709
 the first fortnight of August is 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.459
 possible that we have a condition 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.650
 to arrive in the emergency 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.670
 for low relative humidity 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.670
