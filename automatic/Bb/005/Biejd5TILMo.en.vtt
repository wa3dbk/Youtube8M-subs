00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.160 
lemon sudsy ammonia for those darker
stains<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.830> add<00:01:26.100> less<00:01:26.610> about<00:01:27.479> two<00:01:27.720> ounces

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
stains you can add less about two ounces

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.560 
stains you can add less about two ounces
of<00:01:28.229> ammonia<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.009> water<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:30.000> our<00:01:30.150> lighter

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
of ammonia and water and for our lighter

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.109 
of ammonia and water and for our lighter
stains<00:01:30.960> such<00:01:31.320> as<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:32.070> red<00:01:32.520> kool-aid<00:01:32.850> stain

here you can add a little more water and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.990 
here you can add a little more water and
ammonia<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.680> approximately<00:01:38.280> we're<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:38.939> to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
ammonia so approximately we're going to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:50.440 
ammonia so approximately we're going to
use<00:01:39.150> about<00:01:41.240> 50/50<00:01:42.240> ammonia<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.990> water

and<00:01:51.450> we're<00:01:51.570> gonna<00:01:51.660> mix<00:01:51.900> this<00:01:52.110> up<00:01:52.320> now<00:01:52.800> you<00:01:52.860> will

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
and we're gonna mix this up now you will

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.520 
and we're gonna mix this up now you will
start<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.550> smell<00:01:54.510> the<00:01:54.690> product<00:01:55.050> when<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.320> mix

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
start to smell the product when you mix

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.500 
start to smell the product when you mix
it<00:01:55.740> up<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:56.040> chemical<00:01:56.520> reaction<00:01:56.970> is<00:01:57.060> working

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
it up the chemical reaction is working

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.420 
it up the chemical reaction is working
and<00:01:57.630> that's<00:01:57.690> a<00:01:57.840> good<00:01:57.990> thing<00:01:58.050> but<00:01:59.010> just<00:01:59.070> make

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
and that's a good thing but just make

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.130 
and that's a good thing but just make
sure<00:01:59.640> you're<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.970> well-ventilated<00:02:00.140> area

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
one thing I should mention is that once

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.290 
one thing I should mention is that once
you<00:02:04.050> mix<00:02:04.260> your<00:02:04.560> mixture<00:02:04.980> of<00:02:05.100> cr2<00:02:05.640> ammonia<00:02:06.210> and

you mix your mixture of cr2 ammonia and
water<00:02:06.510> together<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.830> only<00:02:07.980> good<00:02:08.190> for<00:02:08.220> a

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
water together it's only good for a

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.620 
water together it's only good for a
couple<00:02:08.430> hours<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:08.910> you're<00:02:09.180> going<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.510> to

couple hours so you're going to have to

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.380 
couple hours so you're going to have to
remix<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.860> next<00:02:11.100> time<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.430> want<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.730> make<00:02:12.330> a

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
remix the next time you want to make a

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.010 
remix the next time you want to make a
stain<00:02:12.780> no<00:02:13.140> point<00:02:13.380> in<00:02:13.470> keeping<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:14.960> okay<00:02:15.960> so
