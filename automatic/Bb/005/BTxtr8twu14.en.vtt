guess<00:01:37.160> what<00:01:37.280> I'm<00:01:37.369> trying<00:01:37.429> to<00:01:37.670> do<00:01:37.789> is<00:01:37.940> basically

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
guess what I'm trying to do is basically

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.139 
guess what I'm trying to do is basically
use<00:01:38.630> an<00:01:39.110> overdrive<00:01:39.619> pedal<00:01:39.649> to<00:01:40.550> really<00:01:40.820> kind<00:01:41.060> of

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
use an overdrive pedal to really kind of

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.210 
use an overdrive pedal to really kind of
I<00:01:41.300> guess<00:01:41.420> make<00:01:41.810> mark<00:01:42.200> 1<00:01:42.410> channel<00:01:42.679> sound<00:01:43.009> really

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.809 
clips with it on and off on and off
mostly<00:02:25.580> on<00:02:25.730> channel<00:02:26.090> 2<00:02:26.270> on<00:02:26.300> my<00:02:26.660> mark<00:02:26.900> 1<00:02:27.170> mode<00:02:27.819> -

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
mostly on channel 2 on my mark 1 mode -

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.940 
mostly on channel 2 on my mark 1 mode -
I'd<00:02:29.180> like<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.360> do<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.690> for<00:02:29.720> channel<00:02:30.080> 1<00:02:30.260> but<00:02:30.530> I

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
I'd like to do it for channel 1 but I

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.870 
I'd like to do it for channel 1 but I
mean<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.310> guess<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.520> probably<00:02:31.580> need<00:02:31.850> a

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
mean I guess it probably need a

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.100 
mean I guess it probably need a
distortion<00:02:32.209> pedal<00:02:32.390> for<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:32.840> guess<00:02:33.020> I

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
distortion pedal for that I guess I

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.140 
distortion pedal for that I guess I
don't<00:02:33.260> know<00:02:33.319> it's<00:02:33.470> been<00:02:34.400> years<00:02:34.850> since
