from across the map and I really hear

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.410 
from across the map and I really hear
that<00:02:39.840> guys<00:02:40.020> so<00:02:40.320> yeah<00:02:40.860> but<00:02:41.190> if<00:02:41.310> evidently<00:02:42.240> it

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
that guys so yeah but if evidently it

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.610 
that guys so yeah but if evidently it
does<00:02:42.600> work<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:42.930> you'll<00:02:43.050> see<00:02:43.230> what<00:02:43.380> another

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
does work and you'll see what another

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.750 
does work and you'll see what another
thing<00:02:43.830> I'm<00:02:43.920> doing<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.160> I'm<00:02:44.220> keeping<00:02:44.640> my

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
thing I'm doing is I'm keeping my

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.070

distance<00:02:46.110> is<00:02:46.620> because<00:02:46.890> I've<00:02:47.100> got<00:02:47.370> assault

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.130 
distance is because I've got assault
rifles<00:02:48.000> they<00:02:48.180> could<00:02:48.360> have<00:02:48.450> some<00:02:48.660> machine<00:02:48.930> guns

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
was actually that i could have probably

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.780 
was actually that i could have probably
got<00:05:20.710> the<00:05:20.830> double<00:05:21.040> mob<00:05:21.190> guys<00:05:21.430> because<00:05:21.670> i'm

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
going 32 1 or simulator at this point on

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.680 
going 32 1 or simulator at this point on
just<00:05:24.340> got<00:05:24.460> the<00:05:24.550> big<00:05:24.700> molecule<00:05:25.150> so<00:05:25.330> I<00:05:25.360> know<00:05:25.570> I

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
just got the big molecule so I know I

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:26.970 
just got the big molecule so I know I
want<00:05:25.870> a<00:05:25.900> big<00:05:26.020> streak<00:05:26.380> I<00:05:26.470> don't<00:05:26.650> know<00:05:26.740> I'm

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
want a big streak I don't know I'm

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.740 
want a big streak I don't know I'm
within<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:27.670> limit<00:05:27.910> to<00:05:28.000> go<00:05:28.120> for<00:05:28.270> a<00:05:28.300> double<00:05:28.510> mob

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
within the limit to go for a double mob

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.120 
within the limit to go for a double mob
you<00:05:28.900> know<00:05:29.020> because<00:05:29.230> all<00:05:29.680> we<00:05:29.800> need<00:05:29.920> to<00:05:29.950> do<00:05:30.070> is

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
you know because all we need to do is

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.500 
you know because all we need to do is
get<00:05:30.310> one<00:05:30.490> more<00:05:30.640> those<00:05:30.820> floods<00:05:31.120> and<00:05:31.270> I<00:05:31.330> could

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
get one more those floods and I could

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.700 
get one more those floods and I could
probably<00:05:31.660> hit<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:31.960> double<00:05:32.140> muah<00:05:32.410> because

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
probably hit the double muah because

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.470 
probably hit the double muah because
I've<00:05:32.830> got<00:05:32.950> enough<00:05:33.190> time<00:05:33.400> to<00:05:33.520> do<00:05:33.700> that<00:05:33.820> but<00:05:34.360> like

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
I've got enough time to do that but like

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.580 
I've got enough time to do that but like
I<00:05:34.630> mentioned<00:05:34.840> earlier<00:05:35.050> in<00:05:35.260> the<00:05:35.290> video<00:05:35.410> I

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.290 
didn't know I had to die in order
together<00:05:39.160> i<00:05:39.430> did<00:05:39.640> have<00:05:39.730> enough<00:05:39.940> time<00:05:40.090> by

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
together i did have enough time by

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.360 
together i did have enough time by
didn't<00:05:40.540> know<00:05:40.600> i<00:05:40.630> had<00:05:40.660> to<00:05:40.810> die<00:05:40.990> and<00:05:41.230> man<00:05:41.920> I<00:05:42.130> was

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
got it but I didn't get it because you

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.140 
got it but I didn't get it because you
ought<00:05:48.130> to<00:05:48.220> have<00:05:48.310> died<00:05:48.490> and<00:05:48.640> i<00:05:48.670> probably<00:05:48.880> would

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
ought to have died and i probably would

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.640 
ought to have died and i probably would
have<00:05:49.210> because<00:05:49.540> you<00:05:49.660> know<00:05:49.780> a<00:05:49.960> good<00:05:50.350> thing<00:05:50.530> to

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
have because you know a good thing to

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.320 
have because you know a good thing to
remember<00:05:50.770> if<00:05:51.220> you<00:05:51.310> go<00:05:51.460> in<00:05:51.520> for<00:05:51.670> double<00:05:51.910> mobs<00:05:52.120> is

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
remember if you go in for double mobs is

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.270 
remember if you go in for double mobs is
that<00:05:52.570> it's<00:05:52.780> so<00:05:53.140> much<00:05:53.350> easier<00:05:53.380> to<00:05:53.740> get<00:05:53.920> a<00:05:53.980> more

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
that it's so much easier to get a more

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.950 
that it's so much easier to get a more
but<00:05:54.490> once<00:05:54.730> they've<00:05:54.940> been<00:05:54.970> worked<00:05:55.750> because

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
but once they've been worked because

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.270 
but once they've been worked because
think<00:05:56.320> about<00:05:56.380> it<00:05:56.620> they<00:05:56.710> don't<00:05:56.860> have<00:05:56.950> a<00:05:56.980> mini

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280
