00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.269
 to lay double gyproc doubling 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.070
 coating against an existing wall 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.400
 use the metal stud system and 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.669
 12.5 mm gyproc plates trace a 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.859
 trait on the ground on this one lives it's 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:22.230
 a profile and horizontal metal stud 50 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:28.050
 on the back of which you will have previously 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:31.309
 involved the soundtrack cut out 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.219
 to length a profile and vertical msv 50 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.890
 cuts and lots from one to 1.5 cm more 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.079
 short than the distance floor ceilings 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.030
 place and against the wall put the 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.489
 profile and vertical and plumb 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.190
 with a level is fixed the high wall 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.870
 every 80 cm process of the same 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.449
 way for the opposite wall 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.050
 to do this use ankles 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.050
 cloud abl 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.930
 then placed the profile and horizontal 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.030
 superior using a cord drawn at 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.400
 ceiling a line between the two profiles 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.850
 and vertical and set the profile and 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.990
 horizontal along the line drawn 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.870
 clip the profiles and verticals 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.880
 intermediates every 60 cm in the 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.740
 belt place them in the same 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.760
 direction 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.770
 unlike the parish gyproc to 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.200
 simple coating in case of double 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.790
 coating place the second profiler 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.759
 with the back facing the first 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.410
 profile and place the profiles so that 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.400
 the holes to pass the leads themselves 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.950
 located at the same height 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.200
 pay attention to this when 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.970
 cut out the profiles and make sure 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.509
 that their backs so with the openings 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.090
 is facing the opposite wall 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.950
 the east with ex lists seen that the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.410
 first layer of plaque will be asked 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.470
 the horizontal it will be better to 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.790
 screw the profiles msv 50 to the profile and 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.520
 a message 50 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.600
 you will avoid it moving during 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.600
 that you are aiming the plates 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.770
 we 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.340
 at 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.860
 if you place isolated dubbing against 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.770
 an outside wall nonne isolated plan 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.570
 also a strip of glass wool isover 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.200
 behind the profiles and place a bumper 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.360
 steam in this terraced house a 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.270
 single layer of insulation will suffice to 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.040
 improve sound insulation 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.530
 cut the strips of glass wool to 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.750
 the right width using a latte and 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.640
 of a painter's knife 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.740
 for the first layer start 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.330
 always from the bottom place the first 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.570
 plate horizontally and levels 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.850
 in the lower left corner life it's 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.900
 there to the profile and msv 50 with davis gyproc 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.440
 be sure to always screw the plate 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.560
 correctly in the center of the profile place 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.300
 and now the rest of the plates 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.060
 mount the always staggered by 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.710
 report to the previous revenge 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.890
 plan any cloudy fields 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.420
 that a rap start each row with 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.730
 the remaining plate section of the 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.140
 previous row and continue well 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.140
 for the whole parish 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.550
 now apply the second layer 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.620
 of plates 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.160
 place them vertically on the first 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.680
 layer ensure that the plates be 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.220
 about 1 cm shorter than the distance 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.220
 ceiling floors 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.209
 planing any cloudy fields a 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.069
 grater push the plate up to the ceiling 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.159
 using the lever until it 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.599
 forms a gap of 1 cm with the ground and 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:04.090
 that they correspond perfectly to 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.459
 ceiling always start with a 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.099
 end of walls and proceed from the same 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.980
 way for the rest of the parish live 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:15.010
 and the 12.5 mm plates with levis 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.780
 self- propelled gyproc always blocked 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.620
 the plates against the ceiling with a 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.810
 hold a gap of up to 25 cm 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.090
 between levis life it's always when 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.729
 quinconces and hold the plate firmly 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.160
 against the strain structure life it's 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.220
 always a minimum of 1 cm from the edge of the 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.180
 plate 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.789
 you have planned an electrical outlet 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.860
 in the parish life it is first the 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.350
 plate before making to saw 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.710
 bell the desired opening or you 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.860
 integrate the adapted plug opening to 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.229
 the cia wicket then pull the wiring 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.320
 through the wall is fixed taking 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.320
 electric
