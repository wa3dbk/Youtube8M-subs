00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.260
 Now welcome to a new unboxing of 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.500
 dotcom collector edition today as 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:22.760
 you can see we are going to show you the edition 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.060
 metallic iron man 3 as you have a 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.060
 image 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.810
 good as you can see the design differs 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.210
 enough of what is the cover of the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.930
 traditions have opted for 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.910
 use the ironman symbol 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.390
 that you have in your chest normally with 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.830
 the metallic colors in ocher reds 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.830
 brown more or less 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:59.240
 the bluray we have this time 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:02.090
 3d noises is not a combo 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.300
 so basically the one that I opted for the 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.360
 metallic edition is because in this case 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.850
 he liked obvious something different 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.730
 or else you prefer the theme of the editions 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.730
 metal we are going to open it 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.930
 and well it 's quite similar to the 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.230
 edition that came out of the avengers 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.670
 also exactly I think they were 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.060
 about these same dates of August of 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.810
 last year and although it may appear by 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.260
 the fictitious ones and by many images that 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.650
 this image had a light here hopefully 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.830
 but it's not just the decoration of the image 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:58.260
 way it comes with something highlighted here in 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.870
 the symbol in what the zones are 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.170
 in gray that 's more or less the 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.650
 creature and in what is the bezel what 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.280
 it's all the spine all the edge of the 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.660
 edition 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.140
 over here is the loin 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.140
 of the edition 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.650
 and behind has already opted for 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.140
 image of the traditions is flat no 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.900
 It has almost brightness is matte 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.210
 as well 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.510
 on this occasion 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.790
 the technical sheet as you can see in this 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.270
 occasion does not have stuck has like a 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.950
 kind of semi box 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.480
 that the truth is that it is quite comfortable 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.070
 it could be copied by all companies 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.930
 because it is very comfortable then to save 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.720
 and you do not have to bend the sheet or have 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.360
 to save somewhere else or throw it away 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.490
 nor similar things is worth enough 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.410
 well we like this topic a lot when 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.370
 they have to be with the technical sheets in 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.810
 the metallic editions 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.310
 and inside 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:04.060
 well, apart from the usual 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.480
 botched with licenses lately 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.180
 since 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:13.080
 marvel or disney that come to us without 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.720
 no ornament or any 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:20.340
 drawing or design or anything can not be 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:23.220
 nothing more regrettable than a disc of this 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.210
 good way apart from that as well as 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.120
 you can see if they leave us the reflections 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:34.250
 good the image of inside is with the 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:38.010
 study or the warehouse or the office of 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.990
 ironman with the different armors and 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.630
 the middle one that the truth is that it is a 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:46.140
 little weird they have chosen to put it on 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.820
 medium because the spine covers the image of 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.130
 character perhaps they should have chosen 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.230
 put it clearly on the side where 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.990
 is not the disc in this case that is 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.880
 it would look a lot better than in the center 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.680
 that as you can see you do not see 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.450
 Practically nothing 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.970
 nothing else as you can see this edition in 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.790
 italy with exactly the same can 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.280
 It seems that to come with the combo in 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.750
 bluray blu-ray 3d so you do not have to 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.840
 buy it separately as here in 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.579
 Spain but still not confirmed 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.400
 that the languages 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.240
 there in italy come in spanish 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.759
 to finish what we said before 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.770
 as a year ago came the movie 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.889
 the avengers so you can see that 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.430
 basically for an animal have repeated 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.259
 the formula of the metal theme is worth 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.740
 as you see in this occasion that we have 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:42.270
 here saved the leaf was not a kind 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.800
 of semi box as we said before 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:49.180
 discomforts and leaves 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:52.620
 the data sheet and the cover 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.620
 from last year 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.110
 On this occasion, he did come with a 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.110
 extra bluray 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.860
 also without decorating absolutely anything and 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.340
 the image as you can see then quite 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.139
 best 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.840
 chosen 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:14.020
 and designed even to be several 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.900
 characters that they had to show in that 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.310
 movie that in the case of ironman that 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.919
 also as you can see this image is 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.289
 much more clearer and you can see 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:27.949
 better the interior decoration than in the 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:29.330
 in the ironman we still like it still 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:31.370
 well despite the fact that we have put many 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.560
 We really like the design 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.900
 exterior that has been chosen for 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.930
 differentiate it from our editions but 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.080
 They could have done a little more in 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.090
 This time especially so 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:47.300
 costs the output metal edition that 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:51.050
 it's not exactly cheap 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.639
 nothing more we see in future videos of 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.789
 dotcom collector edition up 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.789
 then
