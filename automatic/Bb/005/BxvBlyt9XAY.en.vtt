00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:10.420
 Hello everyone, Sanya is with you again and today 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.700
 cook garlic baguette exists 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.950
 many versions of the origin of the package but neither 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.510
 one of them is not proven some 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.270
 believe that the baguette appeared thanks 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.470
 the construction of the Paris Metro 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.779
 he was built by a worker from different regions 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.910
 France and therefore between them often 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.440
 conflicts have arisen as each 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.070
 the builder had a knife for cutting 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.869
 of bread 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.420
 these conflicts sometimes ended 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.760
 sad and then the author of the metro project 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.999
 asked bakers to create such bread 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.679
 that could break your hands and 

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:40.960
 really baguette taken not to cut 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:43.780
 break so let's start cooking 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.789
 of our garlic baguette for that to us 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.769

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.120

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.969

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.830
 six little ones so get down to 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:08.170
 cooking we need to melt 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.300

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.810
 fresh greens that we chop and 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:22.450
 add to our mix and once again 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.450
 mix thoroughly 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.570
 and now cut the baguette along 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.700
 slightly open the notch to 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.860
 further put there the stuffing and 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.890
 now we have to fill baguette 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.220

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.750
 if you want your baguette to turn out 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.570
 moisten the baking paper with water 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.980
 wrap the baguette and put it in the oven 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.200

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.030
 crispy crust crispy on soft 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.220
 inside just put it on the baking sheet 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.050
