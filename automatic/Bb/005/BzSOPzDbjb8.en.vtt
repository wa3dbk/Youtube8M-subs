can I hadn't can don't know who to go
for<00:03:41.639> so<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:41.970> just<00:03:42.290> she<00:03:43.290> did<00:03:43.470> nothing<00:03:43.680> lots<00:03:44.220> of

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
for so I just she did nothing lots of

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.020 
for so I just she did nothing lots of
time<00:03:45.139> and<00:03:46.139> this<00:03:46.950> was<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.310> mistake<00:03:47.669> i<00:03:47.849> was

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
time and this was the mistake i was

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.509 
time and this was the mistake i was
mentioning<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:49.379> i<00:03:49.500> don't<00:03:49.739> know<00:03:49.799> why<00:03:50.040> i<00:03:50.069> run<00:03:50.400> up

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
mentioning and i don't know why i run up

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.490 
mentioning and i don't know why i run up
here<00:03:50.730> i<00:03:50.910> just<00:03:51.239> saw<00:03:51.359> the<00:03:51.419> opportunity<00:03:51.569> went<00:03:52.290> for

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
here i just saw the opportunity went for

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.400 
here i just saw the opportunity went for
it<00:03:52.590> but<00:03:52.859> i<00:03:53.599> can't<00:03:54.599> really<00:03:54.780> do<00:03:54.959> anything<00:03:55.169> from

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
it but i can't really do anything from

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.680 
it but i can't really do anything from
here<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.940> can't<00:03:56.940> really<00:03:57.060> run<00:03:57.329> back<00:03:57.510> either

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
here I can't really run back either

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.110 
here I can't really run back either
because<00:03:58.139> they<00:03:58.349> just<00:03:58.560> write<00:03:58.919> them<00:03:59.069> on<00:03:59.280> top<00:03:59.489> I'm

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
because they just write them on top I'm

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.780 
because they just write them on top I'm
so<00:04:00.870> if<00:04:01.080> I<00:04:01.230> just<00:04:01.409> run<00:04:01.860> back<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.129> get<00:04:02.370> me<00:04:02.459> shot<00:04:02.580> in

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
so if I just run back and get me shot in

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.030 
so if I just run back and get me shot in

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
you're not aim down sight so you can get

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.230 
you're not aim down sight so you can get
the<00:05:07.470> quick<00:05:07.710> shots<00:05:07.979> off<00:05:08.190> better<00:05:08.639> and<00:05:09.000> more

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
accurate than before and the one it

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.700 
accurate than before and the one it
cleanly<00:05:12.000> off<00:05:12.090> it<00:05:12.270> is<00:05:12.419> very<00:05:12.690> rewarding<00:05:13.110> i<00:05:13.530> would

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710

otherwise be able to shoot cover is very
this<00:06:09.150> is<00:06:09.300> a<00:06:09.330> very<00:06:09.629> important<00:06:10.169> tool<00:06:10.379> to<00:06:10.470> use

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
this is a very important tool to use

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.990 
this is a very important tool to use
yeah<00:06:11.580> so<00:06:11.849> now<00:06:11.970> we're<00:06:12.090> gonna<00:06:12.240> try<00:06:12.569> and<00:06:12.870> get<00:06:13.830> a<00:06:14.000> as

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
yeah so now we're gonna try and get a as

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.730 
yeah so now we're gonna try and get a as
I'm<00:06:15.270> a<00:06:15.360> teammate<00:06:15.690> sound<00:06:16.020> inside<00:06:16.319> on<00:06:16.500> the<00:06:16.590> right

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
I'm a teammate sound inside on the right

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.149 
I'm a teammate sound inside on the right
side<00:06:17.240> so<00:06:18.240> now<00:06:18.389> that<00:06:18.659> site<00:06:18.960> is<00:06:19.080> pretty<00:06:19.590> safe<00:06:19.860> so

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:20.159 
side so now that site is pretty safe so

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:22.430 
side so now that site is pretty safe so
I<00:06:20.220> try<00:06:20.460> to<00:06:20.490> just<00:06:20.669> focus<00:06:21.360> on<00:06:21.599> the<00:06:21.810> Left<00:06:22.110> down

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
I try to just focus on the Left down

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.640 
I try to just focus on the Left down
during<00:06:23.190> the<00:06:23.310> front<00:06:23.580> of<00:06:23.699> me<00:06:23.819> and<00:06:24.500> since<00:06:25.500> there

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
during the front of me and since there

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.710 
during the front of me and since there
was<00:06:25.800> no<00:06:25.830> enemies<00:06:26.250> just<00:06:26.759> right<00:06:27.210> in<00:06:27.330> front<00:06:27.479> of<00:06:27.599> me

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
was no enemies just right in front of me

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.300 
was no enemies just right in front of me
move<00:06:28.199> forward<00:06:28.830> to<00:06:28.979> next<00:06:29.490> cover<00:06:29.759> to<00:06:30.389> try<00:06:30.419> and

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
move forward to next cover to try and

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.860 
move forward to next cover to try and
get<00:06:32.310> as<00:06:32.460> far<00:06:32.490> as<00:06:32.789> the<00:06:33.030> map<00:06:33.180> as<00:06:33.360> possible

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
get as far as the map as possible

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.540 
get as far as the map as possible
because<00:06:34.080> it's<00:06:34.349> always<00:06:34.620> advantageous<00:06:34.919> to

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
because it's always advantageous to

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.640 
because it's always advantageous to
stand<00:06:35.909> in<00:06:36.060> front<00:06:36.210> of<00:06:36.389> the<00:06:36.539> position<00:06:36.960> rather

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
stand in front of the position rather

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.629 
stand in front of the position rather
than<00:06:37.830> behind<00:06:38.159> it<00:06:39.620> since<00:06:40.620> the<00:06:41.039> belly<00:06:41.280> enemy

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
than behind it since the belly enemy

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.159 
than behind it since the belly enemy
enemy<00:06:41.789> is<00:06:41.969> inside<00:06:42.389> that<00:06:42.599> trend<00:06:42.870> and<00:06:43.020> move

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.169 
enemy is inside that trend and move

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.680 
enemy is inside that trend and move
forward<00:06:43.379> here<00:06:43.650> on<00:06:43.830> the<00:06:43.949> right<00:06:44.129> side<00:06:44.659> like<00:06:45.659> I

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
forward here on the right side like I

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.360 
forward here on the right side like I
said<00:06:45.870> before<00:06:46.020> I'm<00:06:46.469> not<00:06:46.530> really<00:06:46.889> confident<00:06:47.250> in

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
said before I'm not really confident in

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.129 
said before I'm not really confident in

we again see very good use of the

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.670 
we again see very good use of the
mini-map<00:07:02.729> all<00:07:03.000> the<00:07:03.180> circuit<00:07:03.569> you<00:07:04.110> were<00:07:04.259> able

you'll be able to succeed a lot more and

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.660 
you'll be able to succeed a lot more and
that's<00:07:26.520> game

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:27.670 
that's game
