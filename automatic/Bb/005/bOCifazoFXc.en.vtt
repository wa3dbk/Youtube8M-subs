hockey stick and so you guys are one of
the<00:00:46.570> only<00:00:46.659> ones<00:00:46.929> using<00:00:47.170> this<00:00:47.769> specific<00:00:48.699> type

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
the only ones using this specific type

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.599 
the only ones using this specific type
of<00:00:49.050> carbon<00:00:50.050> we<00:00:50.800> believe<00:00:51.039> we're<00:00:51.159> the<00:00:51.249> only<00:00:51.370> one

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
of carbon we believe we're the only one

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.729 
of carbon we believe we're the only one
I<00:00:51.789> know<00:00:51.879> but<00:00:52.239> honestly<00:00:53.079> you<00:00:53.289> know<00:00:53.620> it's

joined right through down here in the
blade<00:01:27.880> okay<00:01:28.360> which<00:01:28.539> you<00:01:29.020> know<00:01:29.049> provides<00:01:29.469> the

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
blade okay which you know provides the

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.859 
blade okay which you know provides the
lowest<00:01:29.680> kick<00:01:30.009> point<00:01:30.250> really<00:01:30.430> possible<00:01:30.869> and

lowest kick point really possible and
then<00:01:32.020> our<00:01:32.469> carbon<00:01:33.119> really<00:01:34.119> is<00:01:34.210> where<00:01:34.359> the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
then our carbon really is where the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.450 
then our carbon really is where the
energy<00:01:34.689> transfers<00:01:35.109> comes<00:01:35.439> from<00:01:35.740> as<00:01:36.100> we<00:01:36.280> use

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
energy transfers comes from as we use

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.730 
energy transfers comes from as we use
what<00:01:36.880> we<00:01:36.939> call<00:01:37.030> biaxial<00:01:37.719> continuous<00:01:38.320> fiber

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
what we call biaxial continuous fiber

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.889 
what we call biaxial continuous fiber
technology<00:01:39.100> where<00:01:39.609> we<00:01:39.729> start<00:01:40.000> we<00:01:40.450> never<00:01:40.630> cut

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
technology where we start we never cut

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.289 
technology where we start we never cut
the<00:01:41.020> material<00:01:41.200> we<00:01:41.740> wrap<00:01:41.950> it<00:01:41.979> use<00:01:42.640> our<00:01:42.820> resin<00:01:43.210> to

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
the material we wrap it use our resin to

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.749 
the material we wrap it use our resin to
keep<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.659> thing<00:01:44.070> held<00:01:45.070> together<00:01:45.250> but<00:01:45.640> it

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
keep the thing held together but it

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.700 
keep the thing held together but it
