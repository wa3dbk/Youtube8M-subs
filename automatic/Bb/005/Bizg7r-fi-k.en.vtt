hello<00:00:00.420> fellow<00:00:00.900> beer<00:00:01.410> makers<00:00:01.800> and<00:00:02.159> hops

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
hello fellow beer makers and hops

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.760 
hello fellow beer makers and hops
growers<00:00:03.389> I<00:00:03.570> want<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:03.810> show<00:00:04.020> you<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.230> really

growers I want to show you a really

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.760 
growers I want to show you a really
super<00:00:05.339> simple<00:00:06.200> inexpensive<00:00:07.200> way<00:00:07.410> that<00:00:07.740> I

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
super simple inexpensive way that I

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.850 
super simple inexpensive way that I
developed<00:00:08.460> for<00:00:08.929> drying<00:00:09.929> hops<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.530> thought<00:00:10.740> you

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
developed for drying hops I thought you

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.830 
developed for drying hops I thought you
might<00:00:11.040> want<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.309> see<00:00:11.490> starts<00:00:12.330> out<00:00:12.480> with<00:00:12.630> just

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
might want to see starts out with just

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.930 
might want to see starts out with just
buying<00:00:13.080> this<00:00:13.320> wire<00:00:13.650> mesh<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:14.340> think<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.759> paid

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
buying this wire mesh I think I paid

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.820 
buying this wire mesh I think I paid
about<00:00:15.000> seven<00:00:15.900> or<00:00:15.990> eight<00:00:16.020> dollars<00:00:16.440> for<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.650> at

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
about seven or eight dollars for this at

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.890 
about seven or eight dollars for this at
a<00:00:16.890> hardware<00:00:17.100> store<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:17.970> but<00:00:18.720> one

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
a hardware store this is the but one

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.260 
a hardware store this is the but one
quarter<00:00:19.289> inch<00:00:19.470> mesh<00:00:19.859> size<00:00:20.130> which<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
quarter inch mesh size which is the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.779 
quarter inch mesh size which is the
right<00:00:21.449> size<00:00:21.720> for<00:00:22.039> being<00:00:23.039> able<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.250> allow<00:00:23.400> air

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
right size for being able to allow air

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.330 
right size for being able to allow air
to<00:00:23.820> flow<00:00:24.090> through<00:00:24.300> your<00:00:24.779> hops<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.410> at<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
to flow through your hops and at the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.890 
to flow through your hops and at the
same<00:00:26.490> time<00:00:26.730> not<00:00:26.939> allow<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.300> hops<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.750> come

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
same time not allow the hops to come

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.250 
same time not allow the hops to come
through<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.769> basically<00:00:29.460> took<00:00:29.779> this<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.050> I

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
through so I basically took this and I

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.690 
through so I basically took this and I
followed<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.710> made<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.040> into<00:00:32.309> kind<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.579> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
followed it made it into kind of a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.180 
followed it made it into kind of a
square<00:00:33.120> cage<00:00:33.570> an<00:00:33.809> open<00:00:34.110> top<00:00:34.320> cage<00:00:34.649> was<00:00:34.950> pretty

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
square cage an open top cage was pretty

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.360 
square cage an open top cage was pretty
easy<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.460> do<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:36.660> cage<00:00:36.899> took<00:00:37.200> me<00:00:37.350> maybe<00:00:37.590> 20

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
easy to do this cage took me maybe 20

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.470 
easy to do this cage took me maybe 20
minutes<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.790> make<00:00:38.820> we're<00:00:39.120> talking<00:00:39.450> very

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
minutes to make we're talking very

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.650 
minutes to make we're talking very
simple<00:00:40.050> here<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.530> just<00:00:40.890> folded<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.629> made<00:00:42.629> a

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
simple here I just folded it made a

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.740 
simple here I just folded it made a
frame<00:00:42.989> out<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.440> took<00:00:44.399> some<00:00:44.750> additional

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
frame out of it took some additional

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.930 
frame out of it took some additional
wire<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.440> use<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.980> tie<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.640> tie

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
wire and just use that to tie to tie

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.600 
wire and just use that to tie to tie
together<00:00:48.510> wherever<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.680> seams<00:00:49.950> were<00:00:50.219> so

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
together wherever the seams were so

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.880 
together wherever the seams were so
nothing<00:00:51.360> fancy<00:00:51.780> here<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.110> idea<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.469> make<00:00:52.770> it

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
nothing fancy here the idea is make it

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.490 
nothing fancy here the idea is make it
simple<00:00:53.280> make<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.940> inexpensive<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.870> yet<00:00:55.289> still

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
simple make it inexpensive and yet still

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.250 
simple make it inexpensive and yet still
effective<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.129> now<00:00:56.250> I've<00:00:56.370> got<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.930> box<00:00:57.930> I've

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
effective so now I've got this box I've

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.799 
effective so now I've got this box I've
made<00:00:58.500> open<00:00:58.920> top<00:00:59.160> box<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.850> hops<00:01:00.030> go<00:01:00.270> into<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
made open top box the hops go into and

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.660 
made open top box the hops go into and
you<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.859> got<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> lot<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.340> room<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.520> there

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
you can see I got a lot of room in there

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.520 
you can see I got a lot of room in there
but<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> probably<00:01:03.059> got<00:01:03.270> Oh<00:01:03.600> three<00:01:04.320> or<00:01:04.350> four

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
but I probably got Oh three or four

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.670 
but I probably got Oh three or four
pounds<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.189> damp<00:01:06.150> hops<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.810> there<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.590> want

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
pounds of damp hops in there that I want

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.310 
pounds of damp hops in there that I want
to<00:01:07.890> dry<00:01:08.100> out<00:01:08.390> so<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> next<00:01:09.659> question<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.140> how

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
to dry out so the next question is how

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.580 
to dry out so the next question is how
do<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:10.500> create<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.979> way<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> quickly<00:01:11.760> dry<00:01:12.150> those

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
do we create a way to quickly dry those

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.249 
do we create a way to quickly dry those
safely<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.850> way<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.150> can<00:01:15.270> manage<00:01:15.479> all

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
safely and in a way we can manage all

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.140 
safely and in a way we can manage all
I've<00:01:16.409> got<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:16.619> are<00:01:16.920> four<00:01:17.220> bricks<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.790> found<00:01:18.030> in

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
I've got here are four bricks I found in

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.690 
I've got here are four bricks I found in
the<00:01:18.210> yard<00:01:18.420> very<00:01:19.140> simple<00:01:19.590> very<00:01:19.860> inexpensive<00:01:20.549> I

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the yard very simple very inexpensive I

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.109 
the yard very simple very inexpensive I
laid<00:01:20.939> them<00:01:21.090> out<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.420> created<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.960> space<00:01:22.290> below

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
laid them out and created a space below

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.490 
laid them out and created a space below
below<00:01:24.119> my<00:01:24.390> cage<00:01:24.659> here<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.140> you'll<00:01:25.259> see<00:01:25.470> now

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
below my cage here and you'll see now

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.890 
below my cage here and you'll see now
that<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.070> want<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> create<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.820> drying<00:01:27.240> system

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
that I want to create the drying system

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.109 
that I want to create the drying system
that<00:01:28.439> will<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.650> used<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.159> help<00:01:29.369> dry<00:01:29.670> those<00:01:29.909> hops

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
that will be used to help dry those hops

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.960 
that will be used to help dry those hops
out<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.170> an<00:01:31.290> old<00:01:31.500> inexpensive<00:01:32.430> fan<00:01:32.729> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
out this is an old inexpensive fan that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.480 
out this is an old inexpensive fan that
we<00:01:33.150> had<00:01:33.360> back<00:01:33.689> from<00:01:34.079> well<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.130> think<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.340> came

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
we had back from well I think it came

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.310 
we had back from well I think it came
from<00:01:35.549> Kmart<00:01:36.119> many<00:01:36.360> years<00:01:36.600> ago<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.170> nice

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
from Kmart many years ago but the nice

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.660 
from Kmart many years ago but the nice
thing<00:01:37.500> about<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.860> fan<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.460> big

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
thing about this fan is it's a big

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.940 
thing about this fan is it's a big
surface<00:01:39.060> area<00:01:39.390> it's<00:01:39.990> got<00:01:40.200> different<00:01:40.619> speeds

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
surface area it's got different speeds

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.679 
surface area it's got different speeds
and<00:01:41.189> I'm<00:01:41.250> going<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.460> use<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.060> very<00:01:42.270> slow

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
and I'm going to use that on a very slow

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.270 
and I'm going to use that on a very slow
speed<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.110> want<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.380> dry<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.649> hops<00:01:44.040> out

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
speed I want to dry the hops out

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.609 
speed I want to dry the hops out
carefully<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.390> slowly<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.020> I've<00:01:46.140> taken<00:01:46.350> this

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
carefully and slowly so I've taken this

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.340 
carefully and slowly so I've taken this
fan<00:01:46.950> basically<00:01:47.490> laying<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.659> top<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
fan basically laying it on top of the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.160 
fan basically laying it on top of the
bricks<00:01:49.590> with<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.369> airflow<00:01:50.850> going<00:01:51.210> up<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.049> now

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
bricks with the airflow going up so now

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.440 
bricks with the airflow going up so now
I've<00:01:52.290> got<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> way<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> blow<00:01:53.159> air<00:01:53.460> through<00:01:54.119> that

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
I've got a way to blow air through that

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.770 
I've got a way to blow air through that
open<00:01:55.170> mesh<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.530> has<00:01:55.649> all<00:01:55.860> my<00:01:55.890> hop<00:01:56.159> settings<00:01:56.520> I

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
open mesh it has all my hop settings I

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.179 
open mesh it has all my hop settings I
also<00:01:57.780> want<00:01:58.079> some<00:01:58.229> heat<00:01:58.439> underneath<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:59.009> not

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
also want some heat underneath here not

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.039 
also want some heat underneath here not
a<00:01:59.219> high<00:01:59.549> heat<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.090> gentle<00:02:00.540> heat<00:02:00.719> something

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
a high heat but a gentle heat something

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.260 
a high heat but a gentle heat something
to<00:02:01.409> help<00:02:02.100> those<00:02:02.340> hops<00:02:02.520> dry<00:02:02.820> out<00:02:03.000> what<00:02:03.180> I'm

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
to help those hops dry out what I'm

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.959 
to help those hops dry out what I'm
using<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.049> these<00:02:04.280> arc<00:02:05.280> lights<00:02:05.670> that

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
using is one of these arc lights that

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.050 
using is one of these arc lights that
you<00:02:06.060> use<00:02:06.240> for<00:02:06.540> work<00:02:06.719> light<00:02:06.960> they<00:02:07.170> get<00:02:07.290> very<00:02:07.619> hot

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
you use for work light they get very hot

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.820 
you use for work light they get very hot
that<00:02:09.060> heat<00:02:09.330> can<00:02:09.539> be<00:02:09.599> used<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:10.110> our<00:02:10.140> advantage<00:02:10.259> I

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
that heat can be used to our advantage I

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.900 
that heat can be used to our advantage I
don't<00:02:11.009> want<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.190> point<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> light<00:02:11.730> at<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
don't want to point the light at the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.610 
don't want to point the light at the
hops<00:02:12.239> directly<00:02:12.720> but<00:02:12.870> I'm<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.050> position

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
hops directly but I'm a position

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.149 
hops directly but I'm a position
that<00:02:13.739> under<00:02:14.489> my<00:02:14.640> brick<00:02:15.890> scaffolding<00:02:16.890> here<00:02:17.069> if

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
that under my brick scaffolding here if

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.619 
that under my brick scaffolding here if
you<00:02:17.250> would<00:02:17.459> in<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.730> way<00:02:17.909> that<00:02:18.150> it's<00:02:18.299> going<00:02:18.540> to

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
you would in a way that it's going to

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.410 
you would in a way that it's going to
heat<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:20.220> bricks<00:02:20.430> below<00:02:20.760> here<00:02:21.060> add<00:02:21.330> some

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
heat the bricks below here add some

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.809 
heat the bricks below here add some
warmth<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.319> as<00:02:22.409> that<00:02:22.620> air<00:02:23.340> blows

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
warmth to it and as that air blows

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.430 
warmth to it and as that air blows
through<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:24.180> hops<00:02:24.480> it's<00:02:24.720> going<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:24.989> help<00:02:25.170> dry

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
through the hops it's going to help dry

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.720 
through the hops it's going to help dry
them<00:02:25.620> out<00:02:25.709> more<00:02:25.920> quickly<00:02:26.220> which<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.610> our

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
them out more quickly which is our

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.820 
them out more quickly which is our
objective<00:02:27.180> here<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.629> to<00:02:28.260> dry<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.530> hops

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
objective here to to dry the hops

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.339 
objective here to to dry the hops
relatively<00:02:29.790> quickly<00:02:30.060> but<00:02:30.329> not<00:02:30.390> over<00:02:30.900> dry<00:02:31.110> them

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
relatively quickly but not over dry them

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.860 
relatively quickly but not over dry them
and<00:02:31.500> not<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.310> burn<00:02:32.489> them<00:02:32.700> by<00:02:32.819> any<00:02:32.909> means<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.810> I

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
and not to burn them by any means so I

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.509 
and not to burn them by any means so I
want<00:02:34.049> a<00:02:34.079> gentle<00:02:34.379> heat<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:34.950> can<00:02:35.159> control

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
want a gentle heat that I can control

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.039 
want a gentle heat that I can control
this<00:02:35.760> seems<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.150> work<00:02:36.269> pretty<00:02:36.299> well<00:02:36.569> for<00:02:36.900> me

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
this seems to work pretty well for me

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.780 
this seems to work pretty well for me
once<00:02:37.709> again<00:02:37.829> I<00:02:37.920> had<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.190> sit<00:02:38.400> in<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.549> garage<00:02:38.760> so

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
once again I had to sit in the garage so

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.080 
once again I had to sit in the garage so
it<00:02:39.180> cost<00:02:39.420> was<00:02:39.629> nothing<00:02:40.879> so<00:02:41.879> I'm<00:02:41.940> going<00:02:42.060> to

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
it cost was nothing so I'm going to

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.569 
it cost was nothing so I'm going to
place<00:02:42.299> that<00:02:42.329> halogen<00:02:42.989> lamp<00:02:43.200> underneath<00:02:43.769> my

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
place that halogen lamp underneath my

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.300 
place that halogen lamp underneath my
brick<00:02:44.849> structure<00:02:45.329> here<00:02:45.629> and<00:02:45.859> then<00:02:46.859> on<00:02:46.980> top<00:02:47.190> of

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
brick structure here and then on top of

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.440 
brick structure here and then on top of
the<00:02:47.370> brick<00:02:47.549> structure<00:02:47.910> I'm<00:02:48.000> going<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.209> lay<00:02:48.299> my

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
the brick structure I'm going to lay my

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.360 
the brick structure I'm going to lay my
fan<00:02:49.069> blowing<00:02:50.069> upward<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:51.109> on<00:02:52.109> top<00:02:52.379> of<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.680> my

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
fan blowing upward and on top of that my

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.449 
fan blowing upward and on top of that my
basket<00:02:54.090> cage<00:02:54.299> with<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.540> hops<00:02:54.750> in<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.459> so

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
basket cage with the hops in it so

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.130 
basket cage with the hops in it so
here's<00:02:56.670> my<00:02:56.790> fan<00:02:57.090> pointing<00:02:57.480> upward<00:02:57.750> I've<00:02:57.959> got

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
here's my fan pointing upward I've got

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.660 
here's my fan pointing upward I've got
the<00:02:58.290> light<00:02:58.470> underneath<00:02:59.159> it<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.370> I've<00:02:59.459> pointed

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
the light underneath it and I've pointed

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.399 
the light underneath it and I've pointed
the<00:02:59.819> light<00:03:00.000> downward<00:03:00.599> instead<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.930> upward<00:03:01.049> I

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
the light downward instead of upward I

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:02.839 
the light downward instead of upward I
don't<00:03:01.560> want<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:01.769> have<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.190> light<00:03:02.400> exposure

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
don't want to have that light exposure

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.030 
don't want to have that light exposure
to<00:03:03.060> my<00:03:03.180> hops<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.720> really<00:03:04.290> want<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.530> for<00:03:04.829> heat

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
to my hops I really want that for heat

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.399 
to my hops I really want that for heat
you've<00:03:05.849> got<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.000> nice<00:03:06.209> sunny<00:03:06.510> dry<00:03:06.720> climate<00:03:07.319> you

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
you've got a nice sunny dry climate you

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.170 
you've got a nice sunny dry climate you
wouldn't<00:03:07.709> need<00:03:07.829> to<00:03:07.890> use<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.700> heater<00:03:08.909> at<00:03:09.060> all

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
wouldn't need to use the heater at all

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.319 
wouldn't need to use the heater at all
perhaps<00:03:09.890> good<00:03:10.890> sunshiny<00:03:11.400> space<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:12.000> would

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
perhaps good sunshiny space you would

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.729 
perhaps good sunshiny space you would
have<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.569> off<00:03:12.690> as<00:03:12.870> well<00:03:12.900> but<00:03:13.290> if<00:03:13.440> you<00:03:13.470> want<00:03:13.680> to

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
have it off as well but if you want to

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.140 
have it off as well but if you want to
run<00:03:13.859> overnight<00:03:14.099> of<00:03:14.459> course<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.849> you<00:03:14.909> want<00:03:15.060> to

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
run overnight of course and you want to

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.210 
run overnight of course and you want to
keep<00:03:15.299> that<00:03:15.540> heat<00:03:15.750> coming<00:03:16.170> that's<00:03:16.799> a<00:03:16.950> good<00:03:17.099> way

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
keep that heat coming that's a good way

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.159 
keep that heat coming that's a good way
to<00:03:17.250> do<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:18.389> here<00:03:18.599> it<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:18.810> down<00:03:18.959> below

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
to do that so here it is down below

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.520 
to do that so here it is down below
pointing<00:03:19.889> downward<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:21.019> I'll<00:03:22.019> put<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.349> hops

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
pointing downward and I'll put the hops

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.729 
pointing downward and I'll put the hops
basket<00:03:23.069> on<00:03:23.160> top<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.609> it<00:03:23.730> you'll<00:03:24.540> show<00:03:24.780> here<00:03:25.079> so

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
basket on top of it you'll show here so

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.849 
basket on top of it you'll show here so
here's<00:03:25.950> my<00:03:26.130> whole<00:03:26.370> hops<00:03:27.030> drying<00:03:27.510> mechanism

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
here's my whole hops drying mechanism

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.979 
here's my whole hops drying mechanism
I've<00:03:28.859> got<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.160> heat<00:03:29.340> light<00:03:29.639> below<00:03:30.000> I've<00:03:30.750> got<00:03:30.959> a

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
I've got the heat light below I've got a

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.250 
I've got the heat light below I've got a
fan<00:03:31.319> turned<00:03:32.190> gentle<00:03:32.639> speed<00:03:32.910> up<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.269> I've<00:03:34.079> got

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
fan turned gentle speed up and I've got

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.470 
fan turned gentle speed up and I've got
the<00:03:34.440> basket<00:03:34.859> above<00:03:35.099> open<00:03:35.549> up<00:03:35.669> like<00:03:35.849> this<00:03:35.879> with

my<00:03:36.599> hops<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:37.019> there<00:03:37.200> then<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.010> say<00:03:38.220> I've<00:03:38.310> had

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
my hops in there then I say I've had

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.680 
my hops in there then I say I've had
about<00:03:38.579> this<00:03:38.760> -<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.209> makes<00:03:39.359> it<00:03:39.480> very<00:03:39.569> easy

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690

and<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.090> rotate<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.810> hops<00:03:55.049> as<00:03:55.260> they're<00:03:55.440> drying

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
and to rotate the hops as they're drying

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.180 
and to rotate the hops as they're drying
out<00:03:55.919> and<00:03:56.579> I<00:03:56.790> found<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.180> takes<00:03:57.799> these<00:03:58.799> are<00:03:58.949> still

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
out and I found it takes these are still

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.890 
out and I found it takes these are still
damp<00:03:59.370> hops<00:03:59.669> here<00:03:59.849> I<00:03:59.910> picked<00:04:00.150> these<00:04:00.299> yesterday

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
damp hops here I picked these yesterday

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.390 
damp hops here I picked these yesterday
you<00:04:00.959> want<00:04:01.199> to<00:04:01.290> get<00:04:01.379> them<00:04:01.500> dry<00:04:01.739> just<00:04:01.799> as<00:04:02.129> quickly

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
you want to get them dry just as quickly

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.110 
you want to get them dry just as quickly
as<00:04:02.579> you<00:04:02.639> can<00:04:03.319> these<00:04:04.319> hops<00:04:04.650> here<00:04:05.040> would<00:04:05.639> take<00:04:05.879> I

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
as you can these hops here would take I

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.369 
as you can these hops here would take I
would<00:04:06.389> say<00:04:06.569> somewhere<00:04:06.780> in<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:06.989> neighborhood

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
would say somewhere in the neighborhood

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.759 
would say somewhere in the neighborhood
of<00:04:07.910> 12<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:09.269> 16<00:04:09.720> hours<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:10.290> get<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.590> point

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
of 12 to 16 hours to get to the point

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.800 
of 12 to 16 hours to get to the point
where<00:04:11.069> they<00:04:11.639> were<00:04:11.730> dry<00:04:12.030> enough<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.449> moisture

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
where they were dry enough the moisture

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.210 
where they were dry enough the moisture
content<00:04:12.989> was<00:04:13.440> low<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:13.829> I<00:04:13.859> wouldn't<00:04:14.069> worry

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
content was low and I wouldn't worry

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.430 
content was low and I wouldn't worry
about<00:04:14.370> storing<00:04:14.970> them<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.299> when<00:04:16.079> they're<00:04:16.199> dry

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
about storing them and when they're dry

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.830 
about storing them and when they're dry
from<00:04:16.709> here<00:04:16.919> then<00:04:17.130> I'm<00:04:17.250> going<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.720> put<00:04:18.720> them

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
from here then I'm going to put them

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.039 
from here then I'm going to put them
into<00:04:19.019> freezer<00:04:19.739> bags<00:04:20.010> there<00:04:20.549> I've<00:04:20.669> got<00:04:20.849> a<00:04:21.049> one

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
into freezer bags there I've got a one

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.320 
into freezer bags there I've got a one
of<00:04:22.140> these<00:04:22.229> food<00:04:22.530> bag<00:04:23.310> storage<00:04:23.849> systems<00:04:24.240> that

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
of these food bag storage systems that

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.029 
of these food bag storage systems that
evacuates<00:04:24.990> all<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:25.349> air<00:04:25.469> out<00:04:25.500> of<00:04:25.710> there<00:04:25.860> and

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
evacuates all the air out of there and

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.230 
evacuates all the air out of there and
then<00:04:26.130> seals<00:04:26.490> it<00:04:26.669> tight<00:04:26.880> and

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
then seals it tight and

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.409 
then seals it tight and
a moisture<00:04:28.169> and<00:04:28.289> oxygen<00:04:28.380> barrier<00:04:29.419> container

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
a moisture and oxygen barrier container

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.879 
a moisture and oxygen barrier container
and<00:04:30.690> then<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:30.810> put<00:04:31.020> those<00:04:31.199> into<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.620> freezer

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
and then I put those into the freezer

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.339 
and then I put those into the freezer
and<00:04:32.190> they<00:04:32.520> they<00:04:32.940> are<00:04:33.000> very<00:04:33.720> well<00:04:33.930> preserved

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
and they they are very well preserved

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.550 
and they they are very well preserved
for<00:04:35.310> a<00:04:35.550> good<00:04:36.210> year<00:04:36.509> or<00:04:36.660> more<00:04:36.840> that<00:04:37.139> I<00:04:37.169> can<00:04:37.319> still

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
for a good year or more that I can still

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.499 
for a good year or more that I can still
use<00:04:37.740> those<00:04:37.949> hops<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:38.550> have<00:04:39.150> very

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
use those hops and have very

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:40.790 
use those hops and have very
high-quality<00:04:39.720> hops<00:04:40.319> that<00:04:40.530> I've<00:04:40.590> grown
