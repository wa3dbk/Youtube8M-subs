I've got yes would you she'll blow dry
time<00:01:16.799> by<00:01:17.009> up<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.220> 50%<00:01:18.170> I'm<00:01:19.170> interested<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.770> this

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
time by up to 50% I'm interested in this

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.920 
time by up to 50% I'm interested in this
although<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.580> don't<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.119> lot<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.390> hair<00:01:21.750> it's

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
although I don't have a lot of hair it's

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.960 
although I don't have a lot of hair it's
quite<00:01:22.110> sure<00:01:22.350> my<00:01:22.560> hair<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.830> actually<00:01:22.979> quite<00:01:23.369> fit

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
there's a lot of it and so it does take

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.499 
there's a lot of it and so it does take
quite<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.310> long<00:01:26.430> time<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> blow-dry<00:01:26.939> my<00:01:27.090> hair<00:01:27.210> so

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
interested it says what it does reduces

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.640 
interested it says what it does reduces
friction<00:01:30.180> while<00:01:30.570> conditioning<00:01:31.200> lightly

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
friction while conditioning lightly

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.770 
friction while conditioning lightly
speeds<00:01:32.009> up<00:01:32.130> blow-dry<00:01:32.430> time<00:01:32.610> by<00:01:32.759> 50%<00:01:33.000> provides

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
speeds up blow-dry time by 50% provides

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.580 
speeds up blow-dry time by 50% provides
heat<00:01:34.020> protection<00:01:34.880> okay<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.540> actually<00:01:37.110> like

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
heat protection okay if I actually like

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.510 
heat protection okay if I actually like
this<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.070> something<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.460> would

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
this this is something I would

this this is something I would
potentially<00:01:39.030> buy<00:01:39.150> unfortunately<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.590> one

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.569 
thing I think that little booklet is
missing<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.049> price<00:01:43.549> because<00:01:44.549> normally

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
missing is the price because normally

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.609 
missing is the price because normally

full-size you generally gets that kind

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:54.480 
full-size you generally gets that kind
of<00:06:53.620> something<00:06:53.889> that<00:06:53.979> wouldn't<00:06:54.159> be<00:06:54.279> mega

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
of something that wouldn't be mega

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.429 
of something that wouldn't be mega
expensive<00:06:54.999> to<00:06:55.090> begin<00:06:55.180> with<00:06:55.479> I'd<00:06:55.900> rather<00:06:56.199> have

00:06:56.429 --> 00:06:56.439 
expensive to begin with I'd rather have

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:58.379 
expensive to begin with I'd rather have
luxury<00:06:57.340> samples<00:06:57.729> of<00:06:57.879> something<00:06:58.150> I<00:06:58.240> probably

00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:58.389 
luxury samples of something I probably

00:06:58.389 --> 00:06:59.850 
luxury samples of something I probably
could<00:06:58.779> afford<00:06:58.810> to<00:06:59.169> be<00:06:59.259> purchased<00:06:59.710> but

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
could afford to be purchased but

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.980 
could afford to be purchased but
wouldn't<00:07:00.550> want<00:07:00.789> to<00:07:00.849> buy<00:07:01.000> and<00:07:01.419> then<00:07:01.779> hate

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:01.990 
wouldn't want to buy and then hate

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.869 
wouldn't want to buy and then hate
because<00:07:02.349> it<00:07:02.529> may<00:07:02.620> be<00:07:02.650> costs<00:07:03.009> 15<00:07:03.430> or<00:07:03.550> 20<00:07:03.759> pounds

00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:03.879 
because it may be costs 15 or 20 pounds

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:05.999 
because it may be costs 15 or 20 pounds
I<00:07:04.330> grew<00:07:04.810> up<00:07:04.870> having<00:07:05.020> luxury<00:07:05.379> samples<00:07:05.740> of<00:07:05.830> those

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:06.009 
I grew up having luxury samples of those

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:07.679 
I grew up having luxury samples of those
because<00:07:06.520> I<00:07:06.610> really<00:07:06.819> might<00:07:06.969> go<00:07:07.240> and<00:07:07.300> purchase

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:07.689 
because I really might go and purchase

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:09.929 
because I really might go and purchase
them<00:07:07.870> then<00:07:08.379> a<00:07:08.650> false<00:07:08.889> heads<00:07:09.069> body<00:07:09.310> Molly<00:07:09.729> I'm

hopefully I will show you next month but
let<00:07:29.229> me<00:07:29.289> know<00:07:29.379> what<00:07:29.439> you<00:07:29.560> think<00:07:29.650> about<00:07:29.740> this

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 
let me know what you think about this

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:31.619 
let me know what you think about this
box<00:07:30.129> cuz<00:07:30.310> it's<00:07:30.430> kind<00:07:30.669> of<00:07:30.699> a<00:07:30.789> new<00:07:30.939> one<00:07:31.180> and<00:07:31.539> I

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:31.629 
box cuz it's kind of a new one and I

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:33.480 
box cuz it's kind of a new one and I
think<00:07:32.080> although<00:07:32.199> it<00:07:32.409> is<00:07:32.529> kind<00:07:33.250> of<00:07:33.310> traditional

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:33.490 
think although it is kind of traditional

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.339 
think although it is kind of traditional
in<00:07:33.879> the<00:07:33.969> format<00:07:34.330> it's<00:07:34.539> still<00:07:34.839> a<00:07:34.870> little<00:07:35.110> bit

00:07:35.339 --> 00:07:35.349 
in the format it's still a little bit

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:37.200 
in the format it's still a little bit
different<00:07:35.740> because<00:07:35.979> the<00:07:36.550> products<00:07:36.939> are<00:07:37.000> a<00:07:37.089> bit

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.210 
different because the products are a bit

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:38.939 
different because the products are a bit
different<00:07:37.389> the<00:07:37.719> sizes<00:07:38.139> of<00:07:38.289> samples<00:07:38.770> are<00:07:38.889> a

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:38.949 
different the sizes of samples are a

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:39.990 
different the sizes of samples are a
little<00:07:39.069> bit<00:07:39.219> different<00:07:39.490> and<00:07:39.550> I<00:07:39.610> think<00:07:39.669> they're

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 
little bit different and I think they're

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.999 
little bit different and I think they're
kind<00:07:40.180> of<00:07:40.379> they're<00:07:41.379> doing<00:07:41.620> a<00:07:41.710> little<00:07:41.860> bit

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:42.009 
kind of they're doing a little bit

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:44.100 
kind of they're doing a little bit
better<00:07:42.189> for<00:07:42.610> me<00:07:42.759> but<00:07:43.210> a<00:07:43.240> lot<00:07:43.419> of<00:07:43.449> years<00:07:43.659> long<00:07:43.810> so
