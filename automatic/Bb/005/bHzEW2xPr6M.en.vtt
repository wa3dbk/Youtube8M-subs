00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.389
 A video I promised you there.

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.580
 showing more or less what to the basics 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.439
 of the hats and this time the area goes from 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.449
 az and the first title in the order 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.930
 alphabetical here is the area 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.910
 so come on and I'll show you just the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.189
 polls lose more or less times 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.320
 the basics so you can protect yourself from 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.320
 beauty hat guys 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.000
 so come on, the first one left the area. 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.940
 is called orbi of illusion org delusion 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.440
 she attacks the ball that makes the owner in the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.649
 round trip 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.949
 the second to study and it is fox fire 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.260
 she creates three beasts that they will be 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.199
 as close to the third opponent 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.899
 Give is the charm that makes charm in the name 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.350
 she's charming but she's a charm and you're her 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.890
 The enemy is heading towards you in the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.729
 Slalom then is the way the area is very much 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.290
 demo 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.970
 You have to have the time that your team 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.710
 very mobile for you 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.900
 protect from area 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:22.890
 so come on give it more or less 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.950
 so you give what together with and active w 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.540
 this together with audi will do a damage 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.939
 and it is very high damage and in a short time 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.040
 this is the blush it should of the area 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.600
 so come on if you did not have much 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.619
 mobility, you'll end up more or less 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.619
 taking place as here 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.110
 infuriated the tav did not appear offered 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.100
 then I'll record in spektor mode on 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.380
 normal mode 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.850
 so this is what people like the most 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.000
 or less so you will have team management 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.520
 but only one that in any case 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.130
 one that will close you will end 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.719
 giving much less years and going to hit all 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.179
 You'll do a lot of damage. 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.940
 high on your opponent and recommend you 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.740
 use flash and ignatti to be able to do damage 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.160
 very tall in your relative 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.340
 so this is it guys are 1 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.900
 the bar girl showed basic of the area is 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.510
 show more or less 10 kilos to 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.050
 you know is what each one does the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.150
 area 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.470
 here many people do not know what it is 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.340
 but it's a charm 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.310
 the charm makes it save and morgana the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.780
 charm did this makes the opponent arrives 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.670
 it goes towards you only that isolated is 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.800
 We slowly ask for a move. 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.810
 asking him to slow down the movement 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.610
 movement asking for calmness and causes 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.120
 he goes towards you 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.860
 It is then to protect yourself from the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.510
 basically you get walking from a 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.330
 side to the other so the executive 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:03.480
 so they roses do not do that damage 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.700
 what she does is if you hit decided 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.020
 to support this process for 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.150
 so to protect yourself from the area is 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.830
 recommends using the urn of a 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.450
 motion asking if I'm using to 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.360
 Motion to ask for water in case I am 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.690
 with 399 municipalities you should not be 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.360
 seeing the screen all with nothing on 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.070
 semi screen maps in six kills anything 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.500
 because it left everything clean it gets more 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.460
 easy to show the 15 and the things they have 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.560
 in the ninth game 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.390
 so this is it people I showed here 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.990
 because sometimes they do and the next 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:40.950
 I'll show the runes 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.660
 so that's it, I forgot to talk 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.210
 that the area is a team that has a lot of 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.250
 mobility or to gain the laws 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.440
 very easy on account of health 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.970
 it has a lot of mobility using flash 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.190
 Can you still have more mobility? 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.040
 is a team that moves very easily 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.460
 the map or win a boat on the top is 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.570
 much is enough help your team to the 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.490
 have multiple diseases 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.970
 this damage I did there was without the ground 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.470
 giving a reasonably high and that is 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.470
 you get yourself before your opponent 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.300
 Can you do this one like you? 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.760
 will be able to open a very 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.650
 high on top of your opponent then this 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.620
 people when you recommend them when 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.200
 take light 16 of area and gum lime but it is 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.850
 impossible when you pull your law does not 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.310
 It was the crowd then let's go to the parties. 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.110
 of streets as he had promised 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.039
 for the staff if we come back here for 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:35.020
 part of the streets, right? 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:37.000
 so let's explain the runes 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.639
 talents from websites that are used 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.819
 Masters and women pellz to the area 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.970
 I like to use these urns here is at max 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:49.630
 which are the marks 8.5 interpretation 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.490
 magic totaling all the marks in the 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.669
 fifth essence movement speed 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.949
 totaling 4.5 moves requests 4.5 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:01.960
 per cent of asking movements is 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:07.389
 born margin and margin is not per level 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:12.280
 system sends the normal network and italics 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:15.630
 The power mind analyzes is the 11th p 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.940
 then it was this ruined it gets 8.5 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:23.880
 Magical Weapon 3.7 Generation of 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:30.219
 4.5 percent of bid and 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:31.630
 April 11, power in master's forget 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:37.060
 the talents 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:43.750
 I used this one from here 2028 that in the case here 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:47.500
 it is that it gives more en chico pm the reduc 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:50.199
 here more that exists here 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.020
 the flash that reduces the time to change does not 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:56.530
 It's recharge here so you can have more 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.840
 human and here to bear that bonus 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.270
 in the middle of the speed movement of the polls 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.550
 so this helps a lot by totaling 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.889
 six point five percent movements 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:11.110
 I asked for more movement speed 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.690
 guys on spells for the area is good 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.750
 use flash that flash and guinea haiti 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:19.479
 which is the arsonist because of the 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.180
 mobility area promise and 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:24.219
 to guarantee that there was no enemy 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.099
 so that was it folks this was a guide 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:29.469
 basic and daily does not guide 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:32.680
 We show how that works and assistance 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:34.690
 How basic is it there to be able? 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.599
 you fight an enemy or if you 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.609
 against an area and power to know 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:42.019
 defending herself as she 

00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:44.269
 Like you're going to play a ranking of pick up 

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:46.099
 a type that has more than one 

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:47.929
 otherwise mobility 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:49.759
 so that's it folks hope you 

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:51.769
 I liked the video clip I liked it 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:53.869

00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:55.969

 next video 

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:02.049
 went 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:20.370
 I believe that for me 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.370
