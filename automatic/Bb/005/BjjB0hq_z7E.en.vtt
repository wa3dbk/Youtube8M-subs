Russia one of the biggest of the year
and<00:02:29.690> that<00:02:30.109> is<00:02:30.350> probably<00:02:30.920> going<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.340> be<00:02:31.459> a

and that is probably going to be a

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.430 
and that is probably going to be a
positive<00:02:31.970> thing<00:02:32.329> when<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.840> casualties<00:02:33.410> are

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
positive thing when the casualties are

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.319 
positive thing when the casualties are
counted<00:02:34.010> because<00:02:34.160> that<00:02:34.489> means<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:34.940> course<00:02:35.180> in

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
counted because that means of course in

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.120 
counted because that means of course in
general<00:02:35.780> there<00:02:36.170> are<00:02:36.200> fewer<00:02:36.500> people<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:36.980> the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
general there are fewer people in the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.860
