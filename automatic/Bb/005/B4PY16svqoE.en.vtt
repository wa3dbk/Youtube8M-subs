00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 most organisms 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.850
 Multicellular eukaryotes reproduce 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.700
 by sexual means 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.730
 at the base of this type of reproduction 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.309
 there is the fertilization process by which 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.130
 the sex cells or gametes of two 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.740
 parents merge by joining theirs 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.609
 genetic contributions to form one 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.130
 new cell the zygote the cell so 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.710
 formed reproduces through the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.189
 mitosis to give rise to the organism 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.050
 adult because after fertilization it is 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.260
 zygote has the correct number of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.480
 Diploid chromosomes it is necessary that i 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.780
 gametes joining have both 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.040
 half of the necessary chromosomes accompany 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.590
 applauds 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.840
 this is why gametes are formed thanks to 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.020
 a special type of nuclear division 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.890
 which halves the number of chromosomes 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.129
 called meiosis in meiosis you have 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.640
 two successive nuclear divisions 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.960
 indicated as meiosis 1 and meiosis 2 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.309
 each of which is divided into 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.830
 four phases 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.140
 at the beginning of pro phase 1 the chromatin 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.020
 thickens and becomes visible i 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.090
 already duplicated chromosomes consisting of 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.119
 two chromates of identical 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.330
 according to a process known as synapse i 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.090
 homologous chromosomes appear bearing 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.010
 to the formation of so-called tetra structures 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.740
 of 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.530
 since each chromosome consists of 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.920
 two chromates of the pairing involves 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.560
 four chroma TV the formation of 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.260
 tetra allows the crossing over ie 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.290
 the exchange of portions of DNA between 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.780
 this homologous chromosomes causes the 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.030
 chromosome of maternal origin receives 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.570
 portions of the homologous chromosome of 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.970
 paternal origin and vice versa 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.040
 therefore crossing over is an important one 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.470
 recombination mechanism of the 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.030
 genetic material from the two 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.460
 parents 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.820
 at the end of the pro phase 1 the membrane 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.760
 nuclear dissolves and from each of the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.020
 two oil centers begin to form the 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.270
 spindle fibers in the middle phase 1 le 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.920
 pairs of homologous chromosomes yes 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.160
 line up along the equatorial plane 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.260
 of the cell once aligned 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.240
 correctly the pairs of chromosomes 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.880
 homologues separate during phase 1 i 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.300
 chromates of each chromosome remain 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.760
 joined together in phase 1 i 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.310
 chromosomes are pulled from the fibers of the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.340
 melted until it reaches the opposite poles 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.350
 of the cell 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.959
 each group of chromosomes now has a 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.660
 kit applauds because it contains half 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.090
 of starting chromosomes even if each 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.690
 chromosome is still formed by two 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.450
 moreover chrome thanks to the closing 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.610
 over these chromosomes can be 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.430
 different from those present in the 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.980
 cell of origin at the end of the cloth 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.320
 Phase 1 cells can enter 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.660
 inter phase reforming the membrane 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.800
 nuclear and expires the izs went i 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.010
 however, meiosis does not end chromosomes 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.010
 here 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.230
 each core still has twice as much 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.530
 of genetic material since i 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.510
 chromates of have not yet separated 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.500
 thus begins the second division 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.519
 media or meiosi two during the pro 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.130
 phase two 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.310
 similarly to pro phase 1, chromosomes 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.799
 be compacted again is the 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.440
 disappearance of the nuclear membrane and the 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.290
 spindle fiber formation during 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.090
 the middle phase two the pairs of chromates of 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.260
 they align themselves along the equatorial plane 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.389
 of each cell in phase ii iii 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.790
 chromates of separate at the level of 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.489
 mere center they emigrate towards the poles 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.680
 opposite of the two cells 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.639
 from this moment the chromates can 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.660
 be called chromosomes again 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:05.989
 during the phase two cloth 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.450
 the melt fibers disappear and a new one 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:11.269
 nuclear membrane is formed around 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.340
 each group of chromosomes with cyto 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:17.359
 dieresis is the separation of the two 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.489
 cells in four haploid cells i 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.950
 four nuclei are among them 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:26.080
 different due to the cross in government 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.080
 occurred during the pro phase
