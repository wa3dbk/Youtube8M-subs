00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.570
 Greetings my dear friends 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.810
 d coli i would like to talk about the christmas party 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.130
 it's a season when it fills us with pd 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.769
 emotion is saying feelings 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.199
 of joys excites you or 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.039
 admiration min we are 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.650
 happy that we are going to spend a few days with our families with our beings 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.589
 dear ones 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.699
 that we are going to base at home 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.259
 for one hundrerd 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.739
 I'm always 100 waiting for us to have fun 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.800
 but also 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.530
 wakes us a hundred in wakes up in us stress anxiety and 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.960
 panic 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.500
 and here some 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.590
 tips that I would like to give milk gives ros 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.480
 to be able to spend them better than these holidays 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.370
 in this age 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.080
 we devote a lot of time to kirk to look for no gifts 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.690
 those delegates soon 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.799
 who do more broadcasts for us 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.280
 what about others then what are we looking for p gifts that we like 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.280
 but we are also very safe sando 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.210
 please start gifts for what the world is unfair and that does not exist 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.930
 more important and simply that we have to do is find summit 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.600
 galÃ³n of our heart for each person that we want to make this gift 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.310
 in this way that this person will feel our good vibrations 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.600
 ourself for her 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.770
 our joy 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.770
 everything good that we are desiring this person 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.510
 I think it's much more important than finding a gift 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.300
 for all 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.840
 you also can not forget 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.960
 all meetings have some inter-fiction profile 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.519
 and that is normal because we are all human and this whole process must unite us 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:18.260
 you are a hand then you do not need to plan everything to the last detail 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:20.590
 nothing like that happens 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.939
 you are required to prepare a sauce 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:24.890
 okay 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.590
 wrong with quadrangular against some product 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.849
 nothing happens 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.699
 they do not understand nor a more important importance is to have a good time 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:37.200
 be together with 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.189
 cruises that loved ones 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.999
 read 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:42.749
 and nothing more 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.749
 enjoy it 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:51.869
 the flight in return all those Christmas gifts 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:54.509
 it's crazy 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:57.819
 and it is not necessary either 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.749
 there's a lot of work going on what 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:02.229
 we can 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:03.899
 leave it 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:07.360
 you do not have to try to try to make yourself state 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.149
 prepare a lot of food 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:11.079
 oo 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.649
 waste time for small things that the sling and endo will not be weird in mind 

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:18.369
 our work in life 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:20.940
 yes yes it explained is our work 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.920
 is to pass it 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.920
 best possible and enjoy 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:30.270
 neither 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.639
 you can forget that 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.929
 we are determined to songs 

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:38.759
 then we have to rest enough for us to have 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:40.639
 have more time 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.889
 and enjoy 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.109
 they have to try to find a corner 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.639
 where can you be calm relaxed for a while 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.209
 for example the military 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.569
 make plans for the future we are at the end of the year 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:01.339
 relax is the keyword in this era 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.189
 we do not know what is of all the work before all the work that has to do 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.309
 ask for help 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:15.619
 I did not say yes that stress conquers 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:17.829
 there are many people who 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.509
 with great pleasure 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.259
 I wanted to help you and can help you 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.809
 only here you have to go to them ask for help no more 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.960
 all this said 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.759
 I have to warn them 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.960

 important you can not forget 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.849
