00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.680 

rosacea<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.490> very<00:00:11.760> challenging<00:00:11.969> condition

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
rosacea is a very challenging condition

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.010 
rosacea is a very challenging condition
now<00:00:13.259> i<00:00:13.290> come<00:00:13.860> from<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.160> philosophy<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:15.020> most

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
now i come from the philosophy that most

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.230 
now i come from the philosophy that most
skin<00:00:16.349> conditions<00:00:16.950> are<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.340> reflection<00:00:17.790> of

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
skin conditions are a reflection of

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.670 
skin conditions are a reflection of
something<00:00:18.450> going<00:00:18.689> on<00:00:18.869> internally<00:00:19.290> and

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
something going on internally and

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.920 
something going on internally and
personally<00:00:20.550> my<00:00:20.730> belief<00:00:20.759> is<00:00:21.239> that<00:00:21.270> rosacea<00:00:21.779> is

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
personally my belief is that rosacea is

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.560 
personally my belief is that rosacea is
based<00:00:22.259> on<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.500> digestive<00:00:23.189> condition<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.939> not

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
based on a digestive condition and not

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.330 
based on a digestive condition and not
really<00:00:24.779> based<00:00:25.079> on<00:00:25.320> anything<00:00:25.559> in<00:00:25.919> the<00:00:26.040> skin

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
really based on anything in the skin

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.429 
really based on anything in the skin
itself<00:00:26.700> now<00:00:27.360> that<00:00:27.689> doesn't<00:00:27.899> mean<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.290> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
itself now that doesn't mean that the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.049 
itself now that doesn't mean that the
skin<00:00:28.649> is<00:00:28.770> not<00:00:28.890> struggling<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.669> there's

00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:30.059 
skin is not struggling and there's

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:32.690 
skin is not struggling and there's
absolutely<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.809> ton<00:00:31.290> of<00:00:31.500> inflammation<00:00:31.739> that

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
absolutely a ton of inflammation that

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.540 
absolutely a ton of inflammation that
goes<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> skin<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.469> fact<00:00:35.100> that

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
goes on in the skin in fact that

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.579 
goes on in the skin in fact that
inflammation<00:00:35.910> creates<00:00:36.600> all<00:00:36.870> kinds<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.410> havoc

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:37.589 
inflammation creates all kinds of havoc

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:40.639 
inflammation creates all kinds of havoc
for<00:00:38.280> example<00:00:38.699> some<00:00:39.000> people<00:00:39.329> develop<00:00:39.649> acne

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
for example some people develop acne

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.560 
for example some people develop acne
others<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.399> excessive<00:00:41.940> oil<00:00:42.120> production

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
others have excessive oil production

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.189 
others have excessive oil production
others<00:00:43.410> are<00:00:43.649> excessively<00:00:44.370> dry<00:00:44.960> but<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.109> the

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
others are excessively dry but for the

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.169 
others are excessively dry but for the
most<00:00:46.379> part<00:00:46.499> we're<00:00:47.190> all<00:00:47.339> struggling<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:48.089> the

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:48.179 
most part we're all struggling with the

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.169 
most part we're all struggling with the
same<00:00:48.210> issue<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.109> is<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.739> have

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
same issue and that is that we have

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.329 
same issue and that is that we have
prolonged<00:00:51.179> redness<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.899> skin<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.980> a

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
prolonged redness in the skin with a

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.139 
prolonged redness in the skin with a
propensity<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:55.309> likelihood<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.609> developing

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
propensity or a likelihood of developing

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.750 
propensity or a likelihood of developing
what<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.350> lay<00:00:58.620> person<00:00:58.800> might<00:00:59.159> call<00:00:59.370> broken

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
what a lay person might call broken

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.079 
what a lay person might call broken
capillaries<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.379> face<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.789> then

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
capillaries in the face and that then

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.320 
capillaries in the face and that then
leads<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.569> a<00:01:04.400> worsening<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.820> condition

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
leads to a worsening of the condition

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.630 
leads to a worsening of the condition
and<00:01:06.479> then<00:01:07.170> scar<00:01:07.650> tissue<00:01:07.890> develops<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.550> that

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
and then scar tissue develops and that

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.050 
and then scar tissue develops and that
scar<00:01:08.910> tissue<00:01:08.940> is<00:01:09.420> called<00:01:09.720> FEMA<00:01:10.400> so<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:12.030> our

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
scar tissue is called FEMA so with our

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.450 
scar tissue is called FEMA so with our
approach<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.540> rosacea<00:01:13.080> we<00:01:13.740> try<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.130> address

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
approach to rosacea we try to address

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.090 
approach to rosacea we try to address
all<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.880> these<00:01:15.240> issues<00:01:15.300> at<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> same<00:01:16.140> time<00:01:16.440> you

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
all of these issues at the same time you

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.130 
all of these issues at the same time you
see<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.910> condition<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.540> an<00:01:18.750> internal

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
see if the condition is an internal

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.950 
see if the condition is an internal
condition<00:01:19.620> and<00:01:19.800> we<00:01:20.490> are<00:01:20.700> treating<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.600> skin

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
condition and we are treating the skin

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.260 
condition and we are treating the skin
in<00:01:22.320> such<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> way<00:01:23.160> that<00:01:23.190> we<00:01:23.550> are<00:01:23.760> trying<00:01:24.150> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
in such a way that we are trying to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.960 
in such a way that we are trying to
restore<00:01:24.840> its<00:01:25.020> health<00:01:25.260> then<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.490> need<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.790> focus

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
restore its health then we need to focus

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.940 
restore its health then we need to focus
more<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.840> course<00:01:27.870> inflammation<00:01:28.650> which<00:01:28.830> a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
more on of course inflammation which a

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.500 
more on of course inflammation which a
lot<00:01:29.160> of<00:01:29.190> people<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.700> that's<00:01:29.940> that's<00:01:30.210> not<00:01:30.300> an

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
lot of people do that's that's not an

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.330 
lot of people do that's that's not an
unusual<00:01:30.690> approach<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.440> we<00:01:31.950> use<00:01:32.100> something

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
unusual approach and we use something

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.630 
unusual approach and we use something
called<00:01:32.580> willow<00:01:32.940> bark<00:01:33.210> extract<00:01:33.330> as<00:01:34.230> a<00:01:34.640> powerful

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
called willow bark extract as a powerful

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.030 
called willow bark extract as a powerful
anti-inflammatory<00:01:36.120> for<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> skin<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.530> we'll

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
anti-inflammatory for the skin and we'll

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.640 
anti-inflammatory for the skin and we'll
use<00:01:38.190> it<00:01:38.220> with<00:01:38.520> many<00:01:38.760> other<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.080> vedic<00:01:40.440> and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
use it with many other are you vedic and

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.650 
use it with many other are you vedic and
natural<00:01:41.100> herbs<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.640> order<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.300> create<00:01:42.540> a

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
natural herbs in order to create a

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.560 
natural herbs in order to create a
well-rounded<00:01:43.350> approach<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:44.190> the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
well-rounded approach to the

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.400 
well-rounded approach to the
anti-inflammatory<00:01:45.570> aspect<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.140> skin

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
anti-inflammatory aspect of the skin

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.630 
anti-inflammatory aspect of the skin
because<00:01:46.800> you<00:01:46.890> would<00:01:46.980> never<00:01:47.160> want<00:01:47.400> to<00:01:47.490> use<00:01:47.550> a

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
because you would never want to use a

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.040 
because you would never want to use a
steroid<00:01:48.120> on<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.300> skin<00:01:48.510> of<00:01:48.630> course<00:01:48.840> because

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
steroid on the skin of course because

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.350 
steroid on the skin of course because
that<00:01:49.200> will<00:01:49.350> thin<00:01:49.800> it<00:01:49.920> even<00:01:50.160> further<00:01:50.360> in

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
that will thin it even further in

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.300 
that will thin it even further in
addition<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.900> using<00:01:52.080> that<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.800> use<00:01:53.010> things

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
addition to using that we use things

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.920 
addition to using that we use things
that<00:01:53.520> actually<00:01:53.700> stimulate<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.750> production

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
that actually stimulate the production

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.920 
that actually stimulate the production
of<00:01:55.350> collagen<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.950> elastin<00:01:56.520> now<00:01:57.090> why<00:01:57.690> do<00:01:57.750> you

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
of collagen and elastin now why do you

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.960 
of collagen and elastin now why do you
need<00:01:58.080> collagen<00:01:58.470> and<00:01:58.620> elastin<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.790> as<00:01:59.940> I

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
need collagen and elastin because as I

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.960 
need collagen and elastin because as I
identified<00:02:00.690> when<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.980> rosacea<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.820> are

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
identified when you have rosacea you are

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.750 
identified when you have rosacea you are
progressively<00:02:03.660> thinning<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.680> skin<00:02:04.980> and<00:02:05.220> that

your epidermis it feeds your dermis and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.980 
your epidermis it feeds your dermis and
it<00:02:31.340> keeps<00:02:31.550> them<00:02:31.760> running<00:02:32.000> if<00:02:32.240> you<00:02:32.630> didn't<00:02:32.870> have

it keeps them running if you didn't have

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.510 
it keeps them running if you didn't have
substantial<00:02:33.620> blood<00:02:33.709> supply<00:02:33.980> on<00:02:34.040> your<00:02:34.220> skin

substantial blood supply on your skin
your<00:02:34.970> skin<00:02:35.150> would<00:02:35.420> thin<00:02:35.690> dramatically<00:02:36.350> and

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
your skin would thin dramatically and

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.580 
your skin would thin dramatically and
look<00:02:36.830> much<00:02:37.700> worse<00:02:37.730> than<00:02:38.209> it<00:02:38.300> actually<00:02:38.330> does<00:02:38.720> so

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
look much worse than it actually does so

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.370 
look much worse than it actually does so
that<00:02:39.860> blood<00:02:40.250> supply<00:02:40.430> is<00:02:40.670> important<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.450> what

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
that blood supply is important and what

that blood supply is important and what

these blood vessels on their faces they
look<00:02:46.130> at<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.430> as<00:02:46.550> if<00:02:46.730> it's<00:02:47.740> something<00:02:48.740> that's

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
look at it as if it's something that's

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.810 
look at it as if it's something that's
out<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.190> control<00:02:49.580> that<00:02:49.940> is<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:52.370> is<00:02:52.459> actually

out of control that is that is actually

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.360 
out of control that is that is actually
not<00:02:53.239> good<00:02:53.630> for<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:53.989> skin<00:02:54.140> when<00:02:54.500> in<00:02:54.620> fact<00:02:54.650> the

not good for the skin when in fact the

very stark reality and that is that the

dermis thins and reveals them you see as

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
rosacea are not a dermis which is the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.479 
rosacea are not a dermis which is the
second<00:03:08.360> layer<00:03:08.480> down<00:03:08.750> from<00:03:08.989> our<00:03:09.110> epidermis<00:03:09.709> in

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
second layer down from our epidermis in

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.880 
second layer down from our epidermis in
the<00:03:10.670> skin<00:03:11.000> continues<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.989> thin<00:03:12.230> on<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.530> rate<00:03:12.860> of

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
the skin continues to thin on a rate of

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.310 
the skin continues to thin on a rate of
about<00:03:13.100> one<00:03:13.280> percent<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:13.970> year<00:03:14.030> for<00:03:14.810> most<00:03:14.989> people

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
about one percent a year for most people

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.780 
about one percent a year for most people
for<00:03:15.530> rosacea<00:03:15.739> sufferers<00:03:15.950> it's<00:03:16.520> probably

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
for rosacea sufferers it's probably

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.150 
for rosacea sufferers it's probably
faster<00:03:17.000> than<00:03:17.420> that<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.470> as<00:03:18.650> our<00:03:18.800> dermis

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
faster than that and so as our dermis

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.270 
faster than that and so as our dermis
thins<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:20.209> continually<00:03:20.930> removes<00:03:21.500> tissue<00:03:21.799> that

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
thins it continually removes tissue that

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.430 
thins it continually removes tissue that
was<00:03:22.340> covering<00:03:23.000> our<00:03:23.450> blood<00:03:23.780> vessels<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.380> the

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
was covering our blood vessels and the

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.979 
was covering our blood vessels and the
thinner<00:03:25.340> Lee<00:03:25.580> gets<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.150> more<00:03:26.360> blood<00:03:26.600> vessels

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
thinner Lee gets the more blood vessels

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.800 
thinner Lee gets the more blood vessels
are<00:03:27.110> revealed<00:03:27.500> so<00:03:28.340> all<00:03:28.880> right<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.390> idea<00:03:29.720> is

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
are revealed so all right the idea is

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.170 
are revealed so all right the idea is
not<00:03:30.140> to<00:03:30.200> get<00:03:31.130> rid<00:03:31.370> of<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.610> blood<00:03:31.790> vessels

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
not to get rid of the blood vessels

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.789 
not to get rid of the blood vessels
because<00:03:32.480> again<00:03:32.810> those<00:03:33.019> are<00:03:33.049> what<00:03:33.320> feed<00:03:33.590> and

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
because again those are what feed and

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.440 
because again those are what feed and
keep<00:03:33.920> our<00:03:34.070> skin<00:03:34.280> healthy<00:03:34.640> but<00:03:35.120> rather<00:03:35.269> to

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
keep our skin healthy but rather to

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.660 
keep our skin healthy but rather to
recover<00:03:36.049> them<00:03:36.260> back<00:03:36.440> up<00:03:36.650> again<00:03:36.769> and<00:03:37.100> that's

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
recover them back up again and that's

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.759 
recover them back up again and that's
why<00:03:37.850> you<00:03:37.910> need<00:03:38.269> collagen<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:39.230> elastin

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
why you need collagen and elastin

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.740 
why you need collagen and elastin
stimulators<00:03:40.310> and<00:03:40.549> in<00:03:41.090> order<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.390> do<00:03:41.540> that<00:03:41.690> you

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
stimulators and in order to do that you

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.780 
stimulators and in order to do that you
need<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:42.140> stimulate<00:03:42.769> a<00:03:43.010> cell<00:03:43.280> in<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.549> skin

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
need to stimulate a cell in the skin

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.449 
need to stimulate a cell in the skin
called<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.150> fibroblast<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:45.200> we<00:03:45.829> do<00:03:46.010> this<00:03:46.220> with

called a fibroblast and we do this with
several<00:03:46.910> ingredients<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.660> you<00:03:47.810> can<00:03:48.110> turn<00:03:48.680> to

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
a serious concern for most people so we

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.150 
a serious concern for most people so we
try<00:04:23.870> to<00:04:23.930> address<00:04:24.260> scar<00:04:24.620> tissue<00:04:24.830> with<00:04:25.070> an

it's a wonderful ingredient for
increasing<00:04:31.760> something<00:04:32.120> called<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.420> macrophage

increasing something called a macrophage
which<00:04:33.650> is<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:33.860> scavenger<00:04:34.520> of<00:04:34.550> scar<00:04:34.850> tissue<00:04:34.880> in

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
which is a scavenger of scar tissue in

our skin of course the other component

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.410 
our skin of course the other component
is<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.060> anti<00:04:38.330> inflammatory<00:04:38.930> component<00:04:39.140> and

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
is the anti inflammatory component and

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.030 
is the anti inflammatory component and
the<00:04:41.420> final<00:04:41.810> component<00:04:42.350> which<00:04:42.530> i<00:04:42.680> think<00:04:42.740> is

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
the final component which i think is

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.680 
the final component which i think is
just<00:04:43.400> as<00:04:43.640> critical<00:04:43.820> as<00:04:44.120> all<00:04:44.300> of<00:04:44.450> them<00:04:44.570> is

just as critical as all of them is

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.320 
just as critical as all of them is

that we restore the barrier is through

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.890 
that we restore the barrier is through
this<00:05:19.310> liposome<00:05:19.760> delivery<00:05:20.330> system<00:05:20.660> that<00:05:20.780> we're

restore<00:05:24.320> the<00:05:24.440> barrier<00:05:24.740> and<00:05:24.980> then<00:05:25.280> of<00:05:25.400> course

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
restore the barrier and then of course

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.950 
restore the barrier and then of course
you<00:05:25.730> have<00:05:25.850> retinol<00:05:26.180> died<00:05:26.390> which<00:05:26.660> is<00:05:26.810> also

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
you have retinol died which is also

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.570 
you have retinol died which is also
proven<00:05:27.470> to<00:05:27.590> improve<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:28.040> symptoms<00:05:28.250> of

that our approach is quite unique well

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.150 
that our approach is quite unique well
it's<00:05:35.690> it's<00:05:35.870> an<00:05:36.050> all-encompassing<00:05:36.410> approach

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160
