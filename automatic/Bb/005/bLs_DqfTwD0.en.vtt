00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.740
 the one you see behind me 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.170
 it is a gesture of pure austro madness 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.330
 Italian actually more Italian than 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.690
 Austrian she is called ktm and is for 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.560
 this is Austrian crossbow but 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.939
 behind the project was from the altar then 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.680
 very Italian and from the beautiful country is one of 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.050
 those cars even if it's not brand new 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.439
 that I always want to try again e 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.980
 with us to really see how it goes today 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.469
 there's that guy at one of the most gamers 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.620
 known in Italy with the right passion 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.010
 or that for 4 or two games 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.290
 wheels 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.820
 hi all guys hi maurizio is 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.620
 ready for a day of sports 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.820
 science with that little orange racing car 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.820
 I'd say yes, I'm ready too 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.820
 here we go 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.120
 all 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.310
 the concept is all away via the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.870
 windscreen 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.760
 obviously the roof and if I can 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.110
 in fact to see that he has them but not there 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.800
 I succeed because he actually framed e 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.780
 also the steering wheel because it is a 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.700
 car to enjoy air driving 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.220
 to asphalt and everything you want 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.709
 you obviously looking for the 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.520
 lightness as with this carbon 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.620
 that you see black is in fact a tub a 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.050
 which all parts of the car are then 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.000
 hang up and you can get it 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.680
 a weight that but just over 700 kg 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.739
 not even really light for 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.690
 a car of this kind one of the goodies of 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.370
 this car is the mechanics the engine 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.340
 for a change it is the engine of the 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.530
 old tt the 2000 tfsi from 240 horses 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.480
 which then, however, tn have updated 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.610
 they got to have 300 of them then there are 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.860
 even the tender versions this is 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.610
 the first is that of 2008 when 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.520
 they launched it at the Geneva Motor Show 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.400
 also the change audi and above all the 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.470
 project setup is from the ara and is for 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.570
 this in my opinion the ktm remains 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.120
 however to drive even if maybe not 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.310
 knows all the thrust you would like a 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.600
 object so refined that it makes itself felt 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.380
 everything in the hands finger asks a 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:33.590
 foot and it is always an experience 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:37.549
 satisfying laugh to race says the screen 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.549
 and we like it ok 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:47.730
 ok we are in motion this is a real car 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.410
 racing 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.350
 so much so that the suspensions are 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.739
 pushrod exactly like on single-seaters 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.790
 and precisely on the cars that go on the track 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:05.500
 however the isport is also ready to go 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.590
 on the green road apart from the air is 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.540
 so if you take it and later 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.450
 having made two laps on the track 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.050
 you trust directly in the gate and in 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.810
 highway 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.049
 no one can tell you anything except yours 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.049
 consciousness 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.550
 as far as the price is concerned 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.490
 to say that it wasn't really and really isn't 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.040
 cheap lexbook kpm this model 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.150
 the original one was almost 60 thousand 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.890
 EUR 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.890
 in short, the price that a cayman has today 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.890
 porsche 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:56.360
 but concerns may concern about 

00:04:52.309 --> 00:05:00.459
 price just been unfair but that the 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:03.619
 behavior is magnificent e 

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:07.969
 very sensitive as a car and just aim 

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:11.929
 well the muzzle that she starts turning 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:14.439
 around the curve instead the curve of 

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:14.439
 turn them around 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.850
 no 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:28.320
 has not much the house is still missing 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.270
 quite careful when starting a 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.280
 traverse because a moment is laughing e 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.910
 the moment after 6 shot from the side that 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.910
 You did not want to 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.360
 obviously there is no control 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.199
 electronics are your electronics 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.860
 hands 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:06.860
 but you also have a little all the horn 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.900
 the change is that of the audi tt is 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.050
 unbelievable indeed it seems to be 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:55.110
 inside a car it has evolved to the maximum 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.200
 expression of driving change to six 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.200
 relationships 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.280
 it is a marvel
