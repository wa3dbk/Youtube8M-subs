review<00:00:06.670> on<00:00:07.000> a<00:00:07.660> really<00:00:08.230> nice<00:00:08.410> palette<00:00:09.100> that<00:00:09.280> I

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.340 
review on a really nice palette that I

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.500 
review on a really nice palette that I
got<00:00:09.580> from<00:00:09.700> Coastal<00:00:10.120> Scents

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.510 
got from Coastal Scents

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.630 
got from Coastal Scents
I<00:00:10.600> ordered<00:00:11.110> it<00:00:11.200> the<00:00:11.650> good<00:00:11.830> thing<00:00:12.040> about<00:00:12.100> it<00:00:12.430> it

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:12.640 
I ordered it the good thing about it it

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.250

took<00:00:12.880> me<00:00:13.000> four<00:00:13.240> days<00:00:13.269> but<00:00:13.570> I<00:00:13.660> think<00:00:13.690> it<00:00:13.960> usually

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
took me four days but I think it usually

took me four days but I think it usually
takes<00:00:14.530> three<00:00:14.800> because<00:00:15.599> one<00:00:16.599> of<00:00:16.660> the<00:00:16.779> dates<00:00:16.960> was

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
takes three because one of the dates was

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.430 
takes three because one of the dates was
in<00:00:17.349> between<00:00:17.650> was<00:00:17.860> Thanksgiving<00:00:18.640> so<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:20.199> great
