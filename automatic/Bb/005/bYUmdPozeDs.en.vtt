puff pastry crust didn't even need to
make<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:12.240> defrosted<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:12.929> right<00:00:13.139> out<00:00:13.290> of

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
make that just defrosted it right out of

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.189 
make that just defrosted it right out of
the<00:00:13.500> freezer<00:00:13.769> then<00:00:14.670> I've<00:00:14.820> cut<00:00:15.120> some<00:00:15.299> apples

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
the freezer then I've cut some apples

the freezer then I've cut some apples
and<00:00:16.379> cheese<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.920> know<00:00:16.980> it's<00:00:17.279> not<00:00:17.460> a

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
and cheese and I know it's not a

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.269 
and cheese and I know it's not a
conventional<00:00:17.880> quiche<00:00:18.510> filling<00:00:18.810> but<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
conventional quiche filling but that the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.880 
conventional quiche filling but that the
combination<00:00:20.939> really<00:00:21.150> does<00:00:21.449> work<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.990> if

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
combination really does work and if

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
remember how I was telling you about my

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.299 
remember how I was telling you about my
friend<00:00:42.809> who<00:00:42.899> thought<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.140> quiche<00:00:43.530> was<00:00:43.739> also

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
friend who thought that quiche was also

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.000 
friend who thought that quiche was also
difficult<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.789> do<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.930> not<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.770> only

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
difficult to do it's not and the only

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.520 
difficult to do it's not and the only
real<00:00:47.250> reason<00:00:47.760> why<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> say<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.870> because<00:00:48.930> I

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
real reason why I say that is because I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.350 
real reason why I say that is because I
read<00:00:49.770> Julia<00:00:50.129> Child's<00:00:50.460> kitchen<00:00:50.489> wisdom<00:00:51.180> and

read Julia Child's kitchen wisdom and
there's<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:51.930> simple<00:00:52.350> formula<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.890> need<00:00:53.039> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
there's one simple formula you need to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.580 
there's one simple formula you need to
know<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.730> make<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> great<00:00:54.239> quiche<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:55.379> is

because<00:01:11.250> I'm<00:01:11.369> gonna<00:01:11.490> start<00:01:11.880> with<00:01:12.030> 4<00:01:12.360> eggs<00:01:12.540> here

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:22.899 

well<00:01:20.969> you<00:01:21.119> mathematicians<00:01:21.899> will<00:01:22.140> know<00:01:22.350> that

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
well you mathematicians will know that

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.350 
well you mathematicians will know that
now<00:01:23.909> we're<00:01:24.090> going<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.539> filling<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.700> two

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
now we're going to be filling to the two

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.480 
now we're going to be filling to the two
cup<00:01:27.810> mark<00:01:28.439> half<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.310> cup<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:29.820> each<00:01:29.970> egg<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:32.340> I'm

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
cup mark half a cup for each egg and I'm

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.350 
cup mark half a cup for each egg and I'm
just<00:01:32.670> using<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.060> 1%<00:01:33.780> keep<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.939> nice<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:35.970> light

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
just using a 1% keep it nice and light

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.990 
just using a 1% keep it nice and light
so<00:01:36.659> much<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.079> holiday<00:01:37.500> fare<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.130> pretty

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
so much of the holiday fare is pretty

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.429 
so much of the holiday fare is pretty
heavy<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:41.329> it<00:01:42.329> works<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:42.720> fine<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.079> probably

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
heavy and it works just fine I probably

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.830 
heavy and it works just fine I probably
wouldn't<00:01:43.860> do<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.280> skim<00:01:44.759> with<00:01:45.630> nonfat

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
wouldn't do it with skim with nonfat

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.800 
wouldn't do it with skim with nonfat
milk<00:01:46.289> just<00:01:46.799> because<00:01:47.270> then<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.509> sometimes

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
milk just because then it can sometimes

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.749 
milk just because then it can sometimes
get<00:01:49.170> too<00:01:49.200> thin<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:49.890> honestly<00:01:50.399> with<00:01:50.610> this

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
get too thin but honestly with this

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.809 
get too thin but honestly with this
ratio<00:01:51.830> every<00:01:52.830> time<00:01:53.039> you're<00:01:53.369> gonna<00:01:53.429> get<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
ratio every time you're gonna get the

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.080 
ratio every time you're gonna get the
right<00:01:53.970> texture<00:01:54.360> when<00:01:54.599> it<00:01:54.720> cooks<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:56.670> because

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
right texture when it cooks and because

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.589 
right texture when it cooks and because
I've<00:01:57.209> got<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.509> Apple<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.890> cheese

00:01:59.589 --> 00:01:59.599 
I've got the Apple and the cheese

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:02.839 
I've got the Apple and the cheese
another<00:02:00.599> really<00:02:01.560> nice<00:02:01.709> flavoring<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.369> add<00:02:02.580> in

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:02.849 
another really nice flavoring to add in

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:04.580 
another really nice flavoring to add in
there<00:02:03.090> I'm<00:02:03.509> just<00:02:03.539> whisking<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.140> with<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.349> pork

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
there I'm just whisking it with the pork

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.109

for<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.720> then<00:02:22.620> all<00:02:22.859> I'm<00:02:23.010> going<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.220> do<00:02:23.459> is

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
for it and then all I'm going to do is

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.000 
for it and then all I'm going to do is
pour<00:02:24.209> these<00:02:24.420> right<00:02:24.690> in<00:02:24.870> there<00:02:25.079> and<00:02:25.319> then<00:02:25.890> I'm

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
pour these right in there and then I'm

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.360 
pour these right in there and then I'm
going<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.310> bake<00:02:26.519> it<00:02:26.549> at<00:02:26.880> 350<00:02:27.569> for<00:02:28.019> about<00:02:28.799> 30

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
going to bake it at 350 for about 30

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.309 
going to bake it at 350 for about 30
minutes

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.080 

and<00:02:33.620> it's<00:02:34.010> okay<00:02:34.310> if<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.519> goes<00:02:34.670> over<00:02:34.849> the<00:02:35.000> edge

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
and it's okay if it goes over the edge

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.449 
and it's okay if it goes over the edge
because<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.750> puff<00:02:35.930> pastry<00:02:35.959> as<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.950> does<00:02:37.129> will

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
because the puff pastry as it does will

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:44.319 
because the puff pastry as it does will
puff<00:02:37.700> up<00:02:37.819> around<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.329> okay<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:43.700> that's<00:02:43.879> it

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
puff up around it okay and that's it

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.530 
puff up around it okay and that's it
so<00:02:45.200> these<00:02:45.319> 24<00:02:46.129> see<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.519> wasn't<00:02:46.700> much<00:02:47.209> harder

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
so these 24 see that wasn't much harder

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.819
