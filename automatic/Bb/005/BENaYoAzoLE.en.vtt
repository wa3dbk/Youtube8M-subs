micronized<00:00:14.209> creatine<00:00:14.389> powder<00:00:15.230> and<00:00:15.740> now

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
micronized creatine powder and now

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.980 
micronized creatine powder and now
creatine<00:00:16.460> is<00:00:16.580> so<00:00:16.939> important<00:00:17.390> for<00:00:17.480> your<00:00:17.570> muscle

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
creatine is so important for your muscle

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.960 
creatine is so important for your muscle
building<00:00:18.259> process<00:00:18.470> because<00:00:19.040> it<00:00:19.520> really<00:00:19.790> does

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
building process because it really does

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.880 
building process because it really does
energize<00:00:20.509> the<00:00:20.750> muscle<00:00:21.110> cells<00:00:21.349> so<00:00:21.529> they<00:00:21.680> can

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
energize the muscle cells so they can

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.099 
energize the muscle cells so they can
work<00:00:22.550> harder<00:00:22.939> and<00:00:23.150> work<00:00:23.330> longer<00:00:23.869> so<00:00:24.050> you

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
work harder and work longer so you

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.769 
work harder and work longer so you
really<00:00:24.529> can<00:00:24.740> add<00:00:25.010> that<00:00:25.279> muscle<00:00:25.699> mass<00:00:25.880> yeah<00:00:26.330> the

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
really can add that muscle mass yeah the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.870 
really can add that muscle mass yeah the
way<00:00:26.930> that<00:00:26.960> it<00:00:27.199> does<00:00:27.350> that<00:00:27.619> you<00:00:27.769> know<00:00:27.880> pre-teens

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
way that it does that you know pre-teens

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.980 
way that it does that you know pre-teens
been<00:00:29.000> around<00:00:29.180> for<00:00:29.359> a<00:00:29.390> while<00:00:29.510> and<00:00:29.750> a<00:00:29.840> lot<00:00:29.960> of

been around for a while and a lot of
people<00:00:30.230> know<00:00:30.349> this<00:00:30.470> but<00:00:30.529> it<00:00:31.369> helps<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:31.789> supply

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
people know this but it helps to supply

people know this but it helps to supply
the<00:00:32.480> body<00:00:32.900> the<00:00:33.500> muscle<00:00:33.860> specifically<00:00:34.430> with

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
the body the muscle specifically with

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.580 
the body the muscle specifically with
sufficient<00:00:35.150> water<00:00:35.420> to<00:00:35.930> really<00:00:36.199> be<00:00:36.350> able<00:00:36.500> to

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
sufficient water to really be able to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.219 
sufficient water to really be able to
build<00:00:36.920> those<00:00:37.129> muscles<00:00:37.400> up<00:00:37.809> so<00:00:38.809> anybody<00:00:39.110> that

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:39.229 
build those muscles up so anybody that

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:40.869 
build those muscles up so anybody that
takes<00:00:39.500> creatine<00:00:40.010> you<00:00:40.129> got<00:00:40.250> to<00:00:40.339> make<00:00:40.430> sure<00:00:40.610> also

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
takes creatine you got to make sure also

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.610

that<00:00:41.059> you<00:00:41.269> are<00:00:41.360> drinking<00:00:41.780> plenty<00:00:42.320> of<00:00:42.500> water

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
that you are drinking plenty of water

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.219 
that you are drinking plenty of water
for<00:00:43.220> that<00:00:43.280> same<00:00:43.699> reason<00:00:43.960> something<00:00:44.960> really

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:45.229 
for that same reason something really

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:46.539 
for that same reason something really
interesting<00:00:45.470> about<00:00:45.830> optimum<00:00:46.430> nutrition

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:46.549 
interesting about optimum nutrition

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:49.750 
interesting about optimum nutrition
screen<00:00:47.420> powder<00:00:47.659> is<00:00:47.870> that<00:00:48.500> it<00:00:48.890> won't<00:00:49.250> cause<00:00:49.519> you

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
screen powder is that it won't cause you

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.060 
screen powder is that it won't cause you
to<00:00:49.940> bloat<00:00:50.330> or<00:00:50.540> have<00:00:51.080> a<00:00:51.110> water<00:00:51.350> retention<00:00:51.559> like

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
to bloat or have a water retention like

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.850 
to bloat or have a water retention like
a<00:00:52.250> lot<00:00:52.430> of<00:00:52.549> creatine<00:00:52.790> powders<00:00:53.239> will<00:00:53.860> another

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
a lot of creatine powders will another

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.289 
a lot of creatine powders will another
really<00:00:55.070> interesting<00:00:55.100> thing<00:00:55.580> is<00:00:55.760> that<00:00:55.970> it<00:00:56.119> is

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:56.299 
really interesting thing is that it is

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:57.939 
really interesting thing is that it is
the<00:00:56.449> micronized<00:00:56.960> creatine<00:00:57.199> powder<00:00:57.650> and

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
the micronized creatine powder and

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.649 
the micronized creatine powder and
really<00:00:58.309> what<00:00:58.400> that<00:00:58.549> means<00:00:58.760> is<00:00:58.940> that<00:00:59.180> it's<00:00:59.449> just

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
really what that means is that it's just

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.960 
really what that means is that it's just
very<00:01:00.019> refined<00:01:00.559> which<00:01:00.860> means<00:01:01.070> that<00:01:01.250> it<00:01:01.369> mixes

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
very refined which means that it mixes

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.060 
very refined which means that it mixes
well<00:01:02.210> if<00:01:02.839> anybody's<00:01:03.199> used<00:01:03.350> bad<00:01:03.589> creatine

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
well if anybody's used bad creatine

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.149 
well if anybody's used bad creatine
powder<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.489> doesn't<00:01:04.820> mix<00:01:04.939> well<00:01:05.150> it's<00:01:05.600> not<00:01:05.840> fun

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
powder the doesn't mix well it's not fun

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.530 
powder the doesn't mix well it's not fun
so<00:01:07.869> part<00:01:08.869> of<00:01:08.930> it<00:01:09.049> being<00:01:09.260> such<00:01:09.950> high<00:01:10.130> quality

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
so part of it being such high quality

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.290 
so part of it being such high quality
creatine<00:01:11.540> is<00:01:11.750> that<00:01:12.590> it's<00:01:13.400> almost<00:01:13.970> flavorless

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
creatine is that it's almost flavorless

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.090 
creatine is that it's almost flavorless
so<00:01:14.960> you<00:01:15.020> can<00:01:15.200> mix<00:01:15.380> it<00:01:15.470> with<00:01:15.530> really<00:01:15.770> whatever

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
so you can mix it with really whatever

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
so you can mix it with really whatever
you<00:01:16.220> want<00:01:16.400> so<00:01:16.550> if<00:01:16.610> you<00:01:16.640> want<00:01:16.790> to<00:01:16.850> mix<00:01:16.940> it<00:01:17.000> with

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
you want so if you want to mix it with

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.060 
you want so if you want to mix it with
something<00:01:17.270> high<00:01:17.540> calorie<00:01:17.960> or<00:01:18.140> low<00:01:18.620> calorie

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
something high calorie or low calorie

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.100 
something high calorie or low calorie
you<00:01:19.580> can<00:01:19.760> do<00:01:19.880> that<00:01:20.030> with<00:01:20.180> this<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.840> what<00:01:20.990> you

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
you can do that with this and what you

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.930 
you can do that with this and what you
get<00:01:21.260> with<00:01:21.380> this<00:01:21.500> is<00:01:21.680> just<00:01:21.890> straight<00:01:22.280> creatine

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
get with this is just straight creatine

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.580 
get with this is just straight creatine
monohydrate<00:01:23.240> 100<00:01:24.020> cent<00:01:24.200> creatine

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
monohydrate 100 cent creatine

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.620 
monohydrate 100 cent creatine
monohydrate<00:01:24.830> so<00:01:25.610> it<00:01:25.940> doesn't<00:01:26.270> have<00:01:26.390> any<00:01:26.540> of

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
monohydrate so it doesn't have any of

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.880 
monohydrate so it doesn't have any of
the<00:01:26.690> fillers<00:01:27.020> it<00:01:27.170> doesn't<00:01:27.410> have<00:01:27.530> any<00:01:27.680> it

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
the fillers it doesn't have any it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.260 
the fillers it doesn't have any it
doesn't<00:01:28.070> have<00:01:28.220> any<00:01:28.370> flavoring<00:01:28.910> it<00:01:29.030> doesn't

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
doesn't have any flavoring it doesn't

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.270 
doesn't have any flavoring it doesn't
have<00:01:29.360> anything<00:01:29.720> else<00:01:30.020> added<00:01:30.320> to<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:30.800> so<00:01:30.980> you

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
have anything else added to it so you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.550 
have anything else added to it so you
probably<00:01:31.640> do<00:01:31.760> want<00:01:31.940> to<00:01:32.000> mix<00:01:32.120> it<00:01:32.270> with<00:01:32.390> juice

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
probably do want to mix it with juice

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.649 
probably do want to mix it with juice
because<00:01:33.560> well<00:01:33.890> it's<00:01:34.330> almost<00:01:35.330> flavorless

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
because well it's almost flavorless

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.390 
because well it's almost flavorless
there<00:01:36.140> is<00:01:36.230> a<00:01:36.260> slight<00:01:36.500> flavor<00:01:36.800> and<00:01:37.190> juice

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
there is a slight flavor and juice

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.950 
there is a slight flavor and juice
really<00:01:37.580> makes<00:01:37.850> it<00:01:37.970> does<00:01:38.090> makes<00:01:38.659> it<00:01:38.720> go<00:01:38.810> down<00:01:38.900> a

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
really makes it does makes it go down a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.530 
really makes it does makes it go down a
lot<00:01:39.170> easier<00:01:39.440> and<00:01:39.980> now<00:01:40.790> with<00:01:40.970> this<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:41.240> are

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
lot easier and now with this you are

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.270 
lot easier and now with this you are
going<00:01:41.690> to<00:01:41.750> probably<00:01:41.930> want<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.380> do<00:01:42.740> a<00:01:42.770> loading

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
going to probably want to do a loading
