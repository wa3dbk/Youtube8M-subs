00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
that tells you is you need a little bit

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.660 
that tells you is you need a little bit
more<00:02:03.870> balance<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.680> compensate<00:02:05.340> for<00:02:05.550> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
more balance to compensate for the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.760 
more balance to compensate for the
recoil<00:02:06.120> and<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.390> manage<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.560> there<00:02:07.680> are<00:02:07.710> a

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
recoil and to manage it so there are a

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.710 
recoil and to manage it so there are a
couple<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.160> ways<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.340> do<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.700> one<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.539> get

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
couple of ways to do this one is to get

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.259 
couple of ways to do this one is to get
that<00:02:09.929> upper<00:02:10.259> body<00:02:10.440> weight<00:02:10.739> forward<00:02:11.129> all<00:02:12.120> right

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
that upper body weight forward all right

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.770 
that upper body weight forward all right
bend<00:02:12.690> at<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.870> knees<00:02:13.170> another<00:02:14.099> way<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.730> to

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
bend at the knees another way is to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.119 
bend at the knees another way is to
keeping<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.870> toes<00:02:16.110> pointed<00:02:16.709> towards<00:02:17.040> the

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
keeping the toes pointed towards the

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.059 
keeping the toes pointed towards the
target<00:02:17.400> kick<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.390> strong<00:02:19.170> side<00:02:19.470> foot<00:02:19.769> back

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
target kick that strong side foot back

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.070 
target kick that strong side foot back
just<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.519> bit<00:02:20.550> okay<00:02:21.239> but<00:02:21.420> it's<00:02:21.540> important<00:02:21.989> to

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
just a bit okay but it's important to

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.690 
just a bit okay but it's important to
keep<00:02:22.260> your<00:02:22.379> toes<00:02:22.739> pointed<00:02:22.769> towards<00:02:23.640> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
keep your toes pointed towards the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
towards the target let's try that again

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.540 
towards the target let's try that again
