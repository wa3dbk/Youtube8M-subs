yeah

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.179 

I<00:01:16.759> was<00:01:17.330> wondering<00:01:17.750> about<00:01:17.840> if<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.710> problem<00:01:19.100> was

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
I was wondering about if the problem was

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.109 
I was wondering about if the problem was
gonna<00:01:19.689> come

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
gonna come

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:42.819 
gonna come
yeah

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.160 

I'll<00:01:43.829> show<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.429> no<00:01:44.579> go

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.250 

so<00:01:48.890> it's<00:01:49.159> an<00:01:49.790> experimental<00:01:50.540> stage<00:01:50.750> is<00:01:50.990> still

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
so it's an experimental stage is still

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.210 
so it's an experimental stage is still
tight<00:01:51.560> now<00:01:52.400> budget<00:01:52.850> we<00:01:53.000> come

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
tight now budget we come

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
tight now budget we come
if<00:01:55.730> I<00:01:56.000> say<00:01:56.270> I<00:01:56.300> remote

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:15.220 

we<00:02:06.240> got<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> bunch<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.660> weeds<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:07.050> it

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:38.750 

luckily<00:02:15.800> for<00:02:16.129> the<00:02:16.310> fishing<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.790> on<00:02:16.970> it

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:47.780 

linkage<00:02:39.540> might<00:02:39.720> have<00:02:39.840> popped<00:02:39.990> off

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:03:01.350 

/<00:02:48.790> yeah<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:54.520> bring<00:02:54.730> your<00:02:54.849> servo<00:02:57.090> oh<00:02:58.650> yeah<00:03:00.360> she's

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
/ yeah to bring your servo oh yeah she's

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:12.900 
/ yeah to bring your servo oh yeah she's
bound<00:03:01.600> up

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.560 

that<00:03:13.510> cotterpin<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:15.220> ya<00:03:15.640> catch<00:03:16.150> and

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
that cotterpin that ya catch and

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.570 
that cotterpin that ya catch and
put<00:03:17.080> all<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.350> weeds<00:03:17.560> yeah<00:03:18.040> I'm<00:03:18.250> gonna<00:03:18.370> have<00:03:18.520> to

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
put all the weeds yeah I'm gonna have to

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:27.510 
put all the weeds yeah I'm gonna have to
solder<00:03:18.910> over<00:03:19.270> in<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.630> oil<00:03:25.890> let<00:03:26.890> me<00:03:27.250> know<00:03:27.310> you

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
solder over in the oil let me know you

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.340 
solder over in the oil let me know you
can<00:03:27.670> still<00:03:27.910> break<00:03:28.210> the<00:03:28.420> solder<00:03:28.690> after<00:03:29.230> you

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
can still break the solder after you

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.620 
can still break the solder after you
didn't<00:03:29.560> mean<00:03:32.640> that<00:03:33.640> servos<00:03:34.090> too<00:03:34.300> small<00:03:34.600> I

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
didn't mean that servos too small I

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.730 
didn't mean that servos too small I
think

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.470 

servo<00:03:41.740> might<00:03:41.950> have<00:03:42.100> got<00:03:42.460> too<00:03:42.610> hot<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:43.150> it<00:03:43.300> being

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
servo might have got too hot to it being

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:52.370 
servo might have got too hot to it being
right<00:03:43.750> right<00:03:44.200> there<00:03:44.410> eh

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.120 

so<00:03:53.380> I<00:03:53.410> think<00:03:53.500> I'm<00:03:53.650> gonna<00:03:53.740> have<00:03:53.890> to<00:03:53.980> get<00:03:54.100> a

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
so I think I'm gonna have to get a

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.720 
so I think I'm gonna have to get a
racing<00:03:54.340> prop<00:03:54.730> yeah<00:03:58.980> well<00:03:59.980> no<00:04:00.160> not<00:04:00.460> when<00:04:00.610> you

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
racing prop yeah well no not when you

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.160 
racing prop yeah well no not when you
get<00:04:00.820> the<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.930> frigging<00:04:02.440> yeah<00:04:03.930> once<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:05.020> get

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
get the the frigging yeah once you get

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.620 
get the the frigging yeah once you get
that<00:04:05.290> boat<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:06.430> far<00:04:06.730> cuz<00:04:07.000> yeah<00:04:07.120> I<00:04:07.150> knew<00:04:07.420> that

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
that boat so far cuz yeah I knew that

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:17.090 
that boat so far cuz yeah I knew that
this<00:04:07.750> was<00:04:07.960> gonna<00:04:08.020> create<00:04:08.410> a<00:04:08.470> break<00:04:08.770> right<00:04:09.070> yeah

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
the back they come down out of the

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.980 
the back they come down out of the
bottom<00:04:24.550> on<00:04:24.700> a<00:04:24.730> bit<00:04:24.970> of<00:04:25.000> an<00:04:25.150> angle<00:04:25.300> so<00:04:25.720> that

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
bottom on a bit of an angle so that

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.110 
bottom on a bit of an angle so that
they're<00:04:26.260> pushing<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:27.070> water<00:04:29.940> well<00:04:30.940> your

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
they're pushing the water well your

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.970 
they're pushing the water well your
shaft<00:04:31.330> is<00:04:31.570> already<00:04:31.930> your<00:04:32.200> motor<00:04:32.410> is<00:04:32.530> already

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
shaft is already your motor is already

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.770 
shaft is already your motor is already
on<00:04:33.100> an<00:04:33.220> angle<00:04:33.550> your<00:04:33.940> shaft<00:04:34.180> oh<00:04:34.360> just<00:04:34.540> have<00:04:34.660> to

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
on an angle your shaft oh just have to

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.430 
on an angle your shaft oh just have to
be<00:04:34.870> straight<00:04:35.140> instead<00:04:35.290> of<00:04:35.560> bent<00:04:37.290> you<00:04:38.290> know<00:04:38.410> I

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
be straight instead of bent you know I

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.330 
be straight instead of bent you know I
mean<00:04:39.660> yeah<00:04:40.660> and<00:04:40.930> then<00:04:41.320> that<00:04:41.530> also<00:04:41.710> when<00:04:42.160> you

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
mean yeah and then that also when you

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.250 
mean yeah and then that also when you
get<00:04:42.520> going<00:04:42.820> faster<00:04:43.210> it<00:04:43.330> also<00:04:43.510> pushes<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:44.110> nose

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
get going faster it also pushes the nose

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.050 
get going faster it also pushes the nose
down<00:04:44.530> so<00:04:44.590> you<00:04:44.860> plane<00:04:45.130> up<00:04:45.310> on<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.610> water<00:04:45.790> nice

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
down so you plane up on the water nice

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.490 
down so you plane up on the water nice
and<00:04:46.270> level<00:04:46.390> so<00:04:46.570> you're<00:04:46.690> not<00:04:46.780> going<00:04:46.990> wow<00:04:47.620> this

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.260 

is<00:04:53.500> pretty<00:04:53.740> good<00:04:53.860> first<00:04:54.100> first<00:04:54.970> run<00:04:57.270> it's

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
is pretty good first first run it's

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.820 
is pretty good first first run it's
still<00:04:58.510> floating<00:04:58.780> anyway<00:05:01.260> it<00:05:02.260> didn't<00:05:02.530> rip<00:05:02.680> the

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
still floating anyway it didn't rip the

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.230 
still floating anyway it didn't rip the
drive<00:05:03.070> shaft<00:05:03.340> over<00:05:03.580> to<00:05:03.700> the<00:05:03.790> bottom<00:05:04.060> of<00:05:04.180> the

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
drive shaft over to the bottom of the

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.480 
drive shaft over to the bottom of the
boat<00:05:04.419> and<00:05:04.540> sink<00:05:04.750> it<00:05:04.960> so<00:05:05.230> can<00:05:06.010> always<00:05:06.220> call<00:05:06.430> that

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
boat and sink it so can always call that

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.750 
boat and sink it so can always call that
