crazy<00:02:37.829> I<00:02:38.129> got<00:02:38.730> six<00:02:39.030> gala<00:02:39.719> wing<00:02:39.959> fans<00:02:40.290> and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
crazy I got six gala wing fans and

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.059 
crazy I got six gala wing fans and
they're<00:02:40.680> all<00:02:40.890> running<00:02:41.069> at<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> hundred<00:02:41.579> percent

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
they're all running at a hundred percent

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.520 
they're all running at a hundred percent
so<00:02:44.069> we'll<00:02:44.250> see<00:02:44.639> how<00:02:45.180> quiet<00:02:45.780> really<00:02:46.019> is<00:02:46.139> what's

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
so we'll see how quiet really is what's

00:02:46.530 --> 00:03:19.130 
so we'll see how quiet really is what's
the<00:02:46.799> difference<00:02:46.980> when<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.459> did<00:02:47.609> apply

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:27.260 

so<00:03:19.890> all<00:03:20.340> my<00:03:20.430> fans<00:03:20.640> are<00:03:20.819> 1%<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:24.050> two<00:03:26.090> three<00:03:27.090> and

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
so all my fans are 1% the two three and

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.790 
so all my fans are 1% the two three and
four<00:03:27.660> are<00:03:28.100> my<00:03:29.100> top<00:03:29.400> fans<00:03:29.730> up<00:03:29.940> on<00:03:30.060> top<00:03:30.209> here

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
four are my top fans up on top here

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.809 
four are my top fans up on top here
they're<00:03:31.800> all<00:03:31.920> so<00:03:32.190> they're<00:03:32.340> all<00:03:32.430> run<00:03:32.550> hundred

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
they're all so they're all run hundred

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.390 
they're all so they're all run hundred
percent<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.590> still<00:03:34.590> have<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.830> ones<00:03:35.040> on<00:03:35.280> the

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
percent I still have the ones on the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.580 
percent I still have the ones on the
cooler<00:03:35.820> hook<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.870> motherboard<00:03:37.110> just

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
cooler hook to the motherboard just

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.860 
cooler hook to the motherboard just
because<00:03:38.220> else<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:38.670> didn't<00:03:39.030> want<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.390> case

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
because else I didn't want the case

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.360 
because else I didn't want the case
Master<00:03:40.200> Pro<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.500> fail<00:03:40.830> or<00:03:41.010> something<00:03:41.280> like

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
Master Pro to fail or something like

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.020 
Master Pro to fail or something like
that<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.580> then<00:03:42.080> burn<00:03:43.080> out<00:03:43.200> my<00:03:43.290> cpu<00:03:43.709> okay<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:45.000> I

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
that and then burn out my cpu okay so I

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.790 
that and then burn out my cpu okay so I
kind<00:03:45.570> of<00:03:45.600> wanted<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.959> make<00:03:46.320> sure<00:03:46.350> seeing

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
kind of wanted to make sure seeing

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.010 
kind of wanted to make sure seeing
wasn't<00:03:47.760> going<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:47.940> fail<00:03:48.120> me<00:03:48.420> first<00:03:48.690> before

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
wasn't going to fail me first before

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.750 
wasn't going to fail me first before
hook<00:03:49.319> those<00:03:49.500> up<00:03:49.530> but<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.340> seems<00:03:50.459> like<00:03:50.580> it's

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
hook those up but it seems like it's

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.270 
hook those up but it seems like it's
doing<00:03:50.880> a<00:03:50.940> really<00:03:51.090> good<00:03:51.270> job<00:03:51.330> um<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:52.500> love<00:03:53.070> that
