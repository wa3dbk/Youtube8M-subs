half<00:00:05.640> what<00:00:06.270> have<00:00:06.390> you<00:00:06.480> got<00:00:06.660> well<00:00:07.590> you've

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
half what have you got well you've

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.830 
half what have you got well you've
managed<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.400> double<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.820> thickness<00:00:08.970> two

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
managed to double the thickness two

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.020 
managed to double the thickness two
letters<00:00:10.200> now<00:00:10.320> instead<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.620> one<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.100> you've

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
letters now instead of one and you've

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.540 
letters now instead of one and you've
got<00:00:12.210> one<00:00:12.360> fold<00:00:12.660> oh<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.769> by<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:13.980> way<00:00:14.190> we've

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:14.550 
got one fold oh and by the way we've

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.689 
got one fold oh and by the way we've
half<00:00:14.760> the<00:00:14.970> size<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.420> paper<00:00:16.400> now<00:00:17.400> let's<00:00:17.580> do

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
half the size of the paper now let's do

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:18.200 
half the size of the paper now let's do
it<00:00:17.730> again

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
it again

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.990 
it again
we've<00:00:19.020> made<00:00:19.199> two<00:00:19.380> folds<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.190> quadrupled<00:00:20.910> the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
we've made two folds and quadrupled the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.680 
we've made two folds and quadrupled the
thickness<00:00:21.390> we've<00:00:22.230> now<00:00:22.410> got<00:00:22.619> four<00:00:22.859> layers<00:00:23.130> and

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
thickness we've now got four layers and

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.170 
thickness we've now got four layers and
of<00:00:24.690> course<00:00:25.050> we've<00:00:25.529> half<00:00:25.770> the<00:00:25.949> size<00:00:26.130> again<00:00:26.310> so

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
of course we've half the size again so

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.790 
of course we've half the size again so
that<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.539> now<00:00:27.750> one-quarter<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
you reach this point now let's look for

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.179 
you reach this point now let's look for
a<00:01:04.019> pattern<00:01:04.229> between<00:01:04.499> the<00:01:04.679> number<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.979> layers

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
a pattern between the number of layers

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.269 
a pattern between the number of layers
and<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.789> number<00:01:06.029> of<00:01:06.119> poles<00:01:06.649> if<00:01:07.649> every<00:01:08.009> fold

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:08.279 
and the number of poles if every fold

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:10.219 
and the number of poles if every fold
doubles<00:01:08.819> the<00:01:08.939> number<00:01:08.969> of<00:01:09.209> layers<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.719> can

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
doubles the number of layers I can

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.050 
doubles the number of layers I can
relate<00:01:10.499> the<00:01:10.619> two<00:01:10.770> by<00:01:10.950> using<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.340> power<00:01:11.549> law<00:01:11.789> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
relate the two by using a power law a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.359 
relate the two by using a power law a
bit<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.109> investigation<00:01:13.829> shows<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
bit of investigation shows that the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.550 
bit of investigation shows that the
number<00:01:14.609> of<00:01:14.670> layers<00:01:14.999> is<00:01:15.569> equal<00:01:15.959> to<00:01:16.109> two<00:01:16.319> to<00:01:16.499> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
number of layers is equal to two to the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.760 
number of layers is equal to two to the
power<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:17.069> the<00:01:17.369> number<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.759> folds<00:01:18.209> and

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
power of the number of folds and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.440 
power of the number of folds and
incidentally<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.340> it's<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.549> reduction<00:01:20.819> in<00:01:21.149> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
incidentally so it's a reduction in the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.620 
incidentally so it's a reduction in the
upper<00:01:21.659> surface<00:01:21.840> area<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:24.060> number<00:01:24.179> of<00:01:24.389> folds

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
upper surface area the number of folds

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.019 
upper surface area the number of folds
follows<00:01:25.289> a<00:01:25.319> linear<00:01:25.529> progression<00:01:25.880> while<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:27.029 
follows a linear progression while the

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:29.059 
follows a linear progression while the
number<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.359> layers<00:01:27.599> allows<00:01:28.259> an<00:01:28.380> exponential

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
number of layers allows an exponential

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:30.940 
number of layers allows an exponential
progression

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
progression

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.669 
progression
now<00:01:31.950> let's<00:01:32.189> unfold<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.840> at<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:33.990> point<00:01:34.259> we

of folds equals the number of layers or

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.609 
of folds equals the number of layers or
here<00:01:41.969> to<00:01:42.599> the<00:01:42.810> power<00:01:43.020> two<00:01:43.289> equals<00:01:44.099> four<00:01:45.619> unfold

here to the power two equals four unfold
once<00:01:46.829> more<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:47.939> one<00:01:48.209> fold<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.659> two

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
two to the power one equals two now

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.359 
two to the power one equals two now
let's<00:01:56.159> go<00:01:56.310> back<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.760> more<00:01:56.970> step<00:02:00.799> here<00:02:01.799> we<00:02:02.220> have

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
let's go back one more step here we have

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.060 
let's go back one more step here we have
no<00:02:02.580> folds<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.180> one<00:02:03.330> layer<00:02:03.799> putting<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:04.890> into

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
no folds and one layer putting this into

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.950 
no folds and one layer putting this into
our<00:02:05.190> formula<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.880> two<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.420> power<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
our formula of two to the power of the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.330 
our formula of two to the power of the
number<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.259> folds<00:02:07.680> equals<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.039> number<00:02:08.160> of

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
number of folds equals the number of

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.479 
number of folds equals the number of
layers<00:02:08.610> we<00:02:09.330> get<00:02:09.600> 2<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.289> power<00:02:10.440> not<00:02:10.739> equals

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
layers we get 2 to the power not equals

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.600 
layers we get 2 to the power not equals
1<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.870> an<00:02:12.989> important<00:02:13.440> result<00:02:13.610> when

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
1 and this is an important result when

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.550 
1 and this is an important result when
you<00:02:14.760> raise<00:02:14.940> any<00:02:15.180> number<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.870> power<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.290> 0

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
you raise any number to the power of 0

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.470 
you raise any number to the power of 0
you<00:02:17.010> get<00:02:17.190> 1<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.870> definitely<00:02:18.870> not<00:02:19.080> 0
