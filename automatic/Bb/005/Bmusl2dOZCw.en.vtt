00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.740
 Darling I'm a professor at Harvard University case with something really 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.730
 The strangest way cheaper 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.719
 I will turn out to notice that all of the sudden or ads are these 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:10.700
 Adsense 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.819
 Adsense Google Adsense 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:16.829
 Uh ... for companies that can do investigations to see if someone has 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:20.730
 A criminal record now believed to be carrying in was strange because she thought 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.050
 Well, these advertisers went on the assumption 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.590
 But I have a criminal background 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.830
 So I decided to study your basis 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.270
 Whether or not their white names have the same results when it comes to 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.690
 Advertisements have more names if you know black or traditionally black 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.110
 The names have the same distant hot result that Google has been converting 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.260
 I also found saying: uh ... 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.610
 Otherwise white men are black and our means twenty-five percent are more likely to get 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.980
 This type of Sweeney ad contains evidence that black names are twenty-two 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.320
 Five percent more likely 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.750
 Can be realized with the related arrests that there is discrimination in the provision 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.480
 Of these ads is what she said 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.319
 This 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:01.430
 Super interesting 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.290
 You know we often talk about 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.320
 All the different defects that have wineries in this country 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.960
 For interviews yes you know it all up to achieve it but so 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.720
 And he approaches 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.260
 It should be addressed and for them to transcend this means that the word really is 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.000
 distance 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.770
 Do not even feel the head of a tree university 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.890
 I can say with my progress that it is uh ... even this is not for some 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.820
 The political objective of this issue and what is happening in the country 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.530
 So that you know you're making informed decisions and to consider this area 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.409
 You know what we talked about in foreclosures, and 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.309
 And all different loans in the student get to pay more targeted minorities 

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:41.610
 And more than bankers in court to get a loan to establish 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.860
 Now use in for starters from to actividades 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.070
 You're more likely to come up with ads 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.170
 Criminal related things It's just that she is madly escaping it's not a plot to cut 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.910
 I knew I did 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.190
 That contradicted Oh said do not want to know if there is less than every look 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.300
 Small eventually put him out of now to promote this is not how 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.829
 The d 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.759
 These ads are based on what people click on what people are most likely to click 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.309
 four 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.949
 When we do this research at once you guys are more details on how to 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:16.250
 I did the study because I think it is important 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.770
 Drowsily gather these directories by clicking more than 2,000 names 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.510
 He suggested that she would suggest a race 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.040
 For example for the same as the Keisha trade bombing they are now 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.949
 Uh ... the black landlord refers 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:32.639
 While names such as Brendan Laurie and today indicate the owner's wife entered Sweeney 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.279
 these 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:37.659
 As well as titles at Google.com 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:38.759
 They have returned 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:42.409
 Most appear to have compiled public records to specify black names however 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.189
 Turns out that the more inclined the white names are to generate Janet 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:47.719
 Generate ads 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.590
 Food arrests the word 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.430
 Well now after this happened of course people have been contacting Google to get 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.430
 Her response and she wants to know why this really happens is that 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.860
 The algorithm does not have something you do in Google AdSense 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.700
 Here's what their response was 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.970
 AdWords does not undertake any racial profiling 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.849
 We also have a policy against violence and that of states 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.499
 That we will not allow adverts ads against 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:14.790
 Person, organization or group of people 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.000
 It is up to individual advertisers to decide which keywords they want 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.349
 Use to trigger this business 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.619
 Indicating that advertisers are choosing 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:28.959
 Black names to put something on the addition of about arrests and criminal records 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:29.999
 Etc 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:32.060
 Uh ... they think it will work better 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.899
 But now look at this extravagant view you know 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.789
 I love to see their data to see what they come up with 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:40.699
 I do not prejudge that even okay 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.329
 What is the real world is the fact that these kinds of assumptions are as they are 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.509
 Archaeology 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.809
 Trevor Monday as an example of you Chuck is now what no matter what you think of 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:49.100
 the third place 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.520
 What happens axis 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.919
 For a black man or seventeen years of age, 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.439
 Lying dead on the floor 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:55.519
 They do not check 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.389
 Uh ... I mean, did you check his criminal record even though he died the guy who 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.489
 They shot him and shot him dead at the dead spot of Davis' criminal record 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.100
 Because what is black is assumed to be equal to a criminal arrest record 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.939
 Not black is not worth that 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.119
 And therefore 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:14.169
 We get what happened and for example in the travel market so let me ask 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.159
 A very inappropriate question 'cause I'm curious to see what you think as 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.389
 I know people in the Senate have been wondering 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.919
 If you know that you have these defects by naming your child 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.149
 Something she traditionally considered a black name 

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:28.229
 Said I was afraid 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.389
 Of doing so but I do not think the silly request was processed at that right 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.580
 I do not call for that I am just curious what everyone thinks it is through 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.310
 I would not place an example post if you know 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.210
 Well the Armenian sounding name will be an unfavorable situation when it comes to the job 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.379
 The labor market is right 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.199
 Uh ... I'm not in Lori's daughter 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.340
 Or like or t_v_ everything that is great 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.020
 Looks fine this is the thing uh ... Tribune camera system deal with 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.800
 For a very long time, for example Asian immigrants 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.509
 I decided to throw some coin you would not be crazy ministry my kids 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.709
 Yes especially those Steve really simple 

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:11.979
 Expect your song to be restrictive but strong enough to present to you from us 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.619
 Blue only Richard 

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:16.320
 Happily occasion ten days 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.860
 In the way with in the so-called Amercia do his pronunciation is kind of 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.030
 Put you in the right unfavorable 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.170
 He says confident companies are interested to create this error medically 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.460
 There is but uh ... I'm not regretting at all 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.270
 But if you are naked or about your career right 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.899
 Devices like about it 

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:36.929
 I meant yes 

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:38.370
 I would definitely like something about it 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.780
 I would be hated 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.620
 Mine 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.340
 My baby is nothing kidding with us your specific question after their name 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.780
 Another mobile media idon't know that records that 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.620
 Forget the effect of capacity in terms of 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.259
 Well downstairs 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.009
 Maybe you should answer 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:56.939
 Uh ... Between doing what you want 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:58.329
 Ah ... Sunday 

00:05:58.329 --> 00:05:59.750
 When people said no to the 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.229
 The 1950s are one of those consistent beginnings 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:07.289
 An insult to the financial community is actually about our fifty-year-old Jennifer 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:08.220
 So you know 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.610
 that is it 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.789
 I'm one of the need-to-do 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:14.629
 McDonald's moving with Hollywood with a children's name 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:17.360
 But then at the same time if someone or if they make it 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.599
 Black on the name 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:22.539
 I do not have any problem that none but there if you use everything 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.360
 Know what community we live in 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.799
 You take it with uh ... so face it can be prepared 

00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:31.349
 To counter it is only working in the area in mind when you are 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.649
 My label 

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:35.039
 What I started from another friend 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:37.479
 Black Court on Names 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:39.469
 But the mother ... the first of the north, these shall be 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:42.370
 But I do not go money but I think it looks like all that 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.979
 Most women like to whom boys you know 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:48.710
 But so far I think it was like we should be involved in wrestling with the girls with make 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.120
 The names of most of the boys with some unethical lions were in public places we should 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.319
 Adequate 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:56.209
 Issued and the old abbreviations such as 

00:06:56.209 --> 00:06:58.830
 You know the most aerial time on the right of confrontation 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.469
 Uh ... but this is not a random fluid problem so there is 

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:07.069
 Really Yahoo is a huge need of a couple that other detective 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:10.640
 But now is the third thing you know but I do not believe 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.639
 Trying Mel 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:15.199
 I will not go to work hard sell enough but do not think 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:18.319
 That I have not tried the changes you want to be if you really feel you and make what 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:19.749
 It's all you want to 

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:23.489
 So you just need to prepare them mentally for work 

00:07:23.489 --> 00:07:24.949
 You do not have to do this 

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:28.370
 The right example denotes Doan's act and they can be very successful at 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.580
 Weekend Low Brockman Weekend 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.110
 Because of any mitigation of success
