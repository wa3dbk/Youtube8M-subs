00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
acclimated to the outside temperature it

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.770 
acclimated to the outside temperature it
took<00:01:20.040> us<00:01:20.189> about<00:01:20.340> ten<00:01:20.700> minutes<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.570> this

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
took us about ten minutes to get this

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.280 
took us about ten minutes to get this
lens<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.320> 14-24<00:01:23.720> acclimated<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.900> outside

lens the 14-24 acclimated to the outside

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.690 
lens the 14-24 acclimated to the outside
here<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.740> could<00:01:25.830> start<00:01:26.040> shooting<00:01:26.400> video

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
here so we could start shooting video

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.450 
here so we could start shooting video
you<00:01:27.270> don't<00:01:27.659> want<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.290> wipe<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.710> lens<00:01:28.860> off<00:01:29.189> with

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
you don't want to wipe the lens off with

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.090 
you don't want to wipe the lens off with
a<00:01:29.490> lens<00:01:29.790> cloth<00:01:30.060> or<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> t-shirt<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:31.350> okay<00:01:31.829> that

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
a lens cloth or a t-shirt it's okay that

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.039 
a lens cloth or a t-shirt it's okay that
it's<00:01:32.130> fogging<00:01:32.520> up<00:01:32.820> that's<00:01:33.030> normal<00:01:33.659> it's

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
it's fogging up that's normal it's

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.960 
it's fogging up that's normal it's
getting<00:01:34.380> used<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.860> what's<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.640> outside

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
getting used to what's going on outside

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.270 
getting used to what's going on outside
so<00:01:36.869> what's<00:01:37.049> going<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.200> happen<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.710> over<00:01:38.009> time

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
so what's going to happen is over time

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.310 
so what's going to happen is over time
I'll<00:01:38.640> go<00:01:38.820> over<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.119> ten<00:01:39.329> minutes<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.020> fog

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
I'll go over that ten minutes the fog

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.929 
I'll go over that ten minutes the fog
and<00:01:40.650> condensation<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.310> going<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.490> wear<00:01:41.759> away

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
and condensation is going to wear away

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.030 
and condensation is going to wear away
go<00:01:42.450> away<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.049> you're<00:01:43.350> going<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.560> be<00:01:43.649> able<00:01:43.680> to

shoot<00:01:44.250> but<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.790> also<00:01:44.820> brings<00:01:45.240> up<00:01:45.479> something

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
shoot but that also brings up something

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.420
