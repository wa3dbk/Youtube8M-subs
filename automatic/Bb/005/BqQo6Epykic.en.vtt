this may give you some kicker from the
equity<00:03:42.280> side<00:03:42.459> but<00:03:42.730> will<00:03:42.880> not<00:03:43.060> put<00:03:43.269> your

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
equity side but will not put your

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.599 
equity side but will not put your
capital<00:03:43.870> at<00:03:43.989> risk<00:03:44.220> that's<00:03:45.220> what<00:03:45.400> you<00:03:45.459> should

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
capital at risk that's what you should

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.940 
capital at risk that's what you should
aim<00:03:45.760> at<00:03:45.970> because<00:03:46.269> this<00:03:46.540> is<00:03:46.660> your<00:03:46.950> first

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
aim at because this is your first

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.740 
aim at because this is your first
property<00:03:48.310> hence<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.299> need<00:03:49.389> to<00:03:49.480> be<00:03:49.540> really

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
reason for with you to do that which is

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.110 
reason for with you to do that which is
fine<00:04:02.230> but<00:04:02.950> you<00:04:03.010> should<00:04:03.160> not<00:04:03.370> stop<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:03.879> now<00:04:04.000> you

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.000 
fine but you should not stop it now you
can<00:04:04.239> reduce<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.750> amount<00:04:04.780> because<00:04:05.200> it's<00:04:05.829> not

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
can reduce the amount because it's not

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.470 
can reduce the amount because it's not
about<00:04:06.220> creating<00:04:06.639> wealth<00:04:06.849> it's<00:04:07.150> about

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
about creating wealth it's about

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.229 
about creating wealth it's about
creating<00:04:08.200> a<00:04:08.410> habit<00:04:08.889> of<00:04:09.040> saving<00:04:09.280> because<00:04:10.000> if

what<00:04:59.440> about<00:04:59.620> the<00:04:59.770> gold<00:05:00.010> that<00:05:00.520> you<00:05:00.699> wanted<00:05:01.000> to

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
what about the gold that you wanted to

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.290 
what about the gold that you wanted to
know<00:05:01.210> yeah<00:05:01.840> as<00:05:02.560> a<00:05:02.620> gold<00:05:03.400> as<00:05:03.550> an<00:05:03.669> asset<00:05:03.910> class<00:05:04.090> I

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
know yeah as a gold as an asset class I

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.480 
know yeah as a gold as an asset class I
think<00:05:04.360> because<00:05:04.870> you<00:05:05.289> your<00:05:05.680> patter<00:05:05.919> is<00:05:06.100> already

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
think because you your patter is already

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.610 
think because you your patter is already
full<00:05:06.789> and<00:05:06.970> gold<00:05:07.419> acts<00:05:07.690> more<00:05:08.139> as<00:05:08.260> a<00:05:08.289> hedge

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
full and gold acts more as a hedge

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.439 
full and gold acts more as a hedge
against<00:05:09.130> an<00:05:09.310> equity<00:05:09.669> asset<00:05:09.970> class<00:05:10.000> and<00:05:10.360> you

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 
against an equity asset class and you

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:11.550 
against an equity asset class and you
don't<00:05:10.630> have<00:05:10.750> too<00:05:10.840> much<00:05:10.960> of<00:05:11.020> an<00:05:11.229> equity

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
don't have too much of an equity

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.620 
don't have too much of an equity
exposure<00:05:11.860> right<00:05:12.100> now<00:05:12.430> so<00:05:13.060> currently<00:05:13.389> you<00:05:13.510> can

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
exposure right now so currently you can
