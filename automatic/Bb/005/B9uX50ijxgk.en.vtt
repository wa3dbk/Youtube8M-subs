anyway<00:02:41.200> wrong<00:02:41.410> here<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.400> were<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.510> hazard

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
anyway wrong here and I were the hazard

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.360 
anyway wrong here and I were the hazard
to<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.230> know<00:02:44.350> put<00:02:44.590> out<00:02:44.680> there<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.130> we're<00:02:45.280> not

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
to you know put out there that we're not

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.700 
to you know put out there that we're not
going<00:02:45.550> to<00:02:45.640> do<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:45.760> thing<00:02:46.240> again<00:02:46.270> and<00:02:46.780> will

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
going to do that thing again and will

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.900 
going to do that thing again and will
probably<00:02:48.040> be<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.250> little<00:02:48.400> bit<00:02:48.610> more<00:02:48.790> on<00:02:48.880> the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
probably be a little bit more on the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.730 
probably be a little bit more on the
ball<00:02:49.180> but<00:02:49.480> everything<00:02:50.110> that<00:02:50.260> possibly<00:02:50.650> could

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
ball but everything that possibly could

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.370 
ball but everything that possibly could
have<00:02:50.890> done<00:02:51.070> it<00:02:51.720> even<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:52.840> they<00:02:52.960> said<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.260> when

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
have done it even so they said that when
