00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 heroes of our cheap stefan schwab is 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.500
 today ready to answer the questions 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.730
 who ask about our facebook action 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.219
 came 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.500
 thanks for that and immediately start 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.790
 one of the first questions and that 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.560
 you always wanted to be at rapid 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.090
 play and as an additional question has so still 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.630
 Send what is sent 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.430
 favorite word yes so at rapid belief 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.019
 Like every young Austrian , they play it 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.430
 as I said the biggest association with the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.619
 biggest trailer and that makes of course 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.619
 fun to play in full stadiums and there 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.329
 you are exactly right with it 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.399
 and if my favorite place yes there 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.710
 Of course it is more in winter I am very 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.750
 like to be poor with me and in the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.430
 summer the south but of course vienna 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.590
 for me very nice city a movies 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.570
 very well 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.120
 michael dollar asks stefan what was yours 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.559
 so far the most beautiful moment at rapid 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.719
 yes I believe in costume and so for me 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.399
 personally was compensated in the derby against 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.890
 the austria away was certainly more 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.329
 very nice moment but otherwise like 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.800
 We always said that when I was full 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.570
 There is a lot going on in the stadium 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.510
 fun 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.180
 Fabian Haecki has a private question where 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.150
 as well as exactly who it is not 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.510
 but where is he in 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.150
 center in a slightly longer knee 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.140
 due from werner kovac now you are 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.000
 at rapid you could imagine 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.799
 to stay here longer and become one 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.270
 key figure like stefan hofmann too 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.159
 will you or can you imagine how 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.170
 many players leave again and that 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.640
 to unite with others is to try 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.080
 Of course now a difficult question too 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.299
 answer but i believe in 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.520
 Austria is better if you are 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.200
 can be at rapid 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.670
 and yes, if it is an Austria, it is 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.259
 very doll to be at rapid and thereby 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.630
 You can stay research longer 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.520
 But it really does come up 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.979
 sports development of it 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.240
 the transfer abroad or as far as the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.049
 Of course a goal of every boy 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.119
 footballer 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.909
 and there you have to see if the pastorat 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.439
 but as I said so there is a lot 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.079
 worse than long api to 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.020
 Swim a question from the julia raab 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.579
 with whom are you in belek in the room and with 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.520
 who is the funniest in the team? 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.259
 so in the team around christopher dibon the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.049
 leyen lang lang is that too now 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.629
 again fit in the room and the funniest 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.340
 a team is difficult too 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.440
 but i believe that they are for 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.190
 think that the tobias Knoof he laughs 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.660
 because one is then thank you very much for 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.019
 your time and everything will become one 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.019
 cheap
