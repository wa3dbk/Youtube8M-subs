00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.310

 what I decided to write went silently said 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.060
 something last 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.490
 about the fact that I loved another so ridiculous I 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.680
 wrote this letter to you as I am in summer 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.720
