Madonna about it and we get it you're
trying<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.320> seem<00:01:34.530> edgy<00:01:34.890> by<00:01:35.040> using<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.490> word

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
trying to seem edgy by using the word

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.850 
trying to seem edgy by using the word
bitch<00:01:35.939> over<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.689> over<00:01:36.900> really<00:01:37.500> doesn't<00:01:37.770> do

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860

you any good as I listened to this album
it<00:01:39.509> really<00:01:39.780> made<00:01:39.960> me<00:01:39.990> wonder<00:01:40.290> whether<00:01:40.439> she<00:01:40.710> was

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
it really made me wonder whether she was

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.020 
it really made me wonder whether she was
just<00:01:40.979> trying<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.220> prove<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.610> she<00:01:41.759> could<00:01:41.909> do

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
just trying to prove that she could do

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.240 
just trying to prove that she could do
any<00:01:42.270> music<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.869> any<00:01:43.079> style<00:01:43.409> regardless<00:01:44.100> of

any music of any style regardless of
whether<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.579> was<00:01:44.700> good<00:01:44.850> or<00:01:44.909> not<00:01:45.030> because<00:01:45.390> this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
whether it was good or not because this

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.780 
whether it was good or not because this
album<00:01:45.930> has<00:01:46.079> absolutely<00:01:46.740> no<00:01:47.189> flow<00:01:47.520> or

continuity whatsoever it's one of the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.830 
continuity whatsoever it's one of the
biggest<00:01:49.860> musical<00:01:50.460> identity<00:01:50.640> crisis<00:01:51.600> ever

biggest musical identity crisis ever
when<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.409> think<00:01:52.649> about<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.979> had<00:01:53.159> anybody

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
when you think about it had anybody

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.340 
when you think about it had anybody
other<00:01:53.880> than<00:01:54.090> Madonna<00:01:54.509> put<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.869> record<00:01:55.079> out

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350

your<00:02:25.569> past<00:02:25.810> hits<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.290> think<00:02:26.739> it's<00:02:26.920> safe<00:02:27.099> to<00:02:27.129> say

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
your past hits I think it's safe to say

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.800 
your past hits I think it's safe to say
that<00:02:27.459> your<00:02:27.760> career<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:28.180> over<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.659> it's<00:02:28.750> time

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
that your career is over and it's time

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.930 
that your career is over and it's time
to<00:02:29.080> just<00:02:29.290> do<00:02:29.470> greatest<00:02:29.920> hit<00:02:30.069> stores<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.760> my

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
to just do greatest hit stores and my

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.130 
to just do greatest hit stores and my
guess<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.269> there's<00:02:31.510> just<00:02:31.659> nobody<00:02:31.870> in

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
guess is there's just nobody in

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.809 
guess is there's just nobody in
Madonna's<00:02:32.379> creative<00:02:32.860> team<00:02:33.040> who<00:02:33.129> has<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.579> guts

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
Madonna's creative team who has the guts

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.309 
Madonna's creative team who has the guts
to<00:02:33.970> tell<00:02:34.209> her<00:02:34.329> when<00:02:34.480> something<00:02:34.870> doesn't<00:02:35.049> sound

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
to tell her when something doesn't sound

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.380 
to tell her when something doesn't sound
good<00:02:35.530> or<00:02:35.799> when<00:02:35.980> it's<00:02:36.129> outright<00:02:36.519> bad<00:02:36.819> I<00:02:37.120> mean<00:02:37.329> I

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
good or when it's outright bad I mean I

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.789 
good or when it's outright bad I mean I
hate<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:37.690> say<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:37.870> but<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.140> only<00:02:38.319> time<00:02:38.620> these

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
hate to say it but the only time these

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.800 
hate to say it but the only time these
songs<00:02:39.040> actually<00:02:39.280> sound<00:02:39.879> right<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.390> when<00:02:40.569> Nicki

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
songs actually sound right is when Nicki

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.600 
songs actually sound right is when Nicki
Minaj<00:02:41.200> drops<00:02:41.590> in<00:02:41.769> about<00:02:41.980> half<00:02:42.220> way<00:02:42.400> through

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610

Minaj drops in about half way through
the<00:02:42.730> record<00:02:43.090> Nicki<00:02:43.450> sound<00:02:43.780> fits<00:02:44.110> perfectly

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
the record Nicki sound fits perfectly

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.050 
the record Nicki sound fits perfectly
with<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.069> style<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.489> music<00:02:45.609> that<00:02:45.910> they've

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
with the style of music that they've

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.729 
with the style of music that they've
been<00:02:46.090> doing<00:02:46.510> that<00:02:46.599> entire<00:02:46.930> time<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.379> Madonna

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
been doing that entire time and Madonna

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.650 
been doing that entire time and Madonna
of<00:02:47.980> all<00:02:48.220> people<00:02:48.579> should<00:02:48.609> not<00:02:49.000> be<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.329> one<00:02:49.510> who

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
of all people should not be the one who

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.720 
of all people should not be the one who
sounds<00:02:49.900> awkward<00:02:50.230> on<00:02:50.530> her<00:02:50.650> own<00:02:50.829> record<00:02:51.099> but<00:02:51.579> she

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
sounds awkward on her own record but she

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.849 
sounds awkward on her own record but she
does<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.359> mean<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.660> just<00:02:52.810> sounds<00:02:53.230> so<00:02:53.410> forced

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
does I mean it just sounds so forced

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.710 
does I mean it just sounds so forced
