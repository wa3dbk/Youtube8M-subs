00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
spot in terms of fire rate is around 900

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.800 
spot in terms of fire rate is around 900
rounds<00:03:06.220> per<00:03:06.310> minute<00:03:06.489> when<00:03:07.180> using<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.510> slower

you'll<00:03:11.049> find<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.349> you<00:03:11.440> can<00:03:11.470> be<00:03:11.739> very

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
you'll find that you can be very

accurate<00:03:12.160> at<00:03:12.549> long<00:03:12.579> range<00:03:13.030> but<00:03:13.329> you<00:03:13.420> have<00:03:13.510> to

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
accurate at long range but you have to

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.330 
accurate at long range but you have to
long<00:03:13.900> for<00:03:14.230> that<00:03:14.319> slightly<00:03:14.739> faster<00:03:15.100> fire<00:03:15.310> rate

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.949

stop in on that rapid fire attachment

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.479 
stop in on that rapid fire attachment
just<00:04:20.260> to<00:04:20.409> play<00:04:20.590> around<00:04:20.620> with<00:04:20.890> it<00:04:21.039> for<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:21.250> game

attachments if anything I think I

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.680

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
changed that rapid fire attachment not

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.659 
changed that rapid fire attachment not
to<00:06:16.840> reduce<00:06:17.110> the<00:06:17.289> range<00:06:17.500> of<00:06:17.680> the<00:06:17.770> weapon<00:06:17.889> the

to reduce the range of the weapon the

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.189 
to reduce the range of the weapon the

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 
whole point of going with rapid fire is

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.170 
whole point of going with rapid fire is
to<00:06:20.380> increase<00:06:20.740> your<00:06:20.800> chances<00:06:21.460> in<00:06:21.610> close<00:06:21.880> range

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180

while really handicapping yourself for
long<00:06:24.729> range<00:06:24.910> encounters<00:06:25.630> I<00:06:25.780> think<00:06:26.440> the

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
long range encounters I think the

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.469 
long range encounters I think the
increased<00:06:26.860> recall<00:06:27.340> alone<00:06:27.669> on<00:06:27.910> the<00:06:28.000> scorpion

evo plus rapid fire would have been

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.250 
evo plus rapid fire would have been
enough<00:06:30.520> of<00:06:30.639> a<00:06:30.760> drawback<00:06:31.180> to<00:06:31.419> persuade<00:06:31.930> you<00:06:32.140> not

now that reduced range just makes it a
