00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.050

 You know whose friend is Mr. 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.340
 metronome and that of all the musicians and 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.579
 so you can measure the entries in what 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.820
 Singing moment is a very slow song 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:27.759

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.800
 I live to comb my hair 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.700

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.380

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.380

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:02.230

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.120

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.120

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.100

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.990
 That's wrong 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.640
 i love you 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.640
 hearts 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.620
 the legs 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.270
 if from the bottom 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.190
 also things without our hearts 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.549
 alive 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.600
 yes 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:07.989
 the joy and tenderness of the sun with its 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.939
 body behind your caravan like 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.959
 a whole star 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:18.160
 we hear you work hard you ignore 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:21.039
 to your teachers and dance like that and it does not matter 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.410
 but you try so if it 's what 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:27.340
 important is that you are learning and 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:31.710
 you are understanding it to me I like it 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.710
 it's a lot I like it, thank you very much 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.580
 you're making a lot of progress if you mess up and what 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.580
 you do well 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.599
 s 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:50.449
 is 6 years old and of course you have 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.669
 all the right to be a disaster 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:55.280
 also in the house and doing pranks and 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.319
 others but you get on stage and from 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.780
 true even though there was a problem 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:01.909
 with the musical bridge that you know well 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.610
 which was because you also said all the 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:06.650
 face so that we really gave ourselves 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.500
 realize that you were wrong and 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.699
 you came back very well to the square 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.220
 so I think it's all the metronome 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.789
 the subject has worked well enough 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.680
 it was my maximum for nothing in the least 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:20.710
 but I see that there are many other topics 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.620
 more with those that you can wear 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.599
 much more ok but what are you 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.560
 doing I'm really liking 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.560
 happiness 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.969
 to see is the little button that we like 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.969
 so much 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:38.189
 you know you had problems but very 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:40.489
 well today do not do that face what I 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:40.489
 is liking 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:51.110
 when cleaning the boat 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.800
 at the next concert and the lord 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.800
 colonel 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.490
 promise me that you will continue to be 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.490
 very much 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.940
 that already has 3 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.980
 and you know you won those few greens not 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.139
 only because he sings this incredible 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.360
 but because the exercise the metronome 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:18.100
 it's very difficult is a very inviting child 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.110
 to our jury to yes and then very 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.260
 fun this is the game of the 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:26.139
 metronome notice what I have 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:29.460
 and I brought it and I'm willing to play like that 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:31.860
 is that I ask you to go on stage 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.889
 the game consists of the following six 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.750
 they will have to do the same thing that they did 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:40.220
 put on and take off the sack to the rhythm of 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.220
 metronome we are ready 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:52.150
 I'm not going to move other 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:55.080
 and so much life 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.080
 I do not do it anymore 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:02.550
 life 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.600
 in English of the jury green buttons or 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.560
 red buttons 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.560
 Tell me 

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:30.090
