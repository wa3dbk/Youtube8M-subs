00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.270
 i 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.310
 Hello everyone and I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.770
 How to remove custom firmware from the 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.650
 3.55 that is to say of the people who have the 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.809
 play released and you do not want to have it 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.480
 released and want to be back 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.730
 original good the main thing here as 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.370
 you see good I have some application for 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.410
 here that 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.629
 ok the first thing you have to do is 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.510
 pick up and download the file that I will leave 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.269
 in the description that puts you were worth me 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.420
 it's an application worth the first thing 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:56.420
 that we have to install to erase the 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.570
 record of the play and for later 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.989
 fake it is worth it and what good 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.940
 no remain of the custom 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.830
 firmware let's say not for that when 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.780
 we are in original we are not detected 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.360
 Well, what you have to do is 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.509
 you are going to install packages file is installed 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.120
 jcel pkg vale is the erasmus this 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.790
 you see here 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.320
 it's like any other application worth 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.010
 this is before erasing anything you have to 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.780
 do this and good and you go into what 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.300
 what is the program we said with the 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.890
 balear application to see is that within 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.860
 IGNORE this is that it does 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.940
 you need to erase it or nothing simply 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.370
 delete all the applications that 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.610
 You have to be worth, right now I only have 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.500
 these two the ftp and the cedex that there 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.330
 down it's worth I only have two 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.430
 applications now but you yes 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.510
 you have 20 applications for the deletions 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.310
 all is worth 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.010
 you erase everything you have - he was 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.570
 similar is the eras you leave me because 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.270
 we have to use it and then what 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.100
 we will erase wrong you enter what is inside 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.100
 of the good program of the application is 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.840
 ok now you will see how good now 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.840
 I will enter 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.690
 and good once we are inside what 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.010
 you have to do is press the X 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.260
 ok the record will be cleaned or if or 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.300
 history let's say no of what is the 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.890
 console that record can not be deleted 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.830
 in no way can only be deleted 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.680
 with this it is worth and it is a way to 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.660
 prevent it is worth not to be detected 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.310
 when we have the original console 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.680
 not then the first thing we press the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.340
 X 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.890
 I think yes I think it redirects us just 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.719
 to the menu of the play is worth when we are 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.760
 here then that record will be clean 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:49.590
 ok but we can not leave it that way 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.719
 clean not because then neither do 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.670
 not then we go back in again 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:56.459
 in the application it is worth what is the 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.409
 erasmo and when we are inside this 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.560
 Once we're going to press the circle with the 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:04.019
 round is worth and what he will do will be 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.060
 to falsify what we said the record that 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.439
 we had before for example with some 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.549
 games that we have copied whatever or 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.379
 some programs like the multi man and 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.189
 all that leaves some remains 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:19.109
 then when we delete it if we leave it like this 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.819
 of clean would not notice too much 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.620
 not then for that is that 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.180
 fake is worth what good does 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.400
 we played other games and 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.230
 more things then now I would be 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.870
 perfect then what we have to 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.419
 do next, then erase the eras 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.150
 mino that would be the last one that would be and 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:38.669
 right now it would be what is the custom 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.200
 firmware is ok but it would be clean no longer 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.090
 there would be no application no game 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.750
 or nothing is worth just those 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.720
 two folders 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.550
 What we do is shut down 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.220
 and now we will go to enter the menu 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.740
 console recovery 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.050
 the first thing is to turn it on from the back if 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.500
 You have the slim sacÃ¡is and put the cable 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.410
 ok and we left the button of the 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.880
 power is ok and we wait for the console 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.860
 it goes off you have to leave it 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.970
 pressed it does not matter if it's the slim oo the 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.970
 Fa gives the same thing 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.129
 once it turns off instantly 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.090
 we press again and wait for 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.090
 sound three beeps 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.240
 it's worth once the three beeps sound 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.910
 ok we will skip the recovery menu in the 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.260
 screen simply because we put the 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.260
 cable in command 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.460
 It's good and it will come out good and what it is 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.260
 the menu and you go to option number 6 is worth 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.720
 system update that you 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.310
 a message will come out which is still valid 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.710
 do not do anything later on later 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.410
 we will have to press start and select 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.810
 ok but it's still not worth what you have 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.140
 what to do is then download you is 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.600
 the original 3.55 update that let 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.640
 in the description and when you are in 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.550
 this moment then put it on the play 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.160
 let's not say and well once 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.720
 we put the usb in the play worth just 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.580
 when we are in this message in which 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.650
 we had stayed before you press the 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.900
 start and select at the same time both 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.610
 keys are worth start and select and good 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.400
 start checking the usb of that 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.150
 we have the original 355 there it will take a 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.160
 little good and good , especially so that 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.770
 I recognize it the first folder has 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.480
 to be called ps3 in uppercase within 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.150
 the ps3 folder there has to be another one that 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.850
 it is called update vale and uppercase 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.420
 also and within doubt you have to 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:34.330
 be the original version 3.55 is worth if 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.710
 no the console is not going to detect it 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.080
 now that as you can see, it starts to 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.600
 prepare the update and now short 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.000
 the video is worth when it reaches 100 when 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.250
 reaches 100% because it will not in the 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.520
 355 original worth we're just 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:52.509
 going to the original again 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.880
 and good and that you give to accept you go to 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:58.240
 following 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.820
 ok this would be the safest way to 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.290
 back to the original there are people who have 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.360
 passed directly from the custom 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.480
 directly to the original updating 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.070
 online but not good if you want to go 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.440
 I'm sure it's better to do this than 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.810
 truth is better to make this look like a mess 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.880
 but it's easy and good as you see that 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.070
 It would also take a while worth 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.170
 when it reaches 100% since the console 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.320
 It restarts it as you see me now 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:25.780
 is restarting the console vale is the 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.520
 moment when cutting is the moment 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.280
 critical let's say there that the 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.080
 light or anything is worth there you see this message 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.030
 because I was detecting the cable 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.590
 hdmi but good in principle you do not 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.150
 we have to leave that message 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.740
 valuable directly that's going to restart 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.100
 the pull console is worth as you can 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.100
 watch now 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.949
 and good now as you will see the console and 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.990
 it's completely original, I used to 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:49.460
 I had the reebok and this playstation and 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.800
 contained red now as 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.780
 You see it is blue color, it is already 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.550
 all original the folders that had 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.860
 before it is not on the list either 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.479
 install packages files and all that no longer 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.060
 it's not worth everything 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:03.620
 completely original and good the last 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.900
 step and all because now 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.850
 I would be in original 355 still not 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.960
 would be in the latest version those that 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.300
 they wanted to update already the last 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.400
 version would have to update then 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.960
 as it usually is worth, it would be the last 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.330
 step and be completely clean all 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.560
 correct they could update normally 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.539
 what I do not want to update I want 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.039
 be between 55 and well I hope that you 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:23.479
 I liked it if you liked to vote for me 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:27.009
 like favorites and see you in the 

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:27.009
 next video greetings to all
