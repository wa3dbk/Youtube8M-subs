00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
hello everybody Here I am in a field

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.730 
hello everybody Here I am in a field
with<00:00:01.740> my<00:00:01.949> 80<00:00:02.310> Pro<00:00:02.850> and<00:00:03.449> Here<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:03.929> am<00:00:04.049> doing<00:00:04.620> a

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
with my 80 Pro and Here I am doing a

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.550 
with my 80 Pro and Here I am doing a
video<00:00:05.190> but<00:00:05.759> I<00:00:06.029> wanted<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.509> make<00:00:07.200> this<00:00:07.379> video

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
video but I wanted to make this video

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.610 
video but I wanted to make this video
for<00:00:07.890> everyone<00:00:08.280> here<00:00:08.519> this<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.620> Trifield

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
for everyone here this is a Trifield

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.240 
for everyone here this is a Trifield
meter<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.429> measures<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.269> EMF<00:00:13.170> which<00:00:13.860> if

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
meter and this measures the EMF which if

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.740 
meter and this measures the EMF which if
it's<00:00:14.490> close<00:00:14.730> if<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.030> goes<00:00:15.150> over<00:00:15.330> three

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
it's close if it goes over three

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.740 
it's close if it goes over three
supposedly<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.590> toxic<00:00:16.949> according<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.850> two

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
supposedly is toxic according to two

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.230 
supposedly is toxic according to two
European<00:00:19.410> standards<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.490> use<00:00:20.850> something

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
European standards so you use something

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.910 
European standards so you use something
like<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.779> your<00:00:21.930> house<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.500> check<00:00:22.650> around

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
like this in your house and check around

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.620 
like this in your house and check around
the<00:00:23.039> house<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.490> see<00:00:23.670> what<00:00:23.699> areas<00:00:23.970> are<00:00:24.269> healthy

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
the house to see what areas are healthy

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.420 
the house to see what areas are healthy
or<00:00:24.689> not<00:00:24.779> healthy<00:00:24.840> for<00:00:25.380> example<00:00:26.189> if<00:00:26.279> you're

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
or not healthy for example if you're

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.130 
or not healthy for example if you're
sitting<00:00:26.640> or<00:00:26.910> living<00:00:27.180> close<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> cell<00:00:27.960> phone

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
sitting or living close to a cell phone

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.070 
sitting or living close to a cell phone
tower<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:29.279> will<00:00:29.490> be<00:00:29.580> over<00:00:29.760> 3<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.660> means

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
tower this will be over 3 and that means

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.630 
tower this will be over 3 and that means
it's<00:00:31.289> not<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.800> good<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.399> long-term

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
it's not a good to have long-term

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.130 
it's not a good to have long-term
exposure<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.540> area

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
exposure to that area

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.080 
exposure to that area
I<00:00:34.170> never<00:00:34.620> seen<00:00:34.860> any<00:00:34.980> videos<00:00:35.399> where<00:00:35.670> people

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
I never seen any videos where people

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.900 
I never seen any videos where people
would<00:00:36.239> measure<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.170> EMF<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.950> harmful<00:00:38.309> EMF<00:00:38.670> on

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
would measure the EMF the harmful EMF on

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.000 
would measure the EMF the harmful EMF on
metal<00:00:39.239> detectors<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.410> I'm<00:00:40.680> going<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.860> make

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
metal detectors so I'm going to make

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.530 
metal detectors so I'm going to make
several<00:00:41.340> videos<00:00:41.760> with<00:00:42.000> different<00:00:42.120> metal

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
several videos with different metal

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.510 
several videos with different metal
detectors<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.379> see<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.800> effect<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.309> has

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
detectors just to see the effect it has

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.819 
detectors just to see the effect it has
because<00:00:45.300> long-term<00:00:45.570> exposure<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
because long-term exposure to the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.639 
because long-term exposure to the
negative<00:00:47.579> ENF<00:00:48.059> EMF<00:00:48.510> waves<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.350> not

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
negative ENF EMF waves is not

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.209 
negative ENF EMF waves is not
necessarily<00:00:50.190> healthy<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.320> test<00:00:52.620> I'm

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
necessarily healthy so on this test I'm

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.290 
necessarily healthy so on this test I'm
gonna<00:00:53.460> first<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.600> my<00:00:54.719> 18<00:00:55.170> probe<00:00:55.469> here<00:00:55.710> and

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
gonna first I have my 18 probe here and

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.650 
gonna first I have my 18 probe here and
as<00:00:57.300> I'm<00:00:57.660> swinging<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.789> the<00:00:59.789> number<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
as I'm swinging it the number on the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.569 
as I'm swinging it the number on the
meter<00:01:00.899> as<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.829> if<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.129> come<00:01:02.340> closer

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
meter as you can see if you come closer

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.660 
meter as you can see if you come closer
and<00:01:02.730> look<00:01:02.910> here<00:01:03.290> as<00:01:04.290> I'm<00:01:04.559> swinging<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.129> this

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and look here as I'm swinging it this

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.469 
and look here as I'm swinging it this
number<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.390> if<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.619> stays<00:01:07.890> under<00:01:08.369> 3<00:01:08.729> then

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
number is if this stays under 3 then

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.260 
number is if this stays under 3 then
that's<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.080> safe<00:01:10.350> zone<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.520> I'm<00:01:11.790> swinging

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
that's a safe zone so as I'm swinging

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.950 
that's a safe zone so as I'm swinging
the<00:01:13.220> 80<00:01:14.220> Pro<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:14.909> staying<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> 3<00:01:15.780> now

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the 80 Pro it's staying on the 3 now

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.030 
the 80 Pro it's staying on the 3 now
it's<00:01:16.110> away<00:01:16.320> from<00:01:16.500> my<00:01:16.619> body

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
it's away from my body

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.460 
it's away from my body
as<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.880> bring<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> coil<00:01:18.420> closer<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.020> see<00:01:19.259> how

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
as I bring the coil closer you see how

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.310 
as I bring the coil closer you see how
high<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.799> needle<00:01:20.369> goes<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.360> if<00:01:21.689> these<00:01:21.930> waves

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
high that needle goes so if these waves

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.469 
high that needle goes so if these waves
were<00:01:22.530> coming<00:01:22.710> near<00:01:23.009> my<00:01:23.130> body<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:24.180> would<00:01:24.330> be

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
were coming near my body that would be

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.179 
were coming near my body that would be
pretty<00:01:24.810> much<00:01:24.990> an<00:01:25.140> unhealthy<00:01:25.439> practice<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
pretty much an unhealthy practice and

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.249 
pretty much an unhealthy practice and
bad<00:01:26.340> news<00:01:26.520> for<00:01:26.729> us<00:01:26.790> metal<00:01:27.150> detectors<00:01:27.689> now<00:01:28.229> I

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
bad news for us metal detectors now I

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.710 
bad news for us metal detectors now I
know<00:01:28.799> some<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.520> metal<00:01:29.790> detectors<00:01:30.299> will

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
know some of the metal detectors will

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.990 
know some of the metal detectors will
actually<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.530> needle<00:01:31.799> will<00:01:31.979> move<00:01:32.220> right<00:01:32.579> over

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
actually the needle will move right over

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.980 
actually the needle will move right over
here<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.470> right<00:01:34.500> now<00:01:35.509> we're<00:01:36.509> looking<00:01:36.659> good

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
here but so right now we're looking good

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.710 
here but so right now we're looking good
even<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> hand<00:01:37.740> area<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.400> 80<00:01:38.579> pro<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
even on the hand area so the 80 pro the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.390 
even on the hand area so the 80 pro the
waves<00:01:39.960> are<00:01:40.200> going<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.650> ground<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.189> not

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
waves are going in the ground and not

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.910 
waves are going in the ground and not
towards<00:01:41.820> me<00:01:41.909> now<00:01:42.600> here's<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.290> thing<00:01:43.500> though

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
towards me now here's the thing though

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.490 
towards me now here's the thing though
this<00:01:44.310> wire<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:45.000> connected<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.780> Wireless<00:01:46.350> is

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
this wire is connected and Wireless is

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.139 
this wire is connected and Wireless is
even<00:01:46.740> worse<00:01:46.950> but<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.340> wire<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.610> connected<00:01:47.759> to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
even worse but the wire is connected to

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.539 
even worse but the wire is connected to
the<00:01:48.240> headphones<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.860> headphones<00:01:50.340> are

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
the headphones so as the headphones are

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.460 
the headphones so as the headphones are
on<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.540> around<00:01:51.899> your<00:01:52.110> head<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.439> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
on and this is around your head on a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.740 
on and this is around your head on a
regular<00:01:52.829> basis<00:01:53.310> we're<00:01:54.210> going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.390> measure<00:01:54.570> a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
regular basis we're going to measure a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.640 
regular basis we're going to measure a
deer<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.560> EMF

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
deer the EMF

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.740 
deer the EMF
so<00:01:57.040> I'm<00:01:57.550> gonna<00:01:57.730> put<00:01:57.940> my<00:01:58.030> headphones<00:01:58.240> here<00:01:58.720> I

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
so I'm gonna put my headphones here I

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.000 
so I'm gonna put my headphones here I
got<00:01:58.960> great<00:01:59.170> ghosts<00:01:59.410> but<00:01:59.560> it<00:01:59.650> doesn't<00:01:59.920> matter

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
got great ghosts but it doesn't matter

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.190 
got great ghosts but it doesn't matter
that<00:02:00.100> headphones<00:02:00.840> Wireless<00:02:01.840> has<00:02:01.930> even

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
that headphones Wireless has even

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.260 
that headphones Wireless has even
worthless<00:02:02.530> wireless<00:02:02.980> it's<00:02:03.130> consistent<00:02:03.700> so<00:02:04.060> as

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
worthless wireless it's consistent so as

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.040 
worthless wireless it's consistent so as
I'm<00:02:04.600> going

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
I'm going

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.910 
I'm going
there's<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:06.100> needles<00:02:06.460> not<00:02:06.670> moving<00:02:07.270> however

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
there's the needles not moving however

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.490 
there's the needles not moving however
when<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:08.950> hit<00:02:09.160> a<00:02:09.220> target<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.970> good<00:02:10.900> target<00:02:11.350> that

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
when I hit a target a good target that

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.090 
when I hit a target a good target that
needle<00:02:11.800> moves<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:16.410> see<00:02:17.410> look<00:02:17.590> at<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.830> needle

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
needle moves so see look at that needle

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.910 
needle moves so see look at that needle
moving<00:02:18.400> when<00:02:18.520> I<00:02:18.550> hit<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.760> good<00:02:19.000> target<00:02:19.210> now<00:02:20.140> it's

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
moving when I hit a good target now it's

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.440 
moving when I hit a good target now it's
a<00:02:21.040> good<00:02:21.280> thing<00:02:21.460> that<00:02:21.490> I'm<00:02:21.700> not<00:02:21.850> staying<00:02:22.180> there

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
a good thing that I'm not staying there

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.180 
a good thing that I'm not staying there
all<00:02:22.690> day<00:02:22.930> on<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.200> target<00:02:23.650> its<00:02:23.860> long-term

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
all day on the target its long-term

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.190 
all day on the target its long-term
exposure<00:02:24.910> that's<00:02:25.180> going<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.480> create<00:02:25.990> the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
exposure that's going to create the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.990 
exposure that's going to create the
issue<00:02:26.470> but<00:02:26.740> remember<00:02:27.130> folks<00:02:27.370> this<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.730> on<00:02:27.850> your

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
issue but remember folks this is on your

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.440 
issue but remember folks this is on your
head<00:02:28.210> so<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.800> want<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.130> check<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:31.030> different

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
head so you want to check the different

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.910 
head so you want to check the different
metal<00:02:31.690> detectors<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.350> see<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.800> it's

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
metal detectors to see and it's

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.590 
metal detectors to see and it's
something<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:33.280> don't<00:02:33.430> hear<00:02:33.550> anyone<00:02:33.970> talk<00:02:34.570> about

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
something I don't hear anyone talk about

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.290 
something I don't hear anyone talk about
but<00:02:35.560> it's<00:02:35.680> important<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.280> think<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.730> 80<00:02:36.940> Pro

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
but it's important so I think the 80 Pro

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.560 
but it's important so I think the 80 Pro
is<00:02:37.480> safe<00:02:37.690> with<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.620> headphones<00:02:39.100> I<00:02:39.640> think<00:02:40.450> it's

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
is safe with the headphones I think it's

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.350 
is safe with the headphones I think it's
okay<00:02:40.930> because<00:02:41.350> again<00:02:42.090> long-term<00:02:43.090> it's

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
okay because again long-term it's

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.940 
okay because again long-term it's
staying<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.930> needle<00:02:44.200> staying<00:02:44.470> in<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.710> safe

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
staying the needle staying in the safe

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:45.240 
staying the needle staying in the safe
zone

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
zone

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.220 
zone
but<00:02:45.790> will<00:02:45.940> do<00:02:46.090> other<00:02:46.330> videos<00:02:46.420> with<00:02:47.050> different

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
but will do other videos with different

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.890 
but will do other videos with different
metal<00:02:47.710> detectors<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.460> will<00:02:49.000> test<00:02:49.210> the<00:02:49.360> EMS<00:02:49.720> on

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
metal detectors and will test the EMS on

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.510 
metal detectors and will test the EMS on
those<00:02:50.080> metal<00:02:50.320> detectors<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:51.040> see<00:02:51.220> how<00:02:51.340> they

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
those metal detectors and see how they

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.600 
those metal detectors and see how they
are<00:02:52.230> alright<00:02:53.230> so<00:02:53.470> here<00:02:53.680> we<00:02:53.710> are<00:02:53.830> continuing<00:02:54.520> a

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
are alright so here we are continuing a

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.700 
are alright so here we are continuing a
test<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.270> switched<00:02:55.570> my<00:02:55.840> headphones<00:02:56.440> and

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
test and I switched my headphones and

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.510 
test and I switched my headphones and
now<00:02:56.800> I<00:02:56.830> have<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.280> ear<00:02:57.520> buds<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:59.130> the<00:03:00.130> ear<00:03:00.280> buds

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
now I have the ear buds and the ear buds

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.130 
now I have the ear buds and the ear buds
are<00:03:00.670> much<00:03:00.790> smaller<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:01.450> it<00:03:01.570> might<00:03:01.690> not<00:03:01.750> be<00:03:02.050> as

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
are much smaller so it might not be as

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.530 
are much smaller so it might not be as
bad<00:03:02.320> so<00:03:02.709> I'm<00:03:03.160> gonna<00:03:03.280> go<00:03:03.489> over<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.760> target<00:03:04.030> here

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
bad so I'm gonna go over a target here

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.410 
bad so I'm gonna go over a target here
and<00:03:04.690> we<00:03:04.750> can<00:03:04.930> see<00:03:05.110> here

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.720 

so<00:03:11.020> it's<00:03:11.440> nowhere<00:03:11.650> near<00:03:11.830> as<00:03:12.010> bad<00:03:12.280> when<00:03:12.490> I<00:03:12.520> go

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
so it's nowhere near as bad when I go

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.160 
so it's nowhere near as bad when I go
over<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:12.970> target<00:03:13.180> with<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.480> ear<00:03:13.660> fault<00:03:13.930> with

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
over the target with the ear fault with

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.620 
over the target with the ear fault with
that<00:03:14.319> with<00:03:14.650> these<00:03:14.830> phones<00:03:15.130> so<00:03:16.090> that's<00:03:16.390> good

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
that with these phones so that's good

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.809 
that with these phones so that's good
and<00:03:16.810> bad<00:03:16.870> that<00:03:17.260> says<00:03:17.530> it's<00:03:17.770> it's<00:03:18.040> safer<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.790> use

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
and bad that says it's it's safer to use

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.390 
and bad that says it's it's safer to use
the<00:03:19.090> earbuds<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.590> is<00:03:20.740> to<00:03:20.920> use<00:03:21.069> the<00:03:21.220> big

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
the earbuds that it is to use the big

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.140 
the earbuds that it is to use the big
headphones

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
headphones

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.330 
headphones
however<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.350> headphones<00:03:23.830> are<00:03:23.950> stronger<00:03:24.310> for

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
however the headphones are stronger for

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.910 
however the headphones are stronger for
a<00:03:24.550> reason<00:03:25.000> so<00:03:25.569> even<00:03:25.900> though<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.200> 80<00:03:26.350> Pro<00:03:26.740> is

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
a reason so even though the 80 Pro is

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.340 
a reason so even though the 80 Pro is
safe<00:03:27.160> here<00:03:27.490> when<00:03:28.120> I'm<00:03:28.240> away<00:03:28.540> in<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.080> I'm<00:03:29.200> not

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
safe here when I'm away in and I'm not

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.530 
safe here when I'm away in and I'm not
getting<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.770> reading<00:03:29.950> that's<00:03:30.760> good<00:03:31.090> on<00:03:31.360> one

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
getting the reading that's good on one

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.290 
getting the reading that's good on one
hand<00:03:31.780> cuz<00:03:32.050> it's<00:03:32.230> safe<00:03:32.440> but<00:03:33.250> if<00:03:33.520> I<00:03:33.880> was<00:03:34.090> getting

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
hand cuz it's safe but if I was getting

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.000 
hand cuz it's safe but if I was getting
the<00:03:34.510> radio<00:03:34.780> wave<00:03:34.959> that<00:03:35.200> means<00:03:35.410> this<00:03:35.530> is<00:03:35.770> either

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
the radio wave that means this is either

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.100 
the radio wave that means this is either
a<00:03:36.160> broke<00:03:36.550> metal<00:03:36.940> detector<00:03:37.360> or<00:03:37.420> a<00:03:37.540> very<00:03:37.750> strong

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.160 
a broke metal detector or a very strong
metal<00:03:38.320> detector<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.330> some<00:03:40.330> metal<00:03:40.510> detectors

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
metal detector and some metal detectors

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.010 
metal detector and some metal detectors
I<00:03:41.380> can<00:03:42.010> put<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:42.250> right<00:03:42.370> here<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.760> it<00:03:43.090> will<00:03:43.270> it

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
safest way from an EMF standpoint I'll

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.229 
safest way from an EMF standpoint I'll
do<00:03:54.130> some<00:03:54.340> other<00:03:54.519> videos<00:03:54.880> with<00:03:55.090> other
