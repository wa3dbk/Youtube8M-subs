00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 about andres for doctor DÃ­az and the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.310
 today I bring you the review of the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.750
 update of the application 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.719
 youtube for our devices 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.580
 iphone ipod touch and ipad this 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.410
 update brings very good changes and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.940
 first we will adopt is that the icon 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.060
 change now it's just the button 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.859
 play before said youtube and when here 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.140
 starting the application we noticed that 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.269
 now the fund practically predominates 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.710
 the white before the colors were 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.619
 darker here I am in the section of 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.330
 videos uploaded but good interface 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.949
 this bar from the side to work 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.079
 practically the same as the one we had 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.790
 before now I am going to tell you more or less 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.770
 what is interesting about this 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.360
 application what is it that brings a new 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.489
 problem here we can find videos 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.829
 uploaded here is the information of 50 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.090
 uploaded videos purchases the option to see 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.000
 the playlist of see more 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.239
 afternoon favorites lists history 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.399
 etcetera here are the adjustments of the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.260
 application here we can see activity 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.329
 that would be the activity of all your 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.070
 subscriptions and they gave like a 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.230
 video to a channel you 're subscribed to 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.390
 they uploaded a video and if good he loves you 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.680
 jump all and you just want to see the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.210
 videos that uploaded your subscription 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.510
 our you have to do here 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.790
 and subscriptions were going to appear in your 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.890
 feed all the videos uploaded from the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.420
 channels to which they are subscribed and 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.130
 well here we could watch any video 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.950
 for example let's see one of my channel 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.110
 the most recent that I uploaded the monitor 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.330
 for gaming so when we go to 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.560
 play it here it lowers the volume and 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.330
 good as you can see here is 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.890
 playing the video normally 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.259
 as practically was done in the other 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.500
 application in order we can see the title 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.479
 of the video I can see the likes and videos 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.700
 suggested if I want I can read some 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.200
 comments anything but what 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.850
 interesting is coming now since we can 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.830
 keep browsing the good app 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.149
 as it goes here we are going to lose the video 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.979
 it seems to me that before he ran towards 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.840
 up now when the comments are 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.149
 run below the video the video is 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.979
 the main thing and suppose I want to see 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.690
 the background video I want to continue 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.580
 simply navigating it slides it towards 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.350
 below and how they see the video now 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.970
 simply appearing in miniature is 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.310
 keep playing the video just like 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.159
 they know an out 2 as a multitasking function 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.450
 on galaxy phones but good to see 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.880
 if I want to play the video again 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.920
 simply and then come here if I want 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.569
 see it in full screen logically 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.239
 I can rotate a device 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.950
 and I'll see it in full screen and in another 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.150
 thing if I do not want to stop seeing him what 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.590
 The only thing I have to do is slide 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.749
 down and then slide towards the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.379
 left and so you stop playing the 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:24.030
 video 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.069
 this I loved about the application is its 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.749
 main change and now that it works 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.099
 very well I do not know how useful it is 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:31.260
 that only works on youtube 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.230
 logically if you're playing a 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.659
 video and you go some other application of 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.280
 these are going to stop playing but 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.859
 Well, here, browse read some 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.969
 comments from some other video and good 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:44.370
 suppose here I have one 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.109
 playing and I open another video and not 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.989
 can only play two videos to the 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:51.569
 time and that is something like that logic because 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.219
 then I would spend a lot of processing and the 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.689
 audios would be combined but good if 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.669
 They want to see two videos at a time not 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:59.189
 can do but if navigate between 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:00.719
 some other videos while you find 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.430
 another funny video or things for the 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.750
 style but good these are the 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.609
 major changes that the 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.859
 YouTube application for our 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.419
 iphone and ipod touch devices and good 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.669
 let's see the application on the ipad 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.709
 well here I am on the ipad and to notice that 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:15.780
 the application works practically from 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.340
 the same way simply that adapted 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.530
 for the ipad good here is 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.510
 playing a video and good here 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.980
 we will also navigate much better here 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.260
 we have the comments on one side 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.780
 we have a bit of description of the channel 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.819
 some suggested videos I can see more 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.680
 suggestions is going to send me to the channel 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.510
 prohibited to continue playing 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.300
 then when it was like that it slipped 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.860
 to the side the video will be erased if 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.720
 is from floor to top will continue 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.670
 reproducing if I want to do it in 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.950
 big simply with two fingers can I 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.300
 make a gesture and he will do it 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.730
 or you can also press the button that 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.310
 appears that appears here in the corner and 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.019
 good if I want to read the description 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.820
 in the comments all this I can 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.160
 do and good works the same just 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.980
 a little bigger team looks 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.690
 sold uploaded my subscription is all 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.269
 to work practically the same but 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.190
 It is very well adapted for the iPad and 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.680
 another thing that many complain that if you 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.000
 integrates in android for example is that the 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.100
 Video resolution can not be 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.569
 modify but that does the application 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.069
 automatically is to say if the 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.630
 application sees that your connection is very 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.359
 weak will play the video in a 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.310
 low quality if it serves you that your connection 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.910
 it's good what is going to play in hd or in 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.100
 any 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.480
 of good quality so good as 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.010
 you can change I would have liked that 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.600
 only integrated in this application in 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.280
 android for example you can remove the 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.050
 hd or activate it 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.600
 which is great but the application 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.820
 both ipad and iphone or ipod 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.770
 touch we can not modify that unless 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.360
 that you are browsing from youtube.com in 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.220
 some browser so good if they want 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.230
 Very ricard resolutions can do it 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.030
 going directly to the page but 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.640
 well we wasted the whole interface 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.500
 that has this application and well this 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.000
 it would be all commented two videos I gave away 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.740
 something this time can give three 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.330
 applications of the lowest price in the 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.860
 appstore win any of these 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.930
 applications the only thing that they have to

 to do is leave a like to this video and 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.840
