00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.549 
is zombie strike 2014 so the blasters we
already<00:00:34.360> know<00:00:34.480> about<00:00:34.570> the<00:00:34.720> lineart<00:00:35.110> the

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
already know about the lineart the

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.220 
already know about the lineart the
hammer<00:00:35.890> shot<00:00:36.220> and<00:00:36.520> recently<00:00:37.180> we<00:00:37.720> found<00:00:37.750> out

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
hammer shot and recently we found out

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.660 
hammer shot and recently we found out
about<00:00:38.379> the<00:00:40.199> sledgefire<00:00:41.199> or<00:00:41.829> slide<00:00:42.190> show<00:00:42.399> car

about the sledgefire or slide show car
number<00:00:43.030> what's<00:00:43.600> a<00:00:43.720> neighbor<00:00:43.900> these<00:00:44.739> these<00:00:45.190> are

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
number what's a neighbor these these are

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.210 
number what's a neighbor these these are
new<00:00:45.610> ones<00:00:45.820> coming<00:00:46.120> out<00:00:46.300> 2014<00:00:47.019> so<00:00:47.680> first<00:00:47.980> we

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.939 
have the side strike so as you can see
holds<00:00:52.390> two<00:00:52.570> dots<00:00:52.780> on<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.019> bottom<00:00:53.290> and<00:00:53.470> one

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
strike elite and in handle and it will

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.000 
strike elite and in handle and it will
go<00:01:00.309> for<00:01:00.699> fourteen<00:01:01.660> dollars<00:01:02.050> 99<00:01:02.500> I<00:01:02.620> don't<00:01:02.920> know

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
go for fourteen dollars 99 I don't know

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.580 
go for fourteen dollars 99 I don't know
how<00:01:03.129> much<00:01:03.309> you'll<00:01:03.460> be<00:01:03.550> a<00:01:03.579> pound<00:01:03.879> and<00:01:04.590> it's

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
how much you'll be a pound and it's

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.570 
how much you'll be a pound and it's
going<00:01:05.740> to<00:01:05.800> prime<00:01:05.979> account<00:01:06.190> like<00:01:06.429> the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
going to prime account like the

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.380 
going to prime account like the
Mavericks<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:08.020> next<00:01:08.320> is<00:01:08.679> the<00:01:08.770> cross<00:01:09.550> fire<00:01:10.090> bow

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
Mavericks so next is the cross fire bow

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.749 
Mavericks so next is the cross fire bow
and<00:01:10.929> this<00:01:11.170> will<00:01:11.350> go<00:01:11.470> for<00:01:11.710> ninety<00:01:12.130> dollars<00:01:12.310> 99

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
and this will go for ninety dollars 99

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.330 
and this will go for ninety dollars 99
but<00:01:13.360> don't<00:01:13.690> know<00:01:13.810> how<00:01:13.929> many<00:01:14.170> pounds<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:15.190> this

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
but don't know how many pounds so this

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.010 
but don't know how many pounds so this
is<00:01:15.369> my<00:01:15.640> favorite<00:01:15.910> one<00:01:16.119> because<00:01:16.300> it's<00:01:16.720> actually

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
is my favorite one because it's actually

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.230 
is my favorite one because it's actually
like<00:01:17.110> a<00:01:17.170> cross<00:01:17.440> cross<00:01:18.009> /<00:01:18.250> like<00:01:18.399> high<00:01:18.850> primer

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
like a cross cross / like high primer

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.060 
like a cross cross / like high primer
and<00:01:19.600> like<00:01:19.750> The<00:01:19.899> Guardian<00:01:20.200> morning<00:01:20.679> a<00:01:20.800> robot

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
and like The Guardian morning a robot

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.940 
and like The Guardian morning a robot
line<00:01:21.280> so<00:01:22.030> if<00:01:22.990> you<00:01:23.200> can<00:01:23.320> see<00:01:23.470> on<00:01:23.530> top<00:01:23.679> as<00:01:23.860> an

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
line so if you can see on top as an

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.710 
line so if you can see on top as an
orange-red<00:01:24.250> backing<00:01:24.759> you<00:01:24.850> pull<00:01:25.119> up<00:01:25.270> back<00:01:25.450> and

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
orange-red backing you pull up back and

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.779 
orange-red backing you pull up back and
pretty<00:01:26.140> sure<00:01:26.259> you<00:01:26.380> load<00:01:26.679> down<00:01:27.009> to<00:01:27.070> front<00:01:27.550> and

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
pretty sure you load down to front and

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.350 
pretty sure you load down to front and
fire<00:01:28.479> it<00:01:28.869> says<00:01:29.200> n-strike<00:01:30.009> elite<00:01:30.130> under<00:01:30.640> I'm

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
fire it says n-strike elite under I'm

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.510 
fire it says n-strike elite under I'm
handle<00:01:32.050> it<00:01:32.080> can<00:01:32.319> hold<00:01:32.500> stock<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.190> it<00:01:33.340> the

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
handle it can hold stock and it the

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.820 
handle it can hold stock and it the
colors<00:01:33.789> are<00:01:33.940> green<00:01:34.239> black<00:01:34.750> brown<00:01:35.349> and<00:01:35.380> grey

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
colors are green black brown and grey

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.740 
colors are green black brown and grey
and<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.890> it's<00:01:39.520> got<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.819> taqueria<00:01:40.119> on<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.539> top

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
and so it's got a taqueria on the top

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.880 
and so it's got a taqueria on the top
and<00:01:40.899> a<00:01:40.959> pretty<00:01:41.140> sure<00:01:41.289> it's<00:01:41.440> got<00:01:41.619> one<00:01:41.770> on<00:01:41.860> the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
and a pretty sure it's got one on the

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.040 
and a pretty sure it's got one on the
bottom<00:01:42.099> that's<00:01:42.910> what<00:01:43.149> that<00:01:43.390> weird<00:01:43.690> thing<00:01:43.720> on

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
bottom that's what that weird thing on

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.169 
bottom that's what that weird thing on
the<00:01:44.140> hand<00:01:44.380> like<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.739> diet<00:01:44.950> Ron<00:01:45.250> should<00:01:46.000> don't

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
the hand like the diet Ron should don't

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.330 
the hand like the diet Ron should don't
know<00:01:46.239> why<00:01:46.360> for<00:01:46.599> that<00:01:46.750> there<00:01:47.110> anyway<00:01:47.830> next<00:01:48.190> is<00:01:48.310> a

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
know why for that there anyway next is a

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.690 
know why for that there anyway next is a
twist<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.729> here<00:01:52.179> is<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.959> vortex<00:01:53.560> fuse<00:01:54.340> fire

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
twist so here is the vortex fuse fire

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.850 
twist so here is the vortex fuse fire
which<00:01:55.360> will<00:01:55.539> go<00:01:55.660> for<00:01:55.869> fourteen<00:01:56.379> ninety<00:01:56.709> nine

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
which will go for fourteen ninety nine

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.300 
which will go for fourteen ninety nine
dollars<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:57.720> this<00:01:58.720> is<00:01:58.959> like<00:01:59.709> this<00:01:59.860> idea<00:02:00.160> if

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
dollars and this is like this idea if

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.600 
dollars and this is like this idea if
I'm<00:02:00.459> vortex<00:02:01.030> in<00:02:01.179> the<00:02:01.209> line<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.530> holds<00:02:02.860> five

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
I'm vortex in the line so it holds five

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.190 
I'm vortex in the line so it holds five
discs<00:02:04.030> in<00:02:04.179> the<00:02:04.270> front<00:02:04.509> and<00:02:04.629> a<00:02:04.690> pretty<00:02:04.929> sure<00:02:05.080> you

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
discs in the front and a pretty sure you

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.080 
discs in the front and a pretty sure you
put<00:02:05.410> in<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.830> chamber<00:02:06.220> in<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.369> back<00:02:06.550> and<00:02:07.030> you

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
put in the chamber in the back and you

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.059 
put in the chamber in the back and you
prime<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.450> like<00:02:07.690> a<00:02:07.720> nite<00:02:08.020> finder<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.739> colors

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
prime it like a nite finder the colors

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.660 
prime it like a nite finder the colors
are<00:02:09.220> brown<00:02:09.550> black<00:02:10.090> gray<00:02:11.020> and<00:02:11.250> two<00:02:12.250> different

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
are brown black gray and two different

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.390 
are brown black gray and two different
shades<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:13.060> orange<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:14.230> light<00:02:14.890> orange<00:02:15.129> on<00:02:15.370> the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
shades of orange the light orange on the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.339 
shades of orange the light orange on the
front<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:15.879> a<00:02:16.090> dark<00:02:16.480> orange<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.080> middle

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
front and a dark orange in the middle

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.449 
front and a dark orange in the middle
and<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:18.430> priming<00:02:19.420> em<00:02:19.599> handle<00:02:20.379> is<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.620> lighter

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
and the priming em handle is a lighter

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.150 
and the priming em handle is a lighter
orange<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:22.060> it's<00:02:22.930> got<00:02:23.170> one<00:02:23.379> swing<00:02:23.709> adapter

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
orange and it's got one swing adapter

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.000 
orange and it's got one swing adapter
which<00:02:24.370> isn't<00:02:24.670> very<00:02:24.700> big<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:27.989> that's<00:02:28.989> all<00:02:29.319> we

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
which isn't very big and that's all we

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.410 
which isn't very big and that's all we
know<00:02:30.190> say<00:02:30.519> and<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:32.319> like<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.709> idea<00:02:32.830> of<00:02:33.069> them

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
know say and so I like the idea of them

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.510 
know say and so I like the idea of them
vortex<00:02:34.420> being<00:02:34.690> online<00:02:34.870> if<00:02:35.410> it's<00:02:35.620> pretty<00:02:36.370> good

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
vortex being online if it's pretty good

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.140 
vortex being online if it's pretty good
Andrew<00:02:37.300> Belle<00:02:37.450> me<00:02:37.660> do<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.050> I<00:02:38.200> don't<00:02:38.470> know

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
Andrew Belle me do it I don't know

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.149 
Andrew Belle me do it I don't know
I'm<00:02:39.750> seeing<00:02:40.140> as<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:40.379> is<00:02:40.439> kind<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.920> boy

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
I'm seeing as this is kind of the boy

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.850 
I'm seeing as this is kind of the boy
without<00:02:41.340> line<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:42.420> anyway<00:02:42.840> next<00:02:43.560> we<00:02:43.769> have<00:02:44.069> the

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
without line so anyway next we have the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.789 
without line so anyway next we have the
ricochet<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:47.129> think<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.260> result

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
ricochet I think and this is this result

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.020 
ricochet I think and this is this result
of<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.939> series<00:02:51.629> is<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:52.079> this<00:02:52.110> year<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:53.030> it

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
of the series is to this year and it

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.330 
of the series is to this year and it
will<00:02:54.420> go<00:02:54.689> for<00:02:55.110> nine<00:02:55.500> ninety<00:02:55.829> nine<00:02:55.859> dollars

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
will go for nine ninety nine dollars

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.920 
will go for nine ninety nine dollars
don't<00:02:56.909> know<00:02:57.060> how<00:02:57.209> much<00:02:57.359> you'll<00:02:57.569> be<00:02:57.599> up<00:02:57.750> on

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
don't know how much you'll be up on

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.110 
don't know how much you'll be up on
still<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.829> the<00:02:59.010> priming<00:02:59.370> handle<00:02:59.730> is<00:02:59.909> like<00:03:00.090> a

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
still so the priming handle is like a

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.390 
still so the priming handle is like a
Mavericks<00:03:00.659> were<00:03:00.930> very<00:03:01.170> small<00:03:01.260> screen<00:03:02.129> and

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
Mavericks were very small screen and

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.490 
Mavericks were very small screen and
then<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:02.970> rest<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.420> Buster's<00:03:03.780> orange<00:03:04.200> but

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
then the rest of the Buster's orange but

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.130 
then the rest of the Buster's orange but
has<00:03:04.829> no<00:03:05.519> disk<00:03:05.849> storage<00:03:05.970> anywhere<00:03:06.629> and<00:03:07.019> it

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
has no disk storage anywhere and it

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.240 
has no disk storage anywhere and it
looks<00:03:07.319> like<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.560> put<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.769> disc<00:03:07.950> into<00:03:08.129> the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
looks like you put the disc into the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.080 
looks like you put the disc into the
front<00:03:08.519> so<00:03:09.450> anyway<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.769> next<00:03:11.069> Buster<00:03:11.940> in<00:03:12.060> the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
front so anyway the next Buster in the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:20.839 
front so anyway the next Buster in the
line<00:03:12.389> is<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:16.069> RIP<00:03:17.069> shot<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:19.159> this<00:03:20.159> will<00:03:20.519> go

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
line is the RIP shot and so this will go

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.860 
line is the RIP shot and so this will go
for<00:03:21.590> nine<00:03:22.590> ninety<00:03:23.129> nine<00:03:23.159> dollars<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.480> looks

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
for nine ninety nine dollars it looks

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.839 
for nine ninety nine dollars it looks
pretty<00:03:25.109> small<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:26.129> looks<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.400> bit<00:03:26.549> bigger

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
pretty small that looks a bit bigger

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.089 
pretty small that looks a bit bigger
than<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.060> Ricochet<00:03:27.989> like<00:03:28.319> triad<00:03:28.829> it<00:03:29.010> was

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
than the Ricochet like triad it was

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.440 
than the Ricochet like triad it was
bigger<00:03:29.310> than<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.730> jolt<00:03:30.389> and<00:03:30.629> so<00:03:31.530> it's<00:03:31.769> got<00:03:31.980> a

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
bigger than the jolt and so it's got a

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.849 
bigger than the jolt and so it's got a
storage<00:03:33.450> free<00:03:33.870> disk<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.319> front<00:03:34.560> looks<00:03:34.739> Li

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
storage free disk the front looks Li

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.830 
storage free disk the front looks Li
furloughed<00:03:35.310> it's<00:03:35.609> got<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:36.000> Martha<00:03:36.569> Prime

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
furloughed it's got a Martha Prime

furloughed it's got a Martha Prime
makandal<00:03:37.319> it's<00:03:37.470> got<00:03:37.709> that<00:03:38.280> weird<00:03:38.549> thing<00:03:38.819> at

solve and to be specific it's a vantage
sword<00:04:08.430> pretty<00:04:09.150> sure<00:04:09.269> it<00:04:09.329> is<00:04:09.479> anyway<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:10.049> since

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
sword pretty sure it is anyway and since

I<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.099> the<00:04:11.220> blade<00:04:11.430> being<00:04:11.729> gray<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.269> is<00:04:12.329> black

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
I of the blade being gray it is black

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.310 
I of the blade being gray it is black
queen<00:04:13.319> I<00:04:13.560> think<00:04:13.889> about<00:04:14.129> brown<00:04:14.579> grey<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:16.079> gray

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
queen I think about brown grey and gray

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.279 
queen I think about brown grey and gray
and<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.650> handle<00:04:17.519> is<00:04:17.609> brown<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.239> white<00:04:18.570> onto

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
and the handle is brown and white onto

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.099 
and the handle is brown and white onto
the<00:04:19.500> bit<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.760> blade<00:04:21.090> gets<00:04:21.389> Holden<00:04:21.900> is

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
the bit that the blade gets Holden is

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.820 
the bit that the blade gets Holden is
black<00:04:23.270> so<00:04:24.270> this<00:04:24.510> will<00:04:24.630> go<00:04:24.780> for<00:04:25.020> twelve<00:04:25.349> ninety

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
black so this will go for twelve ninety

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.029 
black so this will go for twelve ninety
nine<00:04:25.979> dollars<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:26.870> I<00:04:27.870> think<00:04:28.560> it's<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.830> pretty

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
nine dollars and I think it's a pretty

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.010 
nine dollars and I think it's a pretty
good<00:04:29.220> idea<00:04:29.340> Hansel's<00:04:29.909> on<00:04:30.120> vortex<00:04:30.389> into<00:04:30.840> line

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
good idea Hansel's on vortex into line

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.700 
good idea Hansel's on vortex into line
and<00:04:31.229> I<00:04:31.889> will<00:04:32.159> be<00:04:32.340> looking<00:04:32.849> for<00:04:33.300> this<00:04:33.539> in<00:04:33.810> 2014

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
and I will be looking for this in 2014

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.930 
and I will be looking for this in 2014
so<00:04:35.250> anyway<00:04:35.610> thank<00:04:36.210> you<00:04:36.300> for<00:04:36.419> watching
