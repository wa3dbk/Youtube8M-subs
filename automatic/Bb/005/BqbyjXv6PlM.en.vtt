How to get Blue Knuckles in Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles (Emulation Glitch Method)

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.040
First, we'll need to get debug mode, which is fairly easy to do.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.100
Go on this vine, and press Left 3 times, Right 3 times, then up 3 times.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.960
Once you hear the ring sound, press Start, then A.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:05.940
Make your way to the pulley (this is the fastest way there), then do the combination again.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.000
Once Again, A + Start.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.020
Now, load up a file which has 1-7 Chaos Emeralds (before going in the flashing ring in MH), then do A + Start once more.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.000
Enter Sound Test again, choose either Sonic (01), Tails (02), or both (00), and press Start on Hidden Palace while holding A. This will activate Debug mode.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:44.000
Press B to activate Debug mode and do what I do here to make your way to the grey Super Emeralds.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.980
Get the Emerald or lose, it doesn't matter which you do.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.040
Use Debug mode to scroll to the bottom of the screen. The game should reset (if it doesn't, use the reset button on the Genesis or soft reset if you're in an emulator).

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.380
Then go to sound test again. You should see either 80, 81, or 82, which means you've done the glitch.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.580
And here's Blue Knuckles! He plays like Knuckles, but the game usually wants you on Sonic's paths.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.980
This doesn't become too much of a problem, though (most of the time).

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.000
He doesn't have a Super form unless you hit an "S" box, which is spawnable through Debug mode.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:04.060
Most levels work fine, but there are a few that can't be completed...

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.640
...like Angel Island Act 2, for example.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:28.020
This section plays out as normal, but...

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.340
...this section is where the game freaks out.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.020
The boss heads to Knuckles' boss area, which you can't reach, making this level unbeatable.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.860
You can use debug mode to explore what's over here, but it's not pretty.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.960
That's all for today. Bye!
