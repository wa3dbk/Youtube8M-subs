 At that moment I'm on my feet. 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.080
 accelerator to the end and the management mode 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.080
 is cutting a backpack 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:33.070
 in this defense of the injection system 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:35.900

 very hot power to fly and he 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.989
 It is the logic of the system and robotic 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.840
 reminding you that in a person who does not 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.340

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:16.710
 track and on the fifth gear and called 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.390
