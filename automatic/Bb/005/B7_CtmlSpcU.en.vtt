life her being immortal was brought
through<00:00:56.879> several<00:00:57.239> generations<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.199> testing

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
through several generations of testing

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.970 
through several generations of testing
and<00:00:59.270> they<00:01:00.270> make<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.660> seem<00:01:00.899> like<00:01:01.230> oh<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.739> just

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and they make it seem like oh it's just

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.860 
and they make it seem like oh it's just
from<00:01:02.190> generation<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.820> generation<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.660> just

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
from generation to generation we just

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.440 
from generation to generation we just
got<00:01:04.019> stronger<00:01:04.379> through<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> alicia<00:01:05.700> flower

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
got stronger through the alicia flower

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.530 
got stronger through the alicia flower
kind<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.590> injecting<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.100> into<00:01:08.540> our

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
kind of injecting that into our

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.969 
kind of injecting that into our
bloodstream<00:01:11.119> somehow<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.420> find<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.200> is

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
bloodstream somehow I find that that is

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.310 
bloodstream somehow I find that that is
killing<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.630> know<00:01:15.750> they're<00:01:15.930> test

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
killing the you know they're test

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.789 
killing the you know they're test
subjects<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:18.020> there's<00:01:19.020> some<00:01:19.290> question

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
subjects so there's some question

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
that and I don't think this is a series

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.219 
that and I don't think this is a series
I<00:05:14.550> think<00:05:14.610> this<00:05:14.850> is<00:05:15.000> a<00:05:15.030> standalone<00:05:15.600> even<00:05:16.110> though

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
I think this is a standalone even though

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:17.900 
I think this is a standalone even though
like<00:05:16.530> there<00:05:16.950> are<00:05:17.100> parts<00:05:17.370> where<00:05:17.460> I<00:05:17.610> was<00:05:17.760> like

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
like there are parts where I was like

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.879 
like there are parts where I was like
okay<00:05:18.300> this<00:05:18.450> could<00:05:18.660> be<00:05:18.810> a<00:05:18.840> series<00:05:19.260> but<00:05:19.560> I<00:05:19.590> feel

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
okay this could be a series but I feel

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.310 
okay this could be a series but I feel
like<00:05:20.039> as<00:05:20.280> it<00:05:20.639> ended<00:05:21.150> I<00:05:21.300> feel<00:05:21.780> like<00:05:21.930> you<00:05:22.110> could

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
like as it ended I feel like you could

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.990 
like as it ended I feel like you could
read<00:05:22.530> it<00:05:22.650> as<00:05:22.830> a<00:05:23.010> standalone<00:05:23.400> if<00:05:23.729> it<00:05:23.849> is<00:05:23.970> a

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
read it as a standalone if it is a

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.529 
read it as a standalone if it is a
standalone<00:05:24.950> so<00:05:25.950> yeah<00:05:26.280> I<00:05:26.700> hope<00:05:27.000> you<00:05:27.060> all<00:05:27.330> have<00:05:27.510> a
