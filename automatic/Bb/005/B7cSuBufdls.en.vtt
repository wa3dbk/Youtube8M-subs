00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.240
 to 

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.240
 [Music] 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:19.710
 [Music] 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.010
 Y 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.039
 Y 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.039
 [Music] 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.119
 love action 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.800
 ah 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.800
 you can not continue 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.699
 already the magic ended 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.469
 ah 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.469
 now I have to leave 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.470
 and it will be better 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.370
 following this solid 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.870
 and today the sky came 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:11.540
 [Music] 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.540
 Maybe tomorrow the sun will shine 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.259
 its action 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:30.790
 maybe tomorrow our crying is behind 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.790
 and if you tell me that your love awaits me 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.659
 I have the light that my path never 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.680
 He said 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.890
 [Applause] 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.800
 [Music] 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.480
 with birds 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.480
 of all units 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:58.390
 You'll see that I'll be back soon and I'll stay 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:02.220
 for that peace that always always you 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.220
 you give 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.590
 [Music] 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:26.360
 [Music] 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.210
 that effect is called vibrato and we do it 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.500
 moving the finger from side to side 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.200
 [Music] 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.660
 and it's different from guitar vibrato 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.810
 electric with metal cords that makes 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.260
 the vibrato in this way 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.230
 [Music] 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.610
 in healthy string and we do vibrato 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.370
 A) Yes 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.970
 removing the thumb support from the 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.810
 back and swinging the hand of 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.120
 Side to side 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.659
 [Music] 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.659
 yes 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.440
 and in the sung part we're going to use the 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:18.390
 strum number 15 thumb down 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:22.610
 cancel half index down 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.610
 thumb for three thumbs down 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.680
 another annular half index work and 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.239
 thumb down 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.239
 and the rhythm is as follows 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:49.140
 [Music] 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.140
 when we touch the annular half index 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.290
 down we have to do the shutdown 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.890
 or a snap we touch the sharp region 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.640
 of the strings and then off with this 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.640
 part of the hand 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.310
 in such a way that it sounds like a snap 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.459
 [Music] 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.780
 Y 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.660
 [Music] 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.610
 and we also have to take into account 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.100
 that we agreed to re minor we're 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.370
 making a small variation that 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.970
 will add to the east finger on finger three in 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.030
 the fourth string 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.530
 [Music] 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.530
 and I agreed to the older finger 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.360
 [Music] 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.570
 add him 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.900
 the sixth string on the third fret 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.790
 [Music] 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.830
 to be able to rip on all 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:10.169
 strings this song we have it in the 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:10.169
