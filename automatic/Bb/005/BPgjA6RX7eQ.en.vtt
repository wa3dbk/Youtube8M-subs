00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.769
 yes dear colleagues dear colleagues 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.130
 I welcome you to the press conference 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.080
 our away game at hannover 96 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.240
 it will be about two and a half thousand 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.010
 accompany fans to Lower Saxony and 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.490
 tobias stieler is the referee 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.490
 the lot 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.830
 Peter the game tomorrow is one 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.990
 another part of the english week 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.480
 stand two games in the next four 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.100
 What are the special features about? 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.989
 view of the trainer in preparation 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:46.200
 on these games in no time 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:48.059
 after beautiful afternoon it goes in like that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.370
 a rhythm where all three four days in the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:57.510
 Game is about the physical 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.010
 to edit the area so that the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.660
 then get fit again at the games 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.049
 are 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:07.439
 from gfos we succeeded 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:11.280
 then you have the tension to build it up 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.920
 is actually nice for us so can 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.930
 little to do with that much 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.750
 burden is glad if I am all 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.490
 three days but would like to fight again 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.710
 to go in and so we are too 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.860
 We are happy to be prepared 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.150
 two difficult tasks that's clear though 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.400
 as you have sold quite well so far and 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.680
 Look like we did that on sunday too 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.470
 then if you review two games 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.720
 let pass as we then at 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.579
 the situation can be answered 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.680
 Thank you Peter, then you have the 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.850
 opportunity to ask your questions 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.850
 makes the beginning 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.030
 everything worked out already clarified 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:56.800
 great the bus goes right in but a 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:01.020
 few minutes but still joachim schmidt 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.020
 does not want to be able to force 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.070
 just from the front off the first question 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.110
 All players are fit and healthy 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.660
 changes in the squad compared to the 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.570
 same squad same card nothing 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.130
 changed to hannover in the last 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.480
 the home team Overather against against 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.540
 HSV have a double point 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.970
 played count you with similar us 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:36.520
 assume that it will be so 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:39.420
 we could play the last game 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.770
 was less successful 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.370
 We speculate so that's it too 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.560
 Run as well at the time of the game 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.950
 but we also know 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.709
 that you have several variants in the 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.940
 that is also possible for circles 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.840
 also it 4 2 3 1 in the play area 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.880
 usually from the persons of the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.600
 implement well but we expect 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.600
 with two tips 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:37.110
 Gladbach or second tip is so 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:38.760
 is 6 did not match but but 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.870
 I have the boys in the preparation 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:49.380
 yes trees went two peaks played like 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:50.900
 Otherwise, there is no surprise 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.670
 otherwise ask 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:58.500
 alexander haubrichs afterwards is migros 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.150
 By contrast, the body has a good plan 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.370
 canceled 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.100
 the expected how a plan looks against 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.280
 hannover from what can you already one 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.680
 look or do not really want many 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.940
 to care 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.299
 So that's what our game in the 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.590
 take next week month 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.989
 should mark what in the last 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.470
 four and also did that he 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:26.400
 Team work is the the 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.930
 club colors and the club so represents 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.640
 have seen about that with the 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.570
 commitment with the use of the 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.820
 continuous readiness 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:37.260
 So what is the virtues of the environment 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.930
 the people here in cologne again and again 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.440
 have called the bring the boys 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.970
 so far for perfection and that will 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.510
 our game also in the last one 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.490
 to accompany the next weeks as well 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.930
 otherwise if you look like the opponent 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.780
 really something for people to be 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.710
 we ourselves will be 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.710
 you will see then 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.040
 let's leave waiting to happen are 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.320
 No big surprises are always there 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.910
 only the question then the right one 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.910
 answer at the right time has 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.960
 There are still questions beyond that 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.080
 that does not look like that then i thank you 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.550
 me for your participation and wish 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:36.610
 Have a good trip to Hannover 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:42.840
