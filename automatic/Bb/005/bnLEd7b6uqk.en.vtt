00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
might have from LeBron James as he

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.510 
might have from LeBron James as he
approaches<00:02:00.490> free<00:02:01.060> agency<00:02:01.390> I<00:02:01.720> think<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:02.520> most

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
approaches free agency I think the most

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.219 
approaches free agency I think the most
important<00:02:04.000> thing<00:02:04.150> for<00:02:04.300> LeBron<00:02:04.630> right<00:02:04.870> now<00:02:05.050> is

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
important thing for LeBron right now is

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.740 
important thing for LeBron right now is
actually<00:02:05.410> to<00:02:05.650> find<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.100> structure<00:02:06.660> where<00:02:07.660> he's

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
actually to find a structure where he's

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.469 
actually to find a structure where he's
got<00:02:07.900> a<00:02:07.930> coach<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:08.410> he<00:02:08.470> respects<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.479> is

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
got a coach that he respects and is

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.080 
got a coach that he respects and is
working<00:02:11.020> hard<00:02:11.470> with<00:02:12.250> teammates<00:02:12.700> who<00:02:12.850> care

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
working hard with teammates who care

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.430 
working hard with teammates who care
about<00:02:13.180> him<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.570> if<00:02:13.660> that's<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:14.020> Cleveland

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
about him and if that's in Cleveland

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.170 
about him and if that's in Cleveland
then<00:02:14.590> he<00:02:14.709> should<00:02:14.890> stay<00:02:15.100> in<00:02:15.160> Cleveland<00:02:15.640> if<00:02:15.760> he

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
then he should stay in Cleveland if he

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.310 
then he should stay in Cleveland if he
doesn't<00:02:16.450> feel<00:02:16.570> I<00:02:16.600> can<00:02:16.900> get<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.170> there

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
doesn't feel I can get it there

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.230 
doesn't feel I can get it there
someplace<00:02:18.040> else<00:02:18.280> but<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.760> one<00:02:18.940> thing<00:02:19.150> I

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
someplace else but the one thing I

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.860 
someplace else but the one thing I
remember<00:02:19.420> about<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:21.280> Bulls<00:02:21.520> was<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.630> wasn't

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
remember about the Bulls was it wasn't

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.740 
remember about the Bulls was it wasn't
until<00:02:23.230> Michael<00:02:23.830> had<00:02:24.130> confidence<00:02:24.550> in<00:02:24.790> Phil

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
until Michael had confidence in Phil

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.830 
until Michael had confidence in Phil
Jackson<00:02:26.260> Scottie<00:02:27.040> Pippen<00:02:27.489> Horace<00:02:28.209> Grant<00:02:28.450> it

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
Jackson Scottie Pippen Horace Grant it

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.510 
Jackson Scottie Pippen Horace Grant it
wasn't<00:02:29.230> until<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.770> got<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.190> framework

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
wasn't until you got that framework

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.760 
wasn't until you got that framework
around<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.239> that<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.900> could<00:02:32.110> be<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.709> champion

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
around you that you could be a champion

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.699 
around you that you could be a champion
the<00:02:33.280> same<00:02:33.430> thing<00:02:33.670> happened<00:02:34.030> with<00:02:34.630> Kobe<00:02:35.020> first

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
the same thing happened with Kobe first

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.570 
the same thing happened with Kobe first
was<00:02:35.950> Shaq<00:02:36.220> but<00:02:36.489> then<00:02:36.670> later<00:02:37.420> with<00:02:37.830> Gasol<00:02:38.830> you

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
was Shaq but then later with Gasol you

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.240 
was Shaq but then later with Gasol you
know<00:02:39.670> he's<00:02:39.820> gotten<00:02:40.209> that<00:02:40.330> sense<00:02:40.780> of<00:02:41.020> a<00:02:41.650> team

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
know he's gotten that sense of a team

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.850 
know he's gotten that sense of a team
around<00:02:42.700> him<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:43.180> think<00:02:43.420> well<00:02:43.540> Bron<00:02:44.140> hasn't

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
around him and I think well Bron hasn't

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.290 
around him and I think well Bron hasn't
quite<00:02:45.040> been<00:02:45.100> able<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.670> get<00:02:45.880> that<00:02:46.000> yet<00:02:46.180> that's

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
quite been able to get that yet that's

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.910 
quite been able to get that yet that's
what<00:02:46.480> he<00:02:46.540> needs<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.810> find<00:02:47.050> could<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.770> on

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
what he needs to find could you on

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.830 
what he needs to find could you on
behalf<00:02:48.100> of<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.489> Bulls<00:02:48.670> throw<00:02:49.030> in<00:02:49.239> perhaps<00:02:49.600> a

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
behalf of the Bulls throw in perhaps a

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.830

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
NBA commissioner for a day what changes

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.140 
NBA commissioner for a day what changes
would<00:03:11.170> you<00:03:11.230> make<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:12.640> know<00:03:12.760> I'll<00:03:12.850> be<00:03:12.940> honest

would you make you know I'll be honest
with<00:03:13.299> you<00:03:13.390> I<00:03:13.420> think<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.959> game<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:15.220> is<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.820> a

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
with you I think the game is is it a

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.220 
with you I think the game is is it a
good<00:03:15.910> place<00:03:16.330> right<00:03:16.450> now<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.930> way<00:03:17.080> they're

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
good place right now the way they're

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.750 
good place right now the way they're
calling<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.680> game<00:03:17.830> right<00:03:17.980> now<00:03:18.040> returns

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
calling the game right now returns

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.060 
calling the game right now returns
basketball<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:19.780> where<00:03:20.530> it's<00:03:20.650> supposed<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:21.010> be

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
basketball to where it's supposed to be

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.920 
basketball to where it's supposed to be
more<00:03:21.459> of<00:03:21.549> a<00:03:21.610> finesse<00:03:21.790> game<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.690> biggest

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
more of a finesse game the biggest

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.199 
more of a finesse game the biggest
change<00:03:23.290> I'd<00:03:23.500> probably<00:03:23.709> propose<00:03:24.310> right<00:03:24.640> now<00:03:24.850> is

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
change I'd probably propose right now is

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.870 
change I'd probably propose right now is
the<00:03:26.170> Commissioner<00:03:26.530> needs<00:03:26.709> to<00:03:26.799> figure<00:03:27.040> out<00:03:27.190> how

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
the Commissioner needs to figure out how

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.310 
the Commissioner needs to figure out how
to<00:03:27.940> price<00:03:28.239> tickets<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:28.959> ordinary<00:03:29.110> people

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
to price tickets so that ordinary people

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.310 
to price tickets so that ordinary people
can<00:03:29.620> go<00:03:29.890> to<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.070> games<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.489> mean<00:03:30.760> I<00:03:30.790> think<00:03:30.910> that

can go to the games I mean I think that

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.170
