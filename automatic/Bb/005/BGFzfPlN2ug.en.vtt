mouth for what leasing is when that was

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:48.959 
mouth for what leasing is when that was
just<00:02:45.879> one<00:02:46.269> side<00:02:47.200> of<00:02:47.730> leasing<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:48.879> not

just one side of leasing and not

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:50.879 
just one side of leasing and not

which<00:02:52.959> is<00:02:53.079> what<00:02:53.199> volkswagen<00:02:53.799> does<00:02:53.949> and<00:02:54.189> it's

which is what volkswagen does and it's

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.189 
which is what volkswagen does and it's
something<00:02:54.489> that<00:02:54.849> i<00:02:54.879> think<00:02:55.109> one<00:02:56.109> of<00:02:56.139> the

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:56.199 
something that i think one of the

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.170 
something that i think one of the
reasons<00:02:56.530> why<00:02:56.829> we've<00:02:57.159> been<00:02:57.340> able<00:02:57.549> to<00:02:57.760> continue

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
reasons why we've been able to continue

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.089 
reasons why we've been able to continue

on with leasing for so long is because

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.970 
on with leasing for so long is because
our<00:03:00.819> residual<00:03:01.599> value<00:03:02.019> is<00:03:02.109> our<00:03:02.230> final<00:03:02.769> dollar

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
our residual value is our final dollar

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.679 
our residual value is our final dollar
amount<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.609> is<00:03:03.790> what<00:03:03.939> your<00:03:04.060> car<00:03:04.329> is<00:03:04.449> worth
