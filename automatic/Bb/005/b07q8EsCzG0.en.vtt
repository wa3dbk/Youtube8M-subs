00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:08.870
 So, let's start by preparing 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.099
 the skin is your comment clean I go 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:17.349
 To use a movie, I'm going to leave the law. 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:21.259
 power favor slideshare makeup 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:23.900
 I confess that the training so I 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.749
 I found this first great to leave the 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.390
 old goods skin for base application 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:31.759
 later but I did not think he minimized 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.420
 so many open fires that way 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.890
 it is well cremosinho just a little bit of 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.660
 look to spread on the face 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.200
 you really feel that 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.590
 soft skin and even your hand looks good 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.350
 I'm going to use eudora's help. 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.240
 handy mania side will leave all 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.590
 links there on the blog 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:58.700
 is this track yesterday is the factor's protection 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:02.030
 15 but here the beige 02 is applying the 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.129
 finger even if you want you can apply the 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:10.749
 corrective before but I want to apply with 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:15.799
 and he was chosen from the inside out 

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:19.310
 It is well liquid and it spreads very 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.869
 ease're in this great stage many 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.030
 people asked me if I already had 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.469
 experienced and had not yet done 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.030
 blog review but I found the quality 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.639
 It's very good indeed. 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.850
 I like to finish the powder 

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:37.520
 because I think so during the 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.409
 That's the day she leaves a little 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.020
 oily skin 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.579
 but she does not really let that 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:50.109
 Looks heavy I did not cut it anymore. 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.709
 Layer is very thin, it hides well 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:56.920
 treatment 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.920
 I'm going to use the little brush 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.860
 You can only see in the video more 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.060
 until the finish very dry so no 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.240
 you know as if you have not applied 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.390
 nothing at night and I particularly adore 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:16.280
 so bases on exposing yourself and hiding 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.340
 well she has good coverage good 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.450
 I applied the base to go well now I 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.770
 I come with corrective okay but can also 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:32.260
 to find there in the vain mania also loves 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.760
 this is the 1001 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.690
 I'll use a little of it because 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.900
 he 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:45.950
 it is well concentrated know but can 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:51.320
 talk to God by tapping him 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:56.110
 good looking looks spreads very easy 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.110
 but I really liked this collective 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:08.920
 to and now I'm going to finish the skin 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:14.410
 a vote that touch of eudora also 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.850
 ok this here is the caramel color it he 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.340
 has a slightly darker tone than the 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.050
 my skin 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.140
 But it's for you to see what to give us. 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.360
 if it equals a little color then it is the 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:31.420
 termite alone the cuddly that is the weight of the 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:33.630
 machine and flies with this 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.630
 powder 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.970
 He leaves supernatural hair well. 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.970
 light 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.540
 I was in love with Dora's style . 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:54.120
 not because I did not know it then 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.010
 It's been a while since I've been using 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.890
 you accompanying me know this and 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.130
 so passionate about it and is a 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.100
 good brand and good quality and 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.980
 knows that seeing good and cheap 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.480
 I think the box of karma yeshi 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.420
 accessible to you I think we 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.610
 would anyone can be beautiful 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.380
 wonderful and delicious powerful feels 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.239
 that woman is a makeup and not 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.410
 necessarily leave so much in this 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.880
 I'll show you guys, he kind of 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.560
 accumulated a little here does not have 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.830
 problems and it can even be condemned 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.190
 brush just not unexpected so on 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.110
 collective he will no longer accumulate it 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.450
 which always happens with most of the 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.120
 my products even as studio fix more 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.250
 mac hard only happens in the 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.870
 prolongation is not good 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:48.750
 I analyzed the skin to use this protection against 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.810
 tan effect that also deodorizes 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.690
 I love you too, you can count 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.280
 and has a well- defined effect on 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.740
 and how I want to give a 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.070
 natural finish not so heavy I 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.230
 I love this bronzer powder the direct use 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.050
 so he came to compensate for the cuddly so he 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:10.920
 already has a certain scintillation had a goal 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.790
 So I used it from the same west. 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.400
 I love you 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.210
 Look what beautiful people in the video they 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.210
 can see are seeing this effect 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.210
 pretty 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.140
 I love this style sabit middle skin 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.180
 tanned 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:33.930
 but it's ok white 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:37.160
 I'll only give one by one with 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.160
 a tool my eyebrow 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.020
 I'll give a brown or opaque shadow 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.860

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.860

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:09.120
 get around to just thinking people because 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:16.710

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:18.680

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:23.010
