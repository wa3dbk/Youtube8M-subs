00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.490
 we just do it 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.830
 Lessings from a part of water 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.119
 different vegetable fats 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.369
 any sweeteners 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.039
 for example dried fruit agaves 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.529
 thick juice solid or the like and then 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:36.309
 Let's take some of her sharpness 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.370
 with some salty or gardening pleasure 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.100
 or a combination of the whole of her 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.089
 can all ingredients with their own others 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.280
 Replace ingredients 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.530
 you can run your creativity free 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.519
 Let each ingredient is by another 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.110
 to replace 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.760
 has similar properties 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.369
 for example, now of course 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.170
 instead of using olive oil with it 

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:58.030
 the taste changes or we 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.519
 use various other oilseeds 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.739
 just to achieve the same effect 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:06.189
 a combination of 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.080
 I say fat and sugar 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.729
 always gives a good taste 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.250
 Of course we try that on one 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.630
 healthy way added 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.240
 Let yourself be surprised and tried 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.250
 Please yourself something from him now a raw food 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.470
 we need to prepare dressing 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.930
 different substances just now 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.930
 ever tell what I will you 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.960
 fill in reverse osmosis water 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.110
 we have the water for once 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.710
 next part completely here in the form of 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.710
 olive oil 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:51.899
 next we add more fat 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.899
 to take low-cost mandl puree 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.460
 excels for dressings 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.450
 for all kinds of sweets around 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:09.220
 to adjust almond milk 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:12.600
 for this stretching about 1 tablespoon us 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.600
 lasts a long time, you have to say 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.110
 and more falls here I stop 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:25.799
 Together illegal from the bio market 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.799
 planting prohibited anyway 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:48.909
 then we come for the most part 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.909
 I have dried berries here 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:03:04.370
 that's what she did 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:07.370
 Some salt will be mine now 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.359
 probably put on the pranger 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.769
 that I can not tolerate salt with oilseeds 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:17.900
 but I still do it because it tastes good 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:23.859
 because I have no negative yet 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.859
 could determine testify impact 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.379
 then the fence part offers without 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.489
 we think they are for some 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.659
 maybe a little too sour 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:58.030
 then a little less 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:04:00.409
 take what is missing now 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.049
 additional does the driveway will 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.609
 taste a bit better 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:10.280
 I'll take fresh food here now 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:11.659
 Herbs and something a pity 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.239
 I like to come here from the garden 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:20.470
 Few fresh herbs brought and one 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:22.970
 very spicy chili fresh herbs 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.910
 in my opinion belong almost in 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.259
 every pressing in 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:43.150
 the candlestick taste very strong yet 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:46.520
 a little something of that is refined 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:51.050
 just grown now into 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:54.490
 Interest does not have to be so small 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.490
 stone come to you witchcraft 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:15.879
 so still the mix essay on it and into it 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.879
 in the personal blender 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:42.489
 The salad dressing is done now 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:48.189
 first taste 

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:51.739
 if you miss something tastes very good 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:52.039
 often also with garlic 

00:05:51.739 --> 00:05:53.629
 purely 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:06:01.099
 I want that but now my wife 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:06:03.429
 spare i show it again so here 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:07.789
 is now the courage with the life 

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:08.360
 I made the hope that the video has you 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:09.860
 like 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.809
 I wish you much fun 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.809
 Try it and see you next time
