historically solar has been forced to

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.360 
historically solar has been forced to
choose<00:00:10.809> between<00:00:10.870> maintaining<00:00:11.680> a<00:00:11.709> situational

choose between maintaining a situational

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.830 
choose between maintaining a situational
awareness<00:00:12.459> or<00:00:12.910> protecting<00:00:13.450> the<00:00:13.510> hearing<00:00:13.750> on

awareness or protecting the hearing on

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.299 
awareness or protecting the hearing on
the<00:00:13.930> battlefield<00:00:14.410> so<00:00:14.709> we've<00:00:14.860> got<00:00:15.010> to<00:00:15.129> find

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
the battlefield so we've got to find

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.010 
the battlefield so we've got to find
some<00:00:15.459> technologies<00:00:16.090> that<00:00:16.299> give<00:00:16.420> you<00:00:16.600> both<00:00:16.810> one

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
some technologies that give you both one

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.320 
some technologies that give you both one
increased<00:00:17.740> situational<00:00:18.430> awareness<00:00:18.520> so

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
increased situational awareness so

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.179 
increased situational awareness so
increased<00:00:19.840> hearing<00:00:20.230> and<00:00:20.380> then<00:00:20.680> protection

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
increased hearing and then protection

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:22.919 
increased hearing and then protection
from<00:00:21.369> impulse<00:00:21.789> noise<00:00:22.029> and<00:00:22.330> sustained<00:00:22.689> noise

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
hear soft sounds well so the ideal

hear soft sounds well so the ideal
solution<00:01:42.759> is<00:01:42.939> something<00:01:43.390> like<00:01:43.570> a<00:01:43.600> TCAPS
