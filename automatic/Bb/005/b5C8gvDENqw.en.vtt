here which is very strong from a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.610 
here which is very strong from a
Catalina<00:00:42.989> tree

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
Catalina tree

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.010 
Catalina tree
Catalina<00:00:44.489> makes<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.820> very<00:00:44.940> strong<00:00:45.120> tree<00:00:45.750> big

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
Catalina makes a very strong tree big

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.279 
Catalina makes a very strong tree big
seed<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.940> very<00:00:47.940> strong<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.719> could<00:00:48.870> see<00:00:49.110> how

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
seed and very strong you could see how

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.770 
seed and very strong you could see how
strong<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.950> how<00:00:50.480> thick<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.719> trunk<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.860> a

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
strong and how thick this trunk is on a

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.020 
strong and how thick this trunk is on a
13<00:00:54.780> inch<00:00:55.370> plant<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:58.219> I've<00:00:59.219> selected<00:00:59.460> some<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
13 inch plant so I've selected some of

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.900 
13 inch plant so I've selected some of
the<00:01:00.180> board<00:01:00.420> wood<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.309> now<00:01:02.309> we're<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.730> to

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the board wood and now we're going to

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.670 
the board wood and now we're going to
prepare<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:04.220> this<00:01:05.220> looks<00:01:05.519> very<00:01:05.580> good

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
prepare it this looks very good

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.350 
prepare it this looks very good
the<00:01:08.930> but<00:01:09.930> our<00:01:10.260> flower<00:01:11.250> buds<00:01:11.580> are<00:01:11.729> ready<00:01:12.150> to

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
the but our flower buds are ready to

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.620 
the but our flower buds are ready to
open<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.710> few<00:01:13.740> days<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.450> we're

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
open in a few days so this is what we're

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.469 
open in a few days so this is what we're
going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.930> use<00:01:16.130> there<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.250> lot<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.790> activity

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
going to use there is a lot of activity

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.340 
going to use there is a lot of activity
in<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.900> bud<00:01:19.200> wood<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:21.240> idea<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:21.930> we

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
in this bud wood and the idea is that we

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.300 
in this bud wood and the idea is that we
hope<00:01:23.000> it<00:01:24.000> will<00:01:24.270> continue<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.380> activity<00:01:25.590> with

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
hope it will continue that activity with

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.830 
hope it will continue that activity with
Without<00:01:26.850> Really<00:01:26.880> stopping<00:01:29.659> we're<00:01:30.659> gonna

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
Without Really stopping we're gonna

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.920 
Without Really stopping we're gonna
check<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.590> see<00:01:31.920> which<00:01:32.400> one<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.150> area<00:01:33.780> that

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
check to see which one is the area that

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.140 
check to see which one is the area that
has<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.380> best<00:01:34.619> matching<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.520> think<00:01:35.939> it's

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
has the best matching so I think it's

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.039 
has the best matching so I think it's
this<00:01:36.420> one<00:01:36.659> here<00:01:37.970> we<00:01:38.970> go<00:01:39.119> into<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.570> capitate

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
this one here we go into the capitate

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.219 
this one here we go into the capitate
tree<00:01:40.439> right<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:40.890> here

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.320 

we're<00:01:46.830> first<00:01:47.189> I'm<00:01:47.729> gonna<00:01:47.939> cut<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.810> budwood<00:01:50.330> to

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
we're first I'm gonna cut the budwood to

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.969 
we're first I'm gonna cut the budwood to
make<00:01:51.540> sure<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.750> get<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.020> good<00:01:52.080> cut<00:01:52.470> before<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
make sure I get a good cut before I the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:20.690 
make sure I get a good cut before I the
copy<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.460> Mike

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:34.270 

like<00:02:21.700> it's<00:02:22.030> going

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.600 

I<00:02:35.740> change<00:02:36.740> but<00:02:37.010> what<00:02:37.240> because<00:02:38.240> I<00:02:38.420> think<00:02:38.480> this

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
I change but what because I think this

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.790 
I change but what because I think this
might<00:02:40.610> give<00:02:40.819> me<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:41.000> better<00:02:41.240> shot<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:42.140> what<00:02:42.709> I'm

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
might give me a better shot and what I'm

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.260 
might give me a better shot and what I'm
going<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.130> do<00:02:43.280> I'm<00:02:43.430> going<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.850> capitate

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
going to do I'm going to the capitate

00:02:44.270 --> 00:03:38.350 
going to do I'm going to the capitate
here

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.220 

make<00:03:39.360> sure<00:03:39.570> were<00:03:39.660> lined<00:03:39.840> up<00:03:40.280> real<00:03:41.280> well<00:03:42.230> start

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
make sure were lined up real well start

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.630 
make sure were lined up real well start
tightening<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.830> want<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.070> leave<00:03:44.190> those<00:03:44.340> leaves

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
tightening I want to leave those leaves

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:58.229 
tightening I want to leave those leaves
there<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:44.910> don't<00:03:45.090> think<00:03:45.210> they<00:03:45.450> could<00:03:45.630> hurt

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:16.120 

that's<00:03:58.870> enough<00:03:59.260> I<00:03:59.680> think

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.940 

then<00:04:16.880> I'm<00:04:17.090> going<00:04:17.390> to<00:04:17.450> now<00:04:18.410> that<00:04:18.620> I<00:04:18.650> know<00:04:18.770> I<00:04:18.920> have

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
then I'm going to now that I know I have

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.400 
then I'm going to now that I know I have
some<00:04:21.950> decent<00:04:24.730> I'm<00:04:25.730> going<00:04:26.120> to<00:04:26.330> cover<00:04:27.110> it<00:04:27.320> up

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
some decent I'm going to cover it up

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:42.360 
some decent I'm going to cover it up
with<00:04:27.620> a<00:04:27.650> powerful<00:04:38.830> hopefully<00:04:39.830> this<00:04:40.420> fire<00:04:41.420> film

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
with a powerful hopefully this fire film

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.710 
with a powerful hopefully this fire film
would<00:04:43.370> help<00:04:43.670> for<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.030> first<00:04:44.270> few<00:04:44.510> hours

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
would help for the first few hours

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:58.360 
would help for the first few hours
retain<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.890> humidity<00:04:47.710> inside<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:49.160> but<00:04:50.120> would

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.470 

done<00:04:59.830> we<00:05:00.830> put<00:05:01.040> the<00:05:01.160> date<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.640> the<00:05:01.880> variety

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
done we put the date and the variety

ideally<00:05:09.200> this<00:05:09.920> should<00:05:10.220> work<00:05:10.670> because<00:05:11.740> it

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
ideally this should work because it

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.410 
ideally this should work because it
everything<00:05:13.190> is<00:05:13.250> so<00:05:13.400> fresh<00:05:13.640> the<00:05:13.970> tools<00:05:14.330> are

everything is so fresh the tools are

everything is so fresh the tools are
complicated<00:05:15.040> within<00:05:16.040> seconds<00:05:16.550> of<00:05:16.930> cutting

the<00:05:18.890> board<00:05:19.130> would<00:05:19.250> was<00:05:19.580> inserted<00:05:20.210> in<00:05:20.360> here<00:05:20.690> and

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
the board would was inserted in here and

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.160 
the board would was inserted in here and
there<00:05:21.260> is<00:05:21.350> no<00:05:21.440> reason<00:05:21.650> why<00:05:21.950> this<00:05:22.010> should<00:05:22.370> fail

we'll<00:05:24.170> monitor<00:05:24.590> it<00:05:24.920> I<00:05:25.010> will<00:05:25.190> follow<00:05:25.430> it<00:05:25.670> up
