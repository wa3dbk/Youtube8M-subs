00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.380
 and the 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.219
 to those of the wta sanchez for moms 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.260
 latinas and in this video today I'm going to 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.509
 teach how to make this makeup that is 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.710
 unconventional with black lips and 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.960
 I have not many will like them 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.090
 for other people who dare to 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.770
 use it on very dark lips and if 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.050
 suddenly you still do not dare to 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.239
 use completely black lips you can 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.910
 opt for a very dark vinotinto color 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.129
 or in purple well dark I hope that you 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.739
 like this video and let's see how it 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.079
 Let's start with a big band 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.579
 we are going to put it on the whole face and this 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.920
 is going to make our skin hydrate and 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.050
 the tone looks more uniform 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.149
 now let's go with our eyes let's do 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.909
 a short brush and we are going to apply a 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.100
 shadow coffee candy in the outline of 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.659
 our eyelids that just for 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.390
 define more the shape of our eyes 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.839
 that are deeper and much more 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.839
 big 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.159
 let's see to apply a little bit of base 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.590
 for shadows in the center of our 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.570
 eyelids with the ring finger and go 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.280
 to begin to blur towards the 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.200
 inside corner of our blogs 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.880
 the eyes this is going to help the 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.680
 shadow that we put on it is more 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.869
 pigmented and we are a little more 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.630
 illuminated we go back to blur 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.430
 again the outline and we mark it a 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.060
 little bit more to make it look a little more 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.060
 definite 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.400
 let's go now with the eyebrows I'm going to use a 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.050
 pencil to leave you anastasia but 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.510
 stiff and extends the tip well 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.400
 so I can create more or 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.250
 less like little hairs I like to create 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.470
 a line below the eyebrow above the 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.870
 eyebrow and then start filling it in 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.940
 inside creating as I tell you about 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.220
 little hairs drawing more or less than one 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.380
 by one so that the eyebrows look more 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.010
 natural and note the texture of vellitos 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.010
 In the eyebrow 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.180
 we go with our other eyebrows 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.060
 intellectual understand that eyebrows that 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.280
 in the most similar possible the eyebrows 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.630
 are twin sisters then I do not know 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.119
 stress if they do not manage to remain 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.340
 We are going to put a little bit of 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.620
 concealer now under the eyebrows for 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.350
 clean the edges that are made more 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.350
 definite illuminated and much cleaner 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.520
 let's now seal the corrector that 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.670
 we did with a shade of vanilla 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.770
 mate and now on the mobile eyelid where 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.530
 we put the base for shadows first 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.840
 let's put a tone like clarito copper 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.520
 and we will concentrate it after 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.260
 put it on the entire eyelid in the corner 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.170
 outside to make it a bit more 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.880
 strong there again we come back with the 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.680
 big brush and we're going to blur a 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.140
 little bit that edge between the contour and the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.480
 copper shadow that we put with eyeliner 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.400
 black in pencil let's outline the line 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.900
 of the tabs and there would be based a 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.150
 little but it does not matter because in sum 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.680
 goes the eyeliner and we're also going to 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.710
 delineate the bottom of the line 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.240
 of water and the line of the eyelashes 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.950
 we blur with a brochet and the same 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.990
 coffee tone that we put in the contour 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.150
 so that black does not look so strong 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.180
 so marked but it looks like more 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.560
 smoked we do the same in both eyes and 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.370
 now we are going to apply the eyeliner 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.930
 liquid we are going to extend a line towards 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.060
 out and then we're going to connect it with 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.370
 the rest of the eyelids as creating a 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.890
 triangle and then filling it 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.069
 connecting it on the line of the 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.709
 tabs 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.389
 we do the same to the other side if you 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.999
 they want can be guided as per their 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.829
 eyebrows to make it look as close 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:37.829
 possible the delineate and then we put 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.469
 put in is possible to show here 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.849
 I'm adding a corrector that is a 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:43.709
 tone as mari I remove my skin is 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.810
 yellowish then my illuminations 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.489
 they must be little yellow version 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.260
 I'm going to put the high points of the face 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.780
 which is below my cheekbones of the center 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.969
 of the nose the forehead and the chin and I go 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.159
 to begin to blur so much touches 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:59.069
 so that everything is well blurred and 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.019
 I have a good coverage I'm going now 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.450
 the contours that should be about 23 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.949
 darker tones than my skin and it's a 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.030
 cream product what I'm putting 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:08.609
 so I can with a brush 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.069
 synthetic under my cheekbones under 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.480
 from the jaw line a grandmother ' 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.189
 tip of the nose and around me 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.659
 front this is to mark the angles 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:18.120
 of my face and make my face look 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.070
 more defined and in some places a bit 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.350
 thinnest 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.050
 let's blur with this big brush 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.520
 so you do not notice where the 1's are and 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.390
 you will achieve but be all right 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.390
 blurred 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.780
 let's fail now with loose powders 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.300
 translucent so the face does not shine 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.039
 and the makeup will not run if 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.650
 they realize today by tapping for 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.960
 not dead of makeup and going on 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.599
 lips I'm going to use this pencil that is 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.069
 a dark purple tone because I do not have 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.900
 black pencil for the lips but 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:50.490
 we could equally use one for 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.050
 eyes without problem 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.180
 I'm going to delineate them very well and 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.349
 fill them and then with my lipstick 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.569
 black 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:00.029
 I'm going to fill my lips 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:02.279
 for now I'm going to finish putting the 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:04.979
 illuminator in the upper parts of the 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:07.770
 face my cheekbones and now if I put in the 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:10.919
 villa them and putting on all the lip 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.259
 up and down and what the pineapple does is 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.990
 create as a base so that the black of 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:19.009
 life looks very dark and it will be 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.009
 really black 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.840
 that's how the makeup was 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.390
 finished I hope you liked it 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.860
 very much and above all dare to put it 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.930
 in practice remember that makeup 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.590
 floor makeup and I know when they like it 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.020
 you can clean it 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.480
 and well this was all the video I hope 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.760
 that you liked it very much we'll see you 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.920
 then on a next occasion they 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.920
 I send a big kiss bye
