but you can kind of see there and that's

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.850 
but you can kind of see there and that's
one<00:03:27.520> reason<00:03:27.550> why<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:27.940> like<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.209> too<00:03:28.510> but<00:03:29.230> if

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
one reason why I like it too but if

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.350 
one reason why I like it too but if
you're<00:03:30.100> afraid<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.430> water<00:03:30.730> which<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.150> probably

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
you're afraid of water which I probably

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.820 
you're afraid of water which I probably
will<00:03:31.600> put<00:03:31.780> this<00:03:31.870> on<00:03:32.050> now<00:03:32.080> but<00:03:32.470> maybe<00:03:32.590> for

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
will put this on now but maybe for

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.290 
will put this on now but maybe for
winter<00:03:33.150> they<00:03:34.150> make<00:03:34.360> a<00:03:34.890> hydro<00:03:35.890> sock<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:37.360> it's<00:03:37.900> a

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
winter they make a hydro sock so it's a

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.940 
winter they make a hydro sock so it's a
repellent<00:03:40.350> pre-filter<00:03:41.350> this<00:03:41.560> goes<00:03:41.709> right

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
repellent pre-filter this goes right

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.190 
repellent pre-filter this goes right
over<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.220> filter<00:03:42.610> so<00:03:43.240> it<00:03:43.510> took<00:03:43.750> me<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.930> lot<00:03:44.140> of

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
over the filter so it took me a lot of

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.480 
over the filter so it took me a lot of
research<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.680> figure<00:03:44.830> out<00:03:45.100> which<00:03:45.280> one<00:03:45.459> of

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
research to figure out which one of

really<00:05:48.990> nicely<00:05:49.500> made<00:05:50.930> nice<00:05:51.930> and<00:05:52.169> blown<00:05:53.360> mounts

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
really nicely made nice and blown mounts

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.480 
really nicely made nice and blown mounts
right<00:05:54.419> in<00:05:54.660> here<00:05:54.840> now<00:05:55.020> with<00:05:55.200> the<00:05:55.320> 14<00:05:55.830> you'll<00:05:56.220> see

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
right in here now with the 14 you'll see

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.210 
right in here now with the 14 you'll see
I'm<00:05:56.970> upside<00:05:57.540> down<00:05:57.750> but<00:05:57.990> is<00:05:58.590> actually<00:05:59.010> gonna<00:05:59.130> be

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
I'm upside down but is actually gonna be

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.210 
I'm upside down but is actually gonna be
a<00:05:59.400> hole<00:05:59.700> here<00:06:00.120> there's<00:06:00.570> actually<00:06:01.110> a<00:06:01.350> clip<00:06:01.980> from

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
a hole here there's actually a clip from

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.400 
a hole here there's actually a clip from
the<00:06:02.310> headlight<00:06:03.210> harness<00:06:03.390> sticking<00:06:04.260> through

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
the headlight harness sticking through

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.780 
the headlight harness sticking through
that<00:06:04.620> so<00:06:04.800> you<00:06:04.890> kind<00:06:05.070> of<00:06:05.100> have<00:06:05.220> to<00:06:05.250> cut<00:06:05.580> that<00:06:05.730> off

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
that so you kind of have to cut that off

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.909 
that so you kind of have to cut that off
and<00:06:06.330> run<00:06:06.900> that<00:06:07.050> through<00:06:07.200> because<00:06:07.560> this<00:06:07.680> kid<00:06:07.890> is

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
and run that through because this kid is

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.470 
and run that through because this kid is
actually<00:06:08.130> for<00:06:08.400> a<00:06:08.430> 2012<00:06:09.150> 2013<00:06:10.640> SRT<00:06:11.640> Jeep<00:06:11.880> but<00:06:12.120> it

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
actually for a 2012 2013 SRT Jeep but it

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.250 
actually for a 2012 2013 SRT Jeep but it
fits<00:06:12.780> the<00:06:12.900> 14<00:06:13.260> because<00:06:13.440> this<00:06:13.590> is<00:06:13.710> the<00:06:13.830> 14<00:06:14.250> so

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
fits the 14 because this is the 14 so

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.240 
fits the 14 because this is the 14 so
you<00:06:16.260> just<00:06:16.410> wind<00:06:16.590> up<00:06:16.710> it<00:06:16.860> gives<00:06:16.980> you<00:06:17.040> all<00:06:17.130> the

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
you just wind up it gives you all the

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.770 
you just wind up it gives you all the
grommets<00:06:17.700> you<00:06:17.760> want<00:06:17.940> to<00:06:18.030> put<00:06:18.180> in<00:06:18.270> your

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
grommets you want to put in your

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.780 
grommets you want to put in your
the<00:06:19.470> air<00:06:19.650> sensor<00:06:20.010> any<00:06:20.160> temperature<00:06:20.490> not<00:06:20.670> sure

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
the air sensor any temperature not sure

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.140 
the air sensor any temperature not sure
your<00:06:21.450> hose<00:06:22.200> goes<00:06:22.470> right<00:06:22.650> back<00:06:22.800> on<00:06:23.040> two<00:06:23.790> clamps

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
your hose goes right back on two clamps

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.990 
your hose goes right back on two clamps
on<00:06:24.300> it<00:06:24.630> took<00:06:25.200> me<00:06:25.320> because<00:06:25.500> I<00:06:25.530> took<00:06:25.590> my<00:06:25.830> time<00:06:26.100> I

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
on it took me because I took my time I

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.060 
on it took me because I took my time I
don't<00:06:27.690> know<00:06:27.750> if<00:06:27.840> 30<00:06:28.050> minutes<00:06:28.410> to<00:06:28.530> install<00:06:28.650> it

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
don't know if 30 minutes to install it

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.610 
don't know if 30 minutes to install it
but<00:06:29.250> it's<00:06:29.430> not<00:06:29.610> bad<00:06:29.940> at<00:06:30.120> all<00:06:30.410> so<00:06:31.410> it's<00:06:31.500> pretty

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
but it's not bad at all so it's pretty

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.560 
but it's not bad at all so it's pretty
much<00:06:31.740> it<00:06:32.070> I<00:06:32.100> mean<00:06:32.430> definitely<00:06:32.910> pick<00:06:33.360> these<00:06:33.510> up

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.570 
much it I mean definitely pick these up

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.080 
much it I mean definitely pick these up
I<00:06:34.020> believe<00:06:34.800> they<00:06:35.130> have<00:06:35.310> them<00:06:35.460> in<00:06:35.580> stock<00:06:35.700> right

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
I believe they have them in stock right

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.620 
I believe they have them in stock right
now<00:06:36.950> they<00:06:37.950> do<00:06:38.010> make<00:06:38.460> the<00:06:38.970> polished<00:06:39.420> in<00:06:39.570> a

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
now they do make the polished in a

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.120 
now they do make the polished in a
wrinkle<00:06:39.960> black<00:06:40.110> the<00:06:40.320> polish<00:06:40.620> is<00:06:40.770> actually<00:06:41.100> a

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
wrinkle black the polish is actually a

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.730 
wrinkle black the polish is actually a
little<00:06:41.280> bit<00:06:41.430> easier<00:06:41.700> to<00:06:41.760> get<00:06:42.000> I<00:06:42.030> believe<00:06:42.420> and<00:06:42.740> I

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
little bit easier to get I believe and I

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.610 
little bit easier to get I believe and I
actually<00:06:44.730> wanted<00:06:45.360> the<00:06:45.480> wrinkle<00:06:45.780> black<00:06:46.020> just

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
actually wanted the wrinkle black just

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.100 
actually wanted the wrinkle black just
for<00:06:46.830> subtle<00:06:47.240> the<00:06:48.240> subtle<00:06:48.540> look<00:06:48.660> that<00:06:48.840> it<00:06:48.930> has

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
for subtle the subtle look that it has

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.170 
for subtle the subtle look that it has
but<00:06:49.410> I<00:06:49.710> kind<00:06:50.190> of<00:06:50.220> like<00:06:50.400> the<00:06:50.520> Polish<00:06:50.880> doesn't

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
but I kind of like the Polish doesn't

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.330
