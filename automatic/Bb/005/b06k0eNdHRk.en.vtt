00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 
have plain nail mV which I do I think

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.020 
have plain nail mV which I do I think
plain<00:06:52.830> is<00:06:53.009> really<00:06:53.280> good<00:06:53.400> because<00:06:53.759> then<00:06:53.909> you

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
plain is really good because then you

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.610 
plain is really good because then you
can<00:06:54.210> just<00:06:54.240> apply<00:06:54.630> whatever<00:06:54.930> color<00:06:55.259> you'd<00:06:55.440> like

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
can just apply whatever color you'd like

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.920 
can just apply whatever color you'd like
but<00:06:55.860> if<00:06:56.009> you<00:06:56.159> just<00:06:56.340> want<00:06:56.550> to<00:06:56.610> put<00:06:56.909> a<00:06:57.090> pink<00:06:57.719> color

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
but if you just want to put a pink color

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.779 
but if you just want to put a pink color
with<00:06:58.379> the<00:06:58.530> nail<00:06:58.710> strengthener<00:06:59.190> in<00:06:59.219> it<00:06:59.550> then

00:06:59.779 --> 00:06:59.789 
with the nail strengthener in it then

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:01.640 
with the nail strengthener in it then
that's<00:07:00.300> fine<00:07:00.719> if<00:07:00.960> you're<00:07:01.169> an<00:07:01.289> on-the-go

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
that's fine if you're an on-the-go

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.129 
that's fine if you're an on-the-go
person<00:07:02.190> and<00:07:02.400> you<00:07:02.490> like<00:07:02.729> color<00:07:03.030> but<00:07:03.870> you<00:07:03.900> also

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 
person and you like color but you also

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:06.499
