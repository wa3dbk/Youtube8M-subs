00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.430
 how to put a cladding klein level of 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.560
 hammer difficulty 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.480
 dress your outer walls while 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.150
 protecting against moisture and 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.220
 infiltrations an elegant solution that 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.320
 also allows to integrate an insulation of 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.510
 the house from the outside in all 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.770
 discretion 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.550
 you will need a rain screen 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.070
 breathing in klein core of ITO 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.250
 grids anti rodent profiles 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.890
 stainless steel two-peg tip 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.309
 through-screw profile and 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.309
 angles 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.970
 equip yourself with a meter of a rule of 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.610
 mason from a spirit level of a chalk to 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.340
 powder from a screwdriver drill from a 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:58.700
 hammer of a handsaw and 10.6 to 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:01.790
 miter cut protect from moisture 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.620
 by laying a film by rain the wall 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.290
 receives cleats regularly 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.270
 spaced that keeps an air gap all 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.630
 serving as a support for the clapboard 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.330
 cladding wood a free space of 20 cm 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.869
 underbody limits the contact with 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.700
 any rainwater splashes 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.710
 started by tracing the starting line 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.010
 from the chalk line break 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.690
 respect the distance of 20 cm with 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.580
 floor 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.060
 a rain screen ensures watertightness 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.830
 from the wall while letting it breathe 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.900
 subsequently pressed against the wall by 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.990
 the vertical battens this membrane 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.040
 sealing and provisionally fixed by 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.409
 some spikes 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.290
 expect a lapse of time between them 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.229
 10 cm in the horizontal direction and 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.030
 five centimeters in the vertical direction 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.180
 for a break decline horizontally 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.970
 the battens of 40 by 27 mm section 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.490
 must be fixed vertically 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.009
 placed the first bed early on the edge of 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.170
 wall on the rain screen and check his 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.780
 plumb before fixing by peg 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.410
 through to respect the spacing 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.989
 between litho which varies between 30 and 60 cm 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.330
 according to the model of klein chosen cut 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:19.320
 two pins to seven lengths position 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.769
 the following rise lite control his 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.550
 Plumbed then fixed by ankle 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:29.010
 through-think restate 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.140
 cuts of lithos at the bottom and top of the 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.450
 lithos install an anti grid 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.700
 rodents that also serves to ensure 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.130
 good ventilation behind the clapboard 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.410
 set the apostle the walls with 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.130
 through pegs for more 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.260
 discretion 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.510
 you can also place the grid 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:51.510
 anti rodents between the wall and the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:55.049
 There are three types of 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.120
 fixing not visible fixing to put 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.459
 implemented for blades in patents 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.190
 Weak width like the model presented 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.680
 in the video a fixation by support is 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.950
 necessary placed at the top in 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.109
 the visible fixing chamfer to put 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.720
 implemented for blades in patents 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.570
 low width a fixation by support 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.450
 must be mirrored 15 mm from the bottom of 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.280
 the visible fixing groove to put 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.910
 for patent slides 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.769
 wide fixing by support to 1/3 and 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.239
 two- thirds the width of the blade 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.400
 are necessary 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.169
 set the starting profile at the bottom of 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.880
 lithos by checking his 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.880
 horizontality high level bubble 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.870
 make a sharp cut for an angle 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.020
 returning wintuk misses for an angle 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.690
 outgoing then placed the first blade 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.030
 on the starting profile with the language 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.160
 is up 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.890
 depending on the model the blink can be fixed 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.590
 by screwing or cloud apparent age or not 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.750
 apparent or so by clipping here on 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.610
 uses stainless steel tips that must 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.190
 sinking into the wood of the bed early on 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.400
 at least 22 mm with thicknesses 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:12.030
 respective 19 mm for our blades and 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.700
 27 mm for nolito spikes of 45 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.040
 mm are enough depressed your spikes embiez 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.590
 next to clit cat at the bottom of the 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.860
 tongue so that the interlocking of the 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.310
 next slide hide the bindings the 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.750
 Blades nesting end in prolongation 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.380
 unnecessary greenhouse and some blades 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.320
 to others 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.020
 on the contrary to handle them this pass ensures 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.690
 free expansion of wood areas 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.670
 of cuts made on treated clapboard 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.980
 or bread should not become 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.870
 weak points apply the same 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.490
 finishing treatment on the areas of 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.380
 sawing before fixing the rectified blades 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.360
 engaged the blade of the next row with the 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.730
 possible fall and help to make it 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.970
 go down into the groove with a hold 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:59.340
 martyrs nailed on the same principle to 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.920
 language level is and next to 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.900
 clit cat arrange yourself to stagger 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:09.570
 the junctions of the blades of a row on 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:12.030
 water you can either use a 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.180
 recessed angle profile that masks the 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:18.000
 binding as here carried out with care 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.550
 bies a full cut to ensure 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.830
 corner binding field counterclockwise very 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.080
 discreet for the outgoing angles you 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.650
 can either use an angle iron or 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.120
 make a careful cut of the clain 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.280
 adding his finishing touch the 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.960
 Corner angle outgoing also offers 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.870
 protection against shocks 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.940
 possible by choosing wood decline 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.830
 processed to heart under pressure you 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.930
 enjoy a long-term guarantee 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.200
 from ten to twenty years depending on the essence 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.920
 chosen and the surface finish 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.570
