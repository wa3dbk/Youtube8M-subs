00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
bench still trying to figure out not

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.820 
bench still trying to figure out not
really<00:00:30.300> figure<00:00:30.599> out<00:00:30.630> we're<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:31.109> trying<00:00:31.800> to

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
really figure out we're just trying to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.950 
really figure out we're just trying to
get<00:00:31.949> better<00:00:32.300> defensively<00:00:33.300> that's<00:00:33.660> my

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
get better defensively that's my

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.549 
get better defensively that's my
probably<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:35.480> point<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.600> contention<00:00:37.020> for<00:00:37.290> me

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
probably the point of contention for me

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.100 
probably the point of contention for me
starting<00:00:37.800> right<00:00:38.160> now<00:00:38.190> as<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.700> just<00:00:38.940> I'm<00:00:39.899> not

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
very good defensively i'm giving up way

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.790 
very good defensively i'm giving up way
too<00:00:42.149> many<00:00:42.390> points<00:00:42.660> from<00:00:42.960> my<00:00:43.140> guy<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.680> I'm

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
too many points from my guy that I'm

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.369 
too many points from my guy that I'm
defending<00:00:44.190> against<00:00:44.930> offensively<00:00:45.930> I'm<00:00:46.200> able

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
defending against offensively I'm able

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.040 
defending against offensively I'm able
to<00:00:46.530> pretty<00:00:47.460> much<00:00:47.700> do<00:00:48.059> what<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.270> want<00:00:48.570> I'm<00:00:48.870> able

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
to pretty much do what I want I'm able

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.459 
to pretty much do what I want I'm able
to<00:00:49.550> make<00:00:50.550> space<00:00:50.850> when<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.210> need<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.660> my<00:00:52.260> guys

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
to make space when I need to my guys

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.740 
to make space when I need to my guys
able<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.890> hit<00:00:53.100> open<00:00:53.309> jumpers<00:00:53.969> legacy<00:00:54.629> I'll

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
able to hit open jumpers legacy I'll

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.260 
able to hit open jumpers legacy I'll
take<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.110> just<00:00:55.350> drive<00:00:55.559> right<00:00:55.590> past<00:00:55.890> me<00:00:56.460> luckily

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
take I just drive right past me luckily

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.580 
take I just drive right past me luckily
you<00:00:57.480> missed<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.989> was<00:00:58.170> able<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.469> get<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
you missed it and I was able to get the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.330 
you missed it and I was able to get the
rebound<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.840> I<00:01:00.840> am<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> defensive<00:01:02.129> liability

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
rebound but I am a defensive liability

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.100 
rebound but I am a defensive liability
right<00:01:02.969> now<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.329> that's<00:01:03.420> probably<00:01:03.629> why<00:01:03.960> I'm

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
right now and that's probably why I'm

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.080 
right now and that's probably why I'm
not<00:01:04.260> seeing<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.799> ton<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.100> playing<00:01:05.549> time<00:01:05.610> just

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
not seeing a ton of playing time just

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.660 
not seeing a ton of playing time just
yet<00:01:06.330> but<00:01:07.320> even<00:01:07.799> with<00:01:07.920> my<00:01:08.070> limited<00:01:08.400> minutes

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
yet but even with my limited minutes

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.270 
yet but even with my limited minutes
like<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.450> game<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.950> my<00:01:11.040> best

games<00:01:11.549> as<00:01:11.880> far<00:01:11.909> as<00:01:12.299> an<00:01:12.420> overall<00:01:12.960> performance

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
games as far as an overall performance

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.880 
games as far as an overall performance
getting<00:01:15.479> some<00:01:15.750> decent<00:01:16.140> assists<00:01:16.560> there<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
getting some decent assists there and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.969 
getting some decent assists there and
leading<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.369> fast-break<00:01:18.470> able<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.770> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
leading the fast-break able to get a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.850 
leading the fast-break able to get a
decent<00:01:20.340> amount<00:01:20.640> amount<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:22.020> rebounds<00:01:22.650> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
decent amount amount of rebounds and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.850 
decent amount amount of rebounds and
when<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.490> need<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.939> I'm<00:01:24.150> able<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.600> get<00:01:25.229> space<00:01:25.560> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
when I need to I'm able to get space and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.960 
when I need to I'm able to get space and
get<00:01:25.950> those<00:01:26.070> open<00:01:26.490> looks<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:27.110> easy<00:01:28.110> jumpers<00:01:28.970> so

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
get those open looks for easy jumpers so

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.319 
get those open looks for easy jumpers so
overall<00:01:30.390> probably<00:01:30.930> my<00:01:31.049> best<00:01:31.259> game<00:01:31.619> as<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.860> pro

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
overall probably my best game as a pro

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.030 
overall probably my best game as a pro
even<00:01:33.329> though<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.659> limited<00:01:34.140> minutes<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
even though it's limited minutes so the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.780 
even though it's limited minutes so the
numbers<00:01:35.759> don't<00:01:35.909> look<00:01:36.090> fantastic<00:01:36.720> but

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
numbers don't look fantastic but

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.249 
numbers don't look fantastic but
certainly<00:01:38.790> did<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> well-rounded<00:01:39.570> game<00:01:39.990> right

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
certainly did a well-rounded game right

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.660 
certainly did a well-rounded game right
there<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.770> hopefully<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:42.030> will<00:01:42.150> continue<00:01:42.439> I

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
there and hopefully that will continue I

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.060 
there and hopefully that will continue I
think<00:01:44.670> once<00:01:44.880> i<00:01:44.970> get<00:01:45.180> enough<00:01:45.630> minutes<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.860> where

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
think once i get enough minutes to where

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.639 
think once i get enough minutes to where
i'm<00:01:47.490> actually<00:01:48.200> being<00:01:49.200> able<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.500> get<00:01:49.590> a

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
i'm actually being able to get a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.469 
i'm actually being able to get a
productive<00:01:50.189> score<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:51.090> would<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.329> awesome

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
productive score that would be awesome

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.520 
productive score that would be awesome
but<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.170> think<00:01:52.409> that's<00:01:52.590> coming<00:01:54.140> if<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.290> keep

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
but I think that's coming if I keep

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.050 
but I think that's coming if I keep
having<00:01:55.680> games<00:01:56.009> like<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.460> it's<00:01:56.700> definitely

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
having games like that it's definitely

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.389 
having games like that it's definitely
gonna<00:01:57.149> come<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.860> let's<00:01:58.860> get<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.189> press

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
gonna come so let's get to the press

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.520

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:51.939 
think at once I figured out and figure

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.059 
think at once I figured out and figure
out<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.150> pattern<00:02:52.569> of<00:02:52.720> which<00:02:53.409> buttons<00:02:53.829> i'm

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
out the pattern of which buttons i'm

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.259 
out the pattern of which buttons i'm
sure<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.760> buttons<00:02:55.060> mean<00:02:55.569> something<00:02:56.139> like

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
sure the buttons mean something like

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.000 
sure the buttons mean something like
aggressiveness<00:02:58.269> or<00:02:58.599> passiveness<00:02:59.560> or

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
aggressiveness or passiveness or

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.860 
aggressiveness or passiveness or
something<00:03:00.370> like<00:03:00.519> that<00:03:00.579> so<00:03:01.090> once<00:03:01.450> i<00:03:01.569> figure

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
something like that so once i figure

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.330 
something like that so once i figure
that<00:03:01.900> stuff<00:03:02.349> while<00:03:02.560> i'm<00:03:02.709> sure<00:03:02.919> you<00:03:03.040> guys<00:03:03.099> will
