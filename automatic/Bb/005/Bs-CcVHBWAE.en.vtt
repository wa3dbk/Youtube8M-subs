00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.720 
little and going natural it's just
a little<00:02:13.670> bit<00:02:13.850> more<00:02:14.240> of<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:15.340> thing<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.370> deal

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
a little bit more of a thing to deal

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.880 
a little bit more of a thing to deal
with<00:02:16.760> sometimes<00:02:17.330> because<00:02:17.720> my<00:02:17.750> hair<00:02:18.260> does<00:02:18.650> get

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
with sometimes because my hair does get

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.400 
with sometimes because my hair does get
tangled<00:02:19.430> very<00:02:19.640> easily<00:02:19.880> but<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.930> also<00:02:21.110> gets

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
tangled very easily but it also gets

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.250 
tangled very easily but it also gets
driver<00:02:21.770> easily<00:02:22.310> not<00:02:22.490> only<00:02:22.760> because<00:02:23.260> naturally

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
driver easily not only because naturally

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.290 
driver easily not only because naturally
that<00:02:24.770> would<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:25.490> know<00:02:25.610> naturally<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.150> was

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
that would you know naturally it was

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.050 
that would you know naturally it was
usually<00:02:26.780> happened<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:28.060> african-american

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
usually happened to african-american

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.430 
usually happened to african-american
hair<00:02:29.270> but<00:02:29.510> then<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.810> fact<00:02:30.050> that<00:02:30.110> my<00:02:30.260> hair<00:02:30.410> is

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
hair but then the fact that my hair is

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.410 
hair but then the fact that my hair is
also<00:02:30.650> strawberry<00:02:31.250> blonde<00:02:31.520> blondes<00:02:32.120> tend<00:02:32.330> to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
also strawberry blonde blondes tend to

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.990 
also strawberry blonde blondes tend to
be<00:02:32.540> drier<00:02:32.870> then<00:02:33.380> most<00:02:33.950> other<00:02:34.250> hair<00:02:34.490> types

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
be drier then most other hair types

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.890 
be drier then most other hair types
so<00:02:36.160> yeah<00:02:37.160> this<00:02:37.700> whole<00:02:38.210> thing<00:02:38.540> will<00:02:38.720> need

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
so yeah this whole thing will need

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.230 
so yeah this whole thing will need
moisture<00:02:39.350> every<00:02:39.620> day<00:02:39.770> all<00:02:39.980> day<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.460> I<00:02:40.940> wanted

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
moisture every day all day and I wanted

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.730 
moisture every day all day and I wanted
to<00:02:41.390> straighten<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:41.990> out<00:02:42.110> because<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.500> wanted

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
to straighten it out because I wanted

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.710 
to straighten it out because I wanted
you<00:02:42.830> guys<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:42.980> see<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.430> actual<00:02:44.090> length<00:02:44.450> before

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
you guys to see the actual length before

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.600 
you guys to see the actual length before
it<00:02:44.960> actually<00:02:45.050> shrinks<00:02:45.620> down<00:02:45.740> to<00:02:45.800> what<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.400> will

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
it actually shrinks down to what it will

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.810 
it actually shrinks down to what it will
probably<00:02:46.820> be<00:02:47.240> which<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.630> about<00:02:47.870> here<00:02:48.350> cuz<00:02:49.310> my

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
probably be which is about here cuz my

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.120 
probably be which is about here cuz my
hair<00:02:50.180> when<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.480> gets<00:02:50.660> wet<00:02:50.900> it<00:02:51.140> shrinks<00:02:51.980> down

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
hair when it gets wet it shrinks down

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.430 
hair when it gets wet it shrinks down
about<00:02:52.490> 75<00:02:53.270> so<00:02:53.480> literally<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:53.960> can<00:02:54.080> shrink<00:02:54.260> down

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
about 75 so literally it can shrink down

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.400 
about 75 so literally it can shrink down
to<00:02:54.680> this<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:56.060> if<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:56.300> think<00:02:56.570> that<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.990> know<00:02:57.140> my

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.050 
to this so if you think that you know my
hair<00:02:57.710> literally<00:02:58.130> can<00:02:58.400> shrink<00:02:58.610> back<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.940> that

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
hair literally can shrink back to that

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.790 
hair literally can shrink back to that
you<00:02:59.270> see<00:02:59.450> how<00:02:59.570> long<00:02:59.810> it<00:03:00.020> is<00:03:00.140> when<00:03:00.410> it's<00:03:00.560> blown

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:25.029 
back in braids for another three months

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:28.950 
back in braids for another three months
so<00:05:25.479> I<00:05:25.750> figured<00:05:26.289> if<00:05:26.529> I<00:05:26.740> do<00:05:26.800> that<00:05:27.509> you<00:05:28.509> know<00:05:28.629> three

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
so I figured if I do that you know three

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.959 
so I figured if I do that you know three
months<00:05:29.139> and<00:05:29.409> braids<00:05:29.710> a<00:05:29.979> month<00:05:30.219> to<00:05:30.460> breathe<00:05:30.729> and

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:30.969 
months and braids a month to breathe and

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:32.969 
months and braids a month to breathe and
another<00:05:31.300> three<00:05:31.539> months<00:05:31.810> and<00:05:31.930> braids<00:05:32.199> then

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
another three months and braids then

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.350 
another three months and braids then
I'll<00:05:33.099> give<00:05:33.310> it<00:05:33.430> a<00:05:33.490> nice<00:05:33.699> opportunity<00:05:34.270> to

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
I'll give it a nice opportunity to

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.219 
I'll give it a nice opportunity to
really<00:05:34.839> really<00:05:35.139> grow<00:05:35.379> and<00:05:35.650> then<00:05:35.770> I<00:05:35.889> can<00:05:36.129> do<00:05:37.229> you
