00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
and in this notebook the edge design 76v

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.510 
and in this notebook the edge design 76v
said<00:00:51.050> we<00:00:52.050> need<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.350> unscrew<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.160> single

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
screw to open over that panel so we need

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:11.970 
screw to open over that panel so we need
a<00:00:58.100> simple<00:00:59.100> screwdriver

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:19.800 

it<00:01:12.980> is<00:01:13.130> open<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:16.180> have<00:01:17.180> to<00:01:17.360> softly<00:01:17.990> pull<00:01:18.590> it<00:01:18.950> up

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
it is open you have to softly pull it up

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.880

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
here we have the RAM slots two slots and

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.450 
here we have the RAM slots two slots and
I<00:01:32.120> already<00:01:32.720> put<00:01:32.960> it<00:01:32.990> inside<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.860> Corsair

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460

I already put it inside the Corsair
Vengeance<00:01:35.230> rum<00:01:36.490> then<00:01:37.490> we<00:01:37.760> have<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.090> two<00:01:38.390> hard

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
Vengeance rum then we have the two hard

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.850 
Vengeance rum then we have the two hard
drives<00:01:38.990> this<00:01:39.860> is<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:41.020> crease<00:01:42.020> of<00:01:42.320> her<00:01:42.380> drag

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
drives this is the crease of her drag

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.170 
drives this is the crease of her drag
this<00:01:43.070> is<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.520> secondary<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:45.220> here<00:01:46.220> I<00:01:46.430> already

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
this is the secondary and here I already

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.469 
this is the secondary and here I already
put<00:01:47.690> it<00:01:47.720> in<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.230> SSD<00:01:51.580> you<00:01:52.580> have<00:01:52.850> just<00:01:53.090> four

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
put it in the SSD you have just four

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:15.700 
put it in the SSD you have just four
screws<00:01:53.870> here<00:01:54.410> to<00:01:54.950> unscrew

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:22.570 

so<00:02:16.710> we<00:02:16.860> can<00:02:17.040> softly<00:02:17.630> hold<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.810> back<00:02:20.900> here<00:02:21.900> close

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
so we can softly hold it back here close

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:30.170 
so we can softly hold it back here close
you<00:02:23.580> see<00:02:24.200> Neutron<00:02:25.200> GT<00:02:25.710> x<00:02:27.080> 240<00:02:28.080> iike<00:02:28.560> bytes<00:02:29.180> so

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
you see Neutron GT x 240 iike bytes so

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.560 
you see Neutron GT x 240 iike bytes so
you<00:02:30.720> have<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.650> force<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:33.050> love<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.320> lock<00:02:35.570> the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.970 
go wrong
both<00:04:05.180> of<00:04:05.330> these<00:04:05.860> these<00:04:06.860> tools<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:07.670> can<00:04:07.940> say<00:04:08.360> and

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
both of these these tools I can say and

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.900 
both of these these tools I can say and
you<00:04:10.030> stick<00:04:11.030> it<00:04:11.150> back<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:11.750> side<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.860> then<00:04:13.100> pull

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
you stick it back and side and then pull

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.350 
you stick it back and side and then pull
it<00:04:14.030> down<00:04:14.270> and<00:04:14.750> it's<00:04:15.650> locked<00:04:15.860> again<00:04:16.160> for<00:04:17.030> the

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
it down and it's locked again for the

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.110 
it down and it's locked again for the
second<00:04:17.960> law<00:04:18.410> it's<00:04:18.830> pretty<00:04:19.220> much<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.700> same<00:04:19.730> but

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
second law it's pretty much the same but

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.320 
second law it's pretty much the same but
you<00:04:20.210> have<00:04:20.360> to<00:04:20.450> remove<00:04:20.690> before<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.320> first<00:04:21.560> one

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
you have to remove before the first one

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:30.550 
you have to remove before the first one
then

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.150 

the<00:04:30.950> backpal<00:04:31.990> first<00:04:32.990> at<00:04:33.230> the<00:04:33.290> bottom<00:04:33.590> inside

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
the backpal first at the bottom inside

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:41.220 
the backpal first at the bottom inside
then<00:04:36.550> yourself<00:04:37.550> your<00:04:38.510> hands<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.860> finally

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
then yourself your hands and finally

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:50.020 
then yourself your hands and finally
just<00:04:47.170> here<00:04:48.490> it's<00:04:49.490> perfect

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
just here it's perfect

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.440 
just here it's perfect
so<00:04:50.480> now<00:04:50.900> let's<00:04:51.440> boot<00:04:51.980> up<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.220> computer<00:04:52.790> and

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
so now let's boot up the computer and

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:59.650 
so now let's boot up the computer and
see<00:04:54.260> the<00:04:55.040> differences<00:04:55.580> between<00:04:57.850> the<00:04:58.850> notebook

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
see the differences between the notebook

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.120

with<00:04:59.870> the<00:04:59.900> HDD<00:05:01.120> stock<00:05:02.120> and<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:03.470> improvement

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
with the HDD stock and the improvement

00:05:04.130 --> 00:06:52.030 
with the HDD stock and the improvement
with<00:05:04.490> the<00:05:04.520> SSD

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.040
