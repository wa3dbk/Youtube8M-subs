a Washington state product and we're
going<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.420> mill<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:22.789> into<00:00:23.789> bits<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.359> since

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
going to mill it into bits and since

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.779 
going to mill it into bits and since
we're<00:00:25.350> completely<00:00:25.710> automated<00:00:26.189> computer

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
we're completely automated computer

we're completely automated computer
technology<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.900> how<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.170> start

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.790 

as<00:00:39.790> you<00:00:40.000> can<00:00:40.120> see<00:00:40.330> I<00:00:40.360> training<00:00:40.990> my<00:00:41.230> partner<00:00:41.680> do

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
as you can see I training my partner do

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.530 
as you can see I training my partner do
all<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.040> work<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:44.310> this<00:00:45.310> is<00:00:45.460> our<00:00:45.700> ground<00:00:46.270> up

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
all the work and this is our ground up

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.420 
all the work and this is our ground up
malted<00:00:47.110> barley<00:00:47.290> this<00:00:47.739> is<00:00:47.860> what<00:00:48.040> it<00:00:48.130> looks<00:00:48.280> like

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
malted barley this is what it looks like

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.330 
malted barley this is what it looks like
when<00:00:48.610> we're<00:00:48.790> done<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:50.410> ready<00:00:50.620> to<00:00:50.739> be<00:00:50.920> put

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
when we're done and it's ready to be put

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.900 
when we're done and it's ready to be put
in<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:51.580> water<00:00:51.730> and<00:00:52.480> heat<00:00:52.750> it<00:00:52.780> up<00:00:53.640> all<00:00:54.640> right

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
in the water and heat it up all right

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.530 
in the water and heat it up all right
here<00:00:55.150> we<00:00:55.180> go<00:00:55.710> 50<00:00:56.710> pounds<00:00:57.129> of<00:00:57.220> malted<00:00:57.670> barley

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.220 

Jim's<00:01:01.540> going<00:01:01.690> to<00:01:01.780> take<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.050> water

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
Jim's going to take the water

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.270 
Jim's going to take the water
temperature<00:01:02.590> because<00:01:02.920> you<00:01:02.980> have<00:01:03.070> to<00:01:03.160> bring

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
temperature because you have to bring

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.979 
temperature because you have to bring
when<00:01:03.640> you're<00:01:03.730> making<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.180> whiskey<00:01:04.600> or<00:01:04.780> making

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
when you're making the whiskey or making

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.510 
when you're making the whiskey or making
the<00:01:05.170> mash<00:01:05.379> we've<00:01:05.740> already<00:01:05.890> ground<00:01:06.190> the<00:01:06.310> grain

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
the mash we've already ground the grain

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.790 
the mash we've already ground the grain
now<00:01:07.210> we<00:01:07.270> have<00:01:07.570> to<00:01:07.600> take<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.380> temperature<00:01:08.560> to

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
now we have to take the temperature to

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.530 
now we have to take the temperature to
make<00:01:09.040> sure<00:01:09.160> the<00:01:09.280> temperature<00:01:09.430> is<00:01:09.850> right<00:01:10.090> so

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
make sure the temperature is right so

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.090 
make sure the temperature is right so
the<00:01:10.690> grain<00:01:10.930> can<00:01:11.200> seep<00:01:11.440> and<00:01:11.680> release<00:01:11.920> its

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
the grain can seep and release its

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.480 
the grain can seep and release its
enzymes<00:01:12.869> make<00:01:13.869> sure<00:01:14.020> ready<00:01:16.710> yep<00:01:17.710> it's<00:01:18.070> perfect

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
enzymes make sure ready yep it's perfect

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.609 
enzymes make sure ready yep it's perfect

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
got to mix up this hot water for him so

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.540 
got to mix up this hot water for him so
that<00:01:31.149> we<00:01:32.050> can<00:01:32.229> add<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.530> malted<00:01:32.860> barley<00:01:33.039> to<00:01:33.430> it

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
that we can add the malted barley to it

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.410 
that we can add the malted barley to it
we<00:01:34.330> also<00:01:34.509> add<00:01:34.840> some<00:01:35.140> cornholes<00:01:35.740> my<00:01:36.700> jokes<00:01:36.970> we

got a dad the right hole because it
keeps<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.550> grain<00:01:39.759> separated<00:01:40.479> okay<00:01:41.350> so<00:01:41.979> he's

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
keeps the grain separated okay so he's

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.800 
keeps the grain separated okay so he's

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
that does it Bob now we gotta mix it

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.759 
that does it Bob now we gotta mix it
about<00:02:10.119> every<00:02:10.360> 20<00:02:10.509> minutes<00:02:10.840> this<00:02:11.260> is<00:02:11.440> our<00:02:11.560> wash

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
about every 20 minutes this is our wash

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.570 
about every 20 minutes this is our wash
after<00:02:12.370> it's<00:02:12.819> been<00:02:13.060> strained<00:02:13.470> cooled<00:02:14.470> we<00:02:15.430> add

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
after it's been strained cooled we add

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.540 
after it's been strained cooled we add
the<00:02:15.760> yeast<00:02:15.910> we<00:02:16.510> added<00:02:16.660> some<00:02:16.989> nutrients<00:02:17.709> we

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
the yeast we added some nutrients we

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.150 
the yeast we added some nutrients we
stir<00:02:18.849> it<00:02:18.970> again<00:02:19.150> we<00:02:19.660> put<00:02:19.840> in<00:02:19.959> our<00:02:20.160> fermenting

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
stir it again we put in our fermenting

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.650 
stir it again we put in our fermenting
room<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.580> sits<00:02:21.849> there<00:02:22.060> for<00:02:22.239> about<00:02:22.300> four<00:02:22.629> or

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
room it sits there for about four or

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.900 
room it sits there for about four or
five<00:02:22.870> days<00:02:22.900> once<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.709> day<00:02:23.860> we<00:02:24.040> stir<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.489> product

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
five days once a day we stir the product

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.790 
five days once a day we stir the product
to<00:02:24.970> get<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.450> yeast<00:02:25.630> back<00:02:26.080> through<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:26.650> it's

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
to get the yeast back through so it's

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.370 
to get the yeast back through so it's
the<00:02:27.459> enzymes<00:02:27.910> are<00:02:28.090> eating<00:02:28.390> all<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.720> nutrients

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
the enzymes are eating all the nutrients

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.470 
the enzymes are eating all the nutrients
