00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
there as far as I can so I think they're

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.750 
there as far as I can so I think they're
referring<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.049> as<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.260> Inquisitor<00:02:41.010> or<00:02:41.189> I

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
referring to as the Inquisitor or I

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.119 
referring to as the Inquisitor or I
which<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.599> thought<00:02:42.870> were<00:02:43.079> actually<00:02:43.469> a<00:02:43.530> set<00:02:43.920> of

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
which I thought were actually a set of

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.670 
which I thought were actually a set of
new<00:02:44.969> villains<00:02:45.390> called<00:02:45.689> the<00:02:45.810> inquisitors<00:02:46.379> but

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
new villains called the inquisitors but

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.220 
new villains called the inquisitors but
it<00:02:46.890> could<00:02:47.069> be<00:02:47.189> either<00:02:47.459> or<00:02:47.730> both<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.420> he<00:02:49.019> just

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
it could be either or both and he just

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.319 
it could be either or both and he just
happens<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.530> be<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.709> high-ranking<00:02:50.340> Inquisitor

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
happens to be a high-ranking Inquisitor

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.660 
happens to be a high-ranking Inquisitor
but<00:02:52.079> yeah<00:02:52.349> it<00:02:52.530> definitely<00:02:52.950> looks<00:02:53.310> like<00:02:53.489> you

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
but yeah it definitely looks like you

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.619 
but yeah it definitely looks like you

and then a funny story behind that is

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.420 
and then a funny story behind that is
that<00:03:27.389> actually<00:03:27.959> George<00:03:28.139> Lucas<00:03:28.590> originally

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
that actually George Lucas originally

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.819 
that actually George Lucas originally
wanted<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.120> be<00:03:30.269> blue<00:03:30.569> when<00:03:31.439> he<00:03:31.560> made<00:03:31.739> the

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
wanted it to be blue when he made the

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.500 
wanted it to be blue when he made the
movies<00:03:32.099> back<00:03:32.340> in<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.549> 70s<00:03:33.000> but<00:03:33.209> because<00:03:33.480> of

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
movies back in the 70s but because of

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.089 
movies back in the 70s but because of
the<00:03:33.689> blue<00:03:33.900> screen<00:03:34.139> technology<00:03:34.379> it<00:03:34.859> wouldn't

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
the blue screen technology it wouldn't

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.990 
the blue screen technology it wouldn't
have<00:03:35.190> went<00:03:35.370> well<00:03:35.609> would<00:03:35.819> have<00:03:35.909> been

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
have went well would have been

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.030 
have went well would have been
transparent<00:03:36.449> so<00:03:37.199> that's<00:03:37.379> why<00:03:37.500> he<00:03:37.620> went<00:03:37.739> red

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
transparent so that's why he went red

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.399 
transparent so that's why he went red
but<00:03:38.250> now<00:03:38.400> with<00:03:38.639> the<00:03:38.669> new<00:03:39.169> green<00:03:40.169> screen

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
but now with the new green screen

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.080 
but now with the new green screen
technology<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:41.190> can<00:03:41.310> put<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.669> blue<00:03:41.819> stripe

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
technology you can put the blue stripe

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.089 
technology you can put the blue stripe
in<00:03:42.269> there<00:03:42.479> so<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.229> x-wing<00:03:43.709> is<00:03:43.829> going<00:03:43.949> to<00:03:44.010> have

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
in there so the x-wing is going to have

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.259 
in there so the x-wing is going to have
blue<00:03:44.250> stripes<00:03:44.579> now<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:44.879> I<00:03:44.940> think<00:03:45.030> that's

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
blue stripes now so I think that's

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.149 
blue stripes now so I think that's
pretty<00:03:45.449> cool<00:03:45.659> so<00:03:46.349> but<00:03:46.560> yeah<00:03:46.650> so<00:03:46.859> a<00:03:46.889> lot<00:03:47.129> of

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
pretty cool so but yeah so a lot of

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.830 
pretty cool so but yeah so a lot of
stuff<00:03:47.519> dropping<00:03:47.939> on<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.120> Star<00:03:48.299> Wars<00:03:48.510> front

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
stuff dropping on the Star Wars front

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.119 
stuff dropping on the Star Wars front
I'm<00:03:49.019> wondering<00:03:49.500> if<00:03:49.590> this<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:49.799> going<00:03:49.919> to<00:03:50.010> be<00:03:50.099> a

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
I'm wondering if this is going to be a

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.909 
I'm wondering if this is going to be a
continuing<00:03:50.729> trend<00:03:51.260> kind<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.409> hoping<00:03:52.709> not

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
continuing trend kind of hoping not

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.129 
continuing trend kind of hoping not
because<00:03:53.699> that<00:03:54.030> can<00:03:54.180> really<00:03:54.540> ruin<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.989> movie

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
because that can really ruin a movie

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.129 
because that can really ruin a movie
considering<00:03:55.919> it's<00:03:56.129> coming<00:03:57.090> out<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.479> you<00:03:58.019> know

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
considering it's coming out and you know

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.289 
considering it's coming out and you know
late<00:03:58.409> next<00:03:58.620> year<00:03:58.799> you<00:03:59.729> know<00:03:59.819> if<00:03:59.939> you<00:04:00.030> start<00:04:00.269> to

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
late next year you know if you start to

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.059 
late next year you know if you start to
have<00:04:00.479> all<00:04:00.689> this<00:04:00.959> information<00:04:01.139> start<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.829> drop

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
have all this information start to drop

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.189 
have all this information start to drop
now<00:04:02.310> while<00:04:02.609> you're<00:04:02.699> filming<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.359> can

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
now while you're filming I can

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.749 
now while you're filming I can
definitely<00:04:04.349> put<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.680> damper<00:04:04.769> on<00:04:05.099> things<00:04:05.370> but<00:04:05.459> at

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:05.759 
definitely put a damper on things but at

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:07.670 
definitely put a damper on things but at
the<00:04:05.849> same<00:04:06.030> time<00:04:06.239> a<00:04:06.299> lot<00:04:06.659> of<00:04:06.720> this<00:04:06.959> is<00:04:07.139> not<00:04:07.379> set

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
the same time a lot of this is not set

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.740 
the same time a lot of this is not set
in<00:04:07.709> stone<00:04:07.829> they're<00:04:08.790> still<00:04:09.090> filming<00:04:09.389> many

in stone they're still filming many

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.569 
in stone they're still filming many
things<00:04:10.019> can<00:04:10.229> change<00:04:10.259> a<00:04:10.799> lot<00:04:11.159> of<00:04:11.220> this<00:04:11.400> can<00:04:11.549> just

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
things can change a lot of this can just

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
what I've seen they're incorporating

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.210 
what I've seen they're incorporating
practical<00:04:27.479> effects<00:04:27.810> I'm<00:04:28.110> sure<00:04:28.889> they're<00:04:29.099> going

practical effects I'm sure they're going

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.219 
practical effects I'm sure they're going
to<00:04:29.370> use<00:04:29.400> CGI<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:30.090> enhance<00:04:30.690> it<00:04:30.900> so<00:04:31.050> that's

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
to use CGI to enhance it so that's

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.490 
to use CGI to enhance it so that's
that's<00:04:31.500> good<00:04:31.830> um<00:04:32.810> obviously<00:04:33.810> there<00:04:34.139> will<00:04:34.320> be

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
that's good um obviously there will be

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.469 
that's good um obviously there will be
some<00:04:34.830> motion<00:04:35.280> excuse<00:04:35.669> me<00:04:35.820> yeah<00:04:36.090> motion
