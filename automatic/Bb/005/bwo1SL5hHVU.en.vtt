00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello to all today I have you 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.049
 explained how to change or dismount 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.910
 autistic the computer fixes dignity 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.860
 without work so the computer 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.740
 it is composed of several elements of the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.980
 hard drive of a magnet that stops its 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.900
 essential memory stoxx same system 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.480
 so is wise hard it will take place 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.939
 very easily because he pulls himself 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.680
 the adored behind and that is all black in 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.109
 general fixed away from the motherboard 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.789
 who she has so first you see that he 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:36.120
 is fixed with two outputs so wanted 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:40.100
 gently remove that then you 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.100
 see below it is fixed with 80 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.500
 you see and delicately everything 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.520
 slowly 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.110
 especially when you make little ones 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.930
 manual work like that was going on the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.039
 principle that you are never in a hurry 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.590
 never one day are you in a hurry you do not 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:05.820
 do not do it never hurried 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:07.380
 always take your time and all 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.540
 computer thefts and it would be better 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:24.240
 always hold down it's more fruit 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:27.500
 to sleep well acquired ritsos email and so 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.500
 there you slide here 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.299
 and here is your hard drive know their 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.060
 German work and two sides that's 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.100
 all similar metal traces with the 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.409
 Mark 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.280
 so I see you doing a sledgehammer 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.950
 segat then for their masters 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:53.819
 nothing more simple regret it in the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.819
 slot you screw the four wires 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.250
 watch out when we live that's okay it's 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.250
 a little bit of trouble, let 's say 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.399
 not be rude is to do this 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.720
 I see well reassembled hard disk and 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:15.970
 find their slots location 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:18.120
 on must well they go out there see the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:27.489
 connectors on the side where were removed 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:28.690
 so it might not do it 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.540
 was first doing them both three 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.889
 first turns in the hand to fix 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.889
 of hygiene of life to ask 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:51.590
 that I wanted hard drives do not 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:54.010
 will not fall 1000 it will not do you 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.010
 succeed 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:17.140
 and you end up with a screwdriver good after 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.280
 if you ever restart like that I 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.459
 think it can work 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.599
 which is especially not forget about the 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.860
 reconnect the two outputs there are 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.319
 one that has disappeared is that she is 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.660
 fallen as is the case in the end you 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.540
 to go looking for her further down the 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.720
 tell and I push it to the bottom 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.900
 more than we see a single part of water 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.900
 then you will only have 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.900
 reset 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.959
 and now thank you and goodbye
