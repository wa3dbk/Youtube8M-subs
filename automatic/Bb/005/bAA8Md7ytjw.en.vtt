right so what I like about this it goes

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.910 
right so what I like about this it goes
to<00:01:44.540> show<00:01:44.570> that<00:01:44.720> we<00:01:45.020> always<00:01:45.170> like<00:01:45.619> the

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
to show that we always like the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.980 
to show that we always like the
basically<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.610> same<00:01:46.850> materials<00:01:47.570> I<00:01:47.810> mean

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
basically the same materials I mean

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.570 
basically the same materials I mean
we're<00:01:48.170> always<00:01:48.350> playing<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.800> same<00:01:49.040> musical

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
we're always playing the same musical

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.130 
we're always playing the same musical
ideas<00:01:49.970> and<00:01:50.240> we<00:01:50.390> are<00:01:50.420> all<00:01:50.869> drawn<00:01:51.789> to<00:01:53.140> similar

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
ideas and we are all drawn to similar

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.810 
ideas and we are all drawn to similar
melodic<00:01:54.560> materials<00:01:55.039> in<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.250> end<00:01:55.399> and<00:01:55.640> it's

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
melodic materials in the end and it's

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.570

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.199 
think of it like the song so what like D
Dorian<00:04:05.140> so<00:04:05.560> all<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:05.980> notes<00:04:06.189> are<00:04:06.459> from<00:04:06.760> C<00:04:07.030> major

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
Dorian so all the notes are from C major

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:19.170 
Dorian so all the notes are from C major
but<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:09.069> mode<00:04:09.849> is<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.120> D<00:04:10.840> minor<00:04:11.140> so<00:04:17.970> right<00:04:18.970> and

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
but the mode is the D minor so right and

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.060 
but the mode is the D minor so right and
there<00:04:19.510> are<00:04:19.570> countless<00:04:20.019> variations<00:04:20.169> that<00:04:20.919> we

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
there are countless variations that we

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.100 
there are countless variations that we
will<00:04:21.280> not<00:04:21.549> get<00:04:21.850> to<00:04:21.910> cover<00:04:22.300> today<00:04:22.660> in<00:04:22.780> terms<00:04:22.960> of

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
will not get to cover today in terms of

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.330 
will not get to cover today in terms of
rhythms

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.300 

that<00:04:27.340> would<00:04:27.460> be<00:04:27.610> one<00:04:27.790> or<00:04:28.030> we<00:04:28.270> could<00:04:28.420> do

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.320 

or<00:04:31.820> we<00:04:31.910> could<00:04:32.060> do<00:04:33.639> like<00:04:34.639> that<00:04:34.880> there's<00:04:35.090> no

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
or we could do like that there's no

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.670 
or we could do like that there's no
there's<00:04:35.660> not<00:04:35.780> enough<00:04:35.840> time<00:04:35.990> in<00:04:36.170> the<00:04:36.290> video<00:04:36.530> to

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
there's not enough time in the video to

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.230 
there's not enough time in the video to
cover<00:04:36.830> everything<00:04:37.250> but<00:04:37.490> at<00:04:37.670> least<00:04:37.820> you<00:04:38.060> can

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
cover everything but at least you can

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.659 
cover everything but at least you can
get<00:04:38.420> the<00:04:39.020> raw<00:04:39.260> materials<00:04:39.830> to<00:04:39.980> develop<00:04:40.520> the

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
get the raw materials to develop the

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.060 
get the raw materials to develop the
lick<00:04:40.910> in<00:04:41.389> other<00:04:41.600> words<00:04:41.840> second<00:04:42.560> perspective

the<00:04:43.190> first<00:04:43.340> one<00:04:43.550> is<00:04:43.730> D<00:04:43.910> minor<00:04:44.120> right<00:04:44.419> second

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
the first one is D minor right second

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.330 
the first one is D minor right second
perspective<00:04:45.050> would<00:04:45.380> be<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:45.680> minor<00:04:46.010> seventh

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
perspective would be a minor seventh

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:58.080 
perspective would be a minor seventh
here<00:04:47.150> so<00:04:48.139> a<00:04:48.169> minor<00:04:48.590> seven<00:04:48.919> or

and use your pentatonic right and the

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.510 
and use your pentatonic right and the

last way I think that is relevant to

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.570 
last way I think that is relevant to
learn<00:05:23.000> it<00:05:23.150> like<00:05:23.270> is<00:05:23.450> in<00:05:23.660> C<00:05:24.020> major<00:05:24.260> so<00:05:24.710> C<00:05:24.920> major<00:05:25.100> 7

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
learn it like is in C major so C major 7
