00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.289
 italy we are good man sorry but 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.030
 for these episodes it is also the next 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.560
 we will be in 1 point from ten because 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.440
 I have found no interesting way 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.850
 for now for 1.8 I recommend started spoils 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.810
 immediately this video because now you 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.760
 I present the stone and co bliss armored mod 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.170
 let's watch it now what's up with 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.740
 this fashion with that ways 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.100
 we will implement in addition to the usual say 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.909
 tools between his picone ax and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.070
 shovel and hoe in cobb listam we will introduce 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:43.350
 also of the armor in codex and the shipowner 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.350
 disco the touring obrist one weapon 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.359
 more scarce that rises slightly above 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.449
 let's say with the leather instead the weapon 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:54.269
 touring stone is the same level as 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.309
 that golden inside to find test 1 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.979
 the one in stone that we say is the most 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.589
 strong in this fashion but it is what 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.229
 it causes slowness but it is not so 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.780
 relevant and I recommend we are 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.850
 very well play very strong and a lot 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.979
 nice look also cool then with the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.549
 spain in active stone copy of course 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.280
 you are doing a little doubt I know 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.140
 you are asking but started for 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.570
 then take it in coop and stone we must 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.490
 use a stick like conversion 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.619
 craft the strong world of course 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.780
 in fact those of the have thought well 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.820
 fashion to use the normal team 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.520
 the one that kraft in the vanilla series 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.609
 in time any vanilla who would be 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.259
 the stone shoulder we call the kraft 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.390
 usually with a stick and two of 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.640
 kobe ​​but those of this fashion do not 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.979
 think about making a stick and two 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.359
 blocks with the sword in copies sto 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.939
 in fact this reference to kobe lo 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:49.799
 snowboarding and instead to do the other 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.250
 sword the stone one the usual one 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.380
 let's say a stick 2 of stone from age 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.870
 last word that would be the usual one 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.480
 equal normal that changes nothing 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.850
 now we take the stone one and vi 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.570

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.570
