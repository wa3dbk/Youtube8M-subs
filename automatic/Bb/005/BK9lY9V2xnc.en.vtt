00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.820
 welcome to a new mod 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.710
 I would like to introduce you today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.420
 show a rather fun modification 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.799
 and no so annoying mega 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.809
 technical modifications for the man 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.179
 Three years to learn this mod 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.070
 i will show is on a manga and 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.900
 anime series ajar the pretty 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.460
 lately and also successfully 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.230
 though that is a tec and shared or 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.390
 attack on digital German or 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.039
 Ham cinema smooching in Japanese 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.710
 if it is right now I pronounced 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.090
 can not yet Japanese and this mod 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.080
 then adds a few basic aspects 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.910
 the series 21 titan the templates and the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.809
 3d one convinces with which one the ones 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.340
 air can glide 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.600
 I do not assume that everyone from 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.340
 But you know I would have you one 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.510
 explain a little and look at that 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.239
 maybe it's just it 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.690
 just super super cool and I love 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.059
 the mangas of it and also the anime it 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.710
 is something simply beautiful is just easy 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.449
 great but it is very brutal so 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.550
 think twice maybe if 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.989
 something 12 want to look at it 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.840
 because the whole thing is I have twelve 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.850
 but actually from 16 or 18 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.260
 but that's not the point 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.730
 want to show that this motto is everything 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.090
 How much fun can you have with it 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.949
 can 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.840
 if you city ​​my intro one 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.729
 pretty cool minecraft style into a 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.810
 You never want to see tec antique 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.490
 like the description for it I left 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.530
 I just can not do that to you here 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.270
 cut clean because misjudges that we 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.080
 are German who no right because gema 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.490
 because japanese because american because all 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.869
 and therefore look in the description 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.350
 or see you look for one 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.350
 intro again 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.110
 so after that long intro was missing 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.180
 which makes the mod actually leads 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.030
 first time three titanium one classes 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.410
 there is much more in anime and manga 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.850
 However, here is the largest one 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.710
 once the 15 meter class 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.970
 they are pretty high then there are those 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.310
 four meter class which actually 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.110
 Three to four feet of class is in the manga 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.420
 and the other classes are currently available 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.210
 but not there is the cold the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.310
 are about six meters class and they 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.780
 are actually female but have to 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.490
 the camouflage say no sex and 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.700
 can be sex parts and no nothing at all 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.060
 is just huge stuff 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.560
 actually what people are on because that 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.420
 Of course I do not want to 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.560
 spoilern 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.750
 I could do it all myself 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.750
 Best, but it is not 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.730
 Everything is introduced alongside the titans 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.920
 it also the templates which you 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.480
 you need to turn it off properly 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.370
 you can also take other weapons for it 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.820
 but that's just cool 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.310
 macsteel and there is the 3d man 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.790
 convinced with what you do exactly the same 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.709
 Like the titan hunters in the series 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.510
 So you have the possibility somehow 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.060
 to shoot your enterhooks and 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.930
 then with the gas you have through the 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.790
 air to glide 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.140
 if we press control for example now 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.760
 pull ourselves or we can too 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.799
 we have to spit wildly through the air 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.049
 manage the titanium-off 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.830
 but who knows it knows why many 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.000
 people do not know you 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.519
 if you just the titan on the 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.380
 Feet box or wherever you go 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.720
 the face shoot a headshot 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.700
 gives in a 3000 meters large 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.560
 Cannonball does not die this titan 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.440
 the only way such a titan 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.090
 It is too close to you to turn off 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.799
 clapping is just really violent 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.600
 neck gossip actually means so much 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.829
 how to do the right job on 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.870
 cut out the neck because otherwise 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.190
 They can all regenerate if you can 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.170
 his head can be turned off 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.430
 regenerate your head when you give them the 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.230
 legs off the skin , the two can 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.700
 regenerate and so on and so forth 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.500
 Of course you have to take that into account 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.450
 that's why the whole minecraft can do it 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.820
 Also be that head up times 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.470
 Nacken counts and sometimes not that you 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.610
 Nacken does not count as neck and 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.350
 especially with the 15 meter titanium 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.850
 Often there is a problem with that 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.620
 are so big and the game can do that 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.480
 he does not often model properly 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.010
 show that you just get up very much 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.780
 She has to kill them sensibly 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.460
 but it's just pretty cool 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.630
 and this time even worked but like that 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.210
 whole really works i show 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.860
 Now again the operation of the 3d 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.460
 you do not believe it to be times 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.410
 so hard 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.490
 you can do it with all the keys 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.030
 There are different actions for that 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.590
 To run 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.570
 with a pressure on the standard 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.670
 occupation of the tv you shoot your first 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.290
 hook out the not with the control to 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.209
 example you can you can 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.640
 mitbeschließen rid again 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.750
 expensive second came out and there too 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.980
 Can you meet the lance or me 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.020
 Just shoot both and then do it 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.550
 if you press on the and paste 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.010
 you also dressed if you are not 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.170
 in flight mode since and then you will be around 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.340
 these are hooks whirled around that is 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.660
 especially useful in the fight against the 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.680
 Titans will be heavy in the 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.669
 neck edge to come if you can not 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.010
 can fly like me in this 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.150
 creative model just in order to 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.910
 andy activate the whole again 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.500
 and cheaply back there is still 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.730
 but many others I can touch 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.410
 do not decipher and I notice too 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.890
 no function as for example 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.630
 or iks or z or y is the whole 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.860
 here in the context menu you can 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.870
 set the whole yourself if you 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.810
 just want it to be in japanese or 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.340
 Chinese but I think Japanese and 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.380
 it just does not understand anything like that 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.120
 is the stupid even if no arrow off 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.560
 shot you can with a pressure 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.419
 on the control button the desch 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.430
 Of course, this also consumes 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.930
 more and more gas, but with that comes good 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.000
 and could be the whole thing 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.710
 umbrella hats good but as we turn 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.360
 this titan here for normal game 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.950
 because the fifa is too big and we can do it 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.520
 not next to the tall building called long dead 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.530
 boxed 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.760
 he is actually relatively easy me 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.900
 I already told you that one 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.760
 piece from the paint can be seen that way 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.080
 cut out in may cry 10 o'clock 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.850
 Main run neck gives the paints 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.620
 clapping is already the best in 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.900
 simply enter your hook systems here 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.240
 where by the way open with fs emmental 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.930
 can you then this gas despite 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.150
 cramming 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.500
 The strong now not because I 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.880
 doubt that this is a normal one 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.350
 But you want to play the game mode 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.729
 can try now only costs 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.320
 iron and sticks the castings would have 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.150
 you can find all of them in the links in the 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.950
 wanted to write download are definitely 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.750
 Fall down to another's nape 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.520
 just does not look with the 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.590
 enter-key times ran 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.819
 or so and then we have time to 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.750
 neck and he is already dead that went 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:40.400
 even relatively fast 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.770
 but now, suitably, it is ours 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.539
 blade shattered and confessed blade and 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.949
 if we still have enough blades over so 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:47.810
 as I am always in wiser 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:50.539
 foresight you can be well equipped 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.590
 With a push of the button he fights 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:52.699
 also reload and you have again 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.900
 both swords full 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.810
 accordingly , it put on two 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.370
 blades in the third person mode or 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.020
 front view you have in us two 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.849
 Swords in hand even if you do that 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.650
 not used but it just looks cool 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:05.060
 out 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.770
 and could be the sword in your 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.110
 neck tuck in but you have 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.370
 here it is only a sword it we can 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.229
 this core blade with the left 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.300
 hit the mouse button or you do it 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.130
 with the right mouse button then add me 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.569
 damage immediately and also over the 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.039
 This is especially in the area 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:19.430
 fight against the titans super-practical 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.889
 here 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.360
 because that means digital in any case 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:25.069
 just be careful with us too 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.130
 to hit his neck and that is at 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:29.599
 These are not that easy 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.250
 yes the whole thing actually consists of two 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:32.870
 Awards There are once these titans 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.370
 murder and once the equipment swat 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.270
 unfortunately not together but I think 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.069
 both a video description 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.180
 installed is a project made from it 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:41.030
 a lot of fun to play 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.050
 I would say ever tried one of 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.819
 kill some titan 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:49.270
 So come with our super skills 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:53.180
 colors and if rises not quite 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:55.490
 and yes yes yes I have talent 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.219
 i have talent i would be born 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.680
 Titan hunter so again and not ping 

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:02.930
 So dead now works 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.060
 really good sometimes did 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.800
 man problems but it is easy 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.360
 just fun you have to really even say and 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.009
 especially with friends in pvp you can 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.659
 that also play and it is fun because 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:12.469
 You can not meet friends in the neck 

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:13.849
 and they die 

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:15.860
 because you can just each other 

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:18.469
 staple and jump on you and 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.719
 say oh là là là là or neck boxing 

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:22.279
 and try to kill you or leave 

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:23.659
 with friends on the hunt because if we 

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:26.180
 Let's go to a normal game mode here 

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:27.590
 see the digital studios attack and 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.449
 Although not so weak with two 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.800
 proposals of death is not the great 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.750
 are due to the conclusion of the video 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.310
 died and would say that 's it 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.050
 also from me and this review I offered 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.250
 Hope so far in my opinion 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.080
 after a very fun but makes 

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.729
 Of course, no slogan for English mod 

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.029
 pages or big events i maps or something 

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:42.800
 What 

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:44.520
 which I think would be pretty cool 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.490
 to play with it 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.080
 but in the future as cool as impossible 

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.150
 I would tell me that from me 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.800
 for today i hope so far and fallen 

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.270
 if i am also happy with the motto that 

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.560
 Whole is in Japanese there is simply 

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.330
 in google translator then you will 

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.800
 already understand the most necessary there and 

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.360
 bottom left the internet again 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.229
 if you want to look now and then 

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.789
 I would be very happy about a rating 

00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:04.379
 happy and having an abo if he is at the 

00:08:02.789 --> 00:08:05.849
 be at the next motto show similar 

00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:09.680
 want and see you next time 

00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:09.680
 again until then and Schutscher
