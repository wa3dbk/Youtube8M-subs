00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
mind probably that that maybe shouldn't

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.320 
mind probably that that maybe shouldn't
go<00:03:46.160> in<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:47.090> show<00:03:47.290> maybe<00:03:48.290> just<00:03:48.590> for<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:48.920> DVD

would it be

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.160 
would it be
yeah<00:04:28.520> it's<00:04:28.700> so<00:04:28.850> funny<00:04:29.150> I<00:04:29.240> would<00:04:29.450> also<00:04:29.600> say<00:04:29.900> Jon

Forsyte<00:04:30.590> that<00:04:30.770> was<00:04:30.860> just<00:04:31.010> curious<00:04:31.370> you<00:04:32.270> can

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
Forsyte that was just curious you can

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.880 
Forsyte that was just curious you can
get<00:04:32.510> away<00:04:32.600> with<00:04:32.810> a<00:04:32.840> lot<00:04:32.990> more<00:04:33.170> because<00:04:33.620> it's<00:04:33.800> an

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
get away with a lot more because it's an

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.850 
get away with a lot more because it's an
animated<00:04:34.190> show<00:04:34.460> yeah<00:04:35.150> yeah<00:04:35.570> it's<00:04:35.810> you<00:04:36.770> know

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
animated show yeah yeah it's you know

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.580 
animated show yeah yeah it's you know
the<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:37.750> kind<00:04:38.750> of<00:04:38.840> allegory<00:04:39.140> that<00:04:39.320> I<00:04:39.350> use

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
the the the kind of allegory that I use

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.710 
the the the kind of allegory that I use
is<00:04:39.830> we<00:04:40.760> did<00:04:40.880> an<00:04:40.940> episode<00:04:41.030> where<00:04:41.330> Peter<00:04:41.540> and

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
is we did an episode where Peter and

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.250 
is we did an episode where Peter and
Lois<00:04:41.870> get<00:04:42.740> into<00:04:42.890> a<00:04:42.950> fistfight<00:04:43.280> and<00:04:43.850> I<00:04:44.840> think

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
Lois get into a fistfight and I think

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.290 
Lois get into a fistfight and I think
because<00:04:46.250> it's<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.490> cartoon<00:04:46.850> you<00:04:46.880> can<00:04:47.060> get<00:04:47.210> away

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
because it's a cartoon you can get away

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.360 
because it's a cartoon you can get away
with<00:04:47.540> that<00:04:47.630> if<00:04:47.870> you<00:04:48.410> know<00:04:48.530> ray<00:04:48.830> punched

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
with that if you know ray punched

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.090 
with that if you know ray punched
Deborah<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.120> Everybody<00:04:50.600> Loves<00:04:50.660> Raymond<00:04:51.200> you

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
Deborah and Everybody Loves Raymond you

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.860 
Deborah and Everybody Loves Raymond you
may<00:04:52.250> be<00:04:52.310> kind<00:04:52.700> of<00:04:52.820> funny<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.210> first<00:04:53.240> few<00:04:53.600> blows

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
may be kind of funny the first few blows

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.360 
may be kind of funny the first few blows
but<00:04:54.230> then<00:04:54.380> it<00:04:54.530> would<00:04:54.650> probably<00:04:54.830> get<00:04:55.100> a<00:04:55.160> little

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
but then it would probably get a little

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.990 
but then it would probably get a little
offensive

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000
