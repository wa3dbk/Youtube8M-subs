00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 they turbul street goodnight isabelle rick 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.250
 for a rugby day we said it 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.410
 very European generic and we start 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.150
 this rugby day h that by the result 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.650
 the cooler it ended 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.570
 few moments in northern ireland 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.949
 the ulster received the saracens 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.260
 We take the same and start again 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.270
 since remember last year what 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.660
 meaning and even only that they have 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.060
 arrested 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.710
 already in the quarter-finals against 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.990
 saracens but it was twickenham 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.199
 today so it was home to 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.380
 belfast the ulster he took his revenge 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.329
 we see that with film for that which 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.070
 Courage still the hells termen 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.620
 then in the same table clermont 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.809
 today she was receiving the English from 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.950
 leicester clermont not necessarily in 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.110
 the best conditions before 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.000
 to approach this quarterfinal h cup on 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.950
 reminds the complicated match against 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.989
 toulon a fortnight ago defeat he 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.539
 a week ago in the brisk derby 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.489
 so callback can be very 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.320
 useful to Clermont people we will see that with 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.460
 guillaume scrubland 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.199
 we are reassured and this qualification 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.120
 for the semi finals even though we have it 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.830
 heard in this topic the balanced remains 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.030
 fragile is the lot of all 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.280
 teams that play on multiple 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.049
 tables listen about it coach 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.880

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.500
 charbonneau 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.970
 we saw it for Toulouse the march was 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.500
 much higher 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.619
 we remind him that we are on a mission 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.810
 impossible on the lawn of the monster the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.060

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.650
 impregnable where ever no French club 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.340
 did not impose the subject signed jérôme 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.049

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.930
 last years 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.909
 Toulouse did not score as many points 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.990
 in the final phase all competitions 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.420
 confused since the last time 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.600

 fabien pelous 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.100
 but the former Toulouse which has raised 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.479
 already several European cups with the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.229
 red and black does he understand this 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.729
 rout 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.729

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.480

 the cats project themselves on them on 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.530
 two sets to bell 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.240
 we already know how to beat the saracens 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.970
 England was two years ago and 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.590

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.880

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.380
 Toulon we'll know tomorrow 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.840
 toulon or the leinster for this shock to my 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.490
 suddenly to dublin or marseille 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.620

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.660
 originally scheduled for February 15 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.970
 but the bad weather wanted it 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.160
 otherwise then it happened near 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.590
 two months since françois trillo fabien 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.580

 Sebastian Chabal because that's where 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.890
 it all began for him where he 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.900
 started his professional career there 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.340

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.260
