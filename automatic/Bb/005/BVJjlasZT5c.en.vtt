now the 18 to 200 millimeter is actually
one<00:00:23.210> of<00:00:23.240> Nichols<00:00:23.630> most<00:00:23.869> popular<00:00:24.320> lenses<00:00:24.740> today

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
one of Nichols most popular lenses today

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.429 
one of Nichols most popular lenses today
and<00:00:25.460> for<00:00:25.609> very<00:00:25.820> good<00:00:25.910> reason<00:00:26.359> most<00:00:27.019> obviously

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
and for very good reason most obviously

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.259 
and for very good reason most obviously
it<00:00:27.650> offers<00:00:27.890> an<00:00:27.980> extremely<00:00:28.400> flexible<00:00:28.580> zoom

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
it offers an extremely flexible zoom

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.720 
it offers an extremely flexible zoom
range<00:00:29.630> it's<00:00:30.560> an<00:00:30.650> equivalent<00:00:30.890> of<00:00:31.220> twenty<00:00:31.609> seven

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
range it's an equivalent of twenty seven

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.610 
range it's an equivalent of twenty seven
millimeter<00:00:32.240> to<00:00:32.689> three<00:00:32.900> hundred<00:00:33.020> millimeter

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
millimeter to three hundred millimeter

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.709 
millimeter to three hundred millimeter
so<00:00:34.040> that<00:00:34.160> takes<00:00:34.430> you<00:00:34.550> from<00:00:34.700> decent<00:00:35.149> wide-angle

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
so that takes you from decent wide-angle

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.799 
so that takes you from decent wide-angle
to<00:00:35.870> really<00:00:36.379> pretty<00:00:36.620> powerful<00:00:37.100> telephoto

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
to really pretty powerful telephoto

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.680 
to really pretty powerful telephoto
here's<00:00:38.809> some<00:00:38.960> examples<00:00:39.440> of<00:00:39.590> that<00:00:39.710> in<00:00:39.860> practice

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
here's some examples of that in practice

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.240 
here's some examples of that in practice
here's<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:41.840> 18<00:00:42.110> to<00:00:42.230> 200<00:00:42.559> millimeter<00:00:43.039> zoomed

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
here's the 18 to 200 millimeter zoomed

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.520 
here's the 18 to 200 millimeter zoomed
all<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:43.550> way<00:00:43.670> out<00:00:43.850> to<00:00:44.030> 18<00:00:44.210> millimeter<00:00:44.840> again

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
all the way out to 18 millimeter again

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.950 
all the way out to 18 millimeter again
mounted<00:00:45.920> on<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.100> dat<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:46.850> you<00:00:47.000> can<00:00:47.210> see<00:00:47.480> that

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
mounted on the dat and you can see that

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.599 
mounted on the dat and you can see that
it<00:00:48.079> captures<00:00:48.379> a<00:00:48.410> really<00:00:48.680> nice<00:00:48.829> wide<00:00:49.219> field

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
it captures a really nice wide field

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.849 
it captures a really nice wide field
which<00:00:49.879> is<00:00:50.000> ideal<00:00:50.329> fishing<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:50.870> landscapes<00:00:51.410> or

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
which is ideal fishing to landscapes or

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:53.410 
which is ideal fishing to landscapes or
even<00:00:52.340> if<00:00:52.430> you're<00:00:52.520> taking<00:00:52.640> group<00:00:53.000> shots<00:00:53.239> he

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
even if you're taking group shots he

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.990 
even if you're taking group shots he
just<00:00:53.629> can't<00:00:53.809> step<00:00:54.050> back<00:00:54.079> any<00:00:54.410> further<00:00:55.000> now

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
just can't step back any further now

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.880 
just can't step back any further now
let's<00:00:56.239> zoom<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.539> lens<00:00:56.570> all<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.019> way<00:00:57.140> into<00:00:57.289> 200

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
let's zoom the lens all the way into 200

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.830 
let's zoom the lens all the way into 200
millimeter<00:00:58.309> and<00:00:58.640> you<00:00:58.789> can<00:00:59.149> see<00:00:59.390> just<00:00:59.719> how

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
millimeter and you can see just how

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.630 
millimeter and you can see just how
close<00:01:00.230> it<00:01:00.410> gets<00:01:00.620> to<00:01:00.769> the<00:01:00.859> subject<00:01:01.340> you<00:01:01.489> can

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
close it gets to the subject you can

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.310 
close it gets to the subject you can
really<00:01:01.820> pick<00:01:02.030> out<00:01:02.179> a<00:01:02.239> load<00:01:02.480> detail<00:01:02.960> with<00:01:03.140> its

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
really pick out a load detail with its

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.670 
really pick out a load detail with its
lens<00:01:04.059> this<00:01:05.059> lens<00:01:05.330> range<00:01:05.600> isn't<00:01:05.840> just<00:01:06.170> flexible

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
lens this lens range isn't just flexible

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.620 
lens this lens range isn't just flexible
it's<00:01:06.830> also<00:01:07.009> very<00:01:07.280> convenient<00:01:07.790> in<00:01:08.119> practice

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
it's also very convenient in practice

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.870 
it's also very convenient in practice
because<00:01:09.350> it<00:01:09.650> covers<00:01:10.009> almost<00:01:10.189> all<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.549> focal

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
because it covers almost all the focal

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.950 
because it covers almost all the focal
lengths<00:01:11.090> you'll<00:01:11.210> be<00:01:11.330> using<00:01:11.540> in<00:01:11.810> most

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
lengths you'll be using in most

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.350 
lengths you'll be using in most
day-to-day<00:01:12.500> circumstances<00:01:13.400> you'll<00:01:13.909> also<00:01:14.060> be

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
day-to-day circumstances you'll also be

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.240 
day-to-day circumstances you'll also be
removing<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.900> lens<00:01:15.049> much<00:01:15.500> less<00:01:15.740> frequently

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
removing the lens much less frequently

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.740 
removing the lens much less frequently
and<00:01:16.520> in<00:01:16.909> turn<00:01:17.119> that<00:01:17.150> means<00:01:17.509> there's<00:01:17.720> less

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
and in turn that means there's less

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.660 
and in turn that means there's less
chance<00:01:17.900> just<00:01:18.439> getting<00:01:18.770> inside<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.220> body<00:01:19.430> and

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
chance just getting inside the body and

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.149 
chance just getting inside the body and
leave<00:01:20.060> a<00:01:20.090> little<00:01:20.240> marks<00:01:20.630> on<00:01:20.780> your<00:01:20.869> images<00:01:21.320> now

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
leave a little marks on your images now

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.260 
leave a little marks on your images now
let's<00:01:22.310> have<00:01:22.369> a<00:01:22.430> look<00:01:22.579> at<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.790> actual<00:01:23.119> lens

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
let's have a look at the actual lens

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.020 
let's have a look at the actual lens
itself<00:01:23.689> zoomed<00:01:24.079> all<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.320> way<00:01:24.409> out<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:24.650> in

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
itself zoomed all the way out and in

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.850 
itself zoomed all the way out and in
here<00:01:26.030> it<00:01:26.150> is<00:01:26.270> out<00:01:26.540> at<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.840> 18<00:01:27.110> millimeter<00:01:27.350> mark

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
here it is out at the 18 millimeter mark

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.649 
here it is out at the 18 millimeter mark
this<00:01:28.100> is<00:01:28.250> as<00:01:28.369> small<00:01:28.640> as<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.970> lens<00:01:29.150> gets<00:01:29.420> in

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
this is as small as the lens gets in

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.630 
this is as small as the lens gets in
practice<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:30.350> now<00:01:30.860> I'll<00:01:30.920> zoom<00:01:31.220> it<00:01:31.399> all<00:01:31.549> the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
practice and now I'll zoom it all the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.730 
practice and now I'll zoom it all the
way<00:01:31.759> into<00:01:31.939> 200<00:01:32.450> millimeter<00:01:32.840> and<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.229> can<00:01:33.619> see

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
way into 200 millimeter and you can see

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.179 
way into 200 millimeter and you can see
the<00:01:33.829> barrel<00:01:34.100> extends<00:01:34.490> by<00:01:34.640> quite<00:01:34.909> a<00:01:34.939> long<00:01:35.210> way

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
the barrel extends by quite a long way

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.679

however<00:02:32.130> if<00:02:32.220> i<00:02:32.370> zoom<00:02:32.400> lens<00:02:32.940> out<00:02:33.090> just<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.480> little

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
however if i zoom lens out just a little

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.230 
however if i zoom lens out just a little
bit<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.290> about<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.770> 100<00:02:35.490> millimeter<00:02:35.910> mark<00:02:36.060> and

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
bit to about the 100 millimeter mark and

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.940 
bit to about the 100 millimeter mark and
let<00:02:36.390> go<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:40.080> can<00:02:40.230> see<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.440> lens<00:02:40.590> actually

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
let go you can see the lens actually

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.310 
let go you can see the lens actually
falls<00:02:41.250> down<00:02:41.580> through<00:02:42.450> its<00:02:42.660> own<00:02:42.750> weight<00:02:43.050> and

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
falls down through its own weight and

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.870 
falls down through its own weight and
this<00:02:43.650> also<00:02:43.830> happens<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.370> other<00:02:44.400> way<00:02:44.700> around

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
this also happens the other way around

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.820 
this also happens the other way around
as<00:02:45.180> well<00:02:45.360> if<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.570> hold<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:46.020> point<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.590> all<00:02:46.740> the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
as well if I hold it point it all the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.900 
as well if I hold it point it all the
way<00:02:46.950> down<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.340> can<00:02:47.370> see<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.640> barrel

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
way down you can see the barrel

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.010 
way down you can see the barrel
extending<00:02:48.860> downwards<00:02:49.860> here<00:02:50.360> now<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.420> be<00:02:51.780> fair

this<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.770> part<00:02:52.980> of<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.130> course<00:02:53.430> for<00:02:53.700> most

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
this is part of the course for most

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.699 
this is part of the course for most
lenses<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.510> are<00:02:54.630> relatively<00:02:55.200> heavy<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
lenses that are relatively heavy and

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.620 
lenses that are relatively heavy and
well-built<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:56.670> it's<00:02:56.790> not<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:56.940> criticism<00:02:57.300> that

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
well-built so it's not a criticism that

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.330 
well-built so it's not a criticism that
you<00:02:57.720> can<00:02:57.870> level<00:02:58.140> exclusively<00:02:58.739> against<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.070> 18

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
to 200 millimeter but it's certainly

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.630 
to 200 millimeter but it's certainly
worth<00:03:00.959> knowing<00:03:01.290> especially<00:03:01.770> if<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.250> do<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> lot

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
worth knowing especially if you do a lot

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.070

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.750 
pointing up or pointing down it will
