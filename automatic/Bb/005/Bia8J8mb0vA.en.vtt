00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
playing the games I don't think I'll do

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.030 
playing the games I don't think I'll do
too<00:04:50.430> much<00:04:50.610> of<00:04:51.170> having<00:04:52.170> a<00:04:52.230> gameplay<00:04:52.590> footage<00:04:52.830> in

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
too much of having a gameplay footage in

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.530 
too much of having a gameplay footage in
the<00:04:53.100> background<00:04:53.460> like<00:04:53.640> this<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.150> we<00:04:54.330> talked

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
the background like this and we talked

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.860 
the background like this and we talked
and<00:04:54.660> over<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:54.900> top<00:04:55.020> of<00:04:55.170> it<00:04:55.290> I<00:04:55.500> prefer<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:57.690> game

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
and over the top of it I prefer the game

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.370 
and over the top of it I prefer the game
commentary<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:59.130> be<00:04:59.220> alive<00:04:59.490> with<00:04:59.760> the<00:04:59.820> game<00:05:00.030> I

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
commentary to be alive with the game I

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.980 
commentary to be alive with the game I
think<00:05:01.380> it<00:05:01.620> makes<00:05:02.130> it<00:05:02.400> more<00:05:02.940> live<00:05:03.210> more<00:05:03.720> real

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
think it makes it more live more real

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.110 
think it makes it more live more real
and<00:05:04.410> I<00:05:04.620> think<00:05:04.980> you<00:05:05.100> would<00:05:05.190> get<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.460> know<00:05:05.580> me<00:05:05.850> a

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
and I think you would get to know me a

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.510 
and I think you would get to know me a
lot<00:05:06.480> better<00:05:06.720> that<00:05:07.440> way<00:05:07.560> because<00:05:07.919> you'd<00:05:08.310> hear

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
lot better that way because you'd hear

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.290 
lot better that way because you'd hear
me<00:05:08.780> Carson<00:05:09.780> or<00:05:10.460> being<00:05:11.460> joyful<00:05:11.880> about<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.150> game

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
me Carson or being joyful about the game

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.830 
me Carson or being joyful about the game
and<00:05:12.480> I<00:05:12.600> think<00:05:12.840> that's<00:05:12.990> much<00:05:13.710> more<00:05:14.250> interesting

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840
