 tasks include young motivation 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.859
 generations to technical sports on 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.010
 Soviet armored personnel carrier

 is the northernmost . 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.270
 northwestern part of our mainland 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.700
 look this machine refers to 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.730
 discharge itself years of self-propelled machines and 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.440
 is registered in the state technical supervision given 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.230
 the car is not overall 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.030
 contrary to the rules of the road 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.820
 on the operation of these machines 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.739
 it is not tracked it does not create over 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.570
 pressure on the ground it does not destroy 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.760
 the road that is actually possible 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.510
 use as a normal passenger car 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.359
 for our trip to the Kola Peninsula 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.590
 we were only stopped once by him 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.170
 traffic police officers 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.570
 and the police officers with two machine guns 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.330
 actually did not specify who the head 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.970
 this whole thing and asked to show 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.920
 documents they rewrote everything and then on 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.710
 you escape, understand the military column 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.950
 there is a time for some reason 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.780
 actually such cars as not 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.030
 drowned if not drowned then 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.520
 written off and becomes scrap metal on 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.520
 overland the unenviable fate but this machine 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.409
 if a second chance once she 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.049
 was in the army then it was written off very 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.570
 for a long time stood for useless and 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.530
 here she was still scrap metal and 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.360
 got to the citizen here well and actually 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.670
 more than two years I was preparing this car to me 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.110
 people helped 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.939
 in varying degrees as we say I can honor in 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.070
 build 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.290
 metal cars here on the road can 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.000
 happen anything but sometimes just 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.590
 can ban travel and then 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.970
 have to look for other ways for 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.880
 movement means unfortunately we have passed 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.119
 incomplete route is not as we wanted it 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.989
 there is because we have difficulties 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.090
 with the Murmansk border services 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.910
 areas we were allowed to be given good 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.950
 literally, well, not with them 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.019
 we even turned gostekhnadzor 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.170
 Gostekhnadzor wrote a whole petition there 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.930
 about swimming in any 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.290
 Well, at the entrance to the border zone, I 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.569
 signed a paper in which I have been notified 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.700
 administrative responsibility and on 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.489
 I decided to take my own risk 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.110
 immerse the water but without such arrogance 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.690
 big i didn't go around 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.200
 and in the safest places where I am 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.580
 I couldn’t prevent anyone from being a military man 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.320

 she sent you actually we saved 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.940
 because we were in the same place there 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.010

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.290
 hard to find a piece of the grid with the guys 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.060
 immersed her here so i really shot 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.200
 the guys immersed the birdie 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.590

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.190
 evidence over we hitched her and 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.989
 actually let go of some water but how 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.310
 turned the world record setting 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.730
 is not 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:55.160
 The main purpose of the competition is that I am very 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.900
 I wanted to say that dear people 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.630
