00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
do this you know cover the main parts of

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.400 

I<00:02:41.180> believe<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.270> used<00:02:42.330> one<00:02:42.630> more<00:02:42.840> Watson<00:02:43.260> I

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
I believe I used one more Watson I

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.570 
I believe I used one more Watson I
should<00:02:43.650> hold<00:02:43.890> on<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.070> minute<00:02:44.190> let<00:02:44.400> me<00:02:44.460> move

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
should hold on a minute let me move

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.250 
should hold on a minute let me move
somebody's<00:02:44.940> around

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.170 

all<00:02:48.800> right<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.069> isn't<00:02:49.370> even<00:02:49.430> close<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:50.030> as

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
all right this isn't even close to as

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.380 
all right this isn't even close to as
good<00:02:50.330> as<00:02:50.450> my<00:02:51.050> picture<00:02:51.379> here<00:02:51.640> but<00:02:52.640> it's<00:02:52.970> just

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
good as my picture here but it's just

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.259 
good as my picture here but it's just
the<00:02:54.049> gist<00:02:54.260> of<00:02:54.409> it<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.620> guess<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:55.790> only<00:02:55.940> move<00:02:56.180> up

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
the gist of it I guess you only move up

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.699 
the gist of it I guess you only move up
my<00:02:56.420> grass<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.870> might<00:02:57.049> help<00:02:57.170> yeah<00:02:57.409> it<00:02:57.560> makes

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
my grass that might help yeah it makes

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.949 
my grass that might help yeah it makes
it<00:02:57.890> like<00:02:58.069> a<00:02:58.099> little<00:02:58.340> bigger<00:02:58.629> all<00:02:59.629> right<00:02:59.750> so

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
it like a little bigger all right so

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.259 
it like a little bigger all right so
there's<00:03:00.110> like<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.620> main<00:03:01.519> kind<00:03:01.879> of<00:03:01.940> look<00:03:02.120> for

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
little bit you put a variable zoom on it

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.740 
little bit you put a variable zoom on it
give<00:04:01.190> it<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.370> makes<00:04:01.669> us<00:04:01.849> scope<00:04:02.329> look<00:04:02.540> a<00:04:02.630> little

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
give it a makes us scope look a little

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.240 
give it a makes us scope look a little
bigger<00:04:03.019> you<00:04:03.349> know<00:04:03.470> some<00:04:03.709> people<00:04:03.919> like<00:04:04.220> having

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
bigger you know some people like having

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.920 
bigger you know some people like having
a<00:04:04.549> bigger<00:04:04.790> looking<00:04:05.120> scope<00:04:05.359> on<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.630> go<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:05.900> I

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
a bigger looking scope on the go and I

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.839 
a bigger looking scope on the go and I
have<00:04:06.079> no<00:04:06.260> idea<00:04:06.310> but<00:04:07.310> that's<00:04:07.400> what<00:04:07.579> that<00:04:07.700> would

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
have no idea but that's what that would

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.660 
have no idea but that's what that would
look<00:04:07.880> like<00:04:08.000> on<00:04:08.269> in

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
look like on in

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.910

another<00:04:10.360> thing<00:04:10.570> you<00:04:10.690> can<00:04:10.780> do<00:04:10.960> is<00:04:11.410> I<00:04:11.560> was<00:04:11.680> using

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
another thing you can do is I was using

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.860 
another thing you can do is I was using
to<00:04:12.040> be<00:04:12.130> Phoenix<00:04:12.490> which<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.180> believe<00:04:13.420> is<00:04:13.540> also<00:04:13.780> on

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
to be Phoenix which I believe is also on

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.000 
to be Phoenix which I believe is also on
page<00:04:14.080> five<00:04:14.910> yep<00:04:15.910> page<00:04:16.150> five<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:17.680> puts<00:04:17.920> your

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
page five yep page five it puts your

page five yep page five it puts your
second-to-last<00:04:18.489> layer<00:04:20.040> and<00:04:21.040> I<00:04:21.100> kind<00:04:21.310> of<00:04:21.370> made

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
second-to-last layer and I kind of made

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.700 
second-to-last layer and I kind of made
it<00:04:21.519> look<00:04:21.700> kinda<00:04:22.090> like<00:04:22.120> a<00:04:22.210> smoke<00:04:22.570> screen<00:04:22.750> you

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
it look kinda like a smoke screen you

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.620 
it look kinda like a smoke screen you
make<00:04:23.860> it<00:04:23.980> the<00:04:24.130> lightest<00:04:24.910> color<00:04:25.000> other<00:04:25.510> than

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.690 
make it the lightest color other than
white<00:04:25.810> right<00:04:26.740> there<00:04:26.770> and<00:04:27.100> it<00:04:27.160> looks<00:04:27.310> kind<00:04:27.640> of

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
white right there and it looks kind of

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.370 
white right there and it looks kind of
like<00:04:27.820> snorting<00:04:28.330> smoke<00:04:28.840> if<00:04:28.990> you<00:04:29.080> look<00:04:29.230> at<00:04:29.350> I

don't know how well it comes out on the

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.360 
don't know how well it comes out on the
screen<00:04:31.090> but<00:04:31.360> uh<00:04:31.650> go<00:04:32.650> ahead<00:04:32.770> and<00:04:32.860> use<00:04:32.950> that<00:04:32.980> and

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370

page<00:04:36.430> three<00:04:36.760> I<00:04:36.910> believe<00:04:36.970> it's<00:04:37.270> only<00:04:37.330> one

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
page three I believe it's only one

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.840 
page three I believe it's only one
thousand<00:04:38.170> Cod<00:04:38.320> points<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:39.160> there<00:04:40.120> we<00:04:40.240> go

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
thousand Cod points and there we go

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.040 
thousand Cod points and there we go
