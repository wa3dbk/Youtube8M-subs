00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
that open you could see the lens or a

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.080 
that open you could see the lens or a
couple<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.060> flashes<00:02:30.480> in<00:02:30.630> there<00:02:30.870> on<00:02:31.140> each<00:02:31.710> side

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
and you know it's tapered so it's

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.650 
and you know it's tapered so it's
unlikely<00:02:35.520> they're<00:02:35.850> gonna<00:02:35.940> fall<00:02:36.180> out<00:02:36.240> but<00:02:36.540> you

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
unlikely they're gonna fall out but you

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.710 
unlikely they're gonna fall out but you
probably<00:02:36.960> put<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.290> up<00:02:37.440> as<00:02:37.620> far<00:02:38.010> as<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.250> could
