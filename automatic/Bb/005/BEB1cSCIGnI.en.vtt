00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.129
 c 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:13.779
 after 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.740
 at rest 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.699
 hello everyone and welcome to a new text tonight 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.059
 today I will test for you again a new hull 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.739
 or protection for iphone 4 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.899
 from the sgp brand 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.899
 and to educate young people I would say even more a 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.180
 protection could be similar a previous trademark protection 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.620
 I had tested 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.050
 last year there are many variations 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.430
 the result is in other words little ten years already that the market they are 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.560
 for iphone 4 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.160
 is he really 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.710
 we have a hallucinatory money name and that's because we can not 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.330
 who goes out every day 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.640
 and for me it will be interesting what is heartbreaking for all tastes and 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.150
 for all needs 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.510
 to specify the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.060
 s &amp; p protection 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.720
 the neo to scoured color series 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.600
 and what I saw in the test &amp; the ctv infonauts was again a 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.220
 lighter 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.330
 loïc is that these bullshit 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.350
 you will see the difference is very simple 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.040
 and so it's a protection that was sent to me by the website etc. 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.820
 so elise said it's for the release does not quote that our little ones have 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.150
 seen they are england 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.660
 and they propose the number 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.660
 very very big that it is for iphone is with its grounds 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.430
 so you go 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.500
 you can discover fictional companies 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.450
 who also sells 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.910
 I will soon realize if you want to save a little bit of 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.080
 Shipping costs are a bit interesting 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.520
 so protection and even when one is alone 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.140
 she shows up so here you have and it's a hockey protection in 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.610
 two parts 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.119
 for his 7th is that it starts to become a little fashionable explore time 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.570
 so if you have a part too very very flexible silicone like here 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.480
 with the buttons that are drawn and so on 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.780
 and you have the party and the losc cooperated both time m 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:10.240
 likewise plastic either 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.429
 the most rigid 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:14.719
 but if it's a little bit that will help maintain the overall 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.789
 and give visibility 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:19.789
 yesterday to the structure 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.340
 at the level of protection in kansas this week it's very 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.129
 simple 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.129
 so just insert your iphone itunes 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.699
 their plastic protection 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.489
 we come from lefort attention that it is well adjusted 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:42.089
 note also at the level of the little hole the world 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.799
 the sensor of the antirust rustle world 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:49.469
 you have put the protection of our consultants in this club 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.479
 there the metal part and forgiveness 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:56.299
 plastic more original than 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.399
 it does not matter how unionized in the record 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:02.499
 the name to submit to the feasts we start with the water 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:04.329
 like these 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.179
 and then we go 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:08.099
 drag it 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.170
 on wine so I'm getting used to douala 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:17.859
 we do not know obviously 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.499
 the first time going back to the young all that a little worry 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:23.769
 we see here 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.769
 see it's going to be all alone 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.789
 here we are 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:34.789
 so to check that it is well adjusted by all 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:37.839
 this is only 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:40.839
 and so once the cohesion funds and its protection 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:43.479
 so we'll see what happens 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.069
 what's interesting is that it's due 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.729
 it's classic 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.959
 rough enough a bit common oum so for better grip 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.569
 the others is nice so the burglar a back part 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.609
 fully protected 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.979
 you have here a degree 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:01.680
 easily registered to everyone 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.319
 the goal the mark - 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.719
 Lausanne 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:09.389
 our cousins ​​had it's nice it's kevin there before handing over to 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.069
 seditious protections know 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.700
 % extremely flexible 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.989
 it must have which one is laid 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.159
 to maintain a concentrated silicone origin in very good place 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.949
 sablon in any case because she marries linda lê phan 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.300
 so you have the passion for the south keystone camera 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.610
 for the button 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.650
 above 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.919
 below so can he% 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.919
 little point to point out is that opening here 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:37.360
 wearing an iphone 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.310
 and still 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.620
 mulched can not very very big 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.240
 I had some problems with the accessories 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.059
 typically iphone chargers 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:49.869
 linky are not of the brand a little the not compatible and in general of 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.189
 presided by a little bigger than the original court and that's it 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:55.229
 do not come back 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:56.100
 so five points 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.360
 to learn in consideration 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.399
 as does most naughty talk but it's not new 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.059
 this is for his protection who is standing 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:08.929
 very good quality like all the products the lpg according to the brands 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.379
 who wins to be known 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:14.529
 and so the little cherry on the cake so to speak 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.960
 c ke 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.949
 the manufacturer also offers 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.949
 neo albouy however m so in fact these are 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.289
 the small ones that comes from us can 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.090
 and that allows you to customize your your protection from our 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:29.150
 algorithms 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.349
 to keep things going as fast as possible 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.389
 with several models of renewal protection that one 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.710
 and the year would have british what i want sanaa focus have again 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.449
 other 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.940
 where there is a hole here for the apple alas alas all interested unionized 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.909
 that's what it looks like 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:49.419
 so you actually have 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.259
 once elected so an outline 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:55.080
 of a different color so the yellow jatropha 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.889
 we have the same decision pushed the vice to the end of the line 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.189
 with protections 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:04.189
 to protect it is a strong signal 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.689
 protect us 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:16.680
 the forum portal 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.180
 the supervisors 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.499
 and to protect and German 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:24.789
 claude makelele long to change 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:27.789
 protected in the port of sète 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:32.520
 no no 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.460
 no for protection utility protect the port at the time 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.309
 extraordinary I find 

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:40.759
 soccer not prevented the most exciting 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:43.930
 so it depends in their city to the novel in which you used it 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:47.990
 mans it's always nice to be able to customize your iphone 

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:51.619
 so I want to make a game in the souk there 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.300
 what happens m 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:05.129
 our young people 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:10.229
 protection is the end of the month of fasting 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:13.499
 here 

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:16.499
 so every year the movies 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.490
 and that's what it gives with the outline of yellow 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.979
 we must understand ourselves 

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:36.469
 you have xstrata 2 different colors the time of the red blue green 

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:40.039
 to congratulate 

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:43.409
 I think it's really nice to customize 

00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:46.089
 its protection meaning above all redeem 

00:07:46.089 --> 00:07:49.089
 so I'm having fun on the site since Thursday 

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:52.220
 these kidnappings would be about 21 

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.240
 level up for them this protection there 

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.240
 alas this night book 

00:07:59.029 --> 00:08:02.099
 since a few weeks so it's been eleven years of 25 euros and 10 euros 

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:05.460
 so it's still very reasonable 

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.210
 to finish I thank his new partners who until now can not 

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.369
 vote is even more tonight 

00:08:11.369 --> 00:08:14.929
 and to communicate a list well is not it if you have questions it was 

00:08:14.929 --> 00:08:15.520
 rare 

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.960
 I am at my disposal and although this site
