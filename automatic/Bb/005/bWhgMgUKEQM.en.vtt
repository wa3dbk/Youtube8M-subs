the look category next category is gonna
be<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.530> portability<00:01:44.430> which<00:01:44.789> would<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.479> go

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
be on portability which would have to go

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.370 
be on portability which would have to go
to<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.930> JBL<00:01:46.469> the<00:01:47.310> Bose<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.479> substantially

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
thought that was a little bit bigger in

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.950 
thought that was a little bit bigger in
terms<00:05:34.960> of<00:05:35.229> the<00:05:35.320> extra<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.970> JBL<00:05:37.449> I<00:05:37.720> mean<00:05:37.900> you

see<00:05:38.139> me<00:05:38.259> the<00:05:38.380> Bose<00:05:38.560> does<00:05:38.860> have<00:05:39.159> a<00:05:39.190> mute<00:05:39.699> button

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.570 
see me the Bose does have a mute button
which<00:05:40.210> you<00:05:40.360> don't<00:05:40.539> really<00:05:40.630> see<00:05:41.080> on<00:05:41.580> Bluetooth

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
which you don't really see on Bluetooth

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.390 
which you don't really see on Bluetooth
speakers<00:05:43.000> but<00:05:43.270> in<00:05:43.360> terms<00:05:43.599> of<00:05:43.810> overall<00:05:43.990> like<00:05:44.650> my

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
speakers but in terms of overall like my

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.120 
speakers but in terms of overall like my
features<00:05:45.909> that<00:05:46.150> like<00:05:46.509> someone<00:05:46.870> would<00:05:46.990> use<00:05:47.320> the

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
features that like someone would use the

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.210 
features that like someone would use the
charge<00:05:48.490> does<00:05:49.479> kind<00:05:49.810> of<00:05:49.870> eat<00:05:50.020> that<00:05:50.229> out<00:05:50.409> so

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
charge does kind of eat that out so

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.340 
charge does kind of eat that out so
if<00:05:52.610> you're<00:05:52.759> going<00:05:52.940> by<00:05:53.120> the<00:05:53.180> tally<00:05:53.600> the<00:05:53.870> JBL

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
if you're going by the tally the JBL

if you're going by the tally the JBL
actually<00:05:54.830> wins<00:05:55.100> and<00:05:55.400> overall<00:05:55.820> categories

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
actually wins and overall categories

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.760 
actually wins and overall categories
however<00:05:58.449> it<00:05:59.449> really<00:05:59.750> depends<00:06:00.199> on<00:06:00.320> what's<00:06:00.560> more

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
however it really depends on what's more

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.499 
however it really depends on what's more
important<00:06:01.220> to<00:06:01.250> you<00:06:01.340> obviously<00:06:01.580> the<00:06:02.030> chain<00:06:02.270> BL

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
important to you obviously the chain BL

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:05.080 
important to you obviously the chain BL
is<00:06:02.690> more<00:06:02.900> portable<00:06:03.500> it's<00:06:03.680> lighter<00:06:04.039> does<00:06:04.880> come

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
is more portable it's lighter does come

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.600 
is more portable it's lighter does come
with<00:06:05.180> the<00:06:05.330> case<00:06:05.600> it<00:06:06.470> also<00:06:06.680> is<00:06:06.949> a<00:06:06.979> lot<00:06:07.130> lower<00:06:07.400> in

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
with the case it also is a lot lower in

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.310 
with the case it also is a lot lower in
price<00:06:07.940> and<00:06:08.330> does<00:06:08.509> have<00:06:08.720> some<00:06:08.900> really<00:06:09.050> cool

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
price and does have some really cool

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.140 
price and does have some really cool
extras<00:06:09.830> which<00:06:10.039> is<00:06:10.220> for<00:06:10.460> example<00:06:10.520> being<00:06:11.000> able

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
extras which is for example being able

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.060 
extras which is for example being able
to<00:06:11.240> charge<00:06:11.479> your<00:06:11.690> phone<00:06:11.750> now<00:06:12.740> the<00:06:12.800> Bose<00:06:13.840> has

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
to charge your phone now the Bose has

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.490 
to charge your phone now the Bose has
also<00:06:16.070> a<00:06:16.789> really<00:06:17.270> great<00:06:17.509> advantage<00:06:17.690> in<00:06:18.289> what

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
also a really great advantage in what

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.700 
also a really great advantage in what
that<00:06:18.680> is<00:06:18.860> is<00:06:19.130> that<00:06:19.990> the<00:06:20.990> sound<00:06:21.229> quality<00:06:21.680> is

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
that is is that the sound quality is

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.070 
that is is that the sound quality is
better<00:06:21.979> and<00:06:22.310> overall<00:06:22.669> I<00:06:23.000> think<00:06:23.449> when<00:06:23.690> it<00:06:23.810> comes

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
better and overall I think when it comes

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.230 
better and overall I think when it comes
to<00:06:24.380> the<00:06:24.590> Bluetooth<00:06:24.949> speaker<00:06:25.400> what<00:06:25.639> is<00:06:25.759> the<00:06:25.940> one

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
to the Bluetooth speaker what is the one

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.870 
to the Bluetooth speaker what is the one
most<00:06:26.539> important<00:06:27.139> thing<00:06:27.349> for<00:06:28.130> most<00:06:28.280> people<00:06:28.460> is

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
most important thing for most people is

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.180 
most important thing for most people is
being<00:06:29.360> able<00:06:29.449> to<00:06:29.599> have<00:06:29.750> a<00:06:29.810> speaker<00:06:30.349> that<00:06:30.650> they

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
being able to have a speaker that they

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.180 
being able to have a speaker that they
can<00:06:31.370> take<00:06:32.349> they<00:06:33.349> can<00:06:33.500> play<00:06:33.680> all<00:06:33.889> the<00:06:34.039> music

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
long they can get a great sound you can

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.710 
long they can get a great sound you can
leave<00:06:36.889> the<00:06:37.070> room<00:06:37.280> be<00:06:38.180> able<00:06:38.360> to<00:06:38.449> still<00:06:38.630> hear

leave the room be able to still hear
music<00:06:39.289> as<00:06:39.470> well<00:06:40.099> as<00:06:40.250> being<00:06:40.460> able<00:06:40.580> to<00:06:40.699> crank<00:06:41.090> the

worrying<00:06:43.340> about<00:06:43.400> a<00:06:43.610> distort<00:06:44.210> so<00:06:44.900> overall<00:06:45.380> I

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
worrying about a distort so overall I

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.520 
worrying about a distort so overall I
think<00:06:46.940> if<00:06:47.180> you're<00:06:47.570> more<00:06:47.840> into<00:06:48.110> the<00:06:48.259> sound

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
think if you're more into the sound

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.129 
think if you're more into the sound
quality<00:06:49.099> and<00:06:49.190> the<00:06:49.310> bass<00:06:49.610> the<00:06:50.000> clarity<00:06:50.599> you

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:51.139 
quality and the bass the clarity you

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:53.260 
quality and the bass the clarity you
don't<00:06:51.440> like<00:06:51.590> the<00:06:51.740> bose<00:06:51.949> better<00:06:52.340> if<00:06:52.729> you're<00:06:52.970> if

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
don't like the bose better if you're if
