00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
front feet I think that's the piss of

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.660 
front feet I think that's the piss of
the<00:01:34.110> piss<00:01:34.320> yeah<00:01:34.650> that's<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> piston<00:01:35.369> there<00:01:35.520> so

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the piss yeah that's the piston there so

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.190 
the piss yeah that's the piston there so
it's<00:01:35.790> very<00:01:35.939> similar<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.450> dread<00:01:36.780> Knight<00:01:36.930> it's

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
it's very similar to a dread Knight it's

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.330 
it's very similar to a dread Knight it's
kind<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.560> little<00:01:37.799> mini<00:01:37.950> dreadknight

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
kind of like a little mini dreadknight

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.770 
kind of like a little mini dreadknight
that<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> power<00:01:38.729> armor<00:01:39.000> do<00:01:39.119> kind<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.420> jumped<00:01:39.689> in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
that a power armor do kind of jumped in

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.140 
that a power armor do kind of jumped in
the<00:01:39.869> back<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.549> guess<00:01:41.549> they're<00:01:41.729> technically

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the back I guess they're technically

of these screws is identical which is
kind<00:01:59.440> of<00:01:59.530> interesting<00:01:59.680> because<00:02:00.100> that

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
kind of interesting because that

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.490 
kind of interesting because that

out<00:05:30.150> there<00:05:30.210> we're<00:05:30.480> wondering<00:05:30.840> if<00:05:31.020> you<00:05:31.230> know

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
out there we're wondering if you know

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.720 
out there we're wondering if you know
they<00:05:31.500> can<00:05:31.650> just<00:05:31.800> basically<00:05:31.919> put<00:05:32.400> it<00:05:32.490> in<00:05:32.580> the

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
they can just basically put it in the

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:38.570 
they can just basically put it in the
Rhino<00:05:33.740> the<00:05:34.740> Razorback<00:05:36.710> hole<00:05:37.710> there<00:05:38.010> that<00:05:38.340> you

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
Rhino the Razorback hole there that you

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.250 
Rhino the Razorback hole there that you
know<00:05:38.700> we've<00:05:38.910> seen<00:05:39.300> so<00:05:39.450> many<00:05:39.540> years<00:05:39.780> for<00:05:40.110> like

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
know we've seen so many years for like

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.390 
know we've seen so many years for like
the<00:05:40.410> predator<00:05:40.590> and<00:05:40.860> things<00:05:41.040> like<00:05:41.160> that<00:05:41.220> but

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
the predator and things like that but

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.330 
the predator and things like that but
obviously<00:05:41.880> you<00:05:42.030> can't<00:05:42.300> it<00:05:42.540> is<00:05:43.230> too<00:05:43.770> big<00:05:43.980> it's

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
obviously you can't it is too big it's

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.010 
obviously you can't it is too big it's
almost<00:05:44.460> like<00:05:44.640> they<00:05:44.850> knew<00:05:44.880> that<00:05:45.090> and<00:05:45.510> then

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
almost like they knew that and then

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.310 
almost like they knew that and then
you've<00:05:46.169> got<00:05:46.200> this<00:05:46.500> piece<00:05:46.770> here<00:05:47.220> which<00:05:47.370> is<00:05:47.730> the

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
you've got this piece here which is the

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.170 
you've got this piece here which is the
you<00:05:49.320> know<00:05:49.410> goes<00:05:49.620> into<00:05:49.890> their<00:05:50.040> for<00:05:50.370> the<00:05:50.520> sky

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
you know goes into their for the sky

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.510 
you know goes into their for the sky
spear<00:05:51.540> it<00:05:52.080> also<00:05:52.590> will<00:05:52.740> not<00:05:52.890> fit<00:05:53.100> that<00:05:53.280> so

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
spear it also will not fit that so

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.530
