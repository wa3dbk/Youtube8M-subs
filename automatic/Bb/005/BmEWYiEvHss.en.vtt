moves<00:00:37.680> or<00:00:37.920> leech<00:00:38.100> seed<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:39.180> then<00:00:39.300> she

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
moves or leech seed but then she

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.830 
moves or leech seed but then she
switches<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.930> out<00:00:40.020> into<00:00:40.260> dragonite<00:00:41.660> kind<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.750> a

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
switches it out into dragonite kind of a

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.540 
switches it out into dragonite kind of a
weird<00:00:43.020> switch<00:00:43.290> maybe<00:00:43.800> she<00:00:44.010> was<00:00:44.129> expecting<00:00:44.520> me

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
weird switch maybe she was expecting me

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.130 
weird switch maybe she was expecting me
to<00:00:44.700> switch<00:00:44.910> out<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.180> vlog<00:00:45.600> which<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.960> actually

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
to switch out a vlog which I actually

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.350 
to switch out a vlog which I actually
did<00:00:46.620> into<00:00:46.980> manectric<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.730> was<00:00:47.879> expecting<00:00:48.149> like

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
did into manectric I was expecting like

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.840 
did into manectric I was expecting like
a<00:00:48.480> stun<00:00:48.870> spore<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.550> because

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
a stun spore you can and because

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.160 
a stun spore you can and because
electric<00:00:51.210> types<00:00:51.420> are<00:00:51.570> immune<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.809> paralysis

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
electric types are immune to paralysis

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.660 
electric types are immune to paralysis
now<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.920> would<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.280> been<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.460> decent

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
now and that would have been a decent

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.600 
now and that would have been a decent
switch<00:00:54.289> but<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> figure<00:00:55.590> manectric<00:00:56.370> can

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
switch but a figure manectric can

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.849 
switch but a figure manectric can
definitely<00:00:57.090> take<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.840> dragon<00:00:58.320> eyes<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.620> mean

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
definitely take on a dragon eyes I mean

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.610 
definitely take on a dragon eyes I mean
it's<00:00:59.010> got<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.309> power<00:00:59.550> rights<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:01.020> mega<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.500> all

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
it's got in power rights so mega of all

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.470 
it's got in power rights so mega of all
of<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.800> thing<00:01:02.070> intimidate<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.820> also<00:01:03.270> going

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
of that thing intimidate is also going

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.469 
of that thing intimidate is also going
to<00:01:03.660> prove<00:01:03.899> pretty<00:01:04.260> helpful<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.739> hope<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.479> then

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
to prove pretty helpful I hope and then

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.840 
to prove pretty helpful I hope and then
away<00:01:06.869> goes<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> hidden<00:01:07.500> power<00:01:07.850> however

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
away goes to the hidden power however

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.060 
away goes to the hidden power however
multi-scale<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.750> still<00:01:09.960> active<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.350> dragonite

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
multi-scale is still active so dragonite

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.219 
multi-scale is still active so dragonite
is<00:01:11.250> gonna<00:01:11.549> survive<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.990> one<00:01:13.140> of

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
is gonna survive it and it's one of

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.219 
is gonna survive it and it's one of
those<00:01:13.320> weakness<00:01:13.799> policy<00:01:14.220> dragon<00:01:14.580> heights<00:01:15.229> so

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
those weakness policy dragon heights so

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.320 
those weakness policy dragon heights so
we<00:01:16.830> might<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> bit<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.880> problem<00:01:18.119> our

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
we might have a bit of a problem our

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.190 
we might have a bit of a problem our
hands<00:01:18.509> now<00:01:18.570> NGOs<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.500> drag<00:01:19.710> advanced<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.250> well

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
hands now NGOs for drag advanced as well

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.719 
hands now NGOs for drag advanced as well
so<00:01:22.200> oh<00:01:22.530> boy<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.009> made<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> huge<00:01:23.490> mistake<00:01:25.220> or<00:01:26.220> did<00:01:26.580> I

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
so oh boy I made a huge mistake or did I

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.999 
so oh boy I made a huge mistake or did I
because<00:01:27.600> somehow<00:01:27.840> mega<00:01:28.200> manectric<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.770> still

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
because somehow mega manectric is still

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.260 
because somehow mega manectric is still
faster<00:01:29.310> than<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> +1<00:01:30.570> Dragonite<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:32.270> didn't

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
faster than a +1 Dragonite I didn't

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.969 
faster than a +1 Dragonite I didn't
expect<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.840> because<00:01:34.079> mega<00:01:34.500> meaning<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.920> it

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
expect that because mega meaning to it

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.609 
expect that because mega meaning to it
was<00:01:35.130> getting<00:01:35.400> out<00:01:35.579> sped<00:01:36.030> by<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.509> plus<00:01:37.290> two

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
cloisters earlier and I'm pretty sure

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.100

plus to cloister and +1 dragonite are

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.580 
plus to cloister and +1 dragonite are
fairly<00:01:43.860> close<00:01:44.189> together<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.850> speed<00:01:45.590> anyway

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
fairly close together in speed anyway

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.679 
fairly close together in speed anyway
she<00:01:46.770> brings<00:01:46.950> out<00:01:47.100> more<00:01:47.369> while<00:01:47.640> which<00:01:48.570> is

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
she brings out more while which is

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.060 
she brings out more while which is
obviously<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.229> become<00:01:49.470> mega<00:01:49.770> mall

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
obviously going to become mega mall

best showing but I have a plan bring
cobalion<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.670> because<00:02:53.940> cobalion<00:02:54.239> is<00:02:54.510> bound<00:02:54.750> to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
cobalion in because cobalion is bound to

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.530 
cobalion in because cobalion is bound to
be<00:02:54.900> faster<00:02:55.640> knew<00:02:56.640> she<00:02:56.850> was<00:02:56.970> probably<00:02:57.180> gonna<00:02:57.390> go

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
be faster knew she was probably gonna go

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.970 
be faster knew she was probably gonna go
for<00:02:57.720> sucker<00:02:57.900> punch<00:02:58.170> in<00:02:58.320> that<00:02:58.440> case<00:02:58.680> but

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
for sucker punch in that case but

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.710 
for sucker punch in that case but
cobalion<00:02:59.280> can<00:02:59.670> easily<00:03:00.180> take<00:03:00.330> one<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.630> those

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
cobalion can easily take one of those

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.390 
cobalion can easily take one of those
and<00:03:01.020> he<00:03:01.350> gets<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.680> attack<00:03:01.890> boost<00:03:02.160> from

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
and he gets the attack boost from

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.770 
and he gets the attack boost from
