sound<00:00:56.030> a<00:00:56.210> little<00:00:56.239> ridiculous<00:00:56.660> but<00:00:56.840> according

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
sound a little ridiculous but according

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.319 
sound a little ridiculous but according
to<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.500> UN<00:00:57.680> water<00:00:57.920> organization<00:00:58.550> diarrhea

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
to the UN water organization diarrhea

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:00.939 
to the UN water organization diarrhea
caused<00:00:59.690> by<00:00:59.930> a<00:00:59.960> lack<00:01:00.079> of<00:01:00.260> adequate<00:01:00.590> sanitation

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
caused by a lack of adequate sanitation

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.850 
caused by a lack of adequate sanitation
facilities<00:01:01.430> is<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:02.690> number<00:01:03.140> one<00:01:03.500> cause<00:01:03.800> of

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
facilities is the number one cause of

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.920 
facilities is the number one cause of
death<00:01:04.190> in<00:01:04.369> the<00:01:04.400> world<00:01:04.640> not<00:01:04.850> starvation<00:01:05.540> or<00:01:05.659> war

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
death in the world not starvation or war

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.140 
death in the world not starvation or war
or<00:01:06.200> any<00:01:06.530> of<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:06.770> stuff<00:01:06.950> a<00:01:07.250> lack<00:01:07.610> of<00:01:07.640> potties

or any of that stuff a lack of potties

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.910 
or any of that stuff a lack of potties
so<00:01:08.630> basically<00:01:09.170> if<00:01:09.350> it's<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.650> zombie

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
so basically if it's the zombie

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.710 
so basically if it's the zombie
apocalypse<00:01:09.950> you're<00:01:10.759> probably<00:01:11.030> not<00:01:11.360> going<00:01:11.630> to

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
apocalypse you're probably not going to

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.210 
apocalypse you're probably not going to
have<00:01:11.900> running<00:01:12.170> water<00:01:12.200> there<00:01:12.619> for<00:01:12.860> doing<00:01:13.190> your
