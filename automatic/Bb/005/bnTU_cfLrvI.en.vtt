like<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.990> world<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.490> thought<00:01:14.670> it'd

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
like that in the world so I thought it'd

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.550

office<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.200> next<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.590> next

office to the next to the next

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.490 
office to the next to the next
it's<00:01:59.399> basically<00:01:59.729> one-stop<00:02:00.270> shopping<00:02:00.990> for<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
it's basically one-stop shopping for the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.590 
it's basically one-stop shopping for the
spine<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.729> nice<00:02:02.880> thing<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.240> we<00:02:03.450> have

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
spine and the nice thing is that we have

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.630 
spine and the nice thing is that we have
an<00:02:03.689> answer<00:02:03.899> for<00:02:04.049> almost<00:02:04.439> every<00:02:04.920> spine<00:02:05.219> patient

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
an answer for almost every spine patient

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.570 
an answer for almost every spine patient
who<00:02:05.729> walks<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.180> door<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:07.369> luckily<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
who walks in the door and luckily the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.760 
who walks in the door and luckily the
answer<00:02:08.819> for<00:02:08.940> most<00:02:09.119> patients<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.569> not<00:02:09.770> surgery

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
answer for most patients is not surgery

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.690 
answer for most patients is not surgery
but<00:02:10.890> at<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.039> same<00:02:11.190> time<00:02:11.370> when<00:02:11.520> it's<00:02:11.640> not

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
but at the same time when it's not

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.770 
but at the same time when it's not
surgery<00:02:12.120> we

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
surgery we

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.690 
surgery we
the<00:02:13.069> non-operative<00:02:14.069> treatment<00:02:14.340> available

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
the non-operative treatment available

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.460 
the non-operative treatment available
here<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.000> don't<00:02:15.180> have<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.420> go<00:02:15.540> elsewhere

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
here you don't have to go elsewhere

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.340 
here you don't have to go elsewhere
so<00:02:17.340> most<00:02:17.720> orthopedic<00:02:18.720> neurosurgical

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
so most orthopedic neurosurgical

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.770 
so most orthopedic neurosurgical
practices<00:02:20.010> are<00:02:20.670> set<00:02:20.880> up<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.120> offer<00:02:21.240> surgery

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
practices are set up to offer surgery

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.570 
practices are set up to offer surgery
they<00:02:22.410> don't<00:02:22.590> necessarily<00:02:23.100> provide<00:02:23.220> the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
they don't necessarily provide the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.480 
they don't necessarily provide the

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
non-operative treatments such as therapy

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.510 
non-operative treatments such as therapy
injections<00:02:26.750> medical<00:02:27.750> management<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.489> on

injections medical management and so on

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.979 
injections medical management and so on
so<00:02:29.850> if<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.060> go<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.209> see<00:02:30.420> an<00:02:30.510> orthopedic

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
so if you go to see an orthopedic

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.110 
so if you go to see an orthopedic
surgeon<00:02:31.410> or<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.709> neurosurgeon<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:33.000> they

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
surgeon or a neurosurgeon and they

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.490 
surgeon or a neurosurgeon and they
decide<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.450> surgery's<00:02:33.870> not<00:02:34.080> for<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.350> they

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
decide that surgery's not for you they

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.960 
decide that surgery's not for you they
oftentimes<00:02:34.800> don't<00:02:35.040> have<00:02:35.400> an<00:02:35.489> answer

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
oftentimes don't have an answer

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.510 
oftentimes don't have an answer
luckily<00:02:36.810> for<00:02:37.110> patients<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.950> turns<00:02:38.190> out<00:02:38.340> that

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
luckily for patients it turns out that

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.030 
luckily for patients it turns out that
the<00:02:39.300> vast<00:02:39.480> majority<00:02:39.870> don't<00:02:40.020> need<00:02:40.319> surgery<00:02:40.650> for

the vast majority don't need surgery for

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
turned out for all three disorders

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.449 
turned out for all three disorders
surgery<00:03:43.500> was<00:03:44.250> very<00:03:44.489> much<00:03:44.700> favored<00:03:45.440> and<00:03:46.459> again

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
surgery was very much favored and again

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
of this study and I think the the key to

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.810 
of this study and I think the the key to
the<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.680> fact<00:04:01.829> that<00:04:01.980> surgery<00:04:02.400> did<00:04:02.609> better

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
the the fact that surgery did better

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.610 
the the fact that surgery did better

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
than non operative treatment was that we

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.610 
than non operative treatment was that we

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
few places can you be sitting at your

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.770 
few places can you be sitting at your
desk<00:05:48.800> poring<00:05:49.800> over<00:05:49.890> data<00:05:50.250> and<00:05:50.490> doing<00:05:50.790> research

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
desk poring over data and doing research

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.420 
desk poring over data and doing research
and<00:05:51.960> then<00:05:52.080> walk<00:05:52.290> across<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:53.040> hall<00:05:53.160> to<00:05:53.190> the

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
and then walk across the hall to the

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.420 
and then walk across the hall to the
clinic<00:05:53.760> and<00:05:53.910> then<00:05:54.510> use<00:05:55.440> the<00:05:55.740> things<00:05:56.310> that

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
clinic and then use the things that

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.680 
clinic and then use the things that
you've<00:05:56.550> found<00:05:56.700> from<00:05:56.940> that<00:05:57.060> research<00:05:57.360> to

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
you've found from that research to

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.780 
you've found from that research to
directly<00:05:58.290> influence<00:05:58.740> how<00:05:59.220> you<00:05:59.280> take<00:05:59.520> care<00:05:59.730> of

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
directly influence how you take care of

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.320 
directly influence how you take care of
patients<00:06:00.270> so<00:06:00.450> it's<00:06:00.630> a<00:06:00.780> it's<00:06:01.410> a<00:06:01.470> very

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
patients so it's a it's a very

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.510

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
to to go from the research realm

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.160 
to to go from the research realm
directly<00:06:08.310> to<00:06:08.430> the<00:06:08.520> clinical<00:06:08.940> realm<00:06:09.150> without<00:06:09.960> a
