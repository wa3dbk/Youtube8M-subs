00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
generally it feels a bit more like a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.740

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
good job of not looking too modern

for<00:02:01.409> g1<00:02:01.740> toys<00:02:02.030> personally<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> prefer<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.509> type

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
for g1 toys personally I prefer the type

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.870 
for g1 toys personally I prefer the type
one<00:02:04.110> mostly<00:02:04.500> because<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:05.040> angular<00:02:05.610> features

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
one mostly because the angular features

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.809 
one mostly because the angular features
just<00:02:06.270> make<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.259> much<00:02:07.530> more<00:02:07.590> sinister<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.640> me

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
just make it so much more sinister to me

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.550 
just make it so much more sinister to me
but<00:02:09.330> those<00:02:09.479> who<00:02:09.629> prefer<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> retro<00:02:10.410> aesthetic

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
but those who prefer a retro aesthetic

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.670 
but those who prefer a retro aesthetic
may<00:02:11.099> prefer<00:02:11.849> head<00:02:12.390> number<00:02:12.690> two<00:02:12.900> since

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
may prefer head number two since

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.860 
may prefer head number two since
it<00:02:13.709> harkens<00:02:13.920> back<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.519> somewhat<00:02:15.209> chunkier

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
it harkens back to the somewhat chunkier

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.530 
it harkens back to the somewhat chunkier
