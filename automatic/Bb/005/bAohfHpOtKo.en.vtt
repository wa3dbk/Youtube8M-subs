00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.210
 Pinta 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.160
 yes 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.450
 to prepare this recipe we are going to 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.279
 need the following ingredients 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.220
 the main ingredient is cauliflower 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.320
 and here is going to be the mass we are also going to 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.720
 be an egg and then what we want and 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.759
 adding apart crushed onion 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.980
 red pepper tomato cherry olives 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.980
 tuna oregano whatever we want 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.430
 at the beginning I added half a kilo of 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.520
 cauliflower in the end end up in white and 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.230
 whole flower 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.150
 the collection is important that is not 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.410
 wet basis since the base has to be 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.320
 dry 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.260
 if you have a good chopper or blender 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.390
 and can crush the perfect ones that I 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.030
 I have a normal blender and I do not 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.430
 he managed to chop it the way he has 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.100
 to be therefore what I had to 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.370
 make is a grater and scratch little to 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.370
 little bit 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.780
 then this will be the aspect that remains 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.120
 as well as a kind of flour so 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.120
 say it very attentive very small 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:30.110
 I like one had more to chop what 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.880
 I did was pass it to the microwave the tones 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.270
 that were left so that they will soften 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.270
 bit 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.460
 and then add the semi-cured cheese 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:53.020
 I had grated it because I scratched it 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.020
 It's 26 grams 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.680
 but each one can throw what 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.720
 want these are the amounts that I 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.310
 I used but you can add 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.970
 other ingredients or use other 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.970
 amounts 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.540
 then we are going to mix the cauliflower in 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.370
 a vegetable paper is good for the tray 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:14.090
 of the oven we are going to mix with an egg 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:17.170
 so that it sticks a little bit more and it does not 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.170
 the mass is so separated 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.450
 and we are expanding them all over this 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.730
 recipe goes great for the days that are 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.650
 that are very low in calories that do not 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.930
 we can eat a lot of carbohydrates 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.720
 many fats this recipe goes great 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.240
 because you take off a bit in the overalls 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.410
 leaf craving pizza and you're 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.410
 eating something very healthy 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.420
 this would be the appearance 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.700
 So what we do is pass it to 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.099
 oven and while we are piling the rest 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.379
 ingredients in the end I added more than that 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.299
 another 28 grams in total about 50 grams 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.970
 approximately add also the 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.510
 mushrooms 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.380
 by 58 grams and while the piece was 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.330
 in the oven 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.920
 As long as I do not know even a 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.360
 true until I saw that it was 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.820
 lying down 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.800
 that you are controlling, we add the 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.840
 ingredients that I want I was 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.500
 thinking because I wanted to register them for 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.500
 have the macronutrients 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.540
 and this will be the aspect if the grams of 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.590
 oven so it has to look like toasted 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.330
 Now well, we start all the 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.980
 ingredients and we add them above 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.900
 we put the tomato base first 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.370
 crushed and we add with the 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.210
 ingredients 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.340
 and something like that would remain 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.410
 and nothing the last touch would be more to 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.720
 oven until the following are made 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.120
 from above and it would look something like this 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.470
 controlling so that it does not burn and the 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.750
 truth is that it is very toasted very 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.280
 crispy and is very good I hope that you 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.200
 have liked it along with a like this 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.200
