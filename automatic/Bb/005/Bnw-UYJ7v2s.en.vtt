00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
probably where we got the seed that we

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.750 
probably where we got the seed that we
got<00:00:40.170> because<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.739> respect<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.489> committee

has<00:01:00.539> almost<00:01:00.899> been<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> disaster<00:01:01.949> from<00:01:02.070> a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
has almost been a disaster from a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.340 
has almost been a disaster from a
coaching<00:01:02.460> standpoint<00:01:03.080> yet<00:01:04.080> they've

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
coaching standpoint yet they've

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.800 
coaching standpoint yet they've
continued<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.220> regroup<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.119> think<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.600> is

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
continued to regroup and I think this is

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.320 
continued to regroup and I think this is
one<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.049> coach<00:01:07.350> calls<00:01:08.060> absolutely<00:01:09.060> best

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
one of coach calls absolutely best
