a timer that's adjustable from 1 to 60

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.130 
a timer that's adjustable from 1 to 60
seconds<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.299> determines<00:01:48.900> the<00:01:49.020> amount

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
seconds and that determines the amount

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.109 
seconds and that determines the amount
of<00:01:49.350> delay<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> lights<00:01:50.250> will<00:01:50.430> stay<00:01:50.700> on

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
of delay that the lights will stay on

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.160 
of delay that the lights will stay on
and<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.290> installation<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:52.979> pretty<00:01:53.580> simple

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
and the installation is pretty simple

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.010 
and the installation is pretty simple
what<00:01:55.170> you're<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> do<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.930> for<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
what you're going to do and for the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.260 
what you're going to do and for the
installation<00:01:58.710> I've<00:01:58.920> developed<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.520> few<00:02:00.180> little

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
installation I've developed a few little

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.000 
installation I've developed a few little
jumpers<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:00.810> you're<00:02:01.080> going<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.290> tie<00:02:01.470> into<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
jumpers but you're going to tie into the

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.460 
jumpers but you're going to tie into the
into<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.060> ground<00:02:03.630> circuit<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.290> power

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
into the ground circuit and the power

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.770 
into the ground circuit and the power
circuit<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.220> courtesy<00:02:05.549> lights<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.450> needs

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
circuit for the courtesy lights it needs

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.229 
circuit for the courtesy lights it needs
it's<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.619> module<00:02:07.950> needs<00:02:08.099> its<00:02:08.280> own<00:02:08.369> ground<00:02:08.909> and

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
it's the module needs its own ground and

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.630 
it's the module needs its own ground and
it<00:02:09.780> needs<00:02:10.019> an<00:02:10.289> ignition<00:02:10.679> switch<00:02:11.129> League<00:02:11.430> and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
it needs an ignition switch League and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.809 
it needs an ignition switch League and
the<00:02:12.120> reason<00:02:12.420> for<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.140> as<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:14.040> go<00:02:14.670> in

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
the reason for that is that as you go in

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.170 
the reason for that is that as you go in
the<00:02:14.939> car<00:02:15.349> when<00:02:16.349> you<00:02:16.680> if<00:02:17.099> you<00:02:17.519> can<00:02:17.669> let<00:02:17.819> those<00:02:17.939> go

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
the car when you if you can let those go

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.449 
the car when you if you can let those go
Don<00:02:18.389> when<00:02:19.109> you<00:02:19.409> know<00:02:19.529> if<00:02:19.769> you<00:02:19.980> open<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.430> door

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
Don when you know if you open the door

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.280 
Don when you know if you open the door
when<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.269> close<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.779> door<00:02:21.959> again

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
when you close the door again

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.750 
when you close the door again
this<00:02:25.290> in<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.680> typical<00:02:26.160> application<00:02:26.670> the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
this in this typical application the

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.210 
this in this typical application the
lights<00:02:26.970> go<00:02:27.180> out<00:02:27.209> with<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.930> module<00:02:28.410> it's<00:02:28.980> going

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
lights go out with the module it's going

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.370 
lights go out with the module it's going
to<00:02:29.340> be<00:02:29.490> delayed<00:02:30.180> by<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.780> amount<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.170> time<00:02:31.350> you

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
to be delayed by the amount of time you

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.559 
to be delayed by the amount of time you
set<00:02:31.830> unless<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.850> turn<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.180> ignition<00:02:33.240> switch

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
set unless you turn the ignition switch

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.270 
set unless you turn the ignition switch
on<00:02:33.900> right<00:02:34.110> away<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.709> what<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.950> ignition

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
on right away and what the ignition

on right away and what the ignition
switch<00:02:35.310> does<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.540> cut<00:02:36.900> set<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.530> zero<00:02:37.800> and

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
switch does is is cut set to zero and

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.470 
switch does is is cut set to zero and
the<00:02:38.220> lights<00:02:38.400> go<00:02:38.520> out<00:02:38.610> automatically<00:02:39.209> what

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
the lights go out automatically what

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.880 
the lights go out automatically what
you're<00:02:39.630> going<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.840> do<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.230> tie<00:02:40.740> in<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:42.330> orange

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
you're going to do is tie in the orange

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.140 
you're going to do is tie in the orange
I'm<00:02:43.890> going<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.100> add<00:02:44.220> this<00:02:44.400> jumper<00:02:44.820> because<00:02:45.000> it

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
I'm going to add this jumper because it

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.570 
I'm going to add this jumper because it
gives<00:02:45.270> me<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.840> ability<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.620> tie<00:02:46.830> orange<00:02:47.370> and

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
gives me the ability to tie orange and

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.690 
gives me the ability to tie orange and
weight<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.140> module<00:02:49.590> which<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:50.070> power<00:02:50.400> and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
weight to the module which is power and

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.490 
weight to the module which is power and
the<00:02:51.980> courtesy<00:02:52.980> light<00:02:53.160> ground<00:02:53.900> now<00:02:54.900> what<00:02:55.350> I'm

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
the courtesy light ground now what I'm

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.320 
the courtesy light ground now what I'm
doing<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.070> just<00:02:56.130> developed<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.820> little<00:02:57.000> set

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
doing is I just developed a little set

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330 
doing is I just developed a little set
of<00:02:57.360> jumpers<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:58.050> can<00:02:58.230> splice<00:02:58.530> these<00:02:58.830> in<00:02:59.100> any

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
of jumpers you can splice these in any

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.790 
of jumpers you can splice these in any
way<00:02:59.670> you<00:02:59.730> want<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.420> it's<00:03:01.200> just<00:03:01.380> easy<00:03:01.560> for<00:03:01.739> the

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
way you want but it's just easy for the

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.110 
way you want but it's just easy for the
sake<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.010> demonstration<00:03:02.220> because<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:02.970> works

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
sake of demonstration because it works

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.820 
sake of demonstration because it works
pretty<00:03:03.300> quickly<00:03:03.630> here<00:03:03.810> but<00:03:04.470> that's<00:03:04.680> what

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
pretty quickly here but that's what

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.759 
pretty quickly here but that's what
you're<00:03:04.980> going<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.340> do<00:03:05.489> is<00:03:05.640> tie<00:03:05.850> into<00:03:06.150> those<00:03:06.769> so

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
you're going to do is tie into those so

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.770 
you're going to do is tie into those so
we've<00:03:08.070> tied<00:03:08.340> into<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:11.300> courtesy<00:03:12.300> light<00:03:12.480> power

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
we've tied into the courtesy light power

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.110 
we've tied into the courtesy light power
and<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.410> courtesy<00:03:13.860> light<00:03:14.040> ground<00:03:14.280> we<00:03:14.880> need<00:03:14.910> to

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
and the courtesy light ground we need to

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.270 
and the courtesy light ground we need to
tie<00:03:15.450> in<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.690> ground<00:03:16.080> so<00:03:16.769> what<00:03:16.920> I'm<00:03:17.040> going<00:03:17.190> to

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
tie in the ground so what I'm going to

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.420 
tie in the ground so what I'm going to
do<00:03:17.459> is<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:18.090> took<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.650> ground<00:03:19.650> lead<00:03:19.950> that's<00:03:20.190> all

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
do is I took the ground lead that's all

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.020 
do is I took the ground lead that's all
for<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.700> switch<00:03:21.000> itself<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.989> I<00:03:22.769> can<00:03:23.010> sort<00:03:23.850> of

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
for the switch itself and I can sort of

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.350 
for the switch itself and I can sort of
tie<00:03:24.209> into<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:27.480> now<00:03:28.350> i<00:03:28.410> have<00:03:29.090> three<00:03:30.090> leads

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
tie into that and now i have three leads

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.150 
tie into that and now i have three leads
that<00:03:30.660> are<00:03:30.690> available<00:03:30.900> for<00:03:31.500> me<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.650> tie<00:03:31.920> into

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
that are available for me to tie into

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.180 
that are available for me to tie into
the<00:03:32.340> module<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.209> i<00:03:33.269> can<00:03:33.480> hook<00:03:33.630> up<00:03:33.840> my<00:03:34.190> ground

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
the module so i can hook up my ground

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.890 
the module so i can hook up my ground
now<00:03:35.640> i'm<00:03:35.850> going<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.120> do<00:03:36.269> is<00:03:36.420> I'm<00:03:36.540> just<00:03:36.660> going<00:03:36.750> to

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
now i'm going to do is I'm just going to

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.810 
now i'm going to do is I'm just going to
put<00:03:37.079> these<00:03:37.200> together<00:03:37.440> kit<00:03:38.190> comes<00:03:38.400> with<00:03:38.519> butt

put these together kit comes with butt

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.479 
put these together kit comes with butt
connectors<00:03:39.329> for<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.720> do<00:03:39.870> that<00:03:40.340> which<00:03:41.340> you

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
connectors for you to do that which you

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.050 
connectors for you to do that which you
can<00:03:41.670> pretty<00:03:42.030> easily<00:03:42.120> do<00:03:42.769> I<00:03:43.769> won't<00:03:44.459> connect

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
can pretty easily do I won't connect

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.280 
can pretty easily do I won't connect
them<00:03:45.209> I'll<00:03:45.329> just<00:03:45.480> twist<00:03:45.750> them<00:03:45.870> for<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.079> sake

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
them I'll just twist them for the sake

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.199 
them I'll just twist them for the sake
here<00:03:46.470> but<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.650> don't<00:03:46.950> suggest<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.519> do<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:47.970> I

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
here but I don't suggest you do that I

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.270 
here but I don't suggest you do that I
would<00:03:48.720> suggest<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:49.170> solder<00:03:49.530> them<00:03:49.709> or<00:03:49.920> use<00:03:50.100> the

would suggest you solder them or use the

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.740 
would suggest you solder them or use the
blood<00:03:50.459> connectors<00:03:50.940> but<00:03:51.150> this<00:03:51.329> for<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.570> sake

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
blood connectors but this for the sake

goes to the power lead and you have an

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.660 
goes to the power lead and you have an
ignition<00:04:10.530> lead<00:04:12.410> which<00:04:13.410> we<00:04:14.160> have<00:04:14.340> an<00:04:14.459> ignition

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
ignition lead which we have an ignition

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.120 
ignition lead which we have an ignition
switch<00:04:15.090> here<00:04:15.420> we're<00:04:15.930> going<00:04:16.079> to<00:04:16.289> tie<00:04:16.530> into<00:04:16.799> any

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
switch here we're going to tie into any

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.969 
switch here we're going to tie into any
any<00:04:17.489> circuit<00:04:18.209> on<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.479> ignition<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.739> could<00:04:19.919> be

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
any circuit on the ignition it could be

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.490 
any circuit on the ignition it could be
any<00:04:20.130> place<00:04:20.400> in<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.640> ignition<00:04:21.150> circuit<00:04:21.500> but

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
any place in the ignition circuit but

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.930 
any place in the ignition circuit but
you<00:04:22.620> need<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.860> get<00:04:22.979> ignition<00:04:23.250> coward<00:04:23.789> and

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
you need to get ignition coward and

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.790 
you need to get ignition coward and
that's<00:04:24.090> because<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.539> module<00:04:25.020> needs<00:04:25.229> to<00:04:25.470> sense

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
that's because the module needs to sense

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.770 
that's because the module needs to sense
that<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.610> ignition<00:04:27.000> switch<00:04:27.030> has<00:04:27.360> been<00:04:27.539> turned

that the ignition switch has been turned

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.159 
that the ignition switch has been turned
on<00:04:28.070> okay<00:04:29.070> so<00:04:29.210> where<00:04:30.210> we're<00:04:30.360> at<00:04:30.390> right<00:04:30.660> now<00:04:30.720> is

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
on okay so where we're at right now is

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.310 
on okay so where we're at right now is
we<00:04:31.430> we<00:04:32.430> set<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:33.150> module

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
we we set the module

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.830 
we we set the module
at<00:04:34.410> eight<00:04:35.130> second<00:04:35.820> delay<00:04:36.350> so<00:04:38.000> right<00:04:39.000> now<00:04:39.030> Don's

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
at eight second delay so right now Don's

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.190 
at eight second delay so right now Don's
going<00:04:40.140> to<00:04:40.230> open<00:04:41.040> the<00:04:41.160> switch<00:04:41.370> is<00:04:41.700> if<00:04:42.000> you<00:04:42.200> open

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
going to open the switch is if you open

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.400 
going to open the switch is if you open

the<00:05:23.640> one<00:05:23.820> thing<00:05:23.850> about<00:05:24.350> these<00:05:25.350> modules<00:05:25.740> is

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
the one thing about these modules is

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.880 
the one thing about these modules is
that<00:05:26.640> you'll<00:05:26.850> see<00:05:27.030> that<00:05:27.210> they<00:05:27.360> come<00:05:27.600> with<00:05:27.890> this

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
that you'll see that they come with this

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.890 
that you'll see that they come with this
little<00:05:29.160> wedge<00:05:29.580> here<00:05:30.060> they<00:05:30.480> come<00:05:30.660> with<00:05:30.780> their

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
little wedge here they come with their

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.590 
little wedge here they come with their
own<00:05:30.930> mounting<00:05:31.380> bracket<00:05:31.740> and<00:05:31.860> this<00:05:32.100> wedge<00:05:32.600> this

is<00:05:33.780> part<00:05:34.020> of<00:05:34.050> a<00:05:34.170> series<00:05:34.200> of<00:05:34.740> modules<00:05:35.460> that<00:05:35.880> we

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
is part of a series of modules that we

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.340 
is part of a series of modules that we
have<00:05:36.420> and<00:05:37.430> there's<00:05:38.430> a<00:05:38.520> few<00:05:38.820> other<00:05:38.850> etc

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
have and there's a few other etc

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.890 
have and there's a few other etc
involved<00:05:40.350> this<00:05:40.470> one<00:05:40.680> happens<00:05:41.190> to<00:05:41.280> be<00:05:41.370> a

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
involved this one happens to be a

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.950 
involved this one happens to be a
headlight<00:05:42.900> delay<00:05:43.770> module<00:05:44.340> but<00:05:44.910> what<00:05:45.810> this

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
headlight delay module but what this

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.300 
headlight delay module but what this
enables<00:05:46.320> you<00:05:46.410> to<00:05:46.440> do<00:05:46.680> is<00:05:46.800> if<00:05:46.950> you<00:05:47.070> pick<00:05:47.280> a

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
enables you to do is if you pick a

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.890 
enables you to do is if you pick a
location<00:05:47.490> in<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.120> car<00:05:48.330> that<00:05:48.510> you<00:05:48.630> want<00:05:48.810> to

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
location in the car that you want to

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.780 
location in the car that you want to
mount<00:05:49.050> these<00:05:49.350> you<00:05:49.980> don't<00:05:50.190> necessarily<00:05:50.310> have

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
mount these you don't necessarily have

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.000 
mount these you don't necessarily have
to<00:05:50.940> mount<00:05:51.180> each<00:05:51.480> one<00:05:51.810> with<00:05:52.290> its<00:05:52.320> own<00:05:52.590> mounting

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
to mount each one with its own mounting

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.580 
to mount each one with its own mounting
bracket<00:05:53.430> the<00:05:54.060> way<00:05:54.270> that<00:05:54.510> the<00:05:54.660> edges<00:05:55.170> are<00:05:55.320> on

and what that red locking wedge does is

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.950 
and what that red locking wedge does is
as<00:06:17.730> you<00:06:18.000> snap<00:06:18.210> them<00:06:18.360> together<00:06:18.480> from

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
as you snap them together from

as you snap them together from
underneath<00:06:19.320> you<00:06:19.920> put<00:06:20.130> the<00:06:20.250> wedge<00:06:20.430> in<00:06:20.760> and<00:06:21.150> that

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.390 
underneath you put the wedge in and that

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.360 
underneath you put the wedge in and that
holds<00:06:21.720> them<00:06:21.840> all<00:06:21.930> together<00:06:22.080> so<00:06:22.830> you<00:06:22.890> can<00:06:23.010> build

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
holds them all together so you can build

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.070 
holds them all together so you can build
