00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.309
 Okay then you learned the line part of 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.110
 rhythm maybe you're not 100% movie 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.300
 but from so much we play this rhythm 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.269
 You'll get it. 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.949
 But it's fundamental, I said blues. 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.130
 rhythm has no other rhythm 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.289
 There you go, there's some kind of blues. 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.390
 which is the most urban blues that later 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.490
 when I went to the square for the city 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.869
 simply state for chicago it 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.449
 gained some characteristics 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.180
 that are more similar to the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.590
 common songs here we have but WHAT 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.250
 I said blues is this rhythm one and 2a and 3a and 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.020
 4a 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.290
 I'm going to say that this rhythm at the end 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.960
 the accounts is the blues swagger 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.920
 this is the basic feature of the blues 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.840
 rock 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.020
 Now we'll talk about the chords of 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.670
 blues then a very concept 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.160
 another very important concept 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.070
 Busk is also played 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.399
 many common songs that we have there 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.559
 that are not blues that is the question 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.260
 Chords are there then, the people. 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.340
 recommends that you seek a formula of 12 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.830
 then this formula is 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.900
 now I'm in the big one, so I'm going 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.479
 show this formula the first then 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.860
 Look, there's 12 bars, okay, that's it. 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.840
 Blues rhythm and we'll stay 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.549
 playing it there after the end 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.090
 people start back we play this 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.610
 there 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.740
 How many times do we want to go? 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.689
 first common feature of the blues 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.579
 It gets a more search sound and I get 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.360
 all chords and puts a seven 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.070
 ways 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.900
 already the theory of this we will come more 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.329
 forward does not have much theory also 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.280
 're enriches the sound so if you in 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.079
 instead of doing it there for example home is 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.860
 m what are the three chords he has 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.950
 it is 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.479
 you will do there with 7 bad faith with 71 m 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.009
 with the seventh can cause cuts with a 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.899
 simple with 71 then we'll go 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.770
 study the chords with seven 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.750
 but this is the basis of the buzu ok now I see 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.659
 the following I'm putting here to 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.969
 make it easier to view, I 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.829
 chords that repeat by this symbol of 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.530
 repetition you are seeing on the screen 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.930
 Yes, that's when you have this symbol 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.819
 means I'm copying the colon 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.909
 previous step already so for me it will not 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.549
 be waiting there 74 times I 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:22.290
 I'll write that little sign, he 'll go. 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.819
 easy to view 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.010
 Then you will get used to this. 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.200
 view, then this is 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.139
 or 12-bar blues 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.090
 Let's play it first, then I will. 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.769
 is even being circulated there to 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.510
 You're understanding me and I'm doing the 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:43.530
 chords from there on the 27th at the right pace 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:48.599
 simple it is then each count up to 4 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.579
 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 are each count up to 4 in 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.950
 one compass then each compass it is 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:56.099
 marked with the ones with the risquinhos nÃ© 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.980
 so it's for example we 'll play 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.870
 now four kompasu chord from there with 76 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.280
 Long though I'll start there I'll go 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.810
 ringing if you can even hear you do not need 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.319
 to play along with what 1234 the first 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.319
 compass 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.500
 ae 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.980
 the third 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:24.160
 the room passes now the group is a blind 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.129
 with 13 goals 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.510
 7 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.520
 now bishop seventh a compass 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.840
 I trained with Sergio 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.500
 after starting back I can is 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.040
 continue or I can finish here 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.450
 also 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.209
 Okay so it is this was the bulls of 12 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.319
 bars okay we did in tondela 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.760
 bigger 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.599
 so I see that it gives a lot to 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.909
 rock blues is characteristic is then 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.370
 I'm going I'm going to play it one more time now 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:18.070
 It's okay, and I want you to play along. 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.769
 with me, if I'm going to try to play slowly 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.300
 If you got lost back the video and then 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.770
 play with me 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.449
 It is necessary that you have 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.030
 got to touch that base for us 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.650
 go ahead then will do it 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.600
 in several other tones I'll give you the 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.370
 way for him to know how to do 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:38.199
 this in any tone without having to look 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:42.660
 the cipher ok then let's play there ok 1 and 2 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.660
 and 3 and 4 trade 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.940
 OK 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.980
 I played once, I want you to play 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.400
 along with me there did not get back and 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.470
 It will leave you ready until it is played to you. 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.110
 able to stop playing the same 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.880
 with me and we can go forward 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.530
 You're not going forward, you can not. 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.890
 take this base with me and that I am 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.890
 here ok
