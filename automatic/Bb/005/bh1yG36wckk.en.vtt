people depending on their call even and

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.319 
people depending on their call even and
how<00:00:35.440> that<00:00:35.590> breaks<00:00:35.770> down<00:00:35.890> it<00:00:36.160> it<00:00:36.310> tends<00:00:36.940> to<00:00:37.150> be<00:00:37.300> a

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
how that breaks down it it tends to be a

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.690 
how that breaks down it it tends to be a
little<00:00:37.570> more<00:00:37.660> dominant<00:00:38.170> in<00:00:38.350> certain<00:00:39.220> ways<00:00:39.399> to

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
little more dominant in certain ways to

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.510 
little more dominant in certain ways to
different<00:00:39.970> people<00:00:40.360> but<00:00:40.800> like<00:00:41.800> you<00:00:42.010> said<00:00:42.250> yeah

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
different people but like you said yeah

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.030 
different people but like you said yeah
I<00:00:42.550> mean<00:00:42.790> the<00:00:43.600> audible<00:00:44.020> voice<00:00:44.170> of<00:00:44.380> God<00:00:44.440> we<00:00:44.860> know

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
I mean the audible voice of God we know

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.770 
I mean the audible voice of God we know
it's<00:00:45.220> biblical<00:00:45.790> and<00:00:45.940> it's<00:00:46.030> for<00:00:46.240> today<00:00:46.540> and

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
it's biblical and it's for today and

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.180 
it's biblical and it's for today and
it's<00:00:46.870> always<00:00:47.140> been<00:00:47.380> but<00:00:48.310> it's<00:00:48.670> a<00:00:48.850> rarity<00:00:50.160> but<00:00:51.160> I

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
it's always been but it's a rarity but I

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.530 
it's always been but it's a rarity but I
would<00:00:51.400> say<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:51.850> voice<00:00:52.000> of<00:00:52.150> God<00:00:52.300> looks<00:00:52.480> like

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540

asked him you know we talked about

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.470 
asked him you know we talked about
stillness<00:04:14.620> we<00:04:14.920> talked<00:04:15.100> about<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.910> secret

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
stillness we talked about the secret

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.960 
stillness we talked about the secret
place<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:16.870> so<00:04:17.019> on<00:04:17.049> is<00:04:18.040> it<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:18.489> God<00:04:18.700> is

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
place and so on is it that God is

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.880 
place and so on is it that God is
waiting<00:04:19.570> for<00:04:19.900> us<00:04:19.989> to<00:04:20.109> get<00:04:20.200> still<00:04:20.470> and<00:04:20.739> then

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
waiting for us to get still and then

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.740 
waiting for us to get still and then
when<00:04:21.370> he<00:04:21.459> sees<00:04:21.700> like<00:04:21.730> okay<00:04:22.210> now<00:04:22.360> he's<00:04:22.540> still

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
when he sees like okay now he's still

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.480 
when he sees like okay now he's still
then<00:04:22.930> he<00:04:22.990> takes<00:04:23.110> initiative<00:04:23.440> where's<00:04:24.310> God

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
then he takes initiative where's God

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.400 
then he takes initiative where's God
always<00:04:24.730> speaking<00:04:25.419> and<00:04:25.630> it's<00:04:25.870> just<00:04:26.020> that<00:04:26.169> we

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
always speaking and it's just that we

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.070 
always speaking and it's just that we
need<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.740> get<00:04:26.890> on<00:04:27.040> his<00:04:27.220> frequency<00:04:27.640> I<00:04:28.080> totally

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
need to get on his frequency I totally

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.180 
need to get on his frequency I totally
believe<00:04:29.320> in<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.500> ladder<00:04:29.680> you<00:04:29.919> know<00:04:29.950> I<00:04:30.070> think

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
believe in the ladder you know I think

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.180 
believe in the ladder you know I think
you'd<00:04:30.760> probably<00:04:30.910> say<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.300> same<00:04:31.330> but<00:04:31.919> to<00:04:32.919> me

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
you'd probably say the same but to me

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.540 
you'd probably say the same but to me

he's so just loving number one
revelatory<00:04:36.360> number<00:04:36.720> two<00:04:36.840> he's<00:04:36.960> just<00:04:37.140> full<00:04:37.470> of

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
revelatory number two he's just full of

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.500 
revelatory number two he's just full of
just<00:04:37.950> vast<00:04:38.280> communication<00:04:38.970> always<00:04:39.180> speaking

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
just vast communication always speaking

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.870

to his people through so many various

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.510 
to his people through so many various
means<00:04:42.180> it's<00:04:42.720> just<00:04:42.810> often<00:04:43.500> we<00:04:43.860> don't<00:04:44.160> have<00:04:44.400> the
