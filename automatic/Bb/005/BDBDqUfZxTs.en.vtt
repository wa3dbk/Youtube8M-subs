chicken just let it sear we're going to
flip<00:04:38.010> it<00:04:38.159> over<00:04:38.450> so<00:04:39.450> it's<00:04:39.539> been<00:04:39.690> three<00:04:39.840> or<00:04:39.990> four

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
flip it over so it's been three or four

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.170 
flip it over so it's been three or four
minutes<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.530> you<00:04:40.620> can<00:04:40.770> see<00:04:40.979> around<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.580> edges

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
minutes and you can see around the edges

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.850 
minutes and you can see around the edges

of the chicken hands starting to get
dark<00:04:44.159> like<00:04:44.370> that<00:04:44.400> that<00:04:45.360> is<00:04:45.659> the<00:04:45.960> sugars

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
dark like that that is the sugars

behind the chicken itself is not burning
again<00:04:52.409> that's<00:04:52.710> where<00:04:52.919> I<00:04:53.220> say<00:04:54.150> keep<00:04:54.419> it<00:04:54.570> a

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
again that's where I say keep it a

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.270 
again that's where I say keep it a
little<00:04:54.870> bit<00:04:55.020> below<00:04:55.169> kind<00:04:55.800> of<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:55.919> highest

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
little bit below kind of the highest

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.250 
little bit below kind of the highest
heat<00:04:56.490> possible<00:04:57.060> we're<00:04:57.750> going<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:57.960> flip<00:04:58.140> it

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
heat possible we're going to flip it

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.500 
heat possible we're going to flip it
over<00:04:58.520> now<00:04:59.520> we<00:04:59.580> got<00:04:59.760> to<00:04:59.849> go<00:04:59.940> clean<00:05:00.150> our<00:05:00.270> tongs
