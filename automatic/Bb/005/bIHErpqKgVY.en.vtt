00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.789 
different tone holes that open up create
a<00:01:44.100> rim<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.450> pad<00:01:45.659> comes<00:01:45.990> down<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.619> has

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
a rim and the pad comes down and it has

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.830 
a rim and the pad comes down and it has
a<00:01:46.829> rim<00:01:47.130> inside<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.270> actually<00:01:48.420> goes

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
a rim inside of it that actually goes

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.560 
a rim inside of it that actually goes
like<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:50.280> seats<00:01:50.700> right<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.329> rim

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
like this and it seats right on that rim

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.319 
like this and it seats right on that rim
now<00:01:52.259> if<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.590> pad<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:53.130> off<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:53.880> isn't

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
now if the pad is off and that isn't

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.149 
now if the pad is off and that isn't
lining<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:54.930> that's<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.380> create<00:01:55.530> leakage

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
lining up that's going to create leakage

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.160 
lining up that's going to create leakage
which<00:01:56.520> means<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.909> won't<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.180> able<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.450> play<00:01:58.049> it

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
which means you won't be able to play it

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.959 
which means you won't be able to play it
very<00:01:58.200> well<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.710> one<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.520> things<00:01:59.729> I'll<00:01:59.880> be

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
very well so one of the things I'll be

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.370 
very well so one of the things I'll be
checking<00:02:00.180> for<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.659> making<00:02:00.930> sure<00:02:01.049> all<00:02:01.229> those

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
checking for is making sure all those

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.789 
checking for is making sure all those
pads<00:02:01.680> are<00:02:01.950> seating<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.430> those<00:02:02.610> tone<00:02:02.850> holes<00:02:03.149> and

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
pads are seating on those tone holes and

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.200 
pads are seating on those tone holes and
also<00:02:04.799> through<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> process<00:02:05.579> as<00:02:05.850> you're<00:02:06.000> going

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
also through the process as you're going

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.270 
also through the process as you're going
through<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.659> can<00:02:06.810> check<00:02:07.110> when<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.920> push<00:02:08.160> a

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
through it you can check when I push a

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.830 
through it you can check when I push a
key<00:02:08.429> down<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.970> see<00:02:09.119> what<00:02:09.270> happens<00:02:09.629> where

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
key down I can see what happens where

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.540 
key down I can see what happens where
it's<00:02:09.959> up<00:02:10.080> here<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.770> now<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.009> can<00:02:11.220> start<00:02:11.310> to

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
it's up here so now I can start to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.490 
it's up here so now I can start to
control<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:13.020> getting<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.470> know

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
control this this is getting to know

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.940 
control this this is getting to know
your

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
your

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.610 
your
every<00:02:14.790> hinge<00:02:15.090> it's<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.599> good<00:02:15.780> thing<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.110> kind<00:02:16.560> of

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
every hinge it's a good thing to kind of

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.040 
every hinge it's a good thing to kind of
know<00:02:16.770> what<00:02:17.129> part<00:02:17.489> connects<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.120> what<00:02:18.300> part<00:02:18.569> and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
know what part connects to what part and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.780 
know what part connects to what part and
what<00:02:19.260> key<00:02:19.440> pushes<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.069> can't<00:02:20.340> tell<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.670> how

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
what key pushes it I can't tell you how

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.729 
what key pushes it I can't tell you how
many<00:02:20.849> sacks<00:02:21.269> will<00:02:21.450> players<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.840> know<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.620> have

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
many sacks will players I know that have

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.070 
many sacks will players I know that have
never<00:02:23.010> sat<00:02:23.370> down<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.150> looked<00:02:24.780> at<00:02:24.989> the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
never sat down and looked at the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.559 
never sat down and looked at the
mechanics<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.860> basic<00:02:26.550> joints<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.180> how<00:02:27.300> keys

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
mechanics of basic joints of how keys

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.900 
mechanics of basic joints of how keys
work<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.680> many<00:02:28.860> repairs<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.519> can<00:02:29.640> fix

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
work so many repairs you can fix

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.640 
work so many repairs you can fix
yourself<00:02:30.030> just<00:02:30.690> by<00:02:30.870> knowing<00:02:31.230> about<00:02:31.349> your

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
yourself just by knowing about your

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.040
