 to go but all of a sudden so thanks to 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.850
 Richard with ten numbers at the beginning I 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.149

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.180
 we learned from two pretty green to 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.100
 the mistake so we handed double-sided 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.020
 underneath because there was the little 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.900
 support there which were barred so 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:25.330

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.570
 in my buddy we assemble them as 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.980
