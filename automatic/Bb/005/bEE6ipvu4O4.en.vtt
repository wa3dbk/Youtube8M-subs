this is just how I style my lace shorts
I<00:00:47.370> recently<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:48.059> purchased<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.660> new<00:00:48.899> pair

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
I recently just purchased this new pair

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.990 
I recently just purchased this new pair
of<00:00:49.289> lace<00:00:49.500> shorts<00:00:49.829> at<00:00:49.950> TJ<00:00:50.309> maxx<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.789> think

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
of lace shorts at TJ maxx and I think

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.819 
of lace shorts at TJ maxx and I think
they<00:00:51.090> were<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.329> nineteen<00:00:51.899> dollars<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.469> they

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
they were like nineteen dollars and they

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.250 
they were like nineteen dollars and they
were<00:00:52.890> originally<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:53.579> 35<00:00:54.180> or<00:00:54.449> 40<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.050> got

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
were originally like 35 or 40 so I got

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.840 
were originally like 35 or 40 so I got
an<00:00:55.350> amazing<00:00:55.620> deal<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.070> them<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.550> that's<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
an amazing deal on them and that's the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.369 
an amazing deal on them and that's the
reason<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.300> normally<00:00:57.390> never<00:00:57.809> bought<00:00:58.170> lace

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
reason that I normally never bought lace

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.990 
reason that I normally never bought lace
shorts<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.920> because<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> lot<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.670> them<00:00:59.850> were

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
shorts is because a lot of them were

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.639 
shorts is because a lot of them were
like<00:01:00.030> super<00:01:00.420> expensive<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.260> when<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.410> found

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
like super expensive so when I found

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.470 
like super expensive so when I found
these<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:01.949> was<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.579> excited<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:03.359> you

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
these I was like so excited and if you

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.939

were thinking about buying a pair then

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.640 
were thinking about buying a pair then
