so<00:00:05.009> this<00:00:05.250> is<00:00:05.400> my<00:00:05.549> rocket<00:00:06.060> stove<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:07.460> did<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.490> lot

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
so this is my rocket stove I did a lot

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.020 
so this is my rocket stove I did a lot
of<00:00:08.780> rocket<00:00:09.780> stove<00:00:10.019> R&amp;D<00:00:10.610> quite<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.639> long<00:00:11.820> time

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
of rocket stove R&amp;D quite a long time

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.709 
of rocket stove R&amp;D quite a long time
ago<00:00:12.469> at<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.650> point<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.309> this<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.330> where<00:00:15.690> I

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
ago at this point and this is where I

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.980 
ago at this point and this is where I
stopped<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.670> was<00:00:17.820> only<00:00:17.970> because<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.690> time

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
stopped and it was only because of time

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.050 
stopped and it was only because of time
constraints<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.859> just<00:00:20.430> pulled<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:20.760> out<00:00:20.939> of

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
constraints I just pulled this out of

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.400 
constraints I just pulled this out of
the<00:00:21.119> junk<00:00:21.359> pile<00:00:21.570> I've<00:00:21.810> been<00:00:21.930> hoping<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.230> get

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the junk pile I've been hoping to get

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.609 
the junk pile I've been hoping to get
back<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:23.449> but<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.660> think<00:00:25.080> I'm<00:00:25.260> gonna<00:00:25.439> go

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
back to it but I think I'm gonna go

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.580 
back to it but I think I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:27.180> explain<00:00:27.630> what<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.320> how

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
ahead and just explain what this is how

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.769 
ahead and just explain what this is how
it<00:00:28.740> works<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.310> turn<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.029> loose<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.599> you

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
it works and turn it loose on you you

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.069 
it works and turn it loose on you you
tube<00:00:30.960> guys<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.619> maybe<00:00:31.920> somebody<00:00:32.399> else<00:00:32.430> can

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
tube guys and maybe somebody else can

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.880 
tube guys and maybe somebody else can
you<00:00:34.079> know<00:00:34.200> run<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> ball<00:00:36.559> my<00:00:37.559> rocket

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
you know run with the ball my rocket

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.350 
you know run with the ball my rocket
stove<00:00:38.100> was<00:00:38.280> made<00:00:38.460> out<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:39.079> schedule<00:00:40.079> 80<00:00:40.230> pipe

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
stove was made out of schedule 80 pipe

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.910 
stove was made out of schedule 80 pipe
quarter-inch<00:00:42.360> wall<00:00:42.600> tubing<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.739> that

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
quarter-inch wall tubing and in that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.920 
quarter-inch wall tubing and in that
piece<00:00:44.129> there<00:00:44.370> should<00:00:44.670> schedule<00:00:44.910> 40<00:00:45.360> pipe<00:00:45.539> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
piece there should schedule 40 pipe to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.709 
piece there should schedule 40 pipe to
build<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.530> chamber<00:00:46.910> for<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> that's<00:00:48.600> where

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
build that chamber for the that's where

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.630 
build that chamber for the that's where
they<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.899> fire<00:00:49.200> actually<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
they have fire actually is the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.139 
they have fire actually is the
dimensions<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.660> are<00:00:52.460> per<00:00:53.460> winning<00:00:54.030> our

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
dimensions on this are per winning our

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.660 
dimensions on this are per winning our
skis<00:00:54.420> design<00:00:54.840> those<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.770> hard<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.039> find<00:00:56.250> but

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
skis design those are hard to find but

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.340 
skis design those are hard to find but
there<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.329> crude<00:00:57.899> drawing<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.730> graph<00:01:00.000> paper

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
there is a crude drawing on graph paper

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.229 
there is a crude drawing on graph paper
that<00:01:01.350> floats<00:01:01.530> around<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.949> internet<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.430> this

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
that floats around the internet and this

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.190 
that floats around the internet and this
stove<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.739> based<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.880> those<00:01:06.299> dimensions<00:01:06.930> and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
stove is based on those dimensions and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.500 
stove is based on those dimensions and
it<00:01:07.439> works<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> champ<00:01:10.670> having<00:01:11.670> access<00:01:12.330> to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
it works like a champ having access to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.140 
it works like a champ having access to
all<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:13.159> low<00:01:14.159> fuel<00:01:14.460> heat<00:01:14.729> through<00:01:15.030> this

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
all that low fuel heat through this

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.130 
all that low fuel heat through this
chamber<00:01:15.720> made<00:01:16.619> me<00:01:16.799> think<00:01:17.040> about<00:01:18.140> gasifying

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
chamber made me think about gasifying

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.030 
chamber made me think about gasifying
wood<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:19.650> fuel<00:01:19.890> which<00:01:21.409> you<00:01:22.409> know<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.740> also<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
wood for fuel which you know is also a

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.399 
wood for fuel which you know is also a
real<00:01:23.280> popular<00:01:23.520> idea<00:01:24.119> right<00:01:24.330> now<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:25.049> problem

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
real popular idea right now the problem

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.010 
real popular idea right now the problem
with<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:27.030> fuel<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.630> typically

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
with that is that that fuel is typically

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.530 
with that is that that fuel is typically
dirty<00:01:29.930> polarizing<00:01:30.930> wood<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> hydrogen

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
dirty polarizing wood and the hydrogen

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.350 
dirty polarizing wood and the hydrogen
is<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.600> dirty<00:01:33.930> process<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:35.280> tried<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> combat

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
is a dirty process I tried to combat

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.440 
is a dirty process I tried to combat
this<00:01:36.570> with<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.619> design<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:39.119> see<00:01:39.299> this

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
this with this design you can see this

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.539 
this with this design you can see this
is<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.900> typical<00:01:40.110> rocket<00:01:40.650> stove<00:01:40.920> as<00:01:41.189> far<00:01:41.400> as

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
is just a typical rocket stove as far as

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.819 
is just a typical rocket stove as far as
that<00:01:41.729> goes<00:01:41.790> I've<00:01:42.600> got<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.840> steel<00:01:43.110> tank<00:01:43.439> mounted

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
that goes I've got a steel tank mounted

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.060 
that goes I've got a steel tank mounted
on<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.100> made<00:01:44.670> from<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.350> air<00:01:46.350> compressor<00:01:46.500> tank

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
on it made from a air compressor tank

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.969 
on it made from a air compressor tank
and<00:01:47.420> if<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.840> filled<00:01:49.110> with<00:01:49.970> old<00:01:51.619> inch<00:01:52.619> inch

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and if this is filled with old inch inch

inch or so lengths they tumble through

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.399 
inch or so lengths they tumble through
this<00:01:59.759> okay<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.390> down<00:02:01.200> into<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:02.329> burn<00:02:03.329> chamber

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
this okay and down into the burn chamber

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.600 
this okay and down into the burn chamber
which<00:02:04.409> isn't<00:02:04.740> finished<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.219> don't<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.549> a

which isn't finished I don't have a

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.819 
which isn't finished I don't have a
riding<00:02:05.850> hole<00:02:06.210> with<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> air<00:02:07.079> adjustment<00:02:07.439> in

it and this pipes not been sealed to the
to<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.630> chamber<00:02:12.990> you<00:02:13.020> can<00:02:13.080> see<00:02:13.290> it's<00:02:13.410> still

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
to the chamber you can see it's still

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.110 
to the chamber you can see it's still
full<00:02:13.710> of<00:02:13.830> wood<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.220> burned<00:02:14.490> this<00:02:14.700> thing<00:02:14.910> it's

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
full of wood I burned this thing it's

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.050 
full of wood I burned this thing it's
been<00:02:15.380> 5<00:02:16.380> years<00:02:16.650> ago<00:02:16.800> which<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.700> why<00:02:17.850> I'm<00:02:17.940> gonna

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
been 5 years ago which is why I'm gonna

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.030 
been 5 years ago which is why I'm gonna
go<00:02:18.210> ahead<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.510> turn<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:18.780> loose<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.800> next

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
go ahead and turn this loose so the next

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.510 
go ahead and turn this loose so the next
guy<00:02:20.160> can<00:02:20.370> run<00:02:20.520> with<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.840> but<00:02:22.010> just<00:02:23.010> looking<00:02:23.310> at

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
guy can run with it but just looking at

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.380 
guy can run with it but just looking at
this

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
this

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.700 
this
anyone<00:02:25.050> that's<00:02:25.760> study<00:02:26.760> pyrolysis<00:02:28.220> knows<00:02:29.220> that

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
anyone that's study pyrolysis knows that

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.170 
anyone that's study pyrolysis knows that
what's<00:02:31.710> going<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.950> happen<00:02:32.370> here<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.790> you're

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
what's going to happen here is you're

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.980 
what's going to happen here is you're
going<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.420> have<00:02:33.600> your<00:02:35.090> your<00:02:36.090> fire<00:02:36.360> down<00:02:36.660> here

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
going to have your your fire down here

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.290 
going to have your your fire down here
your<00:02:37.410> wood<00:02:37.620> through<00:02:37.890> here<00:02:38.250> you're<00:02:39.120> going<00:02:39.240> to

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
your wood through here you're going to

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.000 
your wood through here you're going to
have<00:02:39.420> wood<00:02:39.660> gas<00:02:39.870> buildup<00:02:40.320> in<00:02:40.500> here<00:02:40.710> and<00:02:40.860> that's

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
have wood gas buildup in here and that's

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.520 
have wood gas buildup in here and that's
exactly<00:02:41.340> what<00:02:41.760> does<00:02:41.970> happen<00:02:42.480> I've<00:02:43.050> got<00:02:43.350> this

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
exactly what does happen I've got this

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.510 
exactly what does happen I've got this
tube<00:02:43.830> here<00:02:44.220> on<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.540> lid<00:02:46.040> I've<00:02:47.040> got<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.250> tube

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
tube here on the lid I've got a tube

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.050 
tube here on the lid I've got a tube
here<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:48.360> draw<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:48.840> fuel<00:02:49.140> out<00:02:49.410> in<00:02:50.400> an

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
here to draw that fuel out in an

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.030 
here to draw that fuel out in an
oxygen-free<00:02:51.570> environment<00:02:52.440> passing<00:02:52.890> it

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
oxygen-free environment passing it

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.950 
oxygen-free environment passing it
through<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.580> hottest<00:02:54.210> part<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.600> stove

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
through the hottest part of the stove

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.540 
through the hottest part of the stove
which<00:02:55.740> should<00:02:56.040> be<00:02:56.190> reaching<00:02:56.640> tar<00:02:57.450> cracking

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
which should be reaching tar cracking

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.420 
which should be reaching tar cracking
temperatures<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:01.830> it<00:03:01.950> would<00:03:02.070> have<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.340> be

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
temperatures and it would have to be

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.230 
temperatures and it would have to be
drawn<00:03:02.730> through<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.240> won't<00:03:03.390> flow<00:03:03.660> naturally

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
drawn through it won't flow naturally

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.820 
drawn through it won't flow naturally
but<00:03:06.240> like<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.540> say<00:03:06.720> this<00:03:06.870> is<00:03:06.930> just<00:03:07.230> as<00:03:07.380> far<00:03:07.590> as<00:03:07.710> I

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
but like I say this is just as far as I

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.380 
but like I say this is just as far as I
got<00:03:08.040> with<00:03:08.190> this<00:03:08.370> I've<00:03:08.580> not<00:03:08.790> ran<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.180> fuel

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
got with this I've not ran the fuel

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.360 
got with this I've not ran the fuel
through<00:03:09.540> an<00:03:09.690> engine<00:03:09.990> to<00:03:10.140> see<00:03:10.350> what<00:03:11.070> it<00:03:11.190> does

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
through an engine to see what it does

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.690 
through an engine to see what it does
and<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:12.330> seriously<00:03:12.660> doubt<00:03:13.020> that<00:03:13.080> this<00:03:13.700> steel

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
and I seriously doubt that this steel

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.760 
and I seriously doubt that this steel
tube<00:03:15.000> is<00:03:15.600> going<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.900> be<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.200> thing<00:03:16.440> but<00:03:16.620> it's

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
tube is going to be the thing but it's

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.250 
tube is going to be the thing but it's
good<00:03:16.890> enough<00:03:16.920> for<00:03:17.160> testing<00:03:17.730> but<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.570> ceramic

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
good enough for testing but a ceramic

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.930 
good enough for testing but a ceramic
tube<00:03:19.470> run<00:03:19.770> through<00:03:20.010> here<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.370> run<00:03:20.520> that<00:03:20.670> fuel

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
tube run through here to run that fuel

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.800 
tube run through here to run that fuel
through<00:03:21.209> would<00:03:21.870> probably<00:03:22.440> easily<00:03:23.690> take<00:03:24.690> the

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
through would probably easily take the

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.160 
through would probably easily take the
temperature<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.410> crack<00:03:25.620> tar<00:03:26.959> now<00:03:27.959> it<00:03:28.050> might

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
temperature to crack tar now it might

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.980 
temperature to crack tar now it might
require<00:03:28.350> some<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.130> typical<00:03:30.230> coolers<00:03:31.230> and

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
require some of the typical coolers and

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.840 
require some of the typical coolers and
other<00:03:33.990> devices<00:03:34.380> that<00:03:34.770> you<00:03:34.860> see<00:03:35.070> on<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.490> end<00:03:35.640> of

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
other devices that you see on the end of

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.980 
other devices that you see on the end of
a<00:03:36.500> gasifier<00:03:37.500> but<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.220> won't<00:03:38.370> require<00:03:38.700> a

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
a gasifier but it won't require a

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.630 
a gasifier but it won't require a
cyclone<00:03:39.990> because<00:03:40.440> there's<00:03:41.190> not<00:03:41.340> going<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.520> be

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
cyclone because there's not going to be

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.570 
cyclone because there's not going to be
any<00:03:41.760> ash<00:03:42.030> chunks<00:03:42.690> or<00:03:43.190> charcoal<00:03:44.190> or<00:03:44.400> anything

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
any ash chunks or charcoal or anything

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.430 
any ash chunks or charcoal or anything
like<00:03:44.820> that

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
like that

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.660 
like that
through<00:03:46.440> this<00:03:46.560> design<00:03:47.600> anyway<00:03:49.459> this<00:03:50.459> is<00:03:50.640> a

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
through this design anyway this is a

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.500 
through this design anyway this is a
hell<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.209> stove<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:52.400> I<00:03:53.400> don't<00:03:54.120> know<00:03:54.300> that

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
hell of a stove and I don't know that

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.150 
hell of a stove and I don't know that
this<00:03:54.630> works<00:03:54.959> but<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:55.560> do<00:03:55.650> know<00:03:55.890> that<00:03:56.040> it

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
this works but I do know that it

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.910 
this works but I do know that it
produces<00:03:56.610> gas<00:03:56.880> I<00:03:57.240> just<00:03:57.690> don't<00:03:57.870> know<00:03:58.050> if<00:03:58.320> it

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
produces gas I just don't know if it

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.730 
produces gas I just don't know if it
cracks<00:03:59.160> tar<00:03:59.750> so<00:04:00.750> if<00:04:00.870> anybody<00:04:01.200> out<00:04:01.260> there<00:04:01.380> wants

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
cracks tar so if anybody out there wants

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.760 
cracks tar so if anybody out there wants
to<00:04:02.600> pick<00:04:03.600> up<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.900> ball<00:04:04.310> run<00:04:05.310> with<00:04:05.490> it<00:04:05.580> guys
