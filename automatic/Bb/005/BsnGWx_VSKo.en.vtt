00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:12.139
 hi i am andre and this is the kobo glo 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:16.180
 e-reader the kobo glo comes with 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.180
 the device itself and a micro USB cable 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.070
 we see you the kobo glo of 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.710
 closer to the front 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.279
 6-inch king screen with an HD resolution 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.140
 of 1024 by 768 pixels 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.599
 well at the bottom we actually find it 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.430
 the reset button that you still have 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.050
 micro USB connection to the 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.640
 on the right side we don't like the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.620
 find the on and off button and top 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.630
 the light button and on the left 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.640
 find a micro sd here on the side 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.860
 card slot at the back we find 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.060
 a kind of soft rubber finish 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.060
 which makes it comfortable to hold 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.630
 Here we see the kobo glo used him 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.940
 just turned on this is the home screen 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.860
 we now see the last opened books and 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.180
 drawings possibly well we can 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.980
 simply read through a book 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.780
 just have to click on it 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.250
 the book started up he continues immediately 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.170
 where you left off 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.729
 He can now just swipe to get to the 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.950
 next page or a page 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.600
 You can also go back left or right 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.740
 click off the screen 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.119
 for example, you now want a menu again 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.619
 You really have to put it in it 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.299
 in the middle of the screen then click on the 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.289
 minutes then you can 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.369
 for example, back to home 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.569
 you can possibly read something 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.249
 adjust settings such as 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:23.179
 for example the font size 

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:24.649
 here in the bottom right we back what we 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.049
 being able to do is also interesting we can 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.450
 also select a piece of text 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.670
 well just by putting our finger on it longer 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.259
 piece of text and we see that now 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.399
 passenger selected is what 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.659
 interesting has a dictionary 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.679
 is built in if you are now on dictionary 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.240
 then he immediately goes the definition 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.100
 giving that word 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.479
 very interesting example one 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.920
 are learning a new language 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.630
 read simple books 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.130
 then you can yes look up the definition 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.600
 of every word in that language so that you 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.009
 learn language faster 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.840
 you can also use a translation function 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.119
 You can also use everything on Facebook 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.259
 share and possibly you can do everything 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.340
 to mark 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.469
 then we go back to it again 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.810
 do not click the main menu in the middle and 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.099
 press the cottage then find here 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.659
 so all books you can also here 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.700
 discover through the built-in wi-fi 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.590
 feature can discover is all book 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.670
 in the kobo store you can do that too 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.620
 buy directly from here because 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.750
 yes your kobell is linked with your pc and 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.250
 with the kobo account 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.569
 possibly you can still top right here 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.010
 find further settings 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.180
 such as p see back when 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.160
 which was last synchronized 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.690
 if you go the settings then 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.670
 find all the extensive settings 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.040
 such as the read settings 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.480
 but also for the wi-fi settings and 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.489
 of course also the lighting 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.050
 sleep mode and in energy settings 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.120
 can set when in sleep mode 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.989
 have to go 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.000
 Well we actually all here 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.560
 institutions seen another interesting 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.150
 option with the settings are the extra 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.489
 applications are included which 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.870
 we find here at the very bottom well there 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.519
 find for example a games 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.510
 included but also for example one 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.430
 Web browser 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.650
 that doesn't work it super interesting it 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.090
 is fairly slow and it is black and white 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.709
 for example, also a bad sketch pad 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.750
 so you can for example just as quickly 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.060
 note but also for this 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.470
 the iride doesn't actually mean we're going 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.540
 now look at the light function of the 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.690
 kobo glo as press the light button 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.860
 then the light comes on automatically and 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.610
 we see that it can be very nice 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.290
 read at night 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.000
 we'll find another one at the bottom left 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.010
 brightness option so can it too 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.910
 light has help even less clear 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.739
 set if it gets too much 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.420
 files such as dove and dove x wife 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.130
 are not read on the glow and 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.840
 in addition, the standby time is compared 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.560
 for example the sony reader a piece 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.430
 lower 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.329
 but that is of course due to the 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.329
 built-in lighting 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.410
 the kobo glo is very easy to use 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.390
 The HD 6 inch pink screen is very beautiful 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.980
 to look at and very sharp and tot 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.420
 Finally, the built-in lighting has something 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.420
 very pleasant during the evening hours 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.540
 the kobo glo is a reader with very 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.859
 sharp image and built-in lighting 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.109
 making you both during the day and in the evening 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.510
