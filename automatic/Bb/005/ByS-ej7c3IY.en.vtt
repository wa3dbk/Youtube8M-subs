I'm<00:01:59.909> missing<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.810> group<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.200> my<00:02:01.619> diet<00:02:01.860> and

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
I'm missing this group in my diet and

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.679 
I'm missing this group in my diet and
maybe<00:02:02.610> that's<00:02:02.820> why<00:02:03.000> I'm<00:02:03.149> getting<00:02:03.420> all<00:02:03.570> these

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
maybe that's why I'm getting all these

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.289 
maybe that's why I'm getting all these
weird<00:02:03.750> cramps<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.590> injuries<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.340> hospital

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
weird cramps and injuries and hospital

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.500 
weird cramps and injuries and hospital
visits<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:07.409> can<00:02:07.649> ensure<00:02:08.520> your<00:02:09.860> at<00:02:10.860> least

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
visits you can ensure your at least

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.700 
visits you can ensure your at least
injury<00:02:12.510> free<00:02:12.780> as<00:02:12.959> long<00:02:13.170> as<00:02:13.379> you<00:02:13.500> can

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
injury free as long as you can

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.710 
injury free as long as you can
possibly<00:02:14.100> be<00:02:14.310> by<00:02:14.610> following<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.210> nutrition

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
possibly be by following this nutrition

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.740 
possibly be by following this nutrition
circle<00:02:16.250> alright<00:02:17.250> let's<00:02:17.520> get<00:02:17.700> down<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.210> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
circle alright let's get down to it the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.320 
circle alright let's get down to it the
first<00:02:18.930> one<00:02:19.170> here<00:02:19.470> carbohydrates<00:02:20.340> pasta<00:02:21.090> rice

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
first one here carbohydrates pasta rice

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.100 
first one here carbohydrates pasta rice
bread<00:02:21.810> wheat<00:02:22.100> basic<00:02:23.100> stuff<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.750> think<00:02:24.750> most

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
bread wheat basic stuff I think most

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.900 
bread wheat basic stuff I think most
people<00:02:25.260> can<00:02:25.470> handle<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.920> one<00:02:26.130> no<00:02:26.520> problem

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
people can handle this one no problem

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
people can handle this one no problem
alright<00:02:27.810> here<00:02:28.470> we<00:02:28.530> go<00:02:28.740> first<00:02:29.400> new<00:02:29.760> color<00:02:30.090> beans

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
alright here we go first new color beans

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.540 
alright here we go first new color beans
and<00:02:31.200> lentils<00:02:31.350> alright<00:02:32.100> let's<00:02:32.280> see<00:02:32.370> what<00:02:32.520> else

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
and lentils alright let's see what else

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.620 
and lentils alright let's see what else
is<00:02:32.850> green<00:02:33.150> we<00:02:33.600> have<00:02:33.750> here<00:02:33.990> fish<00:02:34.350> meat<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.010> eggs

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
is green we have here fish meat and eggs

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.650 
is green we have here fish meat and eggs
this<00:02:36.630> is<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.990> protein<00:02:37.500> groups<00:02:37.830> here<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.660> now

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
this is the protein groups here and now

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.810 
this is the protein groups here and now
why<00:02:40.500> they're<00:02:40.710> both<00:02:40.860> green<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.400> because<00:02:41.670> these

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
why they're both green is because these

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.760 
why they're both green is because these
two<00:02:41.880> can<00:02:42.360> be<00:02:42.480> swapped<00:02:42.750> out<00:02:43.020> for<00:02:43.260> each<00:02:43.350> other<00:02:43.560> so

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
two can be swapped out for each other so

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.270 
two can be swapped out for each other so
if<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.430> don't<00:02:44.670> want<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:45.050> eat<00:02:46.050> fish<00:02:46.920> for<00:02:47.130> meat

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
if you don't want to eat fish for meat

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.490 
if you don't want to eat fish for meat
or<00:02:47.310> you've<00:02:47.610> had<00:02:47.760> too<00:02:47.940> much<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:49.200> get<00:02:49.320> your

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
or you've had too much of it to get your

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.100 
or you've had too much of it to get your
protein<00:02:49.920> all<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.280> got<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.490> do<00:02:50.580> is<00:02:50.820> get<00:02:51.780> beans

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
protein all you got to do is get beans

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.170 
protein all you got to do is get beans
or<00:02:52.350> lentils<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:53.100> there's<00:02:53.310> all<00:02:53.640> types<00:02:53.970> of

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
or lentils and there's all types of

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.750 
or lentils and there's all types of
beans<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.750> it's<00:02:55.530> not<00:02:55.680> just<00:02:55.950> limited<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.460> being

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
beans and it's not just limited to being

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.940 
beans and it's not just limited to being
in<00:02:56.880> lentils<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:57.330> can<00:02:57.480> go<00:02:57.570> find<00:02:57.810> out<00:02:58.140> other

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
in lentils you can go find out other

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.460 
in lentils you can go find out other
types<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.460> vegetables<00:02:59.610> just<00:03:00.240> google<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.750> that

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
types of vegetables just google it that

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.310 
types of vegetables just google it that
also<00:03:02.220> have<00:03:02.490> very<00:03:02.970> high<00:03:03.150> protein<00:03:03.450> sources<00:03:04.140> I

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
also have very high protein sources I

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.930 
also have very high protein sources I
just<00:03:04.530> listed<00:03:04.860> these<00:03:04.980> two<00:03:05.250> because<00:03:05.670> they're

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
just listed these two because they're

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.960 
just listed these two because they're
very<00:03:06.240> easily<00:03:07.050> accessible<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.430> any<00:03:08.580> athlete

one I have it in red number four and
your<00:03:33.120> mailto<00:03:33.660> yogurt<00:03:34.050> and<00:03:34.320> your<00:03:34.410> cheese<00:03:35.330> this

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
your mailto yogurt and your cheese this

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.920 
your mailto yogurt and your cheese this
is<00:03:37.500> your<00:03:37.740> calcium<00:03:38.010> group<00:03:38.570> you<00:03:39.570> don't<00:03:39.600> actually

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
is your calcium group you don't actually

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.280 
is your calcium group you don't actually
need<00:03:40.590> any<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.160> these<00:03:41.280> milk<00:03:41.670> yogurt<00:03:42.060> or<00:03:42.210> cheese

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
need any of these milk yogurt or cheese

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.060 
need any of these milk yogurt or cheese
but<00:03:43.670> it's<00:03:44.670> very<00:03:44.850> easy<00:03:45.210> to<00:03:45.450> get<00:03:45.600> so<00:03:46.140> I<00:03:46.230> still

things are high in calcium and the thing

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.920 
things are high in calcium and the thing
I<00:04:05.340> would<00:04:05.490> say<00:04:05.610> about<00:04:05.640> this<00:04:06.030> group<00:04:06.270> it's<00:04:06.630> very

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
I would say about this group it's very

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.490 
I would say about this group it's very
dangerous<00:04:07.170> because<00:04:07.910> about<00:04:09.080> 75%<00:04:10.080> of<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.260> world
