00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.380
 frank baum 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.720
 What's up guys talking? 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.390
 welcome to another video and 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.090
 Look at clothes, do not run away. 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.660
 I got you here, and I did not count. 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.150
 You two walk without tinga nor my comrade. 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.369
 Well, folks, I bring it to you today. 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.460
 in a game play the black ops 2 playing 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.140
 map goes right ethan blessed little map 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.700
 I do not particularly like this map. 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.280
 I almost do not like any pope 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.719
 black ops 2 incredible as it seems 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.250
 this map that I just do not like for this 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.050
 detail of that little house that the galley 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.449
 usually stays up here 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.550
 so it ends up being pretty annoying but when the 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.969
 guys are on the ground, people are killing 11 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.609
 killers and the third well ends my 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.829
 Comrade disney pernÃ£o in no snapper 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:01.969
 A lot of calm in this hour now let's look 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.580
 here killing a little more and beauty in 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.770
 total tranquility that you go 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.410
 to notice that I'm using claymore 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.960
 In this gameplay 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.930
 a lot of people do not like clever no 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.329
 They like the bag of the bet, do not they? 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.340
 very appeals but I particularly do not 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.950
 I have no problem whatsoever against 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.939
 these equipment I use very well 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.399
 my favor 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.590
 the two forms the first is to 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.259
 kill the opponent and the second way is 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.509
 to try to locate me where my 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.759
 enemies are and is very easy because 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.920
 You put something on a door and you 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.380
 does anyone bust her and not 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.630
 die will trigger it on the map will 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.729
 On your screen, a 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.969
 Do you know that at that point 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.490
 someone then the clamor and the purse invests 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:52.549
 besides being very important and 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.530
 efficient in your favor at the time of killing 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.930
 an opponent you get more or 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.030
 less where it is located 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.039
 someone in the event of someone destroying it 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.810
 This is fundamental, cara. 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.909
 I am not particularly 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.979
 use of these two types of 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.080
 equipment and that you are seeing me 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.990
 I already took my side in the single strike. 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.080
 'I killed only two opponents and more beauty 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.720
 No patience, just look at that beauty in the 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.680
 But one more comrade died and then I 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.640
 to be able to free all my schools 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.530
 to orbital and 7 and our escort drone 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.150
 face and particularly the escort drone 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.189
 in this match that was very efficient 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.109
 managed to kill a lot 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:33.209
 I do not know why I could not kill 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.549
 This guy here was lucky that I was 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.680
 corby top 7 in the air and get more or 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.980
 less control here opponents to 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.900
 do not suffer damage not to die and beauty 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.480
 right man this is the important part of 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.260
 you always use the orbital vicente 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.659
 your favor 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.659
 do not you guys frantically forward 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.639
 but know how to manage knowing minimal look 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.200
 to see where the 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.810
 opponents is not that the guys gave a 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.060
 Little luck is so over the house and 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.220
 my scott drone ended up killing them there 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.519
 on top then did not give much to run away 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.530
 one more time I want to see you and 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.299
 share and share with you to 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.909
 to say a little more say so 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.109
 I noticed that I 'm going to put a clemer and stay 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.120
 connected in what I'm talking about 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.310
 You're only going to burst in a little bit. 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.450
 burst gave chance on screen come back I know 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.359
 that someone is there 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.909
 and here comes a little patience and 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.949
 some of the intelligence play is 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.019
 think that the thigh is a bit more 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.370
 intuition of what intelligence goes 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.590
 of the luck of what you really are 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.879
 wanting to do or not you will see that 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.810
 I 'm more or less connected that it has a 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.269
 face up 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.909
 I'm going up here, luckily, it does not kill me. 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.549
 and the fact that he's calm and more of a guy 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:45.030
 there we will kill him good but the orbital 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.889
 and 7 in our favor in favor of my team and 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.079
 now I'll do what I'm going to try 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.569
 a climate here I'm going to look at the guys who 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.699
 corridor and we will bill everyone here 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.560
 You'll get another comrade down here. 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:57.780
 is showing there to take a small 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.669
 Sins and that's it. 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.949
 one of the things that I'm enjoying 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.359
 Damn playing black ops two is almost 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.819
 an assault on the iphone i particularly 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.199
 I find them much more interesting. 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.209
 Let this stain win 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.560
 after the last game updates 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.799
 I think the game was more balanced 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.019
 to use this type of weapon and 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.139
 guy does not stand for is not expensive 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.780
 the planet a stab and basically the 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.610
 save mugged we're making it for myself 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.750
 very interesting and I particularly 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:30.389
 I'm loving playing with e 94 m 27 e 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.889
 now to imitate are weapons that I am 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.009
 enjoying a lot 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.509
 and it's really worth playing with them 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:38.939
 and one thing I really like 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:41.069
 to use is the port stock car because 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:42.960
 because I can pull my ds line 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:45.479
 I'm going to enter the corridors with my friend. 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.930
 pulled out but when there are three guys I 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:51.870
 I can take the 3 and end up dying and 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.029
 Then I can unlock my first 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.199
 Brutal no black options seem like it is 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:56.729
 bit right 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.620
 but due to the large amount of 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:01.560
 I've been suffering from this problem. 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.900
 I got caught in the brutal game. 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.569
 a magnificent thing almost everything 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.699
 get some and there guy and get a drink 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:11.219
 world let's say so it's very difficult 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.960
 play with the connection with this game is more 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:15.569
 I hope you liked the 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.569
 departure was a departure from almost nuclear 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:19.349
 nuclear was ugly ita ii lady 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.659
 did you like it 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.370
 leave him who liked very favorite and 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.990
 leave your comment too much 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.150
 Thank you for your company and the 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.150
 People will see each other in the next video bye
