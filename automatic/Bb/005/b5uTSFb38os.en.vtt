00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
on and then add a gel on top it's that

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.520 
on and then add a gel on top it's that
simple<00:01:33.579> and<00:01:34.420> right<00:01:34.960> I<00:01:34.990> could<00:01:35.229> do<00:01:35.289> it<00:01:35.380> in<00:01:35.469> the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
simple and right I could do it in the

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.560 
simple and right I could do it in the
reverse<00:01:35.770> whatever<00:01:36.070> your<00:01:36.310> flavor<00:01:36.520> is<00:01:36.729> then<00:01:37.539> I

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
reverse whatever your flavor is then I

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.389 
reverse whatever your flavor is then I
can<00:01:37.630> keep<00:01:37.960> stacking<00:01:38.350> these<00:01:38.710> things<00:01:38.950> on<00:01:39.130> top<00:01:39.340> of

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
can keep stacking these things on top of

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.969 
can keep stacking these things on top of
each<00:01:39.609> other<00:01:39.789> now<00:01:40.420> let's<00:01:40.719> say<00:01:41.049> I<00:01:41.079> want<00:01:41.439> to<00:01:41.500> put<00:01:41.950> a

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
each other now let's say I want to put a

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.550 
each other now let's say I want to put a
gel<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.869> grid<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:44.140> then<00:01:44.740> out<00:01:45.070> of<00:01:45.460> snoot<00:01:45.880> done<00:01:46.869> so

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
gel a grid and then out of snoot done so

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.230 
gel a grid and then out of snoot done so
now<00:01:47.710> you're<00:01:47.950> speed<00:01:48.249> light<00:01:48.429> has<00:01:48.700> been<00:01:48.729> jailed

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
now you're speed light has been jailed

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.480 
now you're speed light has been jailed

like about the snoot is well is first of
all<00:01:56.439> okay<00:01:57.189> it'll<00:01:57.700> it'll<00:01:58.030> fold<00:01:58.689> up<00:01:58.899> real<00:01:59.350> nice

and compact in your bag and then when
you<00:02:01.749> put<00:02:01.899> it<00:02:01.990> on<00:02:02.079> depending<00:02:02.560> on<00:02:02.649> how<00:02:02.799> much<00:02:02.950> you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
you put it on depending on how much you

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.730 
you put it on depending on how much you
pull<00:02:03.280> it<00:02:03.399> out<00:02:03.579> each<00:02:04.179> one<00:02:04.630> is<00:02:05.259> giving<00:02:05.619> you<00:02:05.679> a

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
pull it out each one is giving you a

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.679 
pull it out each one is giving you a
different<00:02:06.249> amount<00:02:06.490> of<00:02:06.729> light<00:02:07.060> that's<00:02:07.509> coming

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
different amount of light that's coming

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.230 
different amount of light that's coming
out<00:02:08.110> of<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:08.350> I<00:02:08.470> mean<00:02:08.650> this<00:02:09.130> is<00:02:09.430> what's<00:02:10.030> going<00:02:10.180> to

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
out of it I mean this is what's going to

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.650 
out of it I mean this is what's going to
give<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.630> control<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:12.400> your<00:02:12.640> bag<00:02:12.880> and

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
give you control in your bag and

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.170 
give you control in your bag and
so<00:02:13.750> what<00:02:14.110> we<00:02:14.260> do<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.680> we've<00:02:14.860> got<00:02:14.890> two<00:02:15.730> suits<00:02:16.060> in

snoots

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.480 
snoots
six<00:02:21.370> grids<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.870> six<00:02:23.350> gels<00:02:23.680> because<00:02:23.950> we've<00:02:24.280> got

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
six grids and six gels because we've got

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.850 
six grids and six gels because we've got
six<00:02:24.910> speed<00:02:25.510> lights<00:02:25.750> that<00:02:26.080> we<00:02:26.260> work<00:02:26.620> with

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
six speed lights that we work with

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.510 
six speed lights that we work with
typically<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:28.060> what<00:02:28.660> you're<00:02:28.780> gonna<00:02:28.840> see

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520

typically and so what you're gonna see
is<00:02:30.520> we're<00:02:30.760> gonna<00:02:30.850> talk<00:02:31.030> about<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.270> recent<00:02:31.480> photo

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
is we're gonna talk about a recent photo

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.840 
is we're gonna talk about a recent photo
shoot<00:02:32.110> that<00:02:32.380> we<00:02:32.620> did<00:02:32.830> right<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.280> when<00:02:33.760> I'm

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
shoot that we did right so when I'm

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.490 
shoot that we did right so when I'm
looking<00:02:33.970> at<00:02:34.180> stuff<00:02:34.390> like<00:02:34.570> this<00:02:34.720> it's<00:02:35.380> not

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
looking at stuff like this it's not

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.720 
looking at stuff like this it's not
enough<00:02:35.770> to<00:02:35.860> just<00:02:35.920> look<00:02:36.160> at<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.460> play<00:02:36.520> with

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
enough to just look at it and play with

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.830 
enough to just look at it and play with
it<00:02:36.760> I<00:02:36.970> want<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.210> use<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.480> in<00:02:37.600> real-world

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
it I want to use it in real-world

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.750 
it I want to use it in real-world
environments<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.770> so<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:38.920> wanted<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.400> put<00:02:39.640> this

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
environments and so I wanted to put this

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.300 
environments and so I wanted to put this
to<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.000> test<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.570> use<00:02:41.230> this<00:02:41.470> on<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.740> recent

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
to the test I use this on a recent

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.880 
to the test I use this on a recent
Hilton<00:02:42.760> Hotel<00:02:43.200> photo<00:02:44.200> shoot<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:44.620> we<00:02:44.710> had

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
Hilton Hotel photo shoot that we had

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.190 
Hilton Hotel photo shoot that we had
where<00:02:45.160> we<00:02:45.190> were<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:45.460> very<00:02:45.910> close<00:02:46.900> quarters

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
where we were in very close quarters

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.820 
where we were in very close quarters
with<00:02:47.920> very<00:02:48.280> limited<00:02:48.870> in<00:02:49.870> environment<00:02:50.740> if<00:02:50.800> you

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
with very limited in environment if you

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.560 
with very limited in environment if you
will<00:02:50.980> so<00:02:51.100> we<00:02:51.190> couldn't<00:02:51.610> let<00:02:51.790> light<00:02:52.030> spill<00:02:52.420> all

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
will so we couldn't let light spill all

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.760 
will so we couldn't let light spill all
over<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.870> place<00:02:53.020> we<00:02:53.200> couldn't<00:02:53.470> use<00:02:53.560> our

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
over the place we couldn't use our

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.560 
over the place we couldn't use our
studio<00:02:54.430> strobes<00:02:54.820> things<00:02:55.210> that<00:02:55.360> we<00:02:55.450> would

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
studio strobes things that we would

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.810 
studio strobes things that we would
normally<00:02:55.960> use<00:02:55.990> we<00:02:56.560> had<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.680> very<00:02:57.010> limited<00:02:57.340> area

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
normally use we had a very limited area

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.430 
normally use we had a very limited area
that<00:02:58.090> we<00:02:58.180> can<00:02:58.330> work<00:02:58.480> in<00:02:58.600> so<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:58.780> had<00:02:58.990> to<00:02:59.140> control

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
that we can work in so I had to control

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.320 
that we can work in so I had to control
the<00:02:59.560> light<00:02:59.740> so<00:03:00.250> each<00:03:00.490> one<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:00.880> these<00:03:00.970> speed

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
the light so each one of these speed

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.060 
the light so each one of these speed
lights<00:03:01.570> were<00:03:02.080> equipped<00:03:02.410> with<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.650> magmod

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
lights were equipped with the magmod

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.490 
lights were equipped with the magmod
system<00:03:03.550> and<00:03:03.730> some<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:04.570> them<00:03:04.690> were<00:03:04.810> gelled<00:03:05.200> when

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
system and some of them were gelled when

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.350 
system and some of them were gelled when
we<00:03:05.620> need<00:03:05.800> it<00:03:05.950> but<00:03:06.220> all<00:03:06.490> of<00:03:06.520> them<00:03:06.820> were<00:03:06.970> grid

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
we need it but all of them were grid

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.720 
we need it but all of them were grid
gridded<00:03:08.020> for<00:03:08.770> that<00:03:08.950> shoot<00:03:09.220> so<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.460> we<00:03:09.580> can

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
gridded for that shoot so that we can
