so anyway right now I'm I still can't
get<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.149> car<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.449> idle<00:00:03.780> so<00:00:03.959> I'm<00:00:04.080> going<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.350> take

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
get the car to idle so I'm going to take

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.330 
get the car to idle so I'm going to take
my<00:00:05.089> timing<00:00:06.089> light<00:00:06.770> I<00:00:09.530> plug<00:00:10.530> my<00:00:10.740> vacuum<00:00:10.950> hose

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
my timing light I plug my vacuum hose

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.640 
my timing light I plug my vacuum hose
for<00:00:12.240> my<00:00:12.330> advanced<00:00:13.880> for<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.969> vacuum<00:00:15.179> advance

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
for my advanced for the vacuum advance

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.779 
for my advanced for the vacuum advance
so<00:00:16.650> I'm<00:00:16.740> gonna<00:00:16.830> take<00:00:17.010> my<00:00:17.070> timing<00:00:17.490> right<00:00:17.609> now

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
so I'm gonna take my timing right now

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.070 
so I'm gonna take my timing right now
I'm<00:00:18.000> gonna<00:00:18.150> see<00:00:18.420> if<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:19.160> can<00:00:20.869> see<00:00:21.869> what<00:00:21.990> our

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
I'm gonna see if we can see what our

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.080 
I'm gonna see if we can see what our
timings<00:00:22.470> up<00:00:22.680> go<00:00:23.400> from<00:00:23.609> there

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
timings up go from there

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.290 
timings up go from there
see<00:00:24.840> what<00:00:24.990> happens<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.980> know<00:00:26.300> it's

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
see what happens you know it's

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.849 
see what happens you know it's
recommended<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:28.019> an<00:00:28.140> advance<00:00:28.439> timing

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
recommended you get an advance timing

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.910 
recommended you get an advance timing
right<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.039> do<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:30.199> I'm<00:00:31.199> sure<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.500> lot<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.769> you

come on I'm still running damn it Oh see
this<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.530> problem<00:01:56.010> I<00:01:57.380> can't<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.650> this<00:01:58.830> unless

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
this is a problem I can't do this unless

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.250 
this is a problem I can't do this unless
the<00:01:59.550> engine<00:01:59.970> idles<00:02:00.390> properly<00:02:00.900> you<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:00.990> to

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
the engine idles properly you have to

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.810 
the engine idles properly you have to
set<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.560> idle<00:02:01.710> off<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> little<00:02:02.310> more<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.670> see

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
set the idle off a little more and see

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.060 
set the idle off a little more and see
if<00:02:02.910> I<00:02:03.000> can<00:02:03.119> keep<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.360> idling<00:02:06.619> very<00:02:07.619> hard<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:07.920> do

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
if I can keep it idling very hard to do

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.440 
if I can keep it idling very hard to do
when<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.399> car<00:02:08.610> doesn't<00:02:08.640> want<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.179> cooperate

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
when the car doesn't want to cooperate

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.080 
when the car doesn't want to cooperate
with<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:10.490> definitely<00:02:11.490> got<00:02:11.610> more<00:02:11.850> throttle

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
with you definitely got more throttle

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.210 
with you definitely got more throttle
response<00:02:12.360> out<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.050> now<00:02:13.200> so<00:02:13.230> I'm<00:02:13.830> gonna<00:02:13.980> take

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
response out of it now so I'm gonna take

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.949 
response out of it now so I'm gonna take
a<00:02:14.280> look<00:02:14.459> at<00:02:15.980> at<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.970> idle<00:02:18.270> right<00:02:18.420> now<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:18.810> see

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
a look at at the idle right now and see

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:28.690 
a look at at the idle right now and see
if<00:02:19.020> we<00:02:19.110> can<00:02:19.200> get<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.410> thing<00:02:19.470> tuned<00:02:19.830> again

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.630 

see<00:02:29.700> now<00:02:29.939> I<00:02:30.269> adjust<00:02:30.689> the<00:02:30.930> idle<00:02:31.079> up

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.870 

it's<00:02:33.970> still<00:02:34.240> not<00:02:34.360> right<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:35.530> idle<00:02:35.980> spring<00:02:36.670> is

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
it's still not right the idle spring is

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.490 
it's still not right the idle spring is
half<00:02:37.390> compressed<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.950> idle<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.310> so<00:02:39.490> damn<00:02:39.700> high

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
half compressed the idle is so damn high

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.400 
half compressed the idle is so damn high
but<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:42.100> know<00:02:42.190> but<00:02:42.730> this<00:02:42.820> is<00:02:42.970> all<00:02:43.120> I'm<00:02:43.240> getting

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
but you know but this is all I'm getting

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.430 
but you know but this is all I'm getting
up<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.680> down<00:02:44.860> up<00:02:45.070> and<00:02:45.100> down<00:02:45.280> up<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:45.580> down<00:02:46.440> go

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
up and down up and down up and down go

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.020 
up and down up and down up and down go
ahead<00:02:47.740> and<00:02:47.890> see<00:02:48.100> now<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.310> got<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:48.580> to<00:02:48.730> idle<00:02:49.000> a

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
ahead and see now I got it to idle a

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.230 
ahead and see now I got it to idle a
little<00:02:49.330> bit

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.190 

now<00:02:58.090> some<00:02:59.090> days<00:02:59.270> it<00:02:59.540> doesn't<00:02:59.690> pay<00:02:59.930> to<00:02:59.990> get<00:03:00.140> out

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
now some days it doesn't pay to get out

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:48.730 
now some days it doesn't pay to get out
of<00:03:00.380> bed
