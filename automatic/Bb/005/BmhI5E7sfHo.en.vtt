00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
beginning but it kind of made up for it

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.660 
beginning but it kind of made up for it
in<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.160> end<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:27.230> prose<00:01:28.230> I<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.950> how<00:01:29.160> the<00:01:29.220> point

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
in the end a prose I like how the point

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.360

far<00:06:05.529> that<00:06:06.099> has<00:06:06.279> an<00:06:06.520> epilogue<00:06:06.849> so<00:06:07.089> that's

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:07.449 
far that has an epilogue so that's

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.659
