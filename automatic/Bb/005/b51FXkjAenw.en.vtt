00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:09.929
 Good afternoon, good afternoon to everyone. 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.790
 the bongo president consequently today 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.099
 I come to present a bill 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.890
 that has everything to do with what is being 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.050
 discussed here in this house today but I 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.640
 I wonder if the journalist 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.480
 Boris Casoy was here in our 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.859
 town that he would do what he would 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.820
 This is a shame, it's all wrong. 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.250
 all wrong 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.180
 the water bill that we have ours 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.710
 city ​​is one of the most expensive of abc is 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.110
 more expensive than the city of São Paulo is 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.149
 more expensive than his account is Bernardo 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.789
 it's all wrong 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.850
 water lacks water in several in several 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.890
 neighborhoods of our county 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.199
 so that's all I think is boris casoy 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.329
 thinking about the situation of santo andré 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.940
 This is a shame so today I came 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.160
 present a bill that has ended 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.129
 coinciding with what was discussed today 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.110
 is a bill that exempts the rate of 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.000
 drainage for those who invest 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.500
 reuse of rainwater 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.600
 I would ask for technique to 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.810
 drop the video please and increase 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.810
 the sound 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.500
 the rain water falling from the roof goes 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.050
 to the load and continue through these pipes until 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.750
 arrive at this first reservoir that 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.850
 accumulates 200 liters of water in the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.880
 the water is in the process of cleaning 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.790
 decantation not by opening the 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.980
 faucet water comes out with impurities to 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.340
 clean water goes to this water tank 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.960
 of 5 thousand liters where it is stored 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.330
 first rain 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.790
 I leave it to do the cleaning on the roof 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.010
 right as a matter of some animal feces 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.940
 bird that may have died then 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.050
 I disconnect the tubing when it occurs 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.940
 the second rain 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.690
 I still have that other system that 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.220
 is an Otoniel box of 200 books that 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.110
 the final process goes to the 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.300
 reservoir of five thousand and when it passes 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.150
 by this process from the pressure 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.980
 water pump from the tank to the 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.350
 the central water tank that supplies 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.260
 all faucets and discharges from the 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.600
 residence through these two registers 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.570
 he has the option to choose whether advanced 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.910
 residence and the street or box that 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.220
 china stores then the practical thing 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.290
 that you are doing your 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.880
 and saving water and not 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.900
 wasting using water with 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.030
 rationality 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.790
 the course to build the project was a thousand 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.680
 and five hundred reais and in a few months 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.170
 the engineer says he has recovered all 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.959
 investment before installing the 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.970
 consumption in the residence was 36 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.030
 to 40 cubic meters 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:57.040
 today he only pays the rate with consumption 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:00.680
 less than 10 cubic meters per month 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.390
 Thank you, when I came, I thought I'd introduce you. 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.239
 this project I first thought of 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.190
 environment in the population we 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.920
 taking advantage of the rainwater that is 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.610
 wasted to wash the sidewalks and 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.440
 water the plants using the discharge more 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.209
 after what I saw here today I think 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.970
 It is fundamental that we present 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.300
 this bill here or in session 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.410
 past and spoke of the damar rate is that the 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.970
 former mayor of são paulo offering 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.900
 higher rate for santo andré will turn 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:33.050
 It's like inviting leprosy to manage 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.540
 the sector of the week in the city because 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.709
 rate it all wrong 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.620
 abc 's mask is 300% rate of 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.719
 I increased everything here, everything wrong. 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.730
 so it ended up coinciding that no 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:47.109
 I hoped that today, first of all 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.510
 Like I said I thought of the environment. 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.030
 I thought of the population I gave up to 60 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.269
 video was an inexpensive example but it was 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.519
 cost the ppec the return of custume 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.129
 invested was less than one year 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:03.340
 It's interesting but we need to give 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.500
 a stimulus for the population with the 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.239
 incentive that we have the rate of 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.670
 drainage of rainwater which has not been 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.349
 spoken here that increases every year as well 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.329
 then we need the incentive to 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.760
 population to invest and in the future 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.780
 also the city ​​hall after 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.669
 this project 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.979
 we have microcredit in the city 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.870
 for the population the municipality that you want 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.880
 invest in this system that is 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.340
 ecologically correct 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.150
 able to pay with microcredit from the 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.060
 town hall 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.599
 Let's think about it and we'll rethink everything. 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.729
 huh 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:36.120
 About these and nothing, thank you very much. 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.120
 to all
