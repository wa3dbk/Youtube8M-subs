00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.590
 what we are going to beat I put it to 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.180
 room temperature because this is going to 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.570
 help when the gown is much more 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.570
 easy 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.220
 right now I'm beating this because I 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.660
 I wanted to mention to make sure that 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.010
 I do not know any little ball 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.170
 reach to look here there are still some 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.510
 little balls I'm going to mix all this very very 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.990
 well to then add all the 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.990
 other ingredients 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.350
 the next ingredient that we are going to 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.650
 add is going to be the half cup of and of 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.650
 lime 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.970
 and at the end we are going to add our cube 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.430
 of people we are not going to put it until the 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.080
 final so that it is fluffy what is 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.880
 to help make it fluffy 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.930
 mix that we are doing 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.030
 we also have it at temperature 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.110
 environment all this is going to make it 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.110
 much easier to mix 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.860
 right now what I 'm going to develop these 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.090
 molds as it is a recipe that we are 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.560
 doing especially for pallet 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.440
 valentina I'm using these molds of 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.170
 heart and good we are going to put plastic 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.960
 so we can take out the dessert a lot 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.390
 easier and for that I'm using this 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.330
 plastic paper what I did is nothing 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.610
 more cut a few pieces like that 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.160
 little ones and I'm going to put them here 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.930
 in the good heart then nothing else 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.790
 here we are going to put it assuring that 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.130
 be well adjusted here on the banks 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.680
 so that the shape of the heart fits 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.340
 in the dessert here I already did all the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.620
 hearts with the dessert and I left one for 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.720
 to see what I am doing 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:51.769
 I'm going to add about 3 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.769
 spoonfuls of this snow that of water 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.800
 good and once it's like this we're going to 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.080
 add 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.080
 our cube mix 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.860
 or whipped cream 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.790
 and put in the fridge and let's 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.340
 Freeze it for two to three hours 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.500
 it's like you look at dessert when you 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.080
 we removed the plastics would make a few 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.640
 little ears that looked a little rough 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.220
 but then here and nothing else we settle 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.110
 with a fork you are making the way 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.370
 you around like that look more like the 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.650
 way that for example if you want to do 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.140
 star hearts or whatever and 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:10.870
 well this one is very rich I hope what 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.870
 try and we 're going to do next life
