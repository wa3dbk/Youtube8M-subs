00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
little bit more research on how to

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.440 
little bit more research on how to
formulate<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.220> how<00:01:35.430> ingredients<00:01:35.939> interact

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
formulate and how ingredients interact

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.940 
formulate and how ingredients interact
with<00:01:36.600> each<00:01:36.630> other<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:37.560> put<00:01:37.829> them

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
with each other and so we put them

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.530 
with each other and so we put them
together<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.729> really<00:01:38.909> cool<00:01:39.060> thing<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.299> it
