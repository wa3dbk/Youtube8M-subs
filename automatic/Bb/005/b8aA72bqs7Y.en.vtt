00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hello dear friends with you review 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.819
 on entertainment channels I am leading him 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.529
 Ilyukha beasts today we will 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.490
 look at the company hard drive 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.800
 Toshiba 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.800
 conveo connects2 drove 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.020
 data hard drives presented back in 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.140
 los angeles earlier this year and 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.550
 voila now they are in my hands well 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.740
 more precisely one of them on 1 terabyte 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.080
 there are only four versions then 500 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.490
 gigabyte 1 terabyte 2 terabyte and 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.739
 maximum 3 terabytes 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.100
 500 gigabyte and 1 terabyte models 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.559
 weighs 165 grams just him and which 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.390
 2 3 terabytes they weigh two hundred thirty 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.000
 grams all hard drives are made in 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.070
 hard drive disc 2 and 5 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.400
 turns off on the interface spi 30 and 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.620
 let's see what he can do 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.930
 signatures and computers initially fit 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.770
 mac is stored on the hard disk 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.880
 special file for poppy user and 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.579
 uterus users can work with 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.170
 format ntf in which is formatted 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.910
 it is a hard disk that can be made 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.890
 backups like through 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.350
 firmware she 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.320
 also goes here for windows users 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.060
 so and through time machines for users 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.060
 mac but look only 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.460
 caution that the program driver 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.979
 which goes for mac which you will be 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.720
 allow working with hard disk on mts 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.270
 and we will not be friends time machines and 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.560
 therefore backup is initially supported 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.870
 on pise 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.360
 using this program or if you 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.930
 format it all the same in the format 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.760
 makowski there coffee the time machines with 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.700
 it will work next icon 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.640
 means that here 10 gigabytes of cloud 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.650
 repository it means that there will go 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.960
 user software 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.450
 windows and mac os 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.520
 called goblak we start accounting 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.680
 write and get up to 10 gigabytes 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.970
 free storage but everything is in 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.130
 mostly tied to 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.470
 software in principle myself 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.200
 the disk is completely irrelevant 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.110
 volume maybe we can these 10 megabytes 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.759
 increase to no limit costs 495 in 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.130
 month let's show you right away how 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.280
 everything works but the hard disk is 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.200
 put on the computer I also downloaded 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.780
 the program just it goes here in 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.580
 digi format as long as the hard disk 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.740
 friction i need a computer co 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.590
 god included poster program on 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.410
 McQueen here we deliberately three folders + 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.370
 new folders that I downloaded already one 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.480
 photograph we take your phone camera it 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.709
 the computer is on the other side and 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.410
 connected to the internet 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.840
 okay go to god flag and i 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.600
 I get access to the same three folders 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.810
 mouth new folder go here i have 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.690
 have a photo of me kept 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.200
 on the computer look works on 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.150
 principle 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.160
 This is usually the order cloud storage. 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.100
 walk in the picture we cut the picture 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.330
 save images to desktop 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.530
 I throw it all in a new folder here 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.120
 see new folder 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:09.300
 both and after that I hope to see already 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:12.750
 this photo here let's update and 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.560
 here she appeared in this way 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.140
 works 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.800
 cloud storage look further at 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.440
 hard drive is a usb 30 interface on the side 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.110
 it is written that it is immediately compatible with windows 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.600
 8 respectively with windows 10 mind 7 and 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.480
 for mac users, too, everything is there 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.610
 but it's written for mac users 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.830
 please install the software 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.200
 ensuring and on the back side more 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.180
 detailed pictograms what is it at all 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.670
 means well let's open the box and 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.620
 look at the hard drive itself 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:49.220
 of course I enjoyed it 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:51.060
 something casing 2 and 5 it is pretty 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.130
 cool done then 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.900
 glossy plastics top right 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.299
 there is a blue indicator light 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.269
 colors that shows us work 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.880
 the name of the hard disk itself 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:06.030
 Available in five different colors. 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.270
 making there blue black red white 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.850
 such a gray back here 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.100
 information about where made how much 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.830
 capacity and four rubber feet to 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.440
 he did not slide on the surface 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.959
 interface yusb and accordingly will find 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.590
 us included to connect to 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.860
 computer 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.230
 further in the kit we find 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.240
 warranty instruction manual and 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.890
 instruction such physical sensations from 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.190
 he is pretty small just like 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.650
 love and hard gums in buildings 2 and 5 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.050
 well, pretty light 165 grams 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.170
 thickness if she is interested 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.850
 it turns out here 19 5 millimeters two 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.420
 centimeter so well now let's 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:52.320
 let's pass to tests I will test on 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:55.380
 Kerry see all usb connectors means that 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:59.300
 this is bit 30 lights up blue 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.220
 work indicator and let's run the test 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.740
 back magic for mac users you 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.640
 must first go to the hard drive itself 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.950
 and install here the magician driver is 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.440
 backup program for windows 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.600
 Exotic file there you can already set 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.430
 either we want to do this backup in 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.160
 cloud storage either whole computer 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.960
 or some volume folders and how 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.670
 Often we want to backup and this 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.170
 here is a program for the clouds, it is also here 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.000
 seems to be for users 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:31.050
 windows so for mac users 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:36.660
 choose black magic itself 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:42.600
 our drive toshiba and launch start what 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:48.210
 shows us a record 90 megabit 9290 5 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:52.770
 megabit seconds and reading 96 97 98 megabits 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:55.020
 second record became higher as the 5 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.010
 megabit per second but ok 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.570
 Indicator pretty average for 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.660
 this class hard drive the result is 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:09.200
 what does the company represent to us 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:10.380
 cool and beautiful hard drive 2 and 5 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.710
 form factor 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.210
 and presents all the programs already on 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.610
 backup disk itself 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.710
 both for windows users and mac 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.390
 Well, let's do this real 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:27.280
 test example we want to throw 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:29.890
 1910 star wars file there help 4 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.690
 gigabyte it size and try 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.690
 transfer to hard drive 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:37.270
 there is a b30 now working and see what 4 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:43.840
 gigabytes we will boot in less than 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:46.030
 minute + same file we can and in 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.160
 cloud storage pour and then on 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.930
 mobile device when accessing 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.940
 look online thanks 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.870
 inspected the review until the end write your 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.120
 comments 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.220
 that's there down here don't forget to put 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:01.590
 thumb up and wait for new videos with 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.590
 you have been entertaining review bye
