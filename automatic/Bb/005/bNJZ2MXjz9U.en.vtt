00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.599
 hi to all friends here is dams and in 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.910
 this short video will explain a 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.400
 little secret to easily increase 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.049
 your win the pain of call of duty 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.359
 black ops 2 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.789
 what is the wing loss ratio in the first place 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.310
 well in very simple words is the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.279
 relationship between won games and those 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.640
 lost of your career won you have 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.750
 I don't know 15 games won and 10 games 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.840
 lost your windows network or will be of 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.820
 1.5 if you're like me probably 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.680
 you will prefer one side then the scarring 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.180
 rather than another kill to the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.850
 treasure 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.670
 well probably if you play with 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.879
 a team modalities such as engraving 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.559
 confirmed even team deathmatch 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.170
 often often you will find yourself 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.690
 maybe in quite uncomfortable situations 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.820
 and with people who are in the domain 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.340
 stand out in the small houses in the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.380
 edges of the map trying to have a 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.450
 frieze of 3.0 4.0 and yet they are 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.710
 quite useless for the purposes of 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.590
 team victory 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.280
 this way you probably if you 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.650
 captain of such players happen 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.420
 you are going to lose quite often 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.280
 how to do so to improve the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.619
 own statistics after these 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.049
 resounding defeats and feel the boss 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.310
 well a very easy way is to play 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.860
 in all against all 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.110
 free for all for the English reason 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.590
 this choice is indeed very much 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.590
 simple in free for all you will also win 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.119
 in case you arrive I do n't know third parties 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.040
 because why the victory comes 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.409
 assigned to the first to the precisely 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.200
 second and third at the game e 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.590
 as this mode in all against 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.750
 all 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.750
 let's say they don't play the best 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.820
 players if you are above average 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.579
 you will arrive easily within the first three 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.120
 positions for example I now how 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.960
 now for things like 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.710
 a series wins of 30 31 perhaps in 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.710
 free for all 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.990
 what bumper has dramatically yours 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.310
 general statistics 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.860
 I hope this video was there 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.660
 useful and if you liked remember to

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.800
