00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.850
 good day comrades and you probably 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.480
 think what I'm doing here is just 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.540
 cartoons 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.700
 Yes, I'm doing only cartoons here and bye 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.469
 I render another tank-show I 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.990
 tell you about one event 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.650
 which was unable to visit it was 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.529
 is dedicated to 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.529
 world of warships world of warships 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.970
 so better this event took place 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.519
 St. Petersburg 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.160
 where is the office of game developers 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.170
 about warships about the city itself i 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.600
 I will not tell because it's better 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.610
 see once is no better a hundred times 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.520
 see shorter yourself come and 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.820
 look just and got to the hotel and 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.820
 now we start the adventure made out 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.100
 at the reception and who I see there Jova 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.110
 but he didn't know me by sight therefore 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.050
 he had to lie with your stream 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.260
 thanks, I had a cozy room on 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.879
 sixth floor with a great view and 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.640
 Adventures continued on the table found 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.080
 a bottle of note it was certainly not 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.150
 Captain Grant's Letter 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.030
 a schedule of events but still 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.610
 it was very nice and the bathroom hung a backpack 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.710
 with prey can opener killed and for 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.140
 canned fish ship x 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.090
 info and navy t-shirt 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.850
 what else do you need this sea 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.100
 wolf but I am actually very happy 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.560
 such a love of detail for detail 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.860
 but in the evening was not a big banquet 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.000
 with treats where you could eat 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.570
 meet people involved 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.479
 ships or just chat what a 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.340
 eat real sailors love a 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.799
 the next day we went to the sea 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.729
 museum to visit the cultural capital and not 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.850
 visit the museum 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.979
 it would be a crime museum kept 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.070
 imagine the whole history of the navy 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.619
 chipper Peter the first to modern 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.610
 nuclear aircraft carriers real samples 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.780
 weapons weapons ammunition 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.210
 uniform and all kinds of things 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.439
 which is very closely related to the sea and 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.100
 sea ​​battles 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.270
 tens and even hundreds of ship mockups 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.550
 recreated in exact proportion and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.920
 the smallest details I saw as 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.360
 some avid courts modellers lost 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.000
 consciousness of joy 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.710
 at the sight of all this after the museum on 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.420
 walk on presented heading to 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.200
 world of game developers office 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.990
 warships 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.570
 it is in such places that games are born 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.020
 the atmosphere of creativity is fun and persistent 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.590
 labor 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.530
 people paint model recreate details 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.630
 ships weapons just like it was a museum 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.700
 As a rule, all this is done with 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.310
 historical sources of photographs and 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.040
 drawings because historicity in these 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.380
 affairs is very important and there is a team of people 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.320
 which on the contrary destroys everything that he 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.070
 model or others damage and this command 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.950
 shouting 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.320
 Now this work I do not mean to break 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.660
 build actually you understand what 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.270
 you create good showy shots are you 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.270
 Of course the other team is worth a lot 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.370
 makes the background and effects of water and environment 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.920
 so that you can dive as much as possible 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.320
 in the atmosphere of the sea the elements ship 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.390
 need somewhere to fight separate important 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.360
 moment for any game or movie this 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.230
 sound whether it be gunshots blast or just 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.870
 screams of seagulls 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.840
 This is a special sound insulation room. 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.160
 from acoustic foam rubber 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.830
 give a damn to be like this all your room 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.269
 no one will interfere at all and of course 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.190
 can not forget the video department 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.430
 where are the videos that we watch 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.760
 on youtube and here on met arte 25 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.010
 gave up with pounded arms everyone remembers 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.900
 his fragmovie on tanks now also 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.470
 never forget his fragmovie on 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.900
 ships 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.360
 in addition to walks and excursions around the offices 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.000
 so that we don't harass the developers 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.459
 We were given a press conference answered 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.320
 on exciting questions content 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.930
 I will not retell for sure 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.750
 press conferences you find on the internet 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.930
 but it all sounds pretty colorful and 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.269
 promisingly 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.250
 which can not but rejoice 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.890
 the climax of our adventures has become 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.769
 boat trip through the weather 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.780
 This St. Petersburg but for the harsh 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.780
 sea ​​wolves it's not raining 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.989
 this sea spray every self-respecting 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.140
 the sailor tied the sea knot and drank the rum 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.320
 and suddenly dmitry was on board 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.120
 the same goblin translator though now 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.160
 he is already better known as the presenter 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.690
 remember the videos where he talked about 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.670
 tanks and pro history 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.680
 so we managed to talk a bit and 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.250
 I even showed him one fine cartoon 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.640
 counterattack and he sincerely neighing approved 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.070
 so Dmitry Yurich our man comrades 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.020
 during all these meetings and conversations I 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.300
 met many people who 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.430
 involved in marine subjects and make 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.410
 the videos about the ships were naturally 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.210
 talk about creating a cartoon about 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.730
 ships or some kind of joint 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.340
 cartoons of tanks and ships especially 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.580
 there have been attempts but it is all for now 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.160
 at the level of thinking of ideas that from this 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.410
 Well, let's see, but I will give you 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.140
 told everything he had planned play 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.800
 tanks play the ship and watch 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.030
 cartoons 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.030
 good day comrades
