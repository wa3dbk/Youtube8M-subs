opticals<00:01:45.689> because<00:01:46.759> they're<00:01:47.759> very<00:01:47.909> high

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
opticals because they're very high

opticals because they're very high
quality<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:49.320> lenses<00:01:49.649> are<00:01:49.770> real<00:01:49.920> glass<00:01:50.310> so

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
quality the lenses are real glass so

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.310 
quality the lenses are real glass so
they're<00:01:51.060> very<00:01:51.090> optically<00:01:51.750> clear<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.229> they're

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
they're very optically clear and they're

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.649

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
noticed when I put them on comparing

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.420 
noticed when I put them on comparing
them<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.670> my<00:01:56.759> old<00:01:56.969> GP<00:01:57.329> plastic<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.290> know

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
them to my old GP plastic you know

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.600

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.850 
knock-offs
was<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.689> everything<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.229> looked<00:02:01.469> clearer

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
was that everything just looked clearer

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.300 
was that everything just looked clearer
and<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.969> more<00:02:03.090> crisp<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.320> feel<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:04.799> you

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
opticals are really a good deal if I had

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.820

any if I have to complain about anything
with<00:02:47.220> them<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.780> only<00:02:49.050> complaint<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.560> have

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
with them the only complaint that I have

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.990 
with them the only complaint that I have
is<00:02:49.830> they're<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.010> little<00:02:50.160> bit<00:02:50.310> heavy<00:02:50.550> but<00:02:50.760> that's

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
is they're a little bit heavy but that's

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.430 
is they're a little bit heavy but that's
just<00:02:51.120> because<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.510> lens<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.840> real<00:02:52.080> glass

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
just because the lens is a real glass

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.670 
just because the lens is a real glass
and<00:02:52.830> then<00:02:53.460> back<00:02:54.030> here<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.990> doesn't<00:02:55.230> fit<00:02:55.410> like

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.630 
sunglasses and again they are
military-issue<00:04:10.140> and<00:04:10.500> they've<00:04:11.460> got<00:04:11.610> a

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
military-issue and they've got a

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.010 
military-issue and they've got a
military<00:04:12.060> contract<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.630> they're<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.840> real

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
military contract and they're the real

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
deal for a v8 or sunglasses so I think

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.590 
deal for a v8 or sunglasses so I think
they<00:04:17.250> also<00:04:17.370> make<00:04:17.700> one<00:04:17.910> that's<00:04:18.090> more<00:04:18.450> of<00:04:18.510> a

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
they also make one that's more of a

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.860 
they also make one that's more of a
teardrop<00:04:19.080> shape<00:04:19.200> as<00:04:19.739> well<00:04:19.950> and<00:04:20.540> but<00:04:21.540> these<00:04:21.690> are

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
teardrop shape as well and but these are

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.200 
teardrop shape as well and but these are
sort<00:04:22.260> of<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.550> classic<00:04:23.550> style<00:04:23.880> that<00:04:24.090> are<00:04:24.180> a

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
sort of the classic style that are a

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.880 
sort of the classic style that are a
little<00:04:24.450> bit<00:04:24.540> more<00:04:24.690> square<00:04:24.990> rather<00:04:25.590> than<00:04:25.860> a

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
little bit more square rather than a

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.260 
little bit more square rather than a
teardrop<00:04:26.310> aviator

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
teardrop aviator

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.089 
teardrop aviator
but<00:04:27.750> you<00:04:27.930> know<00:04:28.020> if<00:04:28.080> you<00:04:28.139> prefer<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.710> teardrop

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.099 
but you know if you prefer the teardrop

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:31.189 
but you know if you prefer the teardrop
I<00:04:29.220> think<00:04:29.400> they<00:04:29.490> make<00:04:29.669> those<00:04:29.879> as<00:04:30.060> well<00:04:30.240> but<00:04:31.080> this

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
I think they make those as well but this

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.930 
I think they make those as well but this
is<00:04:31.259> just<00:04:31.560> more<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:31.740> a<00:04:31.860> classic<00:04:32.280> style<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.699> think

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
is just more of a classic style I think

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.490 
is just more of a classic style I think
