witches<00:01:23.369> see<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.970> happening<00:01:24.479> there

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
witches see what is happening there

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.219 
witches see what is happening there
without<00:01:26.310> having<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.210> open<00:01:27.240> their<00:01:27.659> big<00:01:27.869> gates

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
without having to open their big gates

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.429 
without having to open their big gates
without<00:01:28.439> having<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.220> risk<00:01:29.400> anything<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.439> yeah
