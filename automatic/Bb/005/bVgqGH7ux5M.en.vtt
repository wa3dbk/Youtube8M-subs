this<00:01:09.700> one<00:01:09.759> I<00:01:10.090> guess<00:01:10.840> let<00:01:11.020> me<00:01:11.080> cover<00:01:11.229> that<00:01:11.320> real

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
this one I guess let me cover that real

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.040 
this one I guess let me cover that real
fast<00:01:11.800> is<00:01:12.550> because<00:01:12.910> this<00:01:13.119> one<00:01:13.330> doesn't<00:01:13.660> provide

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
fast is because this one doesn't provide

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.809 
fast is because this one doesn't provide
the<00:01:14.110> same<00:01:14.410> capabilities<00:01:15.099> as<00:01:15.130> this<00:01:15.340> one<00:01:15.550> as<00:01:15.670> far

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:15.819 
the same capabilities as this one as far

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:18.150 
the same capabilities as this one as far
as<00:01:15.940> storage<00:01:16.209> goes<00:01:16.569> as<00:01:17.319> you<00:01:17.470> can<00:01:17.590> see<00:01:17.800> on<00:01:17.979> this

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
as storage goes as you can see on this

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.130 
as storage goes as you can see on this
original<00:01:18.849> one<00:01:19.179> that<00:01:19.330> I<00:01:19.360> had<00:01:19.539> there<00:01:19.780> really<00:01:19.929> is

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
original one that I had there really is

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.520 
original one that I had there really is
no<00:01:20.319> storage<00:01:20.849> except<00:01:21.849> for<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.780> bladder<00:01:23.050> pocket

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
here which I did end up keeping I think

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.870
