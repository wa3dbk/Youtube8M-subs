wet<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.930> wild<00:02:01.079> one<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:02.090> up<00:02:03.090> my<00:02:03.270> nose<00:02:03.450> just

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
wet and wild one is just up my nose just

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.350 
wet and wild one is just up my nose just
a<00:02:04.590> hint<00:02:04.979> it's<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.640> hint<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.869> tiny

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
a hint it's just a hint just a tiny

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.060 
a hint it's just a hint just a tiny
and<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:07.660> can't<00:02:07.990> emphasize<00:02:08.170> this<00:02:08.440> enough<00:02:08.710> just

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
and I can't emphasize this enough just

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.790 
and I can't emphasize this enough just
it<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.250> little<00:02:09.490> bit<00:02:09.610> more<00:02:10.060> dry<00:02:10.380> but<00:02:11.380> other<00:02:11.530> than

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
it a little bit more dry but other than

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.980 
it a little bit more dry but other than
that<00:02:11.860> they're<00:02:12.490> both<00:02:12.700> essentially<00:02:13.360> just<00:02:13.780> about

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
that they're both essentially just about

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.620 
that they're both essentially just about
the<00:02:14.200> same<00:02:14.380> color<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:15.040> am<00:02:15.970> actually<00:02:16.270> wearing

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
messy swatches I had on my hand this

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.640 
messy swatches I had on my hand this
thicker<00:02:27.970> one<00:02:28.300> right<00:02:28.510> here<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:28.960> Fergie<00:02:29.470> one

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
thicker one right here is the Fergie one

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.100 
thicker one right here is the Fergie one
and<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.610> thinner<00:02:30.850> one<00:02:31.090> here<00:02:31.330> is<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.570> Mac<00:02:31.780> I

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
and the thinner one here is the Mac I

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.530 
and the thinner one here is the Mac I
kind<00:02:32.470> of<00:02:32.560> did<00:02:32.740> like<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:32.950> dryness<00:02:33.550> test<00:02:33.910> here<00:02:34.300> and

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
kind of did like a dryness test here and

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.080 
kind of did like a dryness test here and
the<00:02:34.990> Mac<00:02:35.200> one<00:02:35.500> is<00:02:35.740> here<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.459> Fergie<00:02:36.730> one<00:02:36.970> is

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
the Mac one is here the Fergie one is

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.350 
the Mac one is here the Fergie one is
here<00:02:37.420> um<00:02:38.320> I<00:02:38.350> honestly<00:02:39.130> think<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.730> Fergie<00:02:40.209> one

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
here um I honestly think the Fergie one

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.110 
here um I honestly think the Fergie one
is<00:02:40.570> just<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.900> little<00:02:41.170> bit<00:02:41.320> more<00:02:41.560> opaque<00:02:42.010> but<00:02:42.850> for

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
is just a little bit more opaque but for

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.699 
is just a little bit more opaque but for
some<00:02:43.270> reason<00:02:43.570> it<00:02:43.690> didn't<00:02:43.990> swatch<00:02:44.230> as<00:02:44.500> well

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
some reason it didn't swatch as well

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.320 
some reason it didn't swatch as well
they're<00:02:44.950> like<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.310> just<00:02:45.520> didn't<00:02:45.760> blend<00:02:46.000> out<00:02:46.150> as

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
they're like it just didn't blend out as

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.060 
they're like it just didn't blend out as
easy<00:02:46.510> because<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.930> was<00:02:47.020> drier<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.590> then<00:02:47.860> this

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
easy because it was drier and then this

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.280 
easy because it was drier and then this
is<00:02:48.280> how<00:02:48.430> they're<00:02:48.640> both<00:02:48.820> kind<00:02:49.630> of<00:02:49.690> built<00:02:49.930> up<00:02:50.140> to

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
is how they're both kind of built up to

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.320 
is how they're both kind of built up to
be<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.680> can<00:02:50.860> tell<00:02:51.070> my<00:02:51.190> hand<00:02:51.520> is<00:02:51.730> really<00:02:51.940> stand

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
be you can tell my hand is really stand

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.810 
be you can tell my hand is really stand
up<00:02:52.510> because<00:02:52.989> actually<00:02:53.890> both<00:02:54.100> of<00:02:54.310> them<00:02:54.400> stain

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
up because actually both of them stain

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.400 
up because actually both of them stain
your<00:02:55.030> lips<00:02:55.060> really<00:02:55.450> well<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.959> don't<00:02:56.230> know<00:02:56.320> if

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
your lips really well I don't know if

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.199 
your lips really well I don't know if
that's<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.650> plus<00:02:56.920> side<00:02:57.160> for<00:02:57.190> some<00:02:57.610> of<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:57.910> but

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
that's a plus side for some of you but

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.630 
that's a plus side for some of you but
me<00:02:58.510> personally<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:59.080> like<00:02:59.530> it<00:02:59.739> when<00:03:00.010> my<00:03:00.190> lipstick

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
me personally I like it when my lipstick

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.280 
me personally I like it when my lipstick
doubles<00:03:01.000> is<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.209> stain<00:03:01.570> because<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:02.140> means

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
doubles is a stain because that means

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.920 
doubles is a stain because that means
even<00:03:03.070> after<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.730> lipstick<00:03:04.090> residue<00:03:04.540> is<00:03:04.720> gone

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
even after the lipstick residue is gone

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.170 
even after the lipstick residue is gone
I<00:03:05.200> got<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.590> little<00:03:05.800> something<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.430> little<00:03:06.459> color

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
I got a little something a little color

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.790 
I got a little something a little color
going<00:03:07.450> on<00:03:07.660> where<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.290> need<00:03:08.500> it

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
going on where I need it

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.520 
going on where I need it
you<00:03:09.010> know<00:03:09.130> another<00:03:09.730> note<00:03:10.030> this<00:03:10.330> lipstick<00:03:11.170> is

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530

either<00:03:12.070> four<00:03:12.760> dollars<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.239> think<00:03:13.269> it's<00:03:13.510> 399<00:03:13.780> or

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
either four dollars I think it's 399 or

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.039 
either four dollars I think it's 399 or
$4.99<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:15.459> think<00:03:15.850> I<00:03:15.940> had<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.090> coupon<00:03:16.360> so<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:16.930> had<00:03:17.019> a

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
$4.99 I think I had a coupon so I had a

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.240 
$4.99 I think I had a coupon so I had a
dollar<00:03:17.290> off<00:03:17.530> you<00:03:17.680> don't<00:03:17.799> remember

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
dollar off you don't remember

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.360 
dollar off you don't remember
and<00:03:18.459> then<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.420> MAC<00:03:19.600> lipsticks<00:03:20.140> are<00:03:20.380> now<00:03:20.500> $15

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
and then the MAC lipsticks are now $15

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.090 
and then the MAC lipsticks are now $15
so<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:22.420> got<00:03:22.660> three<00:03:22.930> of<00:03:22.959> these<00:03:23.140> or<00:03:23.769> one<00:03:23.980> of

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
so you got three of these or one of

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.430 
so you got three of these or one of
these<00:03:24.220> or<00:03:24.610> if<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.120> just<00:03:25.150> prefer<00:03:25.720> owning<00:03:26.260> Mac
