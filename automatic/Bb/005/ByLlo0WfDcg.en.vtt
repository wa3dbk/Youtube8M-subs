00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
think it was the defining game of the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.200 
think it was the defining game of the
FIFA<00:01:21.060> series<00:01:21.270> not<00:01:22.110> since<00:01:22.470> fifa<00:01:22.979> 99<00:01:23.520> has<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> game

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
FIFA series not since fifa 99 has a game

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.690 
FIFA series not since fifa 99 has a game
been<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:24.990> successful<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.920> my<00:01:26.100> opinion<00:01:26.460> anyway

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
been so successful in my opinion anyway

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.600

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.680 
plays is brilliant oh I think it is a
game<00:04:03.459> at<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.819> end<00:04:03.940> of<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.090> day<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.420> I<00:04:04.480> think

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
game at the end of the day and I think

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.809 
game at the end of the day and I think
they<00:04:04.840> made<00:04:05.049> it<00:04:05.230> too<00:04:05.500> they<00:04:06.310> tried<00:04:06.579> to<00:04:06.609> make<00:04:06.700> it

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
they made it too they tried to make it

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.720 
they made it too they tried to make it
too<00:04:07.030> realistic<00:04:07.540> yeah<00:04:08.350> you<00:04:08.799> know<00:04:08.889> like<00:04:08.920> yeah

too realistic yeah you know like yeah

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.000 
too realistic yeah you know like yeah
the<00:04:09.940> scale<00:04:10.180> for<00:04:10.359> players<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.720> lot<00:04:10.810> of<00:04:11.769> annoying

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
the scale for players a lot of annoying

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.840 
the scale for players a lot of annoying
if<00:04:12.489> it<00:04:13.079> the<00:04:14.079> phone<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.709> realism<00:04:15.130> is<00:04:15.430> there<00:04:15.609> and

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
if it the phone the realism is there and

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.849 
if it the phone the realism is there and
it<00:04:15.940> is<00:04:16.060> definitely<00:04:16.299> most<00:04:16.690> realistic<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.350> to

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
it is definitely most realistic and to

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.379 
it is definitely most realistic and to
be<00:04:17.950> fair<00:04:18.130> it's<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.549> lot<00:04:18.700> more<00:04:18.729> challenge<00:04:19.299> to

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
this together yeah it it basically sort

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.860 
this together yeah it it basically sort
of<00:05:58.319> encourages<00:05:59.319> people<00:05:59.469> to<00:05:59.680> play<00:06:00.250> very<00:06:00.870> basic

down<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:02.199> wing<00:06:02.319> cross<00:06:02.529> the<00:06:02.710> volume<00:06:03.039> with<00:06:03.250> very

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
down the wing cross the volume with very

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.369 
down the wing cross the volume with very
little<00:06:03.669> skill<00:06:04.029> and<00:06:04.210> I<00:06:04.270> and<00:06:04.449> I<00:06:04.509> think<00:06:04.750> they

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:05.379 
little skill and I and I think they

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:07.680 
little skill and I and I think they
should<00:06:05.589> have<00:06:06.009> it<00:06:06.250> make<00:06:06.669> it<00:06:06.879> more<00:06:07.060> difficult<00:06:07.360> to

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
should have it make it more difficult to

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.209 
should have it make it more difficult to
cross<00:06:07.839> the<00:06:08.020> ball<00:06:08.229> which<00:06:08.800> would<00:06:08.919> be<00:06:09.009> something

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:09.219 
cross the ball which would be something

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:10.640 
cross the ball which would be something
like<00:06:09.339> that<00:06:09.610> so<00:06:09.759> you<00:06:09.969> have<00:06:10.180> to<00:06:10.330> actually

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
like that so you have to actually

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.589 
like that so you have to actually
practice<00:06:11.650> you<00:06:11.979> know<00:06:12.069> me<00:06:12.279> use<00:06:12.819> scales<00:06:13.120> it<00:06:13.419> takes

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
practice you know me use scales it takes

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.480 
practice you know me use scales it takes
a<00:06:13.690> lot<00:06:13.839> of<00:06:13.870> time<00:06:14.110> and<00:06:14.199> practice<00:06:14.349> to<00:06:14.680> do<00:06:14.860> you

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
a lot of time and practice to do you

i can see headers or something but it

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.430 
i can see headers or something but it
and<00:06:24.699> it's<00:06:24.849> really<00:06:24.969> annoying<00:06:25.150> book<00:06:25.629> there's<00:06:26.379> a

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
and it's really annoying book there's a

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.320 
and it's really annoying book there's a
lot<00:06:26.469> of<00:06:26.620> good<00:06:26.710> elements<00:06:27.190> that<00:06:27.339> game<00:06:27.580> fifa<00:06:28.240> 11

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:31.779 
but i think don't focus so much on the

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:34.230 
but i think don't focus so much on the
realism<00:06:32.289> but<00:06:32.500> if<00:06:32.740> you<00:06:32.860> are<00:06:32.889> still<00:06:33.819> try<00:06:34.149> and

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
realism but if you are still try and

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.640 
realism but if you are still try and
keep<00:06:34.300> the<00:06:34.449> fun<00:06:34.690> element
