00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello the package was just there and 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.660
 has brought me a packet of essens 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.240
 and I was very happy about it 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.030
 and that is the current led the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.929
 cookies and cream with many 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.639
 products 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.289
 I have but one also it myself 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.060
 have purchased comes but then in the course 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.949
 of the video we start now for the first time 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.380
 with my eyes make up 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.779
 I have the two here 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.760
 eyeshadow and these two 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.960
 jumbo kajalstift jumbo pencils and so on 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.669
 I also have the eye make-up today 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.920
 make-up and I have to say I think so 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.559
 it surprisingly so beautiful 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.770
 So really nice on the eye I have 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.710
 here once this color that is the 0 1 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.230
 But I don't like that 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.270
 the entire portable lid given that 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.660
 is so yes what kind of color is that 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.460
 a roll which I do with gold so 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.920
 need gold with shimmer proportion 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.379
 consistency is buttery so right 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.030
 velvety if you go in there and the 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.219
 Order is also pretty easy at the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.480
 has not curved with me now that was 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.250
 no problem now 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.930
 the pigmentation as well as me absolutely 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.960
 Okay, it's not extreme right now 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.610
 blatant but it is not too little 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.220
 So it's enough for me in any case 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.430
 for so the entire moving eyes and 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.960
 this light golden brown swimmer 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.119
 I also like it very much so I am 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.400
 which is really nice on the eye, the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.900
 second color I have is the 0 3 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.970
 last night cookies 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.270
 that is the true and i think that is 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.280
 such an eggplant tone of the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.310
 Do not shimmer as bad as these 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.549
 first color but so easy so one 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.689
 little silky fish is that 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.340
 consistency and order exactly the same 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.899
 So I find that very pleasant 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.060
 I now only in the wrinkle rhein 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.680
 given and then a bit 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.210
 blinded and that worked very well 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.130
 I also find the two colors 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.659
 harmonize very well so for once 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.100
 eye make up you can put the two on 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.870
 combine every case very nicely 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.150
 then I have one more 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.670
 slightly lighter whitish shimmering 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.440
 color into the inner eyes in the left 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.730
 Angle of eye given so a bit 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.380
 blinded and it was actually 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.240
 already make up from the eye and I am 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.710
 really just find that combination 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.270
 I actually really pretty 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.000
 In addition, I still have these two 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.960
 kajal turbo gets a pencils and me 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.570
 believe there are only the two 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.420
 colors here namely once the 0 1 lay 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.430
 with cookies saved my life so condor too 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.930
 the just mentioned eyeshadow I think 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.940
 the colors are also very similar for the 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.200
 I'm on top of the eyelashes along along 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.320
 given and so a bit like a 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.840
 eyeliner cat alone stroke behind 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.910
 drawn and that harmonizes also 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.280
 All very nice with the colors and then 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.610
 Finally, after the jumbo a brush 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.740
 02 yummy yummy then I think so 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.050
 a bit bright so earthy bit 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.610
 skeptical that is also a yes that is 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.900
 I think so could a top color 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.290
 you describe that a little bit though 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.580
 also in purple and have the 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.590
 Today I only on the lower lash line 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.240
 once given along I thought first 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.920
 because that will maybe nothing but so im 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.990
 In retrospect, that also works very cheap 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.550
 nice so everything in combination of holds 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.810
 namely the eye make-up completely 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.400
 let's see if I can find the eyes 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.850
 radiate a bit more because of it 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.410
 he also a bit brighter than and yes 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.570
 All in all, I think now as 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.770
 combination all together very much 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.989
 I wish I had this now 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.030
 Products probably not all 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.410
 bought but as one of me very glad 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.690
 that I am exactly with these products 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.060
 could put on such a lok clock now 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.800
 and yes, I really have to mean mine 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.150
 can be instant from totally convinced 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.980
 I always like to write it like that 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.840
 So today I will just sometimes 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.260
 just in daylight in the mirror 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.360
 I saw that I was coming 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.350
 to the next product namely here this 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.510
 Scheme from 3 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.100
 they already existed in such a way 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.489
 hessen series as far as I remember 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.890
 I think that was the ice cream 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.840
 or something to an ice cream and me 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.700
 think that's pretty much the same 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.090
 the same so these are just these beads 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.430
 which you meteorite a bit cool 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.290
 pearl imitation and yes I think that 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.830
 very pretty the greeks too 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.760
 So are sweet with the ball 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.380
 adapted and I also agree to the 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.730
 She then left on the cheek 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.470
 Me too, so I'm pretty 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.060
 also very happy the next one is this 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.910
 what I bought myself 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.560
 the blanched war head puts top that 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.220
 is also the only color there is 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.540
 and he is also pretty doll 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.550
 So it's a bit of a pigment 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.530
 Be careful when recording 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.090
 In any case tap with the brush 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.800
 but otherwise it is really one 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.290
 nicer I have now by a few 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.330
 Girls are the ones who find that sound 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.160
 it does not stand now that can of course 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.860
 but if you are already cool leaf 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.510
 stuffy guy is in such an olive color 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.950
 has just as I'm going to skin tone 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.800
 or I can imagine 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.750
 with really cheese white girls there 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.310
 you have to be careful 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.320
 when dosing that would be correct 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.200
 look beautiful but maybe so girls 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.920
 he turns it into a rose-colored skin tone 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.140
 to have 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.030
 maybe it is these girls rather 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.250
 less but I really like that 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.810
 nice and generally very nice 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.910
 fresh and fitting now for the 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.220
 Summertime then there were two nail polishes 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.280
 but that was in my packet 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.070
 here this phase ii 0 1 cake pops top 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.120
 So from there to pale and me 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.050
 I like the color very much 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.730
 pretty I have now here 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.430
 applied on the little finger only 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.830
 and yes, no son is sick 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.720
 orange then a petra schmidt 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.250
 Shimmer share to glass I have to 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.690
 the color did not tell me that now 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.340
 I would not have addressed myself now 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.590
 really presented for mine 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.240
 fingernails but so pad applied 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.970
 I'm so pretty , that's me 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.150
 She looks good and then here 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.010
 the color the 04 yes that is such a high 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.900
 lake with shimmer proportion 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.390
 I think that bit again 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.730
 boring so that's it again 08 15 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.740
 nail polish color, I think so now that 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.380
 you do not necessarily have to have something now 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.650
 but totally sweet is that behind it 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.920
 these stickers are on it and that with 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.390
 a muffin and cookies so cares 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.610
 then again extra on nail 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.220
 can stick on it completely sweet from sweet 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.690
 The idea 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.430
 it is probably all here again 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.140
 for free and then I have here 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.750
 still get a lip gloss namely 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.850
 also in color 01 so in short 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.070
 nail polish so all this time 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.900
 fantasy matched and 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.660
 lipgloss I think so sweet so the 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:17.230
 you do not immediately look up 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.880
 the lips but so light rosé gold 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.860
 he leaves a schema 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.230
 and yes, for such a light one 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.990
 Lipgloss times during the day I find the 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.120
 really nice so security that 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.320
 topic but maybe still looking for 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.480
 his colors and then he is on everyone 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.070
 very sweet case fits in any case very much 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.470
 good in this 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:37.200
 since you ask my products have been me 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.190
 rather think there was not yet a 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.570
 There was hand cream on the lake 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.180
 I would like that too 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.490
 bought but when I hunted the place 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.170
 unfortunately there was the hand cream already 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.140
 completely sold out 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:53.080
 that's just really cute 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.490
 fragrant such a hand cream I hold 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.169
 I liked to be taken but was like 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.880
 Unfortunately, no longer there, write me 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:59.410
 I 'd like to see you already 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.690
 I think so, too 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.070
 popular and sold out pretty quickly 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.630
 and always sleep which products 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.550
 had taken studio there which 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.220
 Find interesting and then link 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:12.190
 me and my two last videos that 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:14.260
 was the swatch party to the p2 sigrid 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.330
 I have all lipstick there 

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.910
 Sexpartner once applied and then 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.860
 nor review for Revital swimming
