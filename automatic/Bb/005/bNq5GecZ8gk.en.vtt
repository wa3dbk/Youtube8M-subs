00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
course online and well I've got a really

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.589 
course online and well I've got a really
interesting<00:00:28.529> idea<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.640> might<00:00:29.910> just<00:00:30.179> involve

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
interesting idea that might just involve

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.510 
interesting idea that might just involve
you<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.439> thought<00:00:31.679> what<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.890> would<00:00:31.980> do<00:00:32.250> is

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
you so I thought what I would do is

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.220 
you so I thought what I would do is
present<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.270> here<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.719> get<00:00:33.840> some<00:00:33.870> feedback

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
present it here and get some feedback

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.410 
present it here and get some feedback
from<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.829> about<00:00:35.040> what<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.460> think<00:00:35.610> now<00:00:36.270> doing

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
from you about what you think now doing

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.639 
from you about what you think now doing
the<00:00:36.540> Scout<00:00:36.840> stuff<00:00:37.020> has<00:00:37.290> helped<00:00:37.469> me<00:00:37.530> to

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the Scout stuff has helped me to

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.619 
the Scout stuff has helped me to
understand<00:00:38.160> there's<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.579> community<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.420> people

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
understand there's a community of people

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.060 
understand there's a community of people
out<00:00:39.930> there<00:00:39.960> who<00:00:40.260> are<00:00:40.290> interested<00:00:40.980> in

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
out there who are interested in

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.350 
out there who are interested in
exploring<00:00:41.399> some<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.730> these<00:00:41.790> concepts<00:00:42.239> I'm

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
exploring some of these concepts I'm

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.940 
exploring some of these concepts I'm
talking<00:00:42.750> about<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.440> thought<00:00:43.620> well<00:00:43.770> why

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
talking about so I thought well why

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.650 
talking about so I thought well why
don't<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.280> try<00:00:44.340> taking<00:00:44.940> advantage<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.510> that

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
don't I try taking advantage of that

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.860 
don't I try taking advantage of that
here's<00:00:46.469> my<00:00:46.559> idea<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.969> do<00:00:48.180> courses<00:00:48.690> here<00:00:48.840> at

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
here's my idea we do courses here at

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.360 
here's my idea we do courses here at
Syracuse<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.440> summer<00:00:49.680> where<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.039> explore

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
Syracuse in the summer where we explore

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.950 
Syracuse in the summer where we explore
different<00:00:50.670> topics<00:00:51.210> where<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.449> do<00:00:51.570> some<00:00:51.750> things

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
different topics where we do some things

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.260 
different topics where we do some things
that<00:00:52.020> are<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.230> bit<00:00:52.530> more<00:00:53.010> unusual<00:00:53.670> things<00:00:54.120> that

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
that are a bit more unusual things that

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.330 
that are a bit more unusual things that
are<00:00:54.480> more<00:00:55.050> tied<00:00:55.289> into<00:00:55.500> our<00:00:55.710> research<00:00:56.010> areas

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
are more tied into our research areas

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.889 
are more tied into our research areas
and<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.579> I'm<00:00:56.699> talking<00:00:57.059> about<00:00:57.120> doing<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.660> course

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
and so I'm talking about doing it course

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.290 
and so I'm talking about doing it course
this<00:00:58.109> summer<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.559> games<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.399> libraries<00:00:59.820> now

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
this summer on games and libraries now

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.270 
this summer on games and libraries now
it<00:01:01.260> wouldn't<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.590> traditional<00:01:01.800> course

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
it wouldn't be a traditional course

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.770 
it wouldn't be a traditional course
two-thirds<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.090> our<00:01:03.210> students<00:01:03.570> are<00:01:03.660> actually

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
two-thirds of our students are actually

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.119 
two-thirds of our students are actually
online<00:01:04.080> students<00:01:04.619> which<00:01:04.739> means<00:01:04.949> they<00:01:05.070> do

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
online students which means they do

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.920 
online students which means they do
they're<00:01:05.369> all<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> courses<00:01:06.030> through<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
they're all of the courses through a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.929 
they're all of the courses through a
discussion<00:01:07.590> board<00:01:07.860> type<00:01:08.100> forum<00:01:08.580> through<00:01:08.880> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
discussion board type forum through a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.240 
discussion board type forum through a
program<00:01:09.390> known<00:01:09.780> as<00:01:09.810> blackboard<00:01:10.380> where<00:01:11.130> we

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
program known as blackboard where we

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.210 
program known as blackboard where we
talk<00:01:11.460> about<00:01:11.520> things<00:01:12.000> online<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:13.220> while

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
talk about things online and while

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.560 
talk about things online and while
that's<00:01:14.369> all<00:01:14.640> well<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:14.850> good<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.299> helps<00:01:15.509> to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
that's all well and good and it helps to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.609 
that's all well and good and it helps to
reach<00:01:15.689> out<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.049> students<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.439> really

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
reach out to the students it really

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.719 
reach out to the students it really
doesn't<00:01:16.830> get<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> word<00:01:17.159> out<00:01:17.340> about<00:01:17.400> what

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
doesn't get the word out about what

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.789 
doesn't get the word out about what
we're<00:01:17.880> doing<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.330> here's<00:01:18.540> my<00:01:18.630> idea<00:01:19.110> I'm

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
we're doing so here's my idea I'm

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.740 
we're doing so here's my idea I'm
thinking<00:01:20.220> about<00:01:20.610> teaching<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.360> entire

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
thinking about teaching this entire

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.780 
thinking about teaching this entire
course<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.290> one<00:01:22.470> credit<00:01:22.860> games<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.340> libraries

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
course of one credit games in libraries

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.690 
course of one credit games in libraries
course<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.840> summer<00:01:25.189> right<00:01:26.189> here<00:01:26.400> through

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
course this summer right here through

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.090 
course this summer right here through
YouTube<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.840> idea<00:01:28.140> would<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:29.070> would

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
YouTube the idea would be that it would

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.520 
YouTube the idea would be that it would
be<00:01:29.310> through<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> month<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.909> june<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.470> on<00:01:31.470> a

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
be through the month of june and on a

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
how this would all work I know that

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.770 
how this would all work I know that
YouTube<00:02:56.519> has<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.880> special<00:02:57.299> channels<00:02:57.630> for

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
YouTube has a special channels for

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.720 
YouTube has a special channels for
universities<00:02:58.319> I'd<00:02:58.799> like<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.069> tie<00:02:59.250> into<00:02:59.459> that

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
universities I'd like to tie into that

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.880 
universities I'd like to tie into that
but<00:02:59.970> that's<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.510> basic<00:03:00.630> idea<00:03:00.930> I'd<00:03:01.440> lecture

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
but that's the basic idea I'd lecture

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.860 
but that's the basic idea I'd lecture
every<00:03:02.280> day<00:03:02.519> or<00:03:02.700> every<00:03:02.730> other<00:03:02.910> day<00:03:03.090> right<00:03:03.660> here

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
every day or every other day right here

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.780 
every day or every other day right here
on<00:03:03.989> YouTube<00:03:04.350> students<00:03:04.830> would<00:03:04.980> respond<00:03:05.400> but

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
on YouTube students would respond but

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.309 
on YouTube students would respond but
then<00:03:05.970> anyone<00:03:06.330> else<00:03:06.540> that's<00:03:06.690> watching<00:03:06.870> could

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
then anyone else that's watching could

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.259 
then anyone else that's watching could
join<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.830> class<00:03:08.010> as<00:03:08.250> well<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.970> what<00:03:09.120> do<00:03:09.180> you
