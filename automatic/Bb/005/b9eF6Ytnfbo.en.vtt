00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.389 

so<00:00:00.840> for<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.260> animation<00:00:01.709> I<00:00:01.770> first<00:00:02.040> have<00:00:02.220> all

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
so for the animation I first have all

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.960 
so for the animation I first have all
set<00:00:02.669> my<00:00:02.850> settings<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.990> 25<00:00:04.980> frames<00:00:05.339> per<00:00:05.460> second

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
set my settings to 25 frames per second

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.790 
set my settings to 25 frames per second
and<00:00:06.150> then<00:00:06.930> I'll<00:00:07.319> set<00:00:07.980> my<00:00:08.360> length<00:00:09.620> let's<00:00:10.620> say

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
and then I'll set my length let's say

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.200 
and then I'll set my length let's say
about<00:00:11.010> 200<00:00:11.460> frames<00:00:13.190> and<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.700> just<00:00:14.940> could<00:00:15.179> you

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
about 200 frames and I just could you

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.970 
about 200 frames and I just could you
hide<00:00:15.480> my<00:00:15.690> wall<00:00:16.020> there<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:18.170> then<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.439> create<00:00:20.430> a

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
hide my wall there and then I create a

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.529 
hide my wall there and then I create a
ball

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
ball

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.310 
ball
holy<00:00:24.539> sphere<00:00:25.880> make<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> bit<00:00:27.330> bigger<00:00:27.539> could

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
holy sphere make it a bit bigger could

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.680 
holy sphere make it a bit bigger could
you<00:00:28.470> look<00:00:28.830> into<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.250> front<00:00:29.580> view<00:00:32.329> so<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.360> just

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
you look into the front view so I just

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.750 
you look into the front view so I just
get<00:00:33.870> an<00:00:33.989> estimate<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.590> how<00:00:34.800> big<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.430> ball

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
get an estimate on how big the ball

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.799 
get an estimate on how big the ball
should<00:00:36.059> be<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.899> real<00:00:37.170> world<00:00:38.809> probably

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
should be in a real world probably

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.610 
should be in a real world probably
something<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:41.420> this<00:00:44.539> and<00:00:45.539> then<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.140> go<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
something like this and then I go to the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.790 
something like this and then I go to the
side<00:00:46.829> view<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:49.850> animate<00:00:50.850> my<00:00:51.059> ball<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:52.230> this

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
side view to animate my ball so this

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.420 
side view to animate my ball so this
should<00:00:53.100> be<00:00:53.129> second<00:00:53.760> floor<00:00:54.770> so<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.129> kids

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
should be second floor so the kids

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.950 
should be second floor so the kids
probably<00:00:56.640> will<00:00:56.969> play<00:00:57.210> down<00:00:57.449> here<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
probably will play down here and the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.130 
probably will play down here and the
ball<00:00:58.140> would<00:00:58.350> fly<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.680> something<00:00:59.640> like<00:00:59.870> this<00:01:00.870> I

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
ball would fly in something like this I

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.049 
ball would fly in something like this I
just<00:01:01.289> make<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.920> probably<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> more<00:01:02.940> or<00:01:03.030> less

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
just make it probably a more or less

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.359 
just make it probably a more or less
linear<00:01:03.420> animation<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.500> there's<00:01:04.680> nothing<00:01:05.070> too

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
linear animation so there's nothing too

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.390 
linear animation so there's nothing too
fancy<00:01:05.580> about<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.799> start<00:01:07.799> at<00:01:08.159> around<00:01:08.479> 50

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
fancy about that I start at around 50

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.560 
fancy about that I start at around 50
because<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.580> want<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.939> make<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.119> camera

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
because I want you to make a camera

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.560 
because I want you to make a camera
movement<00:01:12.990> before<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.250> press<00:01:14.580> shift<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.150> W

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
movement before so I press shift and W

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.010 
movement before so I press shift and W
for<00:01:16.759> translation<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.880> shift<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.420> E<00:01:18.659> for

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
for translation and shift and E for

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.289 
for translation and shift and E for
rotation<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.400> see<00:01:20.610> my<00:01:20.729> child<00:01:20.970> boxed

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
rotation so you can see my child boxed

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.270 
rotation so you can see my child boxed
IM<00:01:21.540> kida<00:01:22.159> then<00:01:23.159> i<00:01:23.310> go<00:01:23.520> let's<00:01:24.119> say<00:01:24.860> 20<00:01:25.860> frames

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.550 

forward<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.549> move<00:01:30.390> my<00:01:30.600> ball<00:01:30.810> inside<00:01:31.350> my

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
forward and move my ball inside my

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.200 
forward and move my ball inside my
window<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.860> I<00:01:34.860> just<00:01:35.340> any<00:01:35.850> sound

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
window like so and I just any sound

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.810 
window like so and I just any sound
where<00:01:36.420> I'm<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.630> values<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.290> just<00:01:37.650> made<00:01:38.400> mom

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
where I'm in values I just made mom

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.160 
where I'm in values I just made mom
nothing<00:01:39.600> special

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
nothing special

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.620 
nothing special
and<00:01:41.960> then<00:01:42.960> at<00:01:43.680> frame<00:01:44.009> 70<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.610> press<00:01:44.939> again<00:01:45.240> shift

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
and then at frame 70 I press again shift

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.399 
and then at frame 70 I press again shift
W<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.560> E<00:01:46.860> then<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.759> open<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.329> my<00:01:49.159> graph<00:01:50.159> editor

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
W and E then I open up my graph editor

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.380 
W and E then I open up my graph editor
and<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.369> animation<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:53.970> taking

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and you can see the animation is taking

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.249 
and you can see the animation is taking
place<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:55.409> if<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.619> know<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.799> scrub<00:01:56.159> through<00:01:57.259> you

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
place so if I know I scrub through you

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.179 
place so if I know I scrub through you
can<00:01:58.500> see<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.979> ball<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.340> flying<00:02:00.890> now<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:01.950> have

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
can see the ball is flying now you have

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.280 
can see the ball is flying now you have
to<00:02:02.310> see<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.240> make<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> player<00:02:03.750> blossom

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
to see you have to make a player blossom

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.059 
to see you have to make a player blossom
and<00:02:04.560> see<00:02:05.009> if<00:02:05.219> it's<00:02:05.430> more<00:02:06.119> or<00:02:06.270> less<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.719> realistic

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
and see if it's more or less a realistic

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:15.800 
and see if it's more or less a realistic
speed<00:02:09.030> probably<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:09.899> way<00:02:10.080> too<00:02:10.140> fast<00:02:14.629> this<00:02:15.629> is

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
speed probably it's way too fast this is

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.410 
speed probably it's way too fast this is
how<00:02:15.989> my<00:02:16.260> speed<00:02:16.829> looks<00:02:17.099> like<00:02:19.970> that's<00:02:20.970> probably

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
how my speed looks like that's probably

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:29.180 
how my speed looks like that's probably
okay<00:02:26.299> it<00:02:27.299> looks<00:02:27.569> probably<00:02:27.780> okay<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.829> you<00:02:28.890> know

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
okay it looks probably okay so you know

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.589 
okay it looks probably okay so you know
you<00:02:29.250> think<00:02:29.579> the<00:02:29.700> animation<00:02:30.120> looks<00:02:30.269> pretty

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
you think the animation looks pretty

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.319 
you think the animation looks pretty
cheesy<00:02:31.049> but<00:02:31.349> when<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.190> ball<00:02:32.519> hits<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:33.030> glass

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
cheesy but when the ball hits the glass

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.110 
cheesy but when the ball hits the glass
I<00:02:33.750> let<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.620> physics<00:02:35.310> take<00:02:35.519> over<00:02:35.549> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
I let the physics take over the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.630 
I let the physics take over the
animation<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.019> ball<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.500> often<00:02:38.099> it's

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
animation of the ball so often it's

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.599 
animation of the ball so often it's
hitting<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.420> window<00:02:39.900> move<00:02:40.799> accordingly<00:02:41.340> like

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
hitting the window move accordingly like

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.420 
hitting the window move accordingly like
with<00:02:41.909> gravity<00:02:42.709> friction<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:43.829> all<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.129> stuff

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
with gravity friction and all that stuff

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.789 
with gravity friction and all that stuff
that's<00:02:44.940> first<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.659> all<00:02:45.870> everything<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.560> did<00:02:46.769> for

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
that's first of all everything I did for

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.520
