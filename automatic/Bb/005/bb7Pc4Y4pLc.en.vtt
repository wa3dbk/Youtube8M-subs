 welcome to grandma's recipes today 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.420
 prepare the stewed chicory 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:12.690
 ingredients are drained chicory 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.830
 and cut cherry tomatoes into pieces 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.300
 cut in half basil leaves and one 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.580
 white onion cut into thick slices 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.350
 as well as extra virgin olive oil e 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.630
 salt 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:32.700
 we pour the extra virgin olive oil in 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:40.610
 a pot of clay and a name 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:45.690
 immediately cut the onion and leave it 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.940
 wither slightly once the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.579
 onions have taken a slight color 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.059
 we are slightly withered we join the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.059
 catalonia 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.170
 the tomatoes 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.379
 we organize like a salt 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.379
 the tomatoes and catalonia 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:22.259
 add the chopped basil leaves 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:25.020
 then we roughly mix everything 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.470
 we cover with the lid we lower the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.869
 flame and let it cook slowly 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.740
 during cooking we check each 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.170
 much and we mix to verify that there 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.470
 be thorough enough to cook in 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:48.240
 so that catalonia does not dry out 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:51.539
 too after 30 minutes of cooking the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.429
 our chicory is ready 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.310
 during cooking there was no need 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:02:00.030
 to add water as the vegetables 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.799
 threw it out of itself at this point 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.490
 we just have to serve ours 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.490
 side dish 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.390
 our dish is ready now not there 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.300

 enjoy it we can accompany it with 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.210
 fish meat or even simple eggs
