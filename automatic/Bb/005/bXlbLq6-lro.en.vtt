before is where do I start you could do
the<00:01:24.240> hair<00:01:24.390> first<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:25.200> we're<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.710> try<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the hair first but we're going to try to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.160 
the hair first but we're going to try to
minimize<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.880> impact<00:01:26.909> from<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.600> overspray

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.760 
at this stage all I'm doing is adding
shape<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.400> dimension<00:02:35.239> I<00:02:35.390> do<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:35.959> by<00:02:36.380> looking

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
shape and dimension I do this by looking

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.820 
shape and dimension I do this by looking
closely<00:02:37.099> at<00:02:37.760> sections<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.989> an<00:02:39.170> image<00:02:39.560> and

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
closely at sections of an image and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.430 
closely at sections of an image and
deciding<00:02:40.550> what<00:02:40.940> airbrush<00:02:41.569> effect<00:02:42.080> I'm<00:02:42.380> going

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
deciding what airbrush effect I'm going

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.760 
deciding what airbrush effect I'm going
to<00:02:43.040> use<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.970> create<00:02:44.360> that<00:02:44.690> little<00:02:45.170> section<00:02:45.410> is

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
to use to create that little section is

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.729 
to use to create that little section is
it<00:02:46.069> one<00:02:46.280> effect<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.940> it<00:02:47.450> two<00:02:47.630> effects<00:02:48.080> is<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.650> a

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
it one effect is it two effects is it a

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.010 
it one effect is it two effects is it a
group<00:02:49.100> of<00:02:49.340> effects<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:50.239> doesn't<00:02:50.840> look<00:02:50.989> like

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
group of effects it doesn't look like

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.410 
group of effects it doesn't look like
one<00:02:51.470> little<00:02:51.650> line<00:02:52.069> that<00:02:52.640> I<00:02:52.760> can<00:02:52.940> use<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.270> create

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
one little line that I can use to create

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.930 
one little line that I can use to create
it<00:02:53.720> is<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.230> line<00:02:54.440> with<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:54.890> blend<00:02:55.310> or<00:02:55.670> perhaps

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
it is it a line with a blend or perhaps

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.140 
it is it a line with a blend or perhaps
a<00:02:56.390> fave<00:02:56.959> is<00:02:57.350> it<00:02:57.530> two<00:02:57.860> lines<00:02:58.130> blending<00:02:59.000> in

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
a fave is it two lines blending in

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.030 
a fave is it two lines blending in

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
towards each other you have to look

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.309 
towards each other you have to look
closely<00:03:01.459> at<00:03:01.730> these<00:03:02.120> sections<00:03:02.780> of<00:03:02.959> an<00:03:03.050> image

try to break down how you're going to

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.810 
try to break down how you're going to
create<00:03:05.630> that<00:03:05.959> using<00:03:06.680> your<00:03:06.830> airbrush
