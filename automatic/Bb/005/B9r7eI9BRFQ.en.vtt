00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.730

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.840
 met so this is a whole 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.490
 difficult series but of course hardcore 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.260

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.249
 man so i need the 40 kills in all 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.140
 were allowed to find nice series idea is just 

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:46.030
 a kind of intro that thick you see then 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.159
 of course there stood there for a moment 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.380
 I just 6 out of 1000 likes a new one 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.630
 episode I'm going to upload a lot is you 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.189
 want to see more simply do not forget him 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.840
 to like that is a nice the kind of man 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.130
 you also don't see when the smock is over 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.229
 maybe think or forget say you see 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.149
 u when got the kill so if you want 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.950
 see when I make a keel then 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.819
 you should see the kill in the top right corner 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.460
 keeping an eye there is of course 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.080
 just in when a cue market 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.160
 further and see the seed nowhere 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.690
 nowhere 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.850
 so only in the key or looks can you 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.620
 get to see it and the holy shit that 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.000
 was a nice double keel cuff bowl 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.310
 is also immediately broken as beautiful of course 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.360
 they do n't have anything for you anymore 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.360
 so tension as well here 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.260
 I had him tell him about something true 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.030
 I'll tell when I have a kill 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.160
 you do n't have to get married either 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.990
 I had him through the fence there 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.400
 I also that maybe what did that 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.420
 just say sir i get the kills on 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.280
 not pay attention to your purchase and 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.020
 cats are sitting again , they don't like it 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.690

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.090
 We sit in the hell of the 40 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.890

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.020
 I can I can I could not do hard 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.020

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.530
 ghetto mouth but everyone is stuck with that 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.790
 to your services cam of course here 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.750
 so yes that just won't work if 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.310

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.459
 Study nobody oh no I thought 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.780
 I can also sit that every Christmas bauble 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.040
 because I don't want to spend the day 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.690
 by dying of course because it 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.100

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.810

 I who meet will you culture the film 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.390

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.489
 schiedam bit as fun to harpoon 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.900

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.250

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.910

 going to walk with a straw, I squeeze 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.220
 think it's really funny to see me and 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.140
 get to that very often in hardcore 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.669
 but we are going to actually enjoy it 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.300
 pretty good how many times we are 21 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.199

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.569
 hardcore 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:59.770
 if you are lifted and someone is sitting 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.479

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.099

 sit behind my desk if it's there 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.610
 not at all if we have his own span 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.409
 I just had 5 kills there too 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.490

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.719
 so i just go very well you see it 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:09.069

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:10.690
 lots of kills and they just run off and on 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:12.729
