farming<00:00:19.560> base<00:00:19.680> layout<00:00:20.009> so<00:00:20.700> let's<00:00:20.880> start<00:00:21.119> off

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
farming base layout so let's start off

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.790 
farming base layout so let's start off
with<00:00:21.240> what<00:00:21.509> I<00:00:21.539> like<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.439> like<00:00:22.619> how<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
with what I like so I like how the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.859 
with what I like so I like how the
mortars<00:00:23.189> are<00:00:23.460> triangulated<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.449> how<00:00:24.689> they're

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
mortars are triangulated and how they're

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.170 
mortars are triangulated and how they're
not<00:00:25.050> all<00:00:25.259> in<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.529> same<00:00:25.710> compartment<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.489> would

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
not all in the same compartment it would

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.209 
not all in the same compartment it would
get<00:00:27.329> pretty<00:00:27.480> risky<00:00:28.050> if<00:00:28.349> someone<00:00:28.800> breaks<00:00:28.980> into

00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:29.219 
get pretty risky if someone breaks into

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:31.519 
get pretty risky if someone breaks into
the<00:00:29.399> middle<00:00:29.669> of<00:00:29.759> your<00:00:29.910> bass<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.450> drops<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.320> rage

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
the middle of your bass and drops a rage

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.080 
the middle of your bass and drops a rage
spell<00:00:31.860> and<00:00:32.009> takes<00:00:32.189> out<00:00:32.340> all<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.550> your<00:00:32.730> mortars

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
spell and takes out all of your mortars

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.630 
spell and takes out all of your mortars
at<00:00:33.270> once<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.620> clan<00:00:34.860> castle<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.370> also

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
at once so the clan castle is also

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.209 
at once so the clan castle is also
centralized<00:00:36.270> dark<00:00:37.110> elixir<00:00:37.289> storage<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.950> also

the dark elixir storage and you can
probably<00:00:44.129> guess<00:00:44.579> where<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> giant<00:00:45.300> bombs<00:00:45.480> are

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.290 
probably guess where the giant bombs are
there<00:00:46.079> under<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.920> mortars<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:47.579> don't<00:00:48.120> tell

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
there under the mortars but don't tell

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.660 
there under the mortars but don't tell
anybody<00:00:48.569> once<00:00:49.499> you<00:00:49.649> get<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.949> barbarian<00:00:50.460> king

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
anybody once you get the barbarian king

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.130 
anybody once you get the barbarian king
though<00:00:50.819> i<00:00:50.999> would<00:00:51.179> put<00:00:51.359> them<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.659> between<00:00:52.019> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
though i would put them in between the

though i would put them in between the
two<00:00:52.319> cannons<00:00:52.800> at<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.069> top<00:00:53.309> or<00:00:53.550> put<00:00:54.239> them<00:00:54.300> in

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
two cannons at the top or put them in

the same layer as the dark elixir
storage<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.909> then<00:00:57.329> proceed<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.749> move<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
storage and then proceed to move the

Tesla's and giant bombs around in terms
of<00:01:00.629> strategy<00:01:00.870> definitely<00:01:01.829> recommend<00:01:02.219> farming

gold and elixir related now there will
be<00:01:09.090> plenty<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.510> time<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.049> trophy<00:01:10.380> push

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.480 
later on when you hit higher townhall
levels<00:01:12.690> but<00:01:13.260> looking<00:01:13.620> at<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.830> base<00:01:14.070> now<00:01:14.280> from

levels but looking at this base now from

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.430 
levels but looking at this base now from
a<00:01:14.580> farming<00:01:14.970> perspective<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.320> think

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
a farming perspective you have to think

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.020 
a farming perspective you have to think
about<00:01:16.590> what<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> southern<00:01:17.280> teaser<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.730> hoping

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
about what a southern teaser is hoping

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.090 
about what a southern teaser is hoping
to<00:01:18.150> achieve<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:19.110> attackers<00:01:19.590> who<00:01:19.740> want<00:01:19.980> your

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
to achieve so attackers who want your

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.770 
to achieve so attackers who want your
resources<00:01:20.610> might<00:01:20.910> either<00:01:21.150> come<00:01:21.480> from<00:01:21.690> the

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
to take one set of two storages and then

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.290 
to take one set of two storages and then
leave<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.010> because<00:01:38.160> an<00:01:38.430> attacker<00:01:38.730> will<00:01:39.060> want

leave so because an attacker will want

leave so because an attacker will want

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
might skip this base all together now

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.500

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
top but once the Town Hall is finished

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.050 
top but once the Town Hall is finished
we'll<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.980> either<00:01:50.100> throw<00:01:50.610> more<00:01:50.820> troops

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
we'll have to either throw more troops

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.360 
we'll have to either throw more troops
on<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.300> top<00:01:51.570> side<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.050> base<00:01:52.260> although<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
on the top side of the base although the

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.310 
on the top side of the base although the
top<00:01:53.580> side<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.060> stacked<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.540> defenses<00:01:55.170> so

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
top side is stacked with defenses so

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.180 
top side is stacked with defenses so
he'll<00:01:55.470> definitely<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> tough<00:01:56.160> time

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
he'll definitely have a tough time

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.640 
he'll definitely have a tough time
getting<00:01:56.640> through<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.060> top<00:01:57.270> or<00:01:57.540> he'll<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.350> to

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
getting through the top or he'll have to

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.350 
getting through the top or he'll have to
split<00:01:58.980> his<00:01:59.130> forces<00:01:59.400> and<00:01:59.850> attack<00:01:59.910> from<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
split his forces and attack from the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.780 
split his forces and attack from the
bottom<00:02:00.750> or<00:02:00.930> from<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.650> sides<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.580> then<00:02:02.700> again

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
bottom or from the sides but then again

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.000 
bottom or from the sides but then again
if<00:02:02.970> he<00:02:03.060> does<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.570> he<00:02:04.080> won't<00:02:04.290> be<00:02:04.410> able<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.770> use

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
if he does that he won't be able to use

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.399 
if he does that he won't be able to use
a<00:02:05.040> full<00:02:05.580> army<00:02:06.180> because<00:02:06.480> he'll<00:02:06.720> have<00:02:06.840> used<00:02:07.170> some

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
a full army because he'll have used some

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.410 
a full army because he'll have used some
troops<00:02:07.650> on<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:07.950> top<00:02:08.159> already<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.300> i<00:02:09.330> think

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
troops on the top already so i think

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.059 
troops on the top already so i think
this<00:02:09.629> base<00:02:09.869> achieves<00:02:10.319> what<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.679> sets<00:02:10.890> out<00:02:11.009> to

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
this base achieves what it sets out to

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.070 
this base achieves what it sets out to
do<00:02:11.400> which<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.000> protect<00:02:12.510> your<00:02:12.569> resources

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
do which is protect your resources

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.500 
do which is protect your resources
fairly<00:02:13.500> well<00:02:13.980> because<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.849> farming<00:02:15.360> base

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
fairly well because it is a farming base

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.570 
fairly well because it is a farming base
now<00:02:16.140> if<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.290> were<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.530> make<00:02:16.680> any<00:02:16.890> sort<00:02:17.159> of<00:02:17.280> change

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
now if I were to make any sort of change

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.460 
now if I were to make any sort of change
I<00:02:17.760> would<00:02:17.819> probably<00:02:18.090> take<00:02:18.569> one<00:02:18.900> storage<00:02:19.230> from

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
I would probably take one storage from

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.230 
I would probably take one storage from
each<00:02:19.620> side<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.220> put<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.819> in<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.060> middle

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
each side and put it in the middle
