you<00:02:16.360> see<00:02:16.569> a<00:02:16.630> loaded<00:02:17.020> with<00:02:17.140> nitrogen<00:02:17.500> not<00:02:18.310> a

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
you see a loaded with nitrogen not a

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.100 
you see a loaded with nitrogen not a
whole<00:02:18.610> lot<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.790> phosphate<00:02:19.390> in<00:02:19.569> there<00:02:19.780> but

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
whole lot of phosphate in there but

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.460 
whole lot of phosphate in there but
that's<00:02:20.230> better<00:02:20.500> than<00:02:20.709> some<00:02:20.950> I've<00:02:21.130> seen

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
that's better than some I've seen

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.740 
that's better than some I've seen
this<00:02:23.370> one<00:02:23.550> right<00:02:23.700> here<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:25.260> state<00:02:25.560> green

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
this one right here is the state green

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.830 
this one right here is the state green
version<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.170> moisture<00:02:28.620> max<00:02:28.830> it's<00:02:29.400> 14<00:02:30.120> 11<00:02:30.510> 8

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
version of the moisture max it's 14 11 8

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.790 
version of the moisture max it's 14 11 8
so<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.200> see<00:02:31.440> it's<00:02:31.620> got<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.800> less<00:02:32.760> nitrogen<00:02:33.060> and

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
so you see it's got a less nitrogen and

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.160 
so you see it's got a less nitrogen and
more<00:02:34.800> phosphate<00:02:35.400> than<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.630> miracle-gro

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170

diddly-squat that one right there is
almost<00:03:08.070> 0<00:03:08.870> phosphates<00:03:09.870> in<00:03:10.050> this<00:03:10.230> thing<00:03:10.470> so

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
almost 0 phosphates in this thing so

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.050 
almost 0 phosphates in this thing so
that<00:03:10.890> means<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.190> got<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.459> go<00:03:11.550> back<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:11.910> add

nutrient levels and that's going to

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.680

put in it ain't exactly perfect had to

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.210 
put in it ain't exactly perfect had to
step<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.810> down<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:40.019> few<00:03:40.260> times<00:03:40.470> coming<00:03:40.950> down<00:03:41.100> the

look like folks again that looks pretty

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.730 
look like folks again that looks pretty
good<00:05:03.250> then<00:05:03.960> not<00:05:04.960> bad<00:05:05.169> at<00:05:05.350> all

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
good then not bad at all

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.290 
good then not bad at all
the<00:05:06.220> reason<00:05:06.520> I<00:05:06.580> put<00:05:06.820> that<00:05:07.169> colored<00:05:08.169> mulch<00:05:08.320> down

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
the reason I put that colored mulch down

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.300 
the reason I put that colored mulch down
colors<00:05:10.300> County<00:05:10.600> relevant<00:05:11.050> but<00:05:11.710> to<00:05:11.979> keep<00:05:12.190> the

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
colors County relevant but to keep the

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.879 
colors County relevant but to keep the
dust<00:05:12.550> down<00:05:12.669> in<00:05:12.970> here<00:05:13.180> this<00:05:13.479> red<00:05:13.750> clay<00:05:14.110> when

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
dust down in here this red clay when

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.879 
dust down in here this red clay when
it's<00:05:15.070> wet<00:05:15.310> its<00:05:15.910> slick<00:05:16.360> its<00:05:16.690> sticky

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
it's wet its slick its sticky

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.690 
it's wet its slick its sticky
makes<00:05:18.280> a<00:05:18.400> mess<00:05:18.639> when<00:05:19.060> it's<00:05:19.240> dry<00:05:19.479> it's<00:05:20.229> bone-dry

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
makes a mess when it's dry it's bone-dry

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.150 
makes a mess when it's dry it's bone-dry
dusty<00:05:21.700> so<00:05:22.360> it<00:05:22.870> doesn't<00:05:23.350> stay<00:05:23.530> what<00:05:23.800> I<00:05:23.830> call

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
dusty so it doesn't stay what I call

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.159 
dusty so it doesn't stay what I call
like<00:05:24.460> in<00:05:24.669> a<00:05:24.760> friendly<00:05:25.150> State<00:05:25.479> very<00:05:25.720> long<00:05:25.990> at

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
like in a friendly State very long at

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:27.960 
like in a friendly State very long at
all<00:05:26.289> so<00:05:26.590> the<00:05:26.919> best<00:05:27.070> thing<00:05:27.310> to<00:05:27.340> do<00:05:27.490> is<00:05:27.610> cover<00:05:27.880> it

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
all so the best thing to do is cover it

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.300 
all so the best thing to do is cover it
up<00:05:28.150> and<00:05:28.330> put<00:05:28.930> this<00:05:29.050> mulch<00:05:29.380> on<00:05:29.620> it<00:05:29.800> and<00:05:30.010> maybe

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
up and put this mulch on it and maybe
