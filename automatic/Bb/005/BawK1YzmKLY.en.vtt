these little plastic sleeves so how you

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.900 
these little plastic sleeves so how you
rig<00:01:30.849> this<00:01:31.030> indicator<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:33.220> take<00:01:33.399> the<00:01:33.550> section

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
rig this indicator to take the section

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.529 
rig this indicator to take the section
in<00:01:33.970> your<00:01:34.000> leader<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:34.450> want<00:01:34.599> to<00:01:34.720> put<00:01:34.869> it<00:01:34.959> on<00:01:35.080> and

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
tubing off the tool and that will form a

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.380 
tubing off the tool and that will form a
little<00:01:51.190> loop<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:51.670> that's<00:01:51.910> where<00:01:52.149> we're<00:01:52.270> going

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
little loop and that's where we're going

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.380 
little loop and that's where we're going
to<00:01:52.450> put<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.810> wool

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.710

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
this and you just treat this with

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.900 
this and you just treat this with
whatever<00:03:13.540> float<00:03:13.960> and<00:03:14.110> you<00:03:14.140> like<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:15.670> great
