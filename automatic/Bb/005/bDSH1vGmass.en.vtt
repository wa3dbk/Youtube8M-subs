00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.670
 I will bring us recommended jeff 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.290
 some will be that I have a lot of mania 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.540
 others that have left me bad are 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.310
 I think that is the case of one of the 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.020
 here but that has only happened to me with that 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.610
 and others because in my case I have not gone 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.529
 ok but to other people yes but good 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.119
 that I would not buy them again 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.270
 first of what I'm going to talk about is 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.509
 the lemon shampoo of the brand desert 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.160
 essence that to me that is supposed to be a 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.829
 shampoo for oily hair and I do not 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.050
 I left clean more days and also I did not 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.950
 It left for a lot of brightness and to use it very 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.950
 I continually 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.880
 did something on the scalp that I 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.200
 he left it as more sensitive because now 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.570
 I have stopped using it to finish it and 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.070
 it came out in finished products and I know 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.450
 has removed the sensitivity that had 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.270
 the head was like a kind of 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.980
 very mild itching as well as sensitive one 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.930
 rare thing then that shampoo does not 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.150
 It will use even fall in front 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.070
 that he has gone quite well another little thing 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.130
 I tell you that I do not know if it will be wrong 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.330
 state is this of nutra neil and is that I 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.060
 I miss you there I have a product 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.820
 so bad it came completely closed with 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.010
 its 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.010
 the one that has bitten 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.490
 ok I just threw it over me 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.810
 normal that I have the pajama pants 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.360
 it was completely closed but this 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.150
 rays fly I'll shoot right now 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.160
 the trash this is like a cream I think 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.080
 that when he came to me he was not so affectionate 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.290
 It has a texture like natural yogurt 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.900
 smoothie 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.490
 and it smells really bad besides it smells very 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.610
 badly I used it to take away the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.070
 cuticles back because that's nike 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.440
 but I do not know what good better in the towards 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.660
 down 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.160
 and I did not like it leaves a very bad smell 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.990
 in the nails and it does not have the effect of 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.090
 Remove the cuticles from hydrating the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.380
 nothing, I think it's a product that 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.880
 It comes in disrepair because there are girls 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.400
 they have it and they say they do not 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.960
 it smells bad and they do very well so 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.760
 nothing I will not buy again because 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.350
 the other cuticles created that 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.150
 favorite service do not know when 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.770
 I will upload if before or after this the 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.260
 another cuticle product that I have to 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.510
 is reading favorites is going great and I'm not going 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.820
 to repeat with this or to try to see 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.950
 if it was in poor condition I'm not going to 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.240
 repeat because I'm doing well otherwise 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.430
 with which I will not repeat this has 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.440
 I left in a game recently I do not know 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.120
 what I will do is put this here 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.900
 that is a water, because nothing is a water of 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:32.280
 of him is make up nissan set and he has aloe 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.020
 You will see from vitamin to series and cucumber 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.940
 it's supposed to seal the 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.700
 makeup to refresh the skin to 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.260
 moisturize it melody and I gave it two 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.570
 times to seal the makeup and me 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.220
 I smell bad talking and soon and what 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.710
 I feel so much to ass 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.050
 I do not know how to tell what it smells smells 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.710
 unpleasant 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.710
 you have 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.569
 is that there is a smell like wet cardboard 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.430
 one thing 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.780
 I do not like the pain goes away 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.799
 right away, but this is giving it to you in the 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.379
 face for me is a very 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.569
 unpleasant I think I 'm going to empty it and 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.859
 I do not know how much it cost three dollars can 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.139
 I am going to leave them in link the belt 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.519
 information but I think I'm going to 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.079
 empty because the pot is quite 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:25.379
 I'm going to fill it with something else 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:25.379
 but of course 360 ​​milliliters that do not 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.360
 but the other day 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.959
 let's see what face was being 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.580
 give it to me because I do not know if I do 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.170
 moisturize and nothing because I 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.300
 given only twice and I'm not going to give it 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.980
 more the ones that have it and you will tell me to see 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.740
 if you fly if I'm very disgusting 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.340
 for odors the truth is that it is not 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.500
 a plague there that goes away right away and 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.020
 some may hurt nothing because 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.140
 the smell is very slight but to me it is 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.850
 very slight the smell that kind of smell does not 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.860
 I support something else that does not come back to 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:03.140
 buy is this lip and this is the skin 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.140
 specifically this tone because there's a week 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:15.850
 this lipstick in particular the sociable tone 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:19.090
 I have another awful gypsy I 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.560
 love hard enough 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.860
 pimenta and good because education is 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.650
 so awesome 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.430
 but this one in particular has particles 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.990
 bright the color is not bad and you see 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.639
 the pigmentation is quite good but 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.840
 It has shiny particles that I do not know 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.910
 if you are going to appreciate them there 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.030
 and what happened the other day that he told me and 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.530
 then I wanted to remove it 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.540
 with a cotton cited with a little water 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.850
 I took off my lipstick but I had 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.710
 purpurins had purines all over the 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.270
 face by the neck and I was not given 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.070
 removed so I'm not going to go back to 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.750
 use I do not know what I'm going to do with it if it 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.699
 I'm going to leave it to my niece for 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.040
 that is painted at home and we make the fool 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.150
 when we dress up and such or I 'm going 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.979
 to give my brother to see if she 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.050
 like that of the Sami glitter from 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.300
 then no, and that the brilliant aunts 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.710
 they were falling and that they are not 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.600
 very large glitter for a 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.790
 lipstick to me this I do not like and for 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.880
 last one that came out in one of my last 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:18.500
 goals this waterproof pencil eyeliner 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:22.190
 of which is the type boli type not what 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.590
 will buy again because no pigment 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.860
 we have not given it once only not 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.750
 pigmented beige of waterproof does not have 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.910
 nothing because this gentleman has already passed water 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.870
 Micellar or when drier is removed 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.870
 perfectly 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.220
 with mineral waters that are not removed 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.400
 another type of water blue makeup 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.780
 I mean and that does not look very black 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.190
 removes very well does not do the continuous stroke 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.390
 I do not like anything and I do not recommend it and 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.580
 I bought it because in google what 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.320
 recommended and put it on blogs well e 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.720
 they even compared it with another high 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.890
 range but not no longer they have told me more 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.630
 girls but they have bought that he has gone 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.550
 wrong so what you do not what 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.110
 would buy and nothing up here the video 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.610
 I hope it has helped you and we 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.610
 we see in the following a kiss goodbye
