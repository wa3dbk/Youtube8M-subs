00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
ahead and start out by saying that there

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.789

circuits<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.370> have<00:02:22.519> banned<00:02:23.380> Alabama<00:02:24.380> rigs

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
circuits that have banned Alabama rigs

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.530 
circuits that have banned Alabama rigs
be<00:02:24.829> a<00:02:24.859> SS<00:02:25.340> was<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.609> first<00:02:25.820> one<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.150> do<00:02:26.299> it

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
be a SS was the first one to do it

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.190 
be a SS was the first one to do it
and<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:27.890> think<00:02:28.190> FLW<00:02:28.970> now<00:02:29.180> has<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.690> banned<00:02:29.900> and

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
and I think FLW now has it banned and

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.199 
and I think FLW now has it banned and
I'm<00:02:30.320> gonna<00:02:30.410> put<00:02:30.650> it<00:02:30.739> simply<00:02:31.070> like<00:02:31.250> this<00:02:31.459> there

then there's other times where it's just
like<00:02:47.299> any<00:02:47.540> technique<00:02:48.230> you're<00:02:48.739> not<00:02:48.890> gonna

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
like any technique you're not gonna

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.039 
like any technique you're not gonna
catch<00:02:49.190> any<00:02:49.430> fish<00:02:49.489> I<00:02:49.970> mean<00:02:50.180> it's<00:02:50.329> it's<00:02:50.510> not<00:02:50.569> them

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
catch any fish I mean it's it's not them

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.590 
catch any fish I mean it's it's not them
it's<00:02:51.290> not<00:02:51.470> magic<00:02:51.950> okay<00:02:52.250> if<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.209> had<00:02:53.359> to<00:02:53.450> say

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
it's not magic okay if I had to say

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.880 
it's not magic okay if I had to say
there's<00:02:53.780> one<00:02:53.959> technique<00:02:54.140> that<00:02:54.500> kind<00:02:54.709> of<00:02:54.769> is

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
there's one technique that kind of is

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.559 
there's one technique that kind of is
magic<00:02:55.310> its<00:02:55.459> worm<00:02:55.640> fishing<00:02:56.000> it's<00:02:56.120> just<00:02:56.269> benders

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
magic its worm fishing it's just benders

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.990 
magic its worm fishing it's just benders
standard<00:02:57.260> standard<00:02:58.100> worm<00:02:58.310> fishing<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:58.970> know

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
standard standard worm fishing you know

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.090 
standard standard worm fishing you know
that's<00:02:59.269> that's<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.720> that's<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.170> go<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.440> so

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
that's that's the that's the go to so

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.160 
that's that's the that's the go to so
much<00:03:01.250> of<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.459> time<00:03:01.639> to<00:03:01.850> catch<00:03:02.030> fish<00:03:02.299> so<00:03:02.600> an

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
much of the time to catch fish so an

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.410 
much of the time to catch fish so an
Alabama<00:03:03.680> Rig<00:03:03.829> isn't<00:03:04.400> gonna<00:03:04.489> replace<00:03:04.880> all<00:03:05.150> the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
Alabama Rig isn't gonna replace all the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.030 
Alabama Rig isn't gonna replace all the
rods<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:06.019> techniques<00:03:06.380> you<00:03:06.530> got<00:03:06.650> in<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:06.859> boat

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
rods and techniques you got in the boat

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.220 
rods and techniques you got in the boat
for<00:03:07.069> sure<00:03:07.549> it's<00:03:08.450> not<00:03:08.480> gonna<00:03:08.690> work<00:03:08.900> all<00:03:09.109> the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
for sure it's not gonna work all the

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.710 
for sure it's not gonna work all the
time<00:03:09.489> it's<00:03:10.489> an<00:03:10.579> interesting<00:03:10.850> way<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.209> fish<00:03:11.480> and

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
time it's an interesting way to fish and

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.960 
time it's an interesting way to fish and
I<00:03:11.930> fish<00:03:12.620> it<00:03:12.769> I've<00:03:12.890> got<00:03:13.040> one<00:03:13.190> tied<00:03:13.400> on<00:03:13.549> right<00:03:13.790> now

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
I fish it I've got one tied on right now

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.130 
I fish it I've got one tied on right now
and<00:03:14.150> I've<00:03:14.209> been<00:03:14.390> just<00:03:14.540> throwing<00:03:14.720> around<00:03:14.870> just

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
and I've been just throwing around just

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.690 
and I've been just throwing around just
testing<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:15.560> out<00:03:15.680> today<00:03:15.980> this<00:03:16.190> new<00:03:16.400> one<00:03:16.580> that

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
testing it out today this new one that

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.720 
testing it out today this new one that
I've<00:03:16.790> got

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
I've got

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.300 
I've got
and<00:03:17.849> I'm<00:03:18.450> going<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.810> tell<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.230> like<00:03:20.040> it

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
and I'm going to tell you I like it

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.750 
and I'm going to tell you I like it
because<00:03:20.780> it's<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.930> technique<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.760> targets

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
because it's a technique that targets

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.850 
because it's a technique that targets
fish<00:03:24.030> that<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.360> can't<00:03:24.660> easily<00:03:25.019> target<00:03:25.709> with<00:03:25.830> a

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
fish that you can't easily target with a

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.229 
fish that you can't easily target with a
lot<00:03:26.069> of<00:03:26.099> other<00:03:26.310> techniques<00:03:26.519> most<00:03:26.940> other

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
lot of other techniques most other

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.720 
lot of other techniques most other
techniques<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.870> that's<00:03:27.989> suspended<00:03:28.319> fish<00:03:28.739> it

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
techniques and that's suspended fish it

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.699 
techniques and that's suspended fish it
really<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.180> good<00:03:30.450> in<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.050> cold<00:03:31.260> water<00:03:31.560> and

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
really is good in the cold water and

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.940 
really is good in the cold water and
suspended<00:03:32.280> fish<00:03:32.489> so<00:03:33.440> you<00:03:34.440> know<00:03:34.560> it's<00:03:34.680> just<00:03:34.769> one

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
suspended fish so you know it's just one

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.259 
suspended fish so you know it's just one
of<00:03:35.040> those<00:03:35.130> techniques<00:03:35.459> I'm<00:03:35.670> gonna<00:03:35.819> have<00:03:36.030> tied

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
of those techniques I'm gonna have tied

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.240 
of those techniques I'm gonna have tied
on<00:03:36.480> because<00:03:36.840> it's<00:03:37.200> fun<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.530> do<00:03:37.680> it's<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.099> little

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
on because it's fun to do it's a little

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.130 
on because it's fun to do it's a little
bit<00:03:38.370> different<00:03:38.550> even<00:03:39.300> if<00:03:39.569> tournaments

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
bit different even if tournaments

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.809 
bit different even if tournaments
outlawed<00:03:40.560> even<00:03:40.920> if<00:03:41.010> all<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.190> tournaments<00:03:41.730> I

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
outlawed even if all the tournaments I

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.089 
outlawed even if all the tournaments I
was<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.120> fish<00:03:42.360> outlaw<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:43.019> I'd<00:03:43.500> probably<00:03:43.739> have

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
was to fish outlaw it I'd probably have

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.190 
was to fish outlaw it I'd probably have
a<00:03:44.130> couple<00:03:44.340> in<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.670> boat<00:03:44.849> just<00:03:44.880> for<00:03:45.690> fun<00:03:45.900> and

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
a couple in the boat just for fun and

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.320 
a couple in the boat just for fun and
and<00:03:46.799> I<00:03:46.860> throw<00:03:47.129> them<00:03:47.250> from<00:03:47.370> time<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.730> time<00:03:47.760> of

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
and I throw them from time to time of

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.970 
and I throw them from time to time of
course<00:03:48.569> not<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.900> tournament<00:03:49.319> maybe<00:03:49.470> pre<00:03:49.769> fish

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
course not the tournament maybe pre fish

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.160 
course not the tournament maybe pre fish
you<00:03:50.160> can't<00:03:50.400> do<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:51.209> fun<00:03:51.690> fishing<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:52.110> do

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
you can't do that and fun fishing I do

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.059 
you can't do that and fun fishing I do
it<00:03:53.569> so<00:03:54.569> and<00:03:54.959> it<00:03:55.170> could<00:03:55.290> be<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.410> good<00:03:55.560> way<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.799> find

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
it so and it could be a good way to find

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.370 
it so and it could be a good way to find
fish<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.760> just<00:03:56.790> know<00:03:57.599> if<00:03:57.750> they're<00:03:57.900> there<00:03:58.170> and

then trying other techniques to catch

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.050

on<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.400> fish<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:06.060> you'll<00:04:06.540> have<00:04:06.690> multiple

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
on the fish and you'll have multiple

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.390 
on the fish and you'll have multiple
hooks<00:04:07.410> in<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.650> fish<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:09.170> you<00:04:10.170> know<00:04:10.319> I<00:04:10.739> applaud

you guys to saying that's not how I'm
going<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.190> fish<00:04:14.400> because<00:04:14.640> I<00:04:14.819> don't<00:04:15.209> like

that
I<00:04:17.850> think<00:04:18.389> that's<00:04:18.540> a<00:04:18.600> really<00:04:18.720> good<00:04:18.900> thing<00:04:19.139> but

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
I think that's a really good thing but

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.800 
I think that's a really good thing but
me<00:04:19.620> personally<00:04:19.829> I<00:04:20.190> can<00:04:20.910> catch<00:04:21.090> ten<00:04:21.389> fish<00:04:21.600> in<00:04:21.720> a

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
me personally I can catch ten fish in a

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.180 
me personally I can catch ten fish in a
row<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.079> if<00:04:22.200> they've<00:04:22.320> got<00:04:22.470> multiple<00:04:22.650> hooks<00:04:23.039> in

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
row and if they've got multiple hooks in

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.730 
row and if they've got multiple hooks in
them<00:04:23.310> um<00:04:24.240> I'm<00:04:24.660> sorry<00:04:24.990> but<00:04:25.289> I'm<00:04:25.380> not<00:04:25.410> going<00:04:25.650> to

catch<00:05:02.400> fish<00:05:02.610> with<00:05:02.849> it<00:05:03.000> so<00:05:03.210> if<00:05:03.570> there's<00:05:04.289> a

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
catch fish with it so if there's a

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.290 
catch fish with it so if there's a
tournament<00:05:04.650> when<00:05:04.860> it's<00:05:05.010> allowed<00:05:05.280> you<00:05:05.970> can<00:05:06.120> bet

tournament when it's allowed you can bet

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.520 
tournament when it's allowed you can bet
that<00:05:06.330> I'm<00:05:06.570> probably<00:05:06.750> going<00:05:07.020> to<00:05:07.139> have<00:05:07.260> it<00:05:07.380> tied

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
that I'm probably going to have it tied
