00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello to all i hope you go 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.580
 well 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.800
 so today I had a little tutorial 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:16.130
 on how xp quickly and easily 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:21.800
 so first in a first part 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:26.939
 we would have to buy increments of 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:30.170
 xp 150 I like it's not death so 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:36.570
 if you can buy by five 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:42.510
 after that it's up to you to see a 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:45.690
 little trick on the pubs so a lot 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.920
 of players think that going into 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.579
 maps for example 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.180
 there is a lot of crown it's on a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.840
 road 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.430
 it's part of the road so the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.489
 players will head to there they go 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.100
 to say to myself I'm going to do a lot of XP in 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.909
 killing raul complaint but do not have 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.580
 necessarily we can kill for example a 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.270
 word that can have the equivalent of 3 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.540
 crown in one bob and that's precisely 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.630
 that I'm going to talk to you about because 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.009
 the further you distance from 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:25.789
 from the road plus the furniture will be 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.700
 rich in xp for example this word has that 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:32.179
 I killed a moment ago haro pop 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:36.020
 so we're going to kill just to see by 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:38.470
 curiosity to see how much 10 bp there 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.470
 will let us go 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.890
 so that's 48 xp so you see that a 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.310
 mob kir pop frequently gives really 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.409
 not a lot of xp compared to for example 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.179
 the word allah who was not killed by the 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.810
 players because they do not think about it 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:06.459
 necessarily will give us a lot of xp 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.459
 the water we will see it 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.270
 so do not forget to take 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:18.150
 the increase of xp that I did not take 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.690
 because I do not know there are 175 bonuses 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.750
 xp 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.760
 it's just a bonus and it's really 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.940
 not negligible it's always good to 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.940
 take 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.870
 so here you go went to get the 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.670
 furniture off the road for you 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.980
 do a lot of xp because you can 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:45.480
 see that before 40xp in a single bob and 175 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.100
 in bonus with another frankly it's 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.980
 better to kill than wood 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:54.239
 to go make crowns en masse 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:58.220
 especially since it's so fast and even 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:01.170
 almost faster and more efficient 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.750
 the one I may have killed before 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.500
 I do not know so we're still going 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.260
 that they are quite far from the road 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.739
 finally so much so that's it 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:18.470
 175 bonuses xp you see that this is 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:22.500
 really it's really nice what it is 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:27.300
 it's even nicer rather than going 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:33.420
 kill crawl en masse and die 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:38.490
 and so that's after you can go in 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.650
 msp m which is not necessarily very good 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.380
 at low level as could have known 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.080
 level 39 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:51.210
 it 's not crazy the exo so I'll be at 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:56.360
 would be pretty fragile excuse me but 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:59.070
 harb do not attack at all so 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.200
 do not go alone because you 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.390
 are going to be degummed in two 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.970
 seconds 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:11.520
 unless you're a big pgm of 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.230
 the avif a sick thing and you can 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.540
 also problem 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.150
 she is stupid to help him 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:23.040
 challenged by bus that's not bad by 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:26.030
 against that will be a lot of xp so you 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:30.500
 see here after that there is also the craft 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:34.710
 which is unfortunately quite expensive 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.400
 because for a good snack mounted the 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.490
 first levels 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.650
 it's not worth much but afterwards for 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.400
 raise the higher levels as per 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.770
 example the jeweler's job is good 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.640
 still the job almost 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.850
 expensive anyway 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.980
 but take a weapons blacksmith you 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.570
 can mount a level 80 character 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:00.150
 years by doing that craft through the 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:04.080
 trades yes it's possible but it's 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.630
 expensive very expensive so that's why 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.919
 I did not do it because slamming 50 p 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.380
 o 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.270
 to climb a level 80 it's not 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:17.220
 necessarily what is best 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:21.180
 afterwards it's up to you but here you go 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:24.140
 so on this I tell you see you soon 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.140
 ciao
