 Hi, welcome to youtube channel Digital Digging. 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.560
 In this video, we take a closer look at the Panzer II - both in history and in War Thunder. 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:22.880
 The Panzer II was constructed at a time when the tank armor was supposed to protect the crew primarily from small arms fire and explosive fragments. 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.460
 The result of inadequate protection was recognized in the Battle of France in 1939 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.080
 where these weakly armored machines had problems stopping British and French opponents. 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.760
 The power of this machine lies in its mobility and replacement for cavalry. 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.840
 The Nazi philosophy of blitzkrieg is this fast and agile machine 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:50.240
 complemented by a 20mm KwK 30 or 38 L / 55 cannon, threw perfectly. 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.840
 The tank also played its role on the Eastern Front 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.720
 as long as the queue was still moving and there was no need to fight for every piece of land. 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.460
 But when the Russians deployed new armor, this tančík was very quickly found useless. 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.740
 When these vehicles began to become obsolete, most of them were removed from the tower, which was subsequently built into the Atlantic Wall. 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:29.420
 The remaining bogies were fitted with a 7.5 cm Pak 40 gun and converted to Marder II and Wespe with a 10.5 cm howitzer. 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.820
 Panzer II was eventually replaced by much better armed and armored Panzer III 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.140
 the final version of Pzkpfw II was Pz II F, whose serial production was discontinued in 1942. 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.380
 We have these tanks 4 - Panzer II C, Premium Panzer II Deutsche Afrikakorps, Panzer II F and Premium Panzer II H (which is not related to this video). 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:55.460
 All vehicles are at level 1, with IIC and DAK having identical statistics. 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:04.260
 They have a BR of 1.0 with a maximum speed of 27 mph or 44 kmh, which they reach in 7 seconds. 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.420
 Tower rotation reaches 14 degrees per second. 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:19.660
 They are equipped with a 20 mm KwK30 gun, reaching 279.6 shots per minute and a 6.0 second charge rate. 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:35.840
 Armor thickness reaches 15 mm on the side and stern, 35 mm on the lower front armor and up to 35 mm on the upper part of the front plate. 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.700
 The tower is 15mm thick from all sides except for the front where it is 30mm thick. 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.840
 The Panzer II F has a BR of 1.3 with a maximum speed of 27mph or 44kmh in 7 seconds. 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.640
 Tower rotation reaches 14.0 degrees per second. 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:06.720
 It is armed with a 20mm KwK38, firing 450 shots per minute and a 6.0 second charge. 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:22.780
 The armor thickness reaches 20mm on the side and 15mm on the back, 35mm on the bottom of the front armor and up to 30mm on the top of the front plate. 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.080
 The tower is 15mm thick from all sides except for the front where it is 30mm thick. 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.820
 Both IICs and DAKs are perfectly usable light tanks, but with the IIF you will enjoy something more 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:44.540
 In addition to speed and dexterity, this tank has a dizzying rate of fire, the efficiency of which is enhanced by the ability to use a penetrating-fire ammunition. 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.700
 Just do not sit on the site and use the strengths - the thickness of the armor certainly does not belong to them. 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.220
