00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.640
 the legs 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.640
 the lack 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:13.279
 the question 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.759
 I have offered some examples of activities aimed at teaching fights 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:22.570
 created with 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.420
 the objective of leading students to a gradual increase in the level of 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.990
 understanding of operational and tactical principles such 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.020
 we the different modalities 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.900
 such activities were carried out during the call martial arts workshops 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.810
 taught in a toy library of the district of barÃ£o geraldo and adapted 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.810
 the possibilities and demands of this context 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.820
 in this first activity with the teacher using the pasta 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.720
 pool strikes slow and wide strokes in four different directions 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.840
 the child in turn must identify the specificities of each blow 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.630
 taking them as problem situations to be solved with actions 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.060
 specific defenses in the case limited to the expressive 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.820
 This leads to a greater understanding of the 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.990
 making it capable of replacing an escape attitude commonly observed in the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.570
 young people by an attitude in which she sought to protect without 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.340
 proximity to the attacker 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.220
 in this sense the delimitation of an area the orientations of the 'teacher' and 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.080
 speed control is an important 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.080
 this increase in the level of understanding gradually ' 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.070
 the level of complexity of unpredictability increases in activity 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.789
 Following 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.140
 in which the ability to defend itself without fleeing and becomes fundamental for the 

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:59.600
 child to achieve his or her new goal 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.609
 that of capturing the tapes attached to the waist of the 'teacher' 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.600
 here the child is conducted understanding that offensive actions 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.469
 of the opponent make him vulnerable 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:13.159
 and that she must await the initiative of the 'teacher' and then dodge 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.389
 captured in hiring actions 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:19.389
 this descent 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.159
 vettel 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.360
 with children acting in pairs 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.390
 tries to lead them to the understanding that the opponent's offensive action when 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.019
 addressed to one of them 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.019
 made vulnerable to the other child's offensive actions 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:46.549
 The 'teacher', in turn, can regulate the level of difficulty of the 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.099
 retarding activity accelerating the rhythm of alternation between offensiveness 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.769
 directed 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.259
 and the other 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:58.619
 become aware of this possibility of contracting here. 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:02.589
 children come together to make plans that basically consist of a 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:04.109
 division of functions 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.989
 in which with a child of teacher debut while the other one captures his 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.989
 tapes 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.959
 in another set of activities of the 'teacher' uses as an implement the 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.829
 amateur ball meteor made of foam coated with felt and cherish a rope 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.689
 such activities follow a similar pedagogical sequence 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.879
 in the first encyclical movement are established with the implementation in 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:47.769
 question 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.990
 It is up to children to overcome this obstacle without being 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.350
 at the level of complexity next unpredictability 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.910
 the child must again cross the court space without being hit with the 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.010
 difference that now teacher assumed the role of attacker 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:08.219
 in the search for solutions it should be conducted to understand that after the 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:12.619
 offensive to a moment of recollection of the race and that therefore 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:15.699
 should wait for such actions to dodge 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:17.459
 and progress 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.440
 in turn the teacher has increased the speed of the blows and the 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.710
 time of adaptation by adapting the difficulty of the activity to the level of 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.710
 understanding of students 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.200
 A third moment 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.669
 by means of avoidance and progression previously worked out 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.560
 the child should capture with 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.830
 one or two overalls with which it can block the meteor ball while 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.090
 progresses this time aiming to reach with the pasta his opponent 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:08.879
 and so we came to the end of this video hoping he contributions 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:13.199
 teachers involved in teaching the struggle in different contexts and that these 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.919
 teachers to make the necessary adaptations in accordance with 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.849
 specificities of their pedagogical practice leading their students to 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.419
 to face the fight in an intelligent way 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:24.979
 thank you 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.979
 I stayed 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.349
 W 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.430
 clever 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.569
 right 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:51.809
 right
