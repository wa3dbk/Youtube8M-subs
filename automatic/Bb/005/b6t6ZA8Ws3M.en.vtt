the satellite imagery you can see the
system<00:01:24.780> right<00:01:24.930> here<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:25.979> going<00:01:26.189> to

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
system right here and it's going to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.149 
system right here and it's going to
accelerate<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.930> moves<00:01:28.140> inland<00:01:28.500> up<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.070> the

accelerate as it moves inland up to the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.859 
accelerate as it moves inland up to the
Northeast<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.060> because<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.750> going

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
Northeast and because of that it's going

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.480 
Northeast and because of that it's going
to<00:01:30.930> bring<00:01:31.049> some<00:01:31.110> fairly<00:01:31.530> strong<00:01:31.680> winds<00:01:32.070> inland

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
to bring some fairly strong winds inland

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.120 
to bring some fairly strong winds inland

this<00:03:01.989> will<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.350> weaken<00:03:02.709> quickly<00:03:03.130> or<00:03:03.310> will<00:03:03.579> it

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
this will it weaken quickly or will it

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.090 
this will it weaken quickly or will it
remain<00:03:04.060> very<00:03:04.390> strong<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:05.560> should<00:03:05.799> weaken

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
remain very strong it should weaken

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.740 
remain very strong it should weaken
fairly<00:03:06.459> quickly<00:03:06.730> over<00:03:07.030> land<00:03:07.209> Marshall<00:03:07.660> but

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
fairly quickly over land Marshall but

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.210 
fairly quickly over land Marshall but
it's<00:03:07.959> going<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.170> procure<00:03:08.530> some<00:03:08.890> fairly<00:03:09.100> strong

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
it's going to procure some fairly strong

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.069 
it's going to procure some fairly strong
winds<00:03:09.700> inland<00:03:10.120> when<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:10.269> say<00:03:10.510> we<00:03:10.660> can<00:03:10.840> quickly

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
winds inland when I say we can quickly

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.430 
winds inland when I say we can quickly
weaken<00:03:11.500> down<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:11.980> category<00:03:12.790> one<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.299> then<00:03:13.959> a

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
weaken down to a category one and then a

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.860 
weaken down to a category one and then a
strong<00:03:15.430> tropical<00:03:15.700> storm<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.480> bring<00:03:16.690> those

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
strong tropical storm and bring those

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.870 
strong tropical storm and bring those
winds<00:03:17.200> well<00:03:17.410> inland<00:03:17.860> away<00:03:18.549> from<00:03:18.760> the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
winds well inland away from the

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.280 
winds well inland away from the
coastline<00:03:19.239> so<00:03:19.540> you<00:03:19.630> need<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:19.840> be<00:03:19.930> ready<00:03:20.230> for

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
coastline so you need to be ready for

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.229 
coastline so you need to be ready for
that<00:03:20.470> now<00:03:21.220> here's<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.610> latest<00:03:21.880> satellite

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
that now here's the latest satellite

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.360 
that now here's the latest satellite
image<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:23.320> northern<00:03:23.620> eye<00:03:23.739> wall<00:03:23.980> is<00:03:24.130> right

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
image the the northern eye wall is right

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.640 
image the the northern eye wall is right
on<00:03:24.609> what<00:03:25.359> appears<00:03:25.660> to<00:03:25.720> be<00:03:25.780> Marsh<00:03:26.079> Island<00:03:26.470> right

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
on what appears to be Marsh Island right

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.410 
on what appears to be Marsh Island right
now<00:03:26.680> I'll<00:03:26.920> show<00:03:27.070> you<00:03:27.130> on<00:03:27.250> a<00:03:27.280> radar<00:03:27.519> image<00:03:27.880> the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
now I'll show you on a radar image the

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.720 
now I'll show you on a radar image the
danger<00:03:28.870> sector<00:03:29.320> of<00:03:29.440> course<00:03:29.470> is<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.340> right

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
danger sector of course is the right

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.819 
danger sector of course is the right
front<00:03:31.090> quadrant<00:03:31.239> so<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.810> high<00:03:31.959> high<00:03:32.530> water

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
front quadrant so the high high water

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.130 
front quadrant so the high high water
action<00:03:33.100> is<00:03:33.400> basically<00:03:33.790> at<00:03:34.359> and<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:34.989> east

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.630 
winds but it's relatively dry and that's
blowing<00:03:47.079> from<00:03:47.350> land<00:03:47.620> so<00:03:47.920> we<00:03:48.040> don't<00:03:48.220> see<00:03:48.459> that

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640

you<00:03:51.010> saw<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.250> advisory<00:03:51.820> it's<00:03:52.000> moving<00:03:52.299> fairly

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
you saw the advisory it's moving fairly

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.840 
you saw the advisory it's moving fairly

there<00:05:00.800> south<00:05:01.100> of<00:05:01.250> Bermuda<00:05:01.490> still<00:05:01.880> it's<00:05:02.360> nearly

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
there south of Bermuda still it's nearly

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.320 
there south of Bermuda still it's nearly
stationary<00:05:02.990> and<00:05:03.590> when<00:05:04.190> we<00:05:04.280> look<00:05:04.460> at<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.669> the

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
stationary and when we look at the the

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.750 
stationary and when we look at the the
latest<00:05:05.720> information<00:05:06.080> winds<00:05:06.650> 65<00:05:07.280> miles<00:05:07.610> per

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
latest information winds 65 miles per

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.700 
latest information winds 65 miles per
hour<00:05:08.000> it<00:05:08.570> had<00:05:08.660> almost<00:05:08.870> gotten<00:05:09.289> back<00:05:09.560> to

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
hour it had almost gotten back to

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:10.990 
hour it had almost gotten back to
hurricane<00:05:10.160> again<00:05:10.460> yesterday

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
hurricane again yesterday

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.939 
hurricane again yesterday
it's<00:05:11.449> nearly<00:05:11.690> stationary<00:05:12.020> but<00:05:12.500> we<00:05:12.590> think<00:05:12.770> it's

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
it's nearly stationary but we think it's

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:14.740 
it's nearly stationary but we think it's
going<00:05:13.130> to<00:05:13.160> take<00:05:13.310> a<00:05:13.370> slow<00:05:13.820> but<00:05:14.180> steady<00:05:14.389> motion

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
going to take a slow but steady motion

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.409 
going to take a slow but steady motion
toward<00:05:15.680> the<00:05:16.190> Northeast<00:05:16.699> and<00:05:16.970> the<00:05:17.030> general

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
toward the Northeast and the general

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.089 
toward the Northeast and the general
direction<00:05:17.599> of<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.349> Outer<00:05:18.620> Banks<00:05:18.860> of<00:05:19.039> North

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
direction of the Outer Banks of North

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.379 
direction of the Outer Banks of North
Carolina<00:05:19.310> we<00:05:19.789> don't<00:05:19.940> think<00:05:20.030> it's<00:05:20.210> going<00:05:20.360> to

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
Carolina we don't think it's going to

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:21.279 
Carolina we don't think it's going to
make<00:05:20.570> it<00:05:20.720> there<00:05:20.870> yet

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
make it there yet

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.529 
make it there yet
but<00:05:21.740> it<00:05:22.220> will<00:05:22.370> remain<00:05:22.639> a<00:05:22.699> storm<00:05:23.060> anyway<00:05:23.389> and

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
but it will remain a storm anyway and

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.150 
but it will remain a storm anyway and
we'll<00:05:23.660> continue<00:05:23.840> to<00:05:24.110> monitor<00:05:24.229> that<00:05:24.500> anyway

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
we'll continue to monitor that anyway

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.850 
we'll continue to monitor that anyway
there's<00:05:25.699> a<00:05:25.849> circulation<00:05:26.470> showing<00:05:27.470> no<00:05:27.590> signs

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
there's a circulation showing no signs

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.320 
there's a circulation showing no signs
right<00:05:28.039> now<00:05:28.099> of<00:05:28.370> developing<00:05:28.820> just<00:05:28.970> bringing

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
right now of developing just bringing

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.210 
right now of developing just bringing
some<00:05:29.360> high<00:05:29.599> surf<00:05:29.870> these<00:05:30.320> pack<00:05:30.620> is<00:05:30.800> quietly

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
some high surf these pack is quietly

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.250 
some high surf these pack is quietly
well<00:05:31.729> with<00:05:31.940> Kyle<00:05:32.479> is<00:05:32.750> there<00:05:32.870> any<00:05:32.990> greater

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
well with Kyle is there any greater

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.600 
well with Kyle is there any greater
threat<00:05:33.620> today<00:05:34.070> than<00:05:34.340> there<00:05:34.430> was<00:05:34.550> yesterday

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
threat today than there was yesterday

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.360 
threat today than there was yesterday
that<00:05:35.060> that<00:05:35.360> could<00:05:35.570> make<00:05:35.750> a<00:05:35.780> u.s.<00:05:36.110> hit<00:05:36.740> well

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
that that could make a u.s. hit well

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.830 
that that could make a u.s. hit well
right<00:05:37.520> now<00:05:37.699> we're<00:05:37.910> just<00:05:38.030> monitoring<00:05:38.510> because

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
right now we're just monitoring because

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.020 
right now we're just monitoring because
it's<00:05:39.139> hasn't<00:05:39.979> moved<00:05:40.099> at<00:05:40.340> all<00:05:40.490> for<00:05:40.789> the<00:05:40.849> last

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
it's hasn't moved at all for the last

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.839 
it's hasn't moved at all for the last
say<00:05:42.020> 24<00:05:42.590> to<00:05:42.710> 30<00:05:42.919> hours<00:05:42.979> and<00:05:43.310> we<00:05:43.400> don't<00:05:43.580> expect

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
say 24 to 30 hours and we don't expect

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:45.730 
say 24 to 30 hours and we don't expect
it<00:05:44.000> to<00:05:44.060> move<00:05:44.240> very<00:05:44.270> much<00:05:44.539> over<00:05:44.930> the<00:05:45.080> next<00:05:45.260> 72

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
it to move very much over the next 72

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.469 
it to move very much over the next 72
hours<00:05:45.800> so<00:05:46.250> we<00:05:46.639> need<00:05:46.789> to<00:05:46.849> monitor<00:05:47.030> it<00:05:47.270> on<00:05:47.330> the

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
hours so we need to monitor it on the

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.390 
hours so we need to monitor it on the
East<00:05:47.599> Coast<00:05:47.870> but<00:05:48.050> right<00:05:48.229> now<00:05:48.380> no<00:05:48.620> significant

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
East Coast but right now no significant

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.430 
East Coast but right now no significant
threat<00:05:49.669> okay<00:05:50.090> certainly<00:05:50.479> worth<00:05:50.690> watching<00:05:51.020> in

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
threat okay certainly worth watching in

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.159 
threat okay certainly worth watching in
that<00:05:51.710> general<00:05:52.039> direction
