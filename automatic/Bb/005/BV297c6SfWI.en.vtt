00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.010
 welcome everyone to arrive mauricio soria sa t 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.710
 we are going to generate a container 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.510
 and glass 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.189
 and a few years old 1 

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:11.559
 nasca argentina reflectivity 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:12.879
 I'm afraid it's 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.559
 per cent not only things have no floor 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.589
 I do not know we have an image 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:19.989
 in the highest part of the area and the trénor 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:24.069
 I was having a transparent scientist who in this case do this 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.269
 that's what happens to our transparent label 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:30.350
 we are going to deny what he is 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.879
 3d here we have this head part 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.940
 that is the same base and we have the bottom 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.370
 come down to our house 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.750
 I owe all this to the market some like tarp in jpg 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.269
 let's remember 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.209
 This is going to be positive and this will be negative of our label 

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:49.879
 transparent yes 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.219
 Pablo also in what state is working as a jpg to display them as indicated 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.340
 this experience in negative and positive or negative 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.380
 all this would be when I speak as our duty each of these each 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.730
 of these as jpg 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.020
 while being comfortable abroad yes 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.020
 let's start then they design in 3d studio max 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.299
 here we are in 3d studio max 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.600
 in love the face if we look at the media chain in these 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.040
 that depending on the size of the ticket 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.040
 here we have a house do not abide the measure of length 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.329
 five centimeters by five centimeters in width by height 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.870
 which is 14 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.799
 let's face it for now 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.930
 here we have our is not in my hands up and with this 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.109
 remember that to import this 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:42.920
 we have to do it by fae 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.250
 import 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.780
 we look for the file we tell him to open 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.850
 then we say that everyone has the same scene 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.380
 or that iquique that in multiples objects 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.710
 has decided what 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.240
 tamek that has generated what is the design the drawing matters 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.480
 now we go to station with a great interpretation 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.319
 nikisch 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.860
 we put 90 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.559
 there has stopped and we are going to generate what is the label 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:10.719
 of our most 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:11.640
 for now 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.890
 we are going to select 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.680
 that are the lines here where is that little monitor that is here 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.039
 we say hide it hide the selected ones 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.149
 at that time I do not know 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:24.769
 we are going to enter the materials 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.920
 who is right now we are going to generate that in the faces of each one of them by 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.209
 half of feverish activity 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.489
 next masters 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:32.569
 standard 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:33.709
 I'm looking for the option of 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.069
 he did not want if this 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.099
 to generate several faces 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.719
 and we say that you download 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:43.489
 all the elements and we will generate by name the amount of materials 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.999
 what do we need 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:48.739
 is generating a let's generate 5 box five faces 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.779
 yes because it is unfinished that you go in the upper one that is going to repeat in the part 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:56.060
 or amounts we can earn nothing only with five houses 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.199
 whereas before 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:02.040
 in the part we will abide what is the material or less 90 may be your 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:04.629
 driver has a different number does not matter 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:05.929
 let's see Beijing 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:08.239
 then thorny standard 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.119
 non-standard fly mosquera war and travis 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:12.869
 ray tracing 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:17.059
 and here it brings me curled we are in the diffuse in the little box that have side 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.859
 straight 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.859
 we are going to locate the first house 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:24.889
 in that I get the moon the first face 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.409
 we raise the level 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.489
 we have the ulna equal to a little 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.829
 the reflectivity 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.809
 there are the members like to leave there lousy okey 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:38.370
 we raise the level 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.630
 we already have a small one that are on top 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.900
 and we generate 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.630
 In your opinion, that first design followed the trail to which the material of 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:47.969
 you start to see here 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.589
 in much of what the first face 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:52.449
 you can repeat it quickly 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:56.540
 we touch the material we say is standard 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.550
 fayt reis sky then let's go homicides 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:01.020
 viedma 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.919
 we bring the following material 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.219
 we grew up 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:08.499
 is this that if we open 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:13.620
 we raised the level we will have a circuit we lowered the reflectivity a little 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.450
 and a little more gray 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.799
 we raise the level 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.590
 and we do second matter 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.349
 who have two faces 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.039
 and here you start to see your face somewhere 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.039
 how I looked from the opposite side 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:33.550
 here to extremes 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.659
 that we have every decade over the face of down 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:39.180
 membiela lorica reorganize the faces 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.920
 I'm going to stop at the time the movie for more expensive lot disloyalties 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.050
 with the minimum we brought these 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.439
 already at this moment we already have light of five races 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.580
 they have taught us there are no longer 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.569
 in the box 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.529
 and visuals like spotify lenses point of view 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:57.999
 Read our faces in the boxes 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:01.680
 for Christians and their daughter ana the exact points that are 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.460
 remember that there are 50 here and in you fixers those indicators have to 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.479
 be for each of the boxes 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.020
 now 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.020
 select the box 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:19.969
 we are going to modify and modify the modifiers in the list 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:23.150
 cusco kevin month 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.169
 james peking the most 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.419
 hoppo I say no cuba and with 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.059
 It's like the face I need 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:33.059
 but remember that he told them that there is no cynical impunity or 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.620
 could go the south goiás code 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:40.189
 in the bottom part, what is material 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:44.389
 and here they are identified from the material that is the same identified 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:45.469
 I have here 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:50.159
 there are those who say that every face that does not exist or not one here I have and 5 and so 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:51.580
 all over 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.779
 how my smile here we have the 3 we are going to rearrange the houses 

00:05:56.309 --> 00:06:01.229
 boa touch here at this point thought to avoid it being number 4 for example and 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:04.240
 let's look at quillacollo and 100 states every certain 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.770
 remember we could do any number 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.990
 depending on the numbers you have each 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.780
 and automatically face 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.160
 I do the agents 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.939
 at this time it would be 4 to highlight 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:18.199
 let's adopt and meca pipes the opposite 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:20.409
 jara supposed 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:23.529
 and here he came to place for example enumerated 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:26.270
 one 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.069
 we are placing in the team 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:30.550
 1 and in minutes the decade 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.550
 I think it's four 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:36.479
 as you notice from a3 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.199
 neither 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:42.509
 in this case I think they are two yes here we have already 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.949
 per cent is not box already by side and side 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:49.559
 I consider that I need here we have our design 

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:52.270
 and on the opposite side we have a presence 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.270
 the part above would be that number 5 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.430
 and in the pastera we go the day 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.589
 also a -5 because I want it to be repeated 

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.430
 this face so much 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.349
 at the bottom with the peace that makes our 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:09.009
 cane at this time 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:10.099
 we have ready 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:14.530
 as we know and has reflectivity we simply take a little angel 

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:16.180
 example we have here 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.689
 another on this side 

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:20.189
 and mozilla rendering should be 

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:21.550
 the reflectivity 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.020
 of these two objects 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.469
 in Huesca 

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:30.059
 as it does a little more of approach to visualize renderiza amos we believe 

00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:32.210
 which is already reflected here 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.020
 already in these two exercises 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.180
 we have a box with effectiveness 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.100
 we just finished a small tutorial as to continue with the second tutorial that is 

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.699
 that are based thank you very much
