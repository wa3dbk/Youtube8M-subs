00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:13.929
 this is a systemic approach to the art of new 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.599
 part of the new action can be measured by the degree of change in behavior 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.039
 of the consumer 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.019
 the veterans as 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.970
 the most amazing case other worldly matters 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.660
 with multiple functionalities besides 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.410
 if you have questioned 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.169
 in the second half 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.980
 there is a big difference between sweating a product profiles and creating a new one 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.040
 product 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.510
 small changes in the products made it weak in the porn market to 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.729
 water worker 

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:42.000
 consumers 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.220
 on the other hand 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.720
 how do you know if an innovative idea brings success 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.250
 to the prison site founded fear of the season we can tell the secret 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.460
 one of the ways 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.490
 is to develop a systemic approach to innovate 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.360
 the difference of this approach to the traditional 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.630
 with that I'll 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.470
 is the orthodox and highly disciplined form in the generation of 10 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.220
 The main characteristic of my analysis is not only the 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.270
 consumers 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.940
 but also the desire of the fruits 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.580
 It may seem strange 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.550
 to begin the analysis of the product within a systemic approach 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.060
 we identify essential attributes without the physical and others such as expectation 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.810
 of life 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.640
 and the environment and one of them 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.230
 will be used 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.050
 then sought to creatively have some of the attributes this year 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.220
 I see every day 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.430
 southern fidelity cell phones 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.070
 which allowed the introduction 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.850
 product mp3 player function 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.970
 better still add a camera to the track situations of the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.740
 daily 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.399
 since you do not have US everywhere, at any time of the day and 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:50.540
 night 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.670
 to develop a systemic approach so that it does not occur 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.090
 it is possible to use technique 3 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.470
 this technique uses yes with product analysis standards 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.820
 which can be analyzed separately or in an integrated way to identify 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.820
 opportunities to return the creativity of products 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.149
 the first standard is the subtraction 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:12.679
 product advocates 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:14.839
 although it may seem strange 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:19.139
 but simplify the use of products can be good consumers 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:23.659
 the cassava of new dvd players that do not have rain anymore and have 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.369
 the product engineers have probably noticed the 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:32.969
 amount of handsets with flashing group schedules today 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:36.329
 the second pattern is wrong 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:37.399
 stay alone 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:41.350
 which adopts a copy-feature approach 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.889
 already in the product 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.319
 the gillette introduced a new lamego in the razor 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:48.930
 the world said 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.680
 to improve the shaving experience of consumers 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.829
 seemingly the result was so surprising that there is already a 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.289
 gillette product with five years 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:02.690
 the third standard 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.249
 it's the division 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.540
 which provides that the separation of product functions 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.080
 6 10 disagree 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.779
 to do an analysis in isolation 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:14.839
 before computers were sold with cpu 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:17.979
 a lot of their mouse keyboard has a good heart 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.720
 currently it is possible to buy only one cpu 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.819
 and use the peripherals of the old computer or buy it separately 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:26.639
 the standard room 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.639
 is the only 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.269
 functions that used an approach to assign new functions to 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.439
 11 meters already in the product 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.010
 An interesting example is the use of ipad the windshield as a radio antenna 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.830
 through the simple addition of a 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.669
 product regulation 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:46.619
 and of course the most amazing example is the single arc phone 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:51.369
 camera photo radio mp3 players and that be prey 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:55.979
 which reported that the change in dependency ratio taxes 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.309
 some products as relations within their characteristics of their 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:01.969
 relationship with a gay 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:05.620
 a body product only has a dependency relationship with women 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:10.400
 gillette shavers were originally developed for 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:11.169
 men 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.169
 but it was also used by women for waxing 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:18.709
 looking at this opportunity was developed a line these are for 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.219
 women 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:23.289
 combined use of the five standards 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.999
 decide moments of a strong drought 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:31.249
 a technique widely adopted by several companies in the world 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:36.169
 is the theory for assumption on November 20 - known as prince 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:43.090
 application of the methodology has a systemic thinking in the art of new 

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:43.980
 company 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.229
 what shape 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:46.729
 more competitive in the market
