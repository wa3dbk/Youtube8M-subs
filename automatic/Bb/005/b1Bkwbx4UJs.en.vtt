00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.990 
down you know everything in the back and
it's<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.770> pretty<00:01:37.950> good<00:01:38.040> design<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.700> they're

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
it's a pretty good design and they're

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.450 
it's a pretty good design and they're
really<00:01:39.270> strong<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.860> basically<00:01:41.130> got<00:01:41.310> you

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
really strong and you basically got you

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.010 
really strong and you basically got you
some<00:01:41.670> gear<00:01:41.909> reduction<00:01:42.270> going<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.600> there<00:01:42.810> so

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
some gear reduction going on there so

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.410 
some gear reduction going on there so
instead<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.530> being<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:45.030> like

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
instead of it just being a you know like

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.719 
instead of it just being a you know like
on<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.630> truck<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.590> one<00:01:46.979> brake<00:01:47.340> holding

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
on the truck it's just one brake holding

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.020 
on the truck it's just one brake holding
one<00:01:47.909> wheel<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:49.530> know<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.890> drive<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.790> brakes

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
one wheel you know this drive on brakes

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.340 
one wheel you know this drive on brakes
extra<00:01:51.299> take<00:01:51.390> advantage<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.960> fact<00:01:52.140> that

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
extra take advantage of the fact that

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.530 
extra take advantage of the fact that
there's<00:01:52.619> gear<00:01:52.979> reduction<00:01:53.430> there<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.240> you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
there's gear reduction there and so you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.120 
there's gear reduction there and so you
know<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.720> might<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.110> six<00:01:55.500> or<00:01:55.649> seven<00:01:56.040> to

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
know you might have a six or seven to

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.700 
know you might have a six or seven to
one<00:01:56.280> ratio<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:57.060> your<00:01:57.390> axle<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.350> big<00:01:58.560> heavy

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
one ratio in your axle on this big heavy

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.649 
one ratio in your axle on this big heavy
truck<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.030> taken<00:02:00.240> advantage<00:02:00.570> of

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
truck and so it's taken advantage of

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.420 
truck and so it's taken advantage of
that<00:02:00.719> on<00:02:01.170> top<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.710> fact<00:02:01.920> there's<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.399> know

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
that on top of the fact there's you know

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.639 
that on top of the fact there's you know
dually<00:02:02.969> tires<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.420> back<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.930> it's<00:02:04.560> just

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
dually tires in the back and it's just

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.740 
dually tires in the back and it's just
holding<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.969> driveshaft

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
holding that that that driveshaft

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.109 
holding that that that driveshaft
perfectly<00:02:07.740> perfectly<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.670> know<00:02:08.789> right<00:02:09.000> where

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
perfectly perfectly you know right where

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.249 
perfectly perfectly you know right where
it's<00:02:09.209> going<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:09.989> going<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.170> move

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
it's going to be it's not going to move

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.500 
it's going to be it's not going to move
at<00:02:10.379> all<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:11.250> they<00:02:11.340> work<00:02:11.520> really<00:02:11.550> well<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.150> here

of this see if we can get right here
is<00:02:30.390> an<00:02:31.140> arm<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.950> shoe<00:02:32.220> there's<00:02:32.610> actually

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
is an arm and a shoe there's actually

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.640 
is an arm and a shoe there's actually
shoes<00:02:33.360> on<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.750> inside<00:02:34.050> of<00:02:34.140> this<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.350> they're

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
shoes on the inside of this and they're

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.940 
shoes on the inside of this and they're
actually<00:02:34.980> pushing<00:02:35.190> this<00:02:35.520> way<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.690> way

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
actually pushing this way and that way

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.670 
actually pushing this way and that way
up<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.220> down<00:02:38.310> when<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.360> pull<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:40.320> that

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
up and down when you pull that that that

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.620 
up and down when you pull that that that
arm<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.610> cable<00:02:42.150> right<00:02:42.300> here<00:02:42.510> that

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
arm and this is a cable right here that

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.940 
arm and this is a cable right here that
runs<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.080> inside<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.500> truck

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
runs to the inside the truck

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.710 
runs to the inside the truck
it's<00:02:44.520> basically<00:02:44.850> when<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.120> pull<00:02:45.420> the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
it's basically when you pull the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.630 
it's basically when you pull the
emergency<00:02:45.900> brake<00:02:46.320> on<00:02:46.620> this<00:02:46.770> medium<00:02:47.130> truck<00:02:47.430> and

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
emergency brake on this medium truck and

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.790 
emergency brake on this medium truck and
most<00:02:48.150> medium<00:02:48.570> trucks<00:02:48.870> have<00:02:49.110> one<00:02:49.380> like<00:02:49.560> this

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
most medium trucks have one like this

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.890 
most medium trucks have one like this
those<00:02:50.460> are<00:02:50.610> little<00:02:50.790> arm<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.180> inside<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.810> it

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
those are little arm and inside and it

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.750 
those are little arm and inside and it
locks<00:02:52.410> into<00:02:52.590> place<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:53.160> you're<00:02:53.490> basically

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
locks into place and you're basically

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.940 
locks into place and you're basically
pulling<00:02:54.210> this<00:02:54.390> in<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.600> up<00:02:54.720> position

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
pulling this in the up position

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.900 
pulling this in the up position
expanding<00:02:55.950> both<00:02:56.070> of<00:02:56.250> these<00:02:56.340> shoes<00:02:56.640> and

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
expanding both of these shoes and

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.210 
expanding both of these shoes and
walking<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.450> driveshaft<00:02:58.050> down<00:02:58.320> so<00:02:59.100> this

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
walking this driveshaft down so this

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.740 
walking this driveshaft down so this
drive<00:02:59.460> chef's<00:02:59.700> can't<00:02:59.940> turn<00:03:00.150> one<00:03:00.360> way<00:03:00.390> or<00:03:00.660> the

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
drive chef's can't turn one way or the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.160 
drive chef's can't turn one way or the
other

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
other

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.230 
other
so<00:03:01.350> it's<00:03:01.470> completely<00:03:01.710> you<00:03:02.280> know<00:03:02.340> bound<00:03:02.670> up<00:03:02.970> and

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
so it's completely you know bound up and

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.570 
so it's completely you know bound up and
as<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:03.960> can<00:03:04.080> see<00:03:04.140> I'm<00:03:04.710> spinning<00:03:04.920> around<00:03:05.220> here

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
as you can see I'm spinning around here

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.310 
as you can see I'm spinning around here
it<00:03:05.760> goes<00:03:05.940> all<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.180> way<00:03:06.300> back<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.870> axle

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
it goes all the way back to that axle

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.510 
it goes all the way back to that axle
and<00:03:07.440> that's<00:03:07.590> what<00:03:07.710> I'm<00:03:07.770> talking<00:03:08.070> about<00:03:08.130> that

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
and that's what I'm talking about that

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.140 
and that's what I'm talking about that
axle<00:03:08.910> has<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.120> 7<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.630> 1<00:03:09.810> probably<00:03:10.650> 6<00:03:11.100> or<00:03:11.280> 7<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.640> 1<00:03:11.850> 5

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
axle has a 7 to 1 probably 6 or 7 to 1 5

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.260 
axle has a 7 to 1 probably 6 or 7 to 1 5
to<00:03:12.390> 1<00:03:12.540> gear<00:03:13.260> ratio<00:03:13.580> what<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.700> means<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.090> for

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
to 1 gear ratio what that means is for

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.510 
to 1 gear ratio what that means is for
like<00:03:15.420> every<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.990> know<00:03:16.140> one<00:03:16.800> time<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:17.250> moves

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
like every you know one time this moves

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.220 
like every you know one time this moves
every<00:03:17.820> six<00:03:18.060> times<00:03:18.270> this<00:03:18.450> moves<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.870> moves<00:03:18.900> that

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
every six times this moves it moves that

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.560 
every six times this moves it moves that
once<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.860> believe<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.910> would<00:03:21.000> be<00:03:21.090> right<00:03:21.330> I

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
once I believe that would be right I

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.570 
once I believe that would be right I
have<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.590> think<00:03:22.680> about<00:03:22.830> it<00:03:23.040> for<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.190> second<00:03:23.490> but

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
have to think about it for a second but

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.680 
have to think about it for a second but
so<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:23.760> know<00:03:23.910> basically<00:03:24.270> that's<00:03:24.390> what<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:24.600> is

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
so you know basically that's what it is

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.080 
so you know basically that's what it is
it's<00:03:25.200> going<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.380> lock<00:03:25.620> down<00:03:25.890> everything<00:03:26.760> here

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
it's going to lock down everything here

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.800 
it's going to lock down everything here
because<00:03:27.870> nothing's<00:03:28.230> gonna<00:03:28.380> turn<00:03:29.240> ok<00:03:30.270> so<00:03:30.750> now

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
because nothing's gonna turn ok so now

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
because nothing's gonna turn ok so now
I'm<00:03:30.900> gonna<00:03:30.990> take<00:03:31.140> it<00:03:31.260> apart<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.560> show<00:03:31.680> you

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830
