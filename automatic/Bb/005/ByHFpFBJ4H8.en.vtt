00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.489
 malfatto 

00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:03.620
 my father 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.569
 came from Germany and it was German it was called fruit space 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:10.879

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.769
 austria i before this austerity 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.159
 comes what was the answer in the Austro-Hungarian empire today is practice 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.759
 the clients 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.080
 criminalizes cancer or captures the master 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.009
 in vienna and they had bratislava 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.980
 My father came to Spain 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.390
 after the first world war 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.899
 and stayed in Spain 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.129
 and my mother wanted andean german spain and they got married in spain 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.900
 when I started directing 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.490
 the national orchestra of Spain 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.350
 the boss 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.650
 Told him 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.540
 it is not possible that I explained to everyone that a gentleman called 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.860
 frontex is Spanish 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.829
 so 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.860
 put something in the name 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.860
 for what 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.160
 you see that you are Spanish then my father said good 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.030
 I have come from Germany to burgos and they have treated me very well in Burgos today 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.100
 let's put rafael fride derek bourgeois because I'm also born 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.250
 in burgos 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.560
 in the Franco era in Spain 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.590
 you had to do military service 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.720
 nobody could of life everyone 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.160
 all men had pull army 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.240
 and then I who studied law also right 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.200
 had the opportunity to do it in the summers in montelarreina as second lieutenant 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.480
 as a musician 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.750
 I made an opposition 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.860
 to the band director 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.940
 I won 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.920
 and then 15 three thousand years and as director of baghdad 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.780
 viale also that he has or had the second best position in the army 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.620
 the first one could not have it because the vehicle 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.840
 when the ballet master 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.270
 We are in new environments we are not together and he invited me to come to 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.959
 direct here 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.620
 We talked about the repertoire that repertoire and I explained a bit what I think 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.629
 already very nice in a theater like the mariinsky do an opera like 'life 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.539
 brief' 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:26.549
 nor then r we agreed and came the short life 'the short life' is 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.549
 one for 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:35.129
 then you have to put a little more music because one hour is very short 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.769
 and then there was 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.629
 the intention of peace ere 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.869
 five numbers are from the Spanish suites if I had to be 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:48.859
 but did not give time to bring the material 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:49.909
 and so 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.349
 we think 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.369
 what is done in other places also 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:55.499
 super 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:57.369
 it's a symphony 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:00.369
 with a bit bittersweet taste 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:02.089
 i what 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:05.679
 it's a great preparation for a work like life 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:10.009
 to it says the recording of this Nepalese work 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:12.659
 in the year 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.659
 60 and child 4 65 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:22.529
 Maybe a little later in Spain with Los Angeles victory 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:24.839
 as a soprano 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:26.669
 a big surprise 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.389
 How was the album very successful 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.949
 we did it 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.709
 then it was known 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.269
 and how it has been very successful 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.510
 We have been without diego doing it for 40 years because of the iss 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:46.089
 first of all to say I want to say that this room where we are here is a 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:47.439
 miracle 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.729
 3 a wonder 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:54.419
 the acoustics is slowly perfect step and a beautiful end is lovely 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.889

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:00.570

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.579
 as soloists 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.199

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.119
