frame 600 millimeter and this is very

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.990 
frame 600 millimeter and this is very
nice<00:00:17.570> it's<00:00:18.570> got<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> glass<00:00:19.080> fiber<00:00:19.320> main<00:00:19.619> frame

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
nice it's got a glass fiber main frame

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.640 
nice it's got a glass fiber main frame
glass<00:00:21.000> fiber<00:00:21.330> motor<00:00:21.660> mounts<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.230> landing

tubes<00:00:26.160> for<00:00:26.490> your<00:00:26.609> booms<00:00:27.119> very<00:00:27.960> nice<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
tubes for your booms very nice the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.740 
tubes for your booms very nice the
overall<00:00:29.160> frame<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.580> lightweight<00:00:29.820> very<00:00:30.330> rigid

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
overall frame is lightweight very rigid

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.200 
overall frame is lightweight very rigid
due<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> components<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.560> made<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:32.210> one

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
due to the components is made with one

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.490 
due to the components is made with one
of<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.360> first<00:00:33.570> things<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:33.989> about<00:00:34.020> this

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
of the first things I like about this

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.709 
of the first things I like about this
particular<00:00:35.160> frame<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.940> shock<00:00:36.180> absorbing

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
particular frame is the shock absorbing

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.729 
particular frame is the shock absorbing
landing<00:00:37.260> clause

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
landing clause

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.040 
landing clause
they<00:00:38.219> are<00:00:38.489> spring<00:00:38.879> mounted<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.570> what<00:00:39.930> this

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
they are spring mounted so what this

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.660 
they are spring mounted so what this
will<00:00:40.230> do<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.440> if<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.980> rough<00:00:41.160> landing

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
will do is if you have a rough landing

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.610 
will do is if you have a rough landing
when<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.360> come<00:00:42.540> down<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:43.110> will<00:00:43.320> absorb<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
when you come down this will absorb the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.979 
when you come down this will absorb the
shock<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.670> keeps<00:00:44.879> from<00:00:45.149> transferring<00:00:45.719> that

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
shock so it keeps from transferring that

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.569 
shock so it keeps from transferring that
it's<00:00:46.170> an<00:00:46.289> impact<00:00:46.680> energy<00:00:46.920> into<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> rest<00:00:47.489> of

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
it's an impact energy into the rest of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.940 
it's an impact energy into the rest of
the<00:00:47.640> frame<00:00:47.850> which<00:00:48.510> may<00:00:48.660> cause<00:00:48.870> damage<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.770> it's

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
the frame which may cause damage so it's

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.470 
the frame which may cause damage so it's
quite<00:00:50.100> nice<00:00:50.340> especially<00:00:50.789> if<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.149> guys<00:00:51.239> just

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
quite nice especially if you guys just

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.330 
quite nice especially if you guys just
learning<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.780> fly<00:00:52.020> with<00:00:52.260> these<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.160> very

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
learning to fly with these it's a very

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.790 
learning to fly with these it's a very
forgiving<00:00:53.789> frame<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.329> not<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.079> mention<00:00:55.289> very

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
forgiving frame so not to mention very

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.350 
forgiving frame so not to mention very
cool<00:00:56.129> looking<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.640> mean<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.910> thing<00:00:57.149> looks

joke here it looks like more like a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.560 
joke here it looks like more like a
weapon<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.469> does<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> airframe<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.699> anyway

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
weapon and it does a airframe so anyway

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.789 
weapon and it does a airframe so anyway
it's<00:01:03.780> very<00:01:03.840> cool<00:01:04.260> guys<00:01:04.409> you're<00:01:04.530> gonna<00:01:04.619> like
