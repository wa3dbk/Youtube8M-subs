the radius on the range is still there

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.160 
the radius on the range is still there
like<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.730> don't<00:02:44.880> really<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.390> see<00:02:45.570> this<00:02:45.690> the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
like you don't really you see this the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.870 
like you don't really you see this the
radius<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.680> still<00:02:46.920> there<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.460> radius<00:02:47.760> is

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
radius is still there the radius is

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.940 
radius is still there the radius is
still<00:02:48.120> there<00:02:48.300> so<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.080> is<00:02:49.110> really<00:02:49.410> what

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
still there so this is really what

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.980
