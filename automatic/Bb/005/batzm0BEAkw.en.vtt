rotate<00:00:56.370> all<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.000> way<00:00:57.120> around<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.510> let's<00:00:57.750> go

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
rotate all the way around this let's go

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.830 
rotate all the way around this let's go
up<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.199> down<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> chain<00:00:59.670> missile<00:01:00.539> launcher

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
up and down is a chain missile launcher

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.720 
up and down is a chain missile launcher
and<00:01:00.930> Chinkin<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.559> retract<00:01:01.920> back<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.489> forth

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
and Chinkin can retract back and forth

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.060 
and Chinkin can retract back and forth
and<00:01:02.910> also<00:01:03.390> rotate<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.229> that's<00:01:04.409> really<00:01:04.619> cool<00:01:04.949> he

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
and also rotate so that's really cool he

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.760 
and also rotate so that's really cool he
can<00:01:05.280> fully<00:01:05.489> rotate<00:01:05.790> them<00:01:06.240> very<00:01:06.869> awesome<00:01:07.260> his

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
can fully rotate them very awesome his

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.950 
can fully rotate them very awesome his
arms<00:01:08.070> will<00:01:08.280> only<00:01:08.520> rotate<00:01:09.119> all<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.780> way<00:01:09.900> around

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
arms will only rotate all the way around

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.469 
arms will only rotate all the way around
if<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.500> lift<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.890> shoulder<00:01:11.400> pad<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:11.909> can

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
if you lift up the shoulder pad so can

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.880 
if you lift up the shoulder pad so can
rotate<00:01:12.869> them<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.409> then<00:01:13.530> they're<00:01:13.710> still

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
rotate them but then they're still

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.410 
rotate them but then they're still
hindered<00:01:14.250> by<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.670> part<00:01:14.880> right<00:01:14.939> there<00:01:15.000> and

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
hindered by that part right there and

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.320 
hindered by that part right there and
they<00:01:15.630> will<00:01:15.840> go<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.350> out<00:01:16.500> when<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.979> do<00:01:17.330> move

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
they will go in and out when you do move

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.880 
they will go in and out when you do move
the<00:01:18.479> shoulder<00:01:18.750> pads<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.229> they<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.530> kind<00:01:19.830> of

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
the shoulder pads or they can kind of

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.920 
the shoulder pads or they can kind of
move<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> shoulder<00:01:21.090> pads<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.479> but

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
move with the shoulder pads on but

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.390 
move with the shoulder pads on but
either<00:01:22.080> fully<00:01:22.500> rotate<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.009> elbow<00:01:23.100> of

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
either fully rotate at the elbow of

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.789 
either fully rotate at the elbow of
course<00:01:23.610> bend<00:01:23.909> at<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.090> elbow<00:01:24.450> his<00:01:24.900> wrists<00:01:25.290> do

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
course bend at the elbow his wrists do

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.280 
course bend at the elbow his wrists do
rotate<00:01:26.340> get<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> little<00:01:27.780> hindered<00:01:28.080> by<00:01:28.229> this

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
rotate get a little hindered by this

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.590 
rotate get a little hindered by this
part<00:01:28.740> right<00:01:28.799> here<00:01:28.860> he<00:01:29.520> does<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.939> upper<00:01:30.360> elbow

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
part right here he does have upper elbow

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.630 
part right here he does have upper elbow
articulation<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.470> really<00:01:31.890> tough<00:01:32.340> and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
articulation but it's really tough and

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.880 
articulation but it's really tough and
because<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.270> upper<00:01:33.659> arm<00:01:33.869> right<00:01:34.110> here<00:01:34.170> but

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
because of this upper arm right here but

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.830 
because of this upper arm right here but
it<00:01:34.979> will<00:01:35.130> move<00:01:35.400> if<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.790> force<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.720> be

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
it will move if you force it but just be
