00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
I also love this it's a macro switch

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.440 
I also love this it's a macro switch
located<00:03:17.250> right<00:03:17.460> on<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.670> top<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.209> device

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
that kind of inches on these small flip

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.110 
that kind of inches on these small flip
style<00:03:31.020> cameras<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.860> little<00:03:32.400> bit<00:03:32.520> more<00:03:32.700> toward

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
memory that's what you get with it and

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.040 
memory that's what you get with it and
it's<00:03:44.220> might<00:03:44.610> sound<00:03:45.030> like<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.239> lot<00:03:45.450> but<00:03:45.510> consider

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050

this I was shooting 1080 pixel video on
this<00:03:49.680> camera<00:03:50.070> and<00:03:50.489> it<00:03:50.580> was<00:03:50.670> clocking<00:03:51.030> in<00:03:51.360> at

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
this camera and it was clocking in at

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.690 
this camera and it was clocking in at
about<00:03:52.550> 1.3<00:03:53.550> megabytes<00:03:54.060> per<00:03:54.450> second<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:55.950> 128

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
about 1.3 megabytes per second so 128

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.580 
about 1.3 megabytes per second so 128
megabytes<00:03:56.910> of<00:03:57.270> storage<00:03:57.330> doesn't<00:03:58.080> really<00:03:58.230> get
