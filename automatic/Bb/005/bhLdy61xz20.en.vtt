00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.830 
well okay whoo I actually popped off up
there<00:02:47.350> for<00:02:47.680> once<00:02:47.830> usually<00:02:48.580> you<00:02:48.730> just<00:02:48.760> go<00:02:49.600> down

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
there for once usually you just go down

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.600 
there for once usually you just go down
the<00:02:50.020> slope<00:02:51.420> no<00:02:52.420> no<00:02:52.600> that's<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.890> for<00:02:54.489> that

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
the slope no no that's that for that

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.460 
the slope no no that's that for that
level<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:57.850> know<00:02:57.940> this<00:02:58.090> game<00:02:58.239> is<00:02:58.390> fairly<00:02:58.930> short

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
level you know this game is fairly short

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.140 
level you know this game is fairly short
if<00:02:59.800> you<00:02:59.920> only<00:03:00.070> point<00:03:00.520> through<00:03:00.730> as<00:03:00.820> one

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
if you only point through as one

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.330 
if you only point through as one
character<00:03:01.690> but<00:03:01.959> if<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:02.590> play<00:03:02.800> through<00:03:03.010> is<00:03:03.130> all

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
character but if you play through is all

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.340 
character but if you play through is all
them<00:03:03.640> then<00:03:03.880> it's<00:03:04.090> definitely<00:03:04.900> going<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:05.140> take

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
them then it's definitely going to take

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.160 
them then it's definitely going to take
you<00:03:05.560> awhile<00:03:08.760> okay<00:03:09.760> as<00:03:09.910> tails<00:03:10.269> you<00:03:10.780> can<00:03:10.930> get

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
you awhile okay as tails you can get

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.530 
you awhile okay as tails you can get
through<00:03:11.410> here<00:03:11.709> easily<00:03:12.010> because<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:13.420> don't

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
through here easily because you don't

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.020 
through here easily because you don't
have<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:13.690> make<00:03:13.900> it<00:03:14.049> any<00:03:14.200> tricky<00:03:14.590> jumps<00:03:15.070> or

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
have to make it any tricky jumps or

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.789 
have to make it any tricky jumps or
anything<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.840> sort<00:03:18.989> but<00:03:19.989> here<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:20.650> can

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
anything of the sort but here you can

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.690 
anything of the sort but here you can
just<00:03:20.830> fly<00:03:21.280> up<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.610> this<00:03:22.030> weird<00:03:22.540> formation<00:03:23.410> and

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
just fly up to this weird formation and

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.690 
just fly up to this weird formation and
jump<00:03:24.700> up<00:03:24.820> and<00:03:25.350> this<00:03:26.350> leads<00:03:26.739> to<00:03:27.040> a<00:03:27.220> rather

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
jump up and this leads to a rather

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.390 
jump up and this leads to a rather
glitchy<00:03:28.209> area<00:03:28.840> Oh
