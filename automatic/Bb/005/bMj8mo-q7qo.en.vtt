00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.550
 and here they are on yak wee for the holiday came to us 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.040
 what holiday is more important than 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.500
 new year for russian people 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.339
 only christmas egypt 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:12.209
 instead do the same decent 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:14.990
 light easter's attitude it will last 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.880
 someone buys them who does it 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.630
 so everyone has their own names of those who are even 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.170
 now 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.910
 in case of non-payment of our native village, we 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.000
 we know how nothing is needed here 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 check let's go back in the past q 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.860
 Besides 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.300
 that very basic ingredient noting 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.860
 this of course we missed are friends 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.640
 oils make up a small percentage but even 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.210
 the atheists of butter will be red handed 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.920
 tasty if of course the oil was too 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.870
 delicious 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.640
 but in our production 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.550
 particular production in Russia 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.140
 we assume that it becomes 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.160
 harder 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.420
 and but he likes to push out so that 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.950
 the consistency about the products will be personal 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.950
 its function is sea natural 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.360
 in other issuers as well 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.370
 preferable to use 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.369
 jointly oils because 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.760
 the rally with this oil it is saved 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.940
 no more 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.030
 marketable condition 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.200
 average temperature 39 of view 113 not 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.950
 hiding 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.220
 on daman use i personally 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.730
 I prefer Sevastyanov and therefore 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.800
 what does it suit for a more natural 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.719
 taste 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.480
 oil consistency 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.890
 it corresponds to the national 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.729
 simple products that are more 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.250
 short term i prefer 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.930
 use these products in 7 5 m 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.610
 betting because here immediately to mind 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.900
 takadas to the most 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.300
 naturalness about torture arrests 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.370
 decided to check the minister of oil 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.110
 Sernur factory from very suitable for 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.060
 baking cakes with the help of a survey but 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.020
 it turned out that a very small percentage 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.820
 modern women bake cakes Sane 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.750
 However, this does not mean that they are not oil 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.750
 enjoy wrinkles otherwise this is not the first 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.040
 but if the reason 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.040
 most likely this will happen 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:22.999
 she like 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.549
 this practice 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.619
 when he returns to his homeland 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:30.189
 in the driver's seat 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.189
 f rewrote each time 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:36.779
 local products 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:41.019
 portrait and then pay both packages 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.019
 according to apa 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:46.509
 I like all of our model we 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:47.499
 use 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.009
 but if the reasons for the final oil is still 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:51.699
 need to replace unnatural 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:53.959
 finally what the ice cream fell 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.419
 such a recipe does not justify itself here 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.899
 just need just perfect 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:59.539
 a machine 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:00.589
 for cooking traditional 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:02.090
 Easter dishes 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.249
 such as 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.609
 Easter cakes and Easter 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.239
 gentlemen of hosts is a high quality 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.729
 in dairy products 

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:11.529
 but particulars are not so easy for the products 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:13.949
 after stopping the plant and maybe us 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:15.359
 just ask how alone 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.349
 becomes factories of course 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.109
 someone else has representatives 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.099
 enterprises can they officially their mass 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.319
 deal days of Easter dishes especially to 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.569
 holiday made a discount on the cream 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.709
 butter 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.449
 is he capable of just a good habitual 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:33.359
 because firstly on commodity and raw materials 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.019
 on top of 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.290
 it makes wonderful 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.509
 Easter cakes and a wonderful pass 

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.979
 and do not want 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.380
 search yourself also help 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.810
 with this post wish them 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.279
 caring 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:46.359
 more and more Georgians 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.879
 and really while we figured out what 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.859
 make a festive meal almost 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.499
 forgot and he himself the main holidays 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.819
 witnesses a bright resurrection not 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.309
 forget and for what it's all done all of you 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.189
 beloved brothers and sisters 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:05.469
 happy holiday 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:08.469
 all this needs to take into account that sunday 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.519
 resurrected Christ 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:13.739
 one of them 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.369
 our hearts 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:17.370
 and will even serve 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.840
 for all of us 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.900
 their 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.460
 networking 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.449
 Estonians 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.309
 Sunday 

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:26.599
 truly 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.799
 that is, completely eradicated
