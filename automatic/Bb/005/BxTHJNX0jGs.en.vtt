00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.590
 in today's video you will learn how 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.630
 customize a white t-shirt using 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.150
 improvised stamps 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.910
 We'll customize and leave it well. 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:33.100
 colorful to make we will use 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.900
 caps of various sizes or 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.129
 any other object you have in 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:42.180
 house can also be these washers that 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:45.160
 they will have a very interesting effect 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.710
 let's use some fabric paints 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.450
 in the colors you want but think of 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.450
 a cool color combination here 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.350
 We'll need a piece too. 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.350
 cardboard and a brush 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.589
 of course we need a shirt 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.589
 white 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.190
 We'll start by putting the cardboard 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.869
 inside the shirt so that the ink does not 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.450
 back to back 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.720
 you can use a cardboard the size of 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.860
 t-shirts a little piece like that I 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.960
 I'm using 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.750
 however you have to move it every 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.750
 time to paint a part of the shirt 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.560
 and come on you will see how simple it is 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.410
 just put paint on the lid she goes 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.289
 act as a kind of affection 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.390
 cover the entire cover and then 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.640
 tighten against the fabric 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.640
 that way the ink will stay on the shirt 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.760
 I'll start with the blue color. 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.140
 my customization will be very happy 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.910
 with various colors 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:09.160
 but you can do with the colors that 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:12.899
 preferred and it's so simple just press 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.899
 the cover in the fabric 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.980
 when you do you will notice that the ink does not 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.620
 adheres equally as a common stamp 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.040
 he has failures and the grace of this 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.860
 customization is right there you 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.560
 can even pass more ink in a 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.459
 the sides so that the stamp 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.459
 irregular 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.860
 good after stamping with the color blue 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.860
 now I'll start putting other colors 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.989
 It's so simple and so delicious to do. 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.650
 customize is very good 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.840
 is like a therapy and this customization is 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.450
 so easy you can call it that way 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.220
 the children to do or even who 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.800

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.760
 experience with handicrafts because it is 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.760
 very simple 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.790
