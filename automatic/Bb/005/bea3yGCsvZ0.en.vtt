00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
gone with the Asics running shoe now as

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.520 
gone with the Asics running shoe now as
you<00:02:02.759> can<00:02:02.880> see<00:02:02.939> on<00:02:03.329> an<00:02:03.479> ASIC<00:02:03.869> or<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> running

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
you can see on an ASIC or on a running

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.139 
you can see on an ASIC or on a running
shoe<00:02:04.649> any<00:02:04.829> running<00:02:05.130> shoe<00:02:05.310> you'll<00:02:05.610> notice<00:02:06.000> that

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
shoe any running shoe you'll notice that

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.139 
shoe any running shoe you'll notice that
the<00:02:06.299> back<00:02:06.899> part<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.469> very<00:02:08.220> thick<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
the back part is very thick and the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:09.440 
the back part is very thick and the
reason

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
reason

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.530 
reason
why<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.629> because<00:02:10.700> when<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.879> run<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.450> are

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
why is because when you run you are

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.750 
why is because when you run you are
going<00:02:12.810> forward<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.500> it's<00:02:14.010> designed<00:02:14.519> to

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
going forward and it's designed to

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.210 
going forward and it's designed to
handle<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.209> impact<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.470> forward<00:02:16.739> motion

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
handle the impact of this forward motion

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.550 
handle the impact of this forward motion
so<00:02:17.400> some<00:02:17.670> people<00:02:17.940> will<00:02:18.150> he'll<00:02:18.810> strike<00:02:19.140> meaning

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
so some people will he'll strike meaning

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.290 
so some people will he'll strike meaning
that<00:02:19.650> they'll<00:02:19.830> they'll<00:02:20.370> hit<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.760> heel<00:02:21.030> and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
that they'll they'll hit the heel and

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.940 
that they'll they'll hit the heel and
then<00:02:21.450> run<00:02:21.690> this<00:02:21.840> way<00:02:22.019> some<00:02:22.319> will<00:02:22.470> toe<00:02:22.650> strike

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
then run this way some will toe strike

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.949 
then run this way some will toe strike
and<00:02:23.190> they'll<00:02:23.280> hit<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.550> toe<00:02:23.760> first<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.360> then

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
and they'll hit the toe first and then

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.809 
and they'll hit the toe first and then
go<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.319> way<00:02:25.470> but<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:26.160> way<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.489> running

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
go that way but the way that running

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.100 
go that way but the way that running
shoes<00:02:27.000> are<00:02:27.120> designed<00:02:27.239> it's<00:02:27.630> supposed<00:02:27.989> to

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
shoes are designed it's supposed to

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.620 
shoes are designed it's supposed to
handle<00:02:28.470> all<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.769> that<00:02:29.310> impact<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.209> forward

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
handle all of that impact of the forward

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.620 
handle all of that impact of the forward
movement<00:02:31.580> now<00:02:32.580> because<00:02:32.880> my<00:02:33.090> workouts<00:02:33.480> are

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
movement now because my workouts are

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.420 
movement now because my workouts are
usually<00:02:34.019> combination<00:02:34.620> workouts<00:02:34.950> like<00:02:35.099> I<00:02:35.250> will

lifting weights and again it's not bad

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.920 
lifting weights and again it's not bad
for<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:44.670> what<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.060> article<00:02:45.420> stated<00:02:45.660> was

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
for you but what the article stated was

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.470 
for you but what the article stated was
you're<00:02:46.380> not<00:02:46.410> getting<00:02:46.980> as<00:02:47.180> effective<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.390> a

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
you're not getting as effective of a

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.970 
you're not getting as effective of a
workout<00:02:48.840> if<00:02:49.049> you're<00:02:49.290> going<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.680> be<00:02:49.769> doing

squats and lunges and running shoes

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.750 
squats and lunges and running shoes
because<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.769> thickness<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.459> heel

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
because of the thickness of the heel

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.789 
because of the thickness of the heel
it's<00:02:54.299> like<00:02:54.510> if<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.780> wore<00:02:54.989> high<00:02:55.200> heels<00:02:55.230> and

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
it's like if you wore high heels and

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.539 
it's like if you wore high heels and
then<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.040> did<00:02:56.810> squats<00:02:57.810> well<00:02:58.410> your<00:02:59.099> booty<00:02:59.430> is

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
then you did squats well your booty is

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.949 
then you did squats well your booty is
kind<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.819> already<00:02:59.970> elevated<00:03:00.569> because<00:03:00.720> you're

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
kind of already elevated because you're

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.660 
kind of already elevated because you're
in<00:03:01.079> a<00:03:01.140> heel<00:03:01.319> so<00:03:01.530> you're<00:03:01.680> not<00:03:01.829> really<00:03:02.190> targeting

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
in a heel so you're not really targeting

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.339 
in a heel so you're not really targeting
that<00:03:02.790> area<00:03:03.150> if<00:03:03.540> you've<00:03:03.720> ever<00:03:03.870> taken<00:03:04.019> like<00:03:04.319> a

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
article suggested was to get a shoe

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.289 
article suggested was to get a shoe

specifically designed for weight
training<00:03:39.329> and<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:40.049> guess<00:03:40.799> I<00:03:40.950> just<00:03:41.160> never<00:03:41.340> really

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
training and I guess I just never really

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.860 
training and I guess I just never really
thought<00:03:41.910> about<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:42.359> because<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.660> have

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
thought about that because I have

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.870 
thought about that because I have

involve a lot of running and jumping

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.920 
involve a lot of running and jumping
because<00:04:38.669> it<00:04:38.789> doesn't<00:04:39.030> have<00:04:39.180> that<00:04:39.210> kind<00:04:39.509> of

because it doesn't have that kind of

because it doesn't have that kind of
cushioning<00:04:40.409> this<00:04:40.860> shoe<00:04:41.159> it's<00:04:41.969> very<00:04:42.330> flexible

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
cushioning this shoe it's very flexible

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.679 
cushioning this shoe it's very flexible
and<00:04:43.500> very<00:04:43.680> flimsy<00:04:44.280> but<00:04:45.060> you'll<00:04:45.210> notice<00:04:45.539> that

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:45.689 
and very flimsy but you'll notice that

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:47.899 
and very flimsy but you'll notice that
the<00:04:45.960> heel<00:04:46.229> of<00:04:46.500> this<00:04:46.650> one<00:04:46.860> is<00:04:47.039> so<00:04:47.370> much<00:04:47.610> thinner

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
the heel of this one is so much thinner

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.029 
the heel of this one is so much thinner
than<00:04:48.539> the<00:04:48.719> heel<00:04:48.930> of<00:04:49.139> my<00:04:49.169> running<00:04:49.620> shoe<00:04:49.860> it's

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
than the heel of my running shoe it's

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.360 
than the heel of my running shoe it's
probably<00:04:50.699> I<00:04:51.289> would<00:04:52.289> say<00:04:52.319> a<00:04:52.530> good<00:04:52.949> three

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
probably I would say a good three

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.879 
probably I would say a good three
quarters<00:04:53.759> of<00:04:53.789> an<00:04:54.030> inch<00:04:54.240> thinner<00:04:55.080> so<00:04:55.469> when<00:04:55.770> you

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
I weight train I will usually start off

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.490 
I weight train I will usually start off
with<00:05:08.150> just<00:05:09.150> to<00:05:09.270> warm<00:05:09.750> up<00:05:09.840> my<00:05:09.870> lower<00:05:10.110> body<00:05:10.319> I'll

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
with just to warm up my lower body I'll

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.290 
with just to warm up my lower body I'll
usually<00:05:10.800> start<00:05:10.979> off<00:05:11.099> with<00:05:11.279> a<00:05:11.310> hundred<00:05:11.550> walking

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
usually start off with a hundred walking

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.140 
usually start off with a hundred walking
lunges<00:05:12.629> that's<00:05:13.020> what<00:05:13.139> I<00:05:13.199> do<00:05:13.259> that's<00:05:14.000> just<00:05:15.000> how

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
lunges that's what I do that's just how

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.240 
lunges that's what I do that's just how
I<00:05:15.180> do<00:05:15.360> it<00:05:15.629> I<00:05:15.930> find<00:05:16.560> that<00:05:16.710> it<00:05:16.830> just<00:05:16.860> gets

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
I do it I find that it just gets

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.950 
I do it I find that it just gets
everything<00:05:17.610> like<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.120> blood<00:05:18.360> pumping<00:05:18.569> and

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
everything like the blood pumping and

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.339 
everything like the blood pumping and
it's<00:05:19.590> not<00:05:19.770> too<00:05:20.159> harsh<00:05:20.879> on<00:05:21.210> my<00:05:21.599> lower<00:05:21.779> half<00:05:22.080> but

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
it's not too harsh on my lower half but

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.140 
it's not too harsh on my lower half but
it<00:05:22.439> definitely<00:05:22.919> warms<00:05:23.490> up<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.699> muscle<00:05:24.000> so<00:05:24.120> I

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
it definitely warms up the muscle so I

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.059 
it definitely warms up the muscle so I
can<00:05:24.330> start<00:05:24.509> adding<00:05:24.719> weight<00:05:24.960> when<00:05:25.770> I<00:05:25.800> did<00:05:26.039> I

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:26.069 
can start adding weight when I did I

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:28.070 
can start adding weight when I did I
made<00:05:26.219> my<00:05:26.370> running<00:05:26.669> shoes<00:05:26.879> I<00:05:27.180> could<00:05:27.270> do<00:05:27.629> you

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:30.029 
because I do them pretty often weekly I

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:32.420 
because I do them pretty often weekly I
could<00:05:30.389> do<00:05:30.539> a<00:05:30.569> hundred<00:05:30.779> walking<00:05:31.620> lunges<00:05:31.919> kind
