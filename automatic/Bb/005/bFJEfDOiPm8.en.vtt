00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.460
 in the t5 of the construction manual that the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:22.699
 Headmistress will be the inside of 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.590
 hull and covers laminated with glass fabric 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:33.540
 I remove all of them first 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:35.730
 wires and loop the connections 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.280
 between the plates easily with it 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.280
 full stories fit better on them 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.320
 I'll do it and in Rome too 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.030
 Quiet the oxide roadkill with fiberglass 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.030
 strengthened the bank 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.790
 Next, I'll cut that 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:29.280
 glass fabric rightly that in the 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.280
 hull and want to insert into the deck 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.650
 I use a standard fabric of 163 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:42.040
 grams per square meter 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:46.800
 that I insert myself in the trunk and at 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.800
 cut off the pages 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.799
 here you do not have a continuous train 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.630
 you can also take the fabric pieces 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.030
 The approaches will come later 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.479
 provide all hire because it is so 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.380
 You can act around the inner ship 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.009
 so also like rest pieces together 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.350
 lay 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.459
 so you do not have so why do you have 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.459
 not too much waste 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.049
 while I'm in the trunk he already 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.830
 fiberglass reinforced sake fed 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:48.269
 I have the deck at the moment 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:52.410
 provisionally glued the end I now 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:55.250
 in which I also peel thin in the 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.250
 nice feed 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.210
 I distribute that with the epoxide mass 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.150
 a pouch as I do it in the 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:15.260
 hull did and then press it with 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.260
 a plastic spoon into the sewed into 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.320
 I put on the still fresh throats 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.750
 now the previously cut to the right 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:04:00.160
 Glass cloth on and laminate with and 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:03.130
 covered with oxide on the wood 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.530
 I use a soft spatula to 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.350
 I slightly rounded at the edges 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.540
 so that he does not pull threads out with 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:18.540
 the spatula I now distribute the 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:22.150
 Epoxid on the glass and try so 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.230
 uniform to uniform uniform 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.680
 to reach the train of the glass 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:34.620
 in the end , no light and may 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:37.660
 no shiny surfaces left over 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.120
 you see bright spots is too few apps 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.360
 oxide applied to the dark spots 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:48.760
 on the shiny surfaces there 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.650
 there is too much happening on the glass 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.040
 I repeated the same in the same now 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.040
 hull 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.950
 I have the complete fabric 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:29.510
 let evenly separated with epoxide 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:33.180
 I e book now looks herten 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.550
 and remove after curing so on 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.560
 usually that next day 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:44.910
 overhanging glass fabric with a 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:48.180
 sharp knife the glass fabric has decreased 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:51.890
 the first to laminate one more 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.600
 very prominent every structure of this 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:57.840
 Fabric will now be layered with more layers 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:01.380
 conclusion I have to fill up first 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.530
 The first layer is easy to sand 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.700
 and then one or two more 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:11.310
 Layer epoxide with a foam roller 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:15.530
 roll on until the 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.530
 tissue structure is no longer recognizable
