 fundamentally a method of 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.290
 self-defense is a system that is 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.320
 always an evolution adapting 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.780
 constantly to these needs the

 he kajukenbo has more grip includes 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.380
 levers in joints bumps 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.150
 low and attacks with the help of 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.280
 combinations concentrating 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.470
 mainly in real combat and in 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.630
 the effectiveness avoiding movements and 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.490
 practical and spectacular and the plans 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.950
 of studies include counterattacks 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.740
 against knife fist techniques 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.400
 also cane firearms and holds 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.400
 and immobilizations 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.040
 We have an original style 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.740
 Hawaiian city was created in the year 47 and 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.900
 the year 49 by five great masters of 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.230
 different martial arts came together 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:15.040
 creating the black belt society 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.989
 during this period they have been creating or 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.959
 have been exchanging concepts of 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.010
 different studios creating and creating what 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.799
 which is known today as the 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.890
 kajukenbo that direct adriano expected 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.200
 the maximum the maximum exponent of the 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.299
 cairo time the creator and founder the 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.299
 who started transmitting it in hawaii 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.879
 first in the 50s and from the 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.910
 60s on the American continent to 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:42.700
 alejos through kings of forms 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.349
 elton löning we authorize large 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.349
 teachers who are today 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.490
 the master emperor passed away on the 6th 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.050
 April 2009 and left as suppressor 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.520
 of the system 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.470
 the highest representative worldwide 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.580
 to mister grand master angel garcía 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.870
 soldier as we say angel garcía 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.230
 started with the stem burned in the year 73 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.440
 a turret air base a navy 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.680
 American called the nyse pac and from 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.840
 of 1984 happened to be under the tutelage 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.090
 direct from the founder and the creator of 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.099
 system 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.629
 has appointed director for europe 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:35.700
 Central America and South America 's system 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.590
 Angel has been evolving the system 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.989
 with the authorization of emperor demand 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.060
 until you create the canyon time just as 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.819
 we know today in europe there are some 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.430
 differences in the European field and the one that 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.489
 there is an American tempo 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.829
 in part work the great merit of this is 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.640
 the work and the work of programs for 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.640
 take care of soldiers 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.049
 is a style that was created by and for 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.299
 self defense is a very style 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.000
 simple very direct very effective 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.609
 tremendously effective on the street because 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.190
 will abide by the problem the problem 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.289
 we emerge from a radical way 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.280
 people who come to give us a blow then 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.979
 is going to be found as a reaction 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.160
 forceful a forceful traction with 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.780
 1 2 3 4 strokes if necessary to 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.199
 avoid a second attack by his 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:36.289
 part we play a lot with the surprise that 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.870
 was created for the street the people that 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.760
 he created the system 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.460
 he worked all his life to the public service 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.350
 as policemen as military know a 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.950
 little what is self-defense 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.950
 street 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:01.389
 if there is a time it is a system that 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:03.849
 based on a method of working a method 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.099
 of work a work program for 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.330
 each degree each degree that has to 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:11.210
 be happening 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.830
 know the techniques that are required 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.140
 to pass the sacred 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.330
 It consists of defenses against fist 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.940
 defenses against ran defense against 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.590
 knife and defenses against stick 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.900
 we also had defenses against several 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.900
 two or three adversaries like many more 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.010
 when the system was created the system 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:41.320
 Kajukenbo created it was created by 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.900
 five great masters who practiced 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.720
 totally different styles as they are 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.030
 the deep times 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.820
 we know today as judo taekwondo 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.270
 jiu jitsu time that is the base is the 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.010
 base of the Chinese tempo and boxing system 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.700
 a north china style is not bad 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.700
 without a country 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.849
 the system cal and time is usually 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:15.389
 work normally in pairs 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:17.370
 couples to see the striking angles 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:19.080
 the angles of direction that comes the 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.629
 hit that as we have to do the 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.370
 defense the depth that we have to 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:25.849
 put in each stroke then good the 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.349
 Working as a couple allows us to visualize 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:31.710
 all those concepts that are what the 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:33.960
 that we work with more weight in a blow 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.860
 in another blow if we have to load more 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.860
 companies elsewhere 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.720
 with couples because it's really where you 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.720
 see the effectiveness of the system
