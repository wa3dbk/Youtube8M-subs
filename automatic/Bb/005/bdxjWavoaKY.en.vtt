00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.880 
like doing this I there's no need for me
to<00:02:46.390> do<00:02:46.570> this<00:02:46.660> so<00:02:46.780> why<00:02:46.930> would<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.200> complete<00:02:47.740> the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
to do this so why would I complete the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.710 
to do this so why would I complete the
map<00:02:48.070> because<00:02:48.580> I<00:02:48.640> don't<00:02:48.880> want<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.180> do<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.570> it's

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
map because I don't want to do it it's

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.400 
map because I don't want to do it it's
so<00:02:49.930> boring<00:02:50.580> anyways<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:52.270> thing<00:02:52.510> I'm<00:02:52.750> doing<00:02:52.810> is

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
so boring anyways the thing I'm doing is

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.950 
so boring anyways the thing I'm doing is
using<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:54.190> low<00:02:54.940> level<00:02:55.120> character<00:02:55.600> from<00:02:55.780> the

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
using a low level character from the

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.230 
using a low level character from the
beginning<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.710> going<00:02:57.430> through<00:02:57.490> all<00:02:57.790> the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
beginning and going through all the

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.810 
beginning and going through all the
low-level<00:02:59.200> area<00:02:59.710> so<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.040> will<00:03:00.400> start<00:03:00.490> a<00:03:00.700> new

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
low-level area so I will start a new

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.640 
low-level area so I will start a new
character<00:03:01.030> which<00:03:01.420> I'm<00:03:01.570> doing<00:03:01.900> on<00:03:02.020> my<00:03:02.200> guardian

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
character which I'm doing on my guardian

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.700 
character which I'm doing on my guardian
now<00:03:02.830> is<00:03:03.510> going<00:03:04.510> through<00:03:04.870> all<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.290> starting

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
now is going through all the starting

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.710 
now is going through all the starting
areas<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.460> then<00:03:06.730> keep<00:03:07.030> going<00:03:07.060> up<00:03:07.480> from<00:03:07.660> there

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
areas and then keep going up from there

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.900 
areas and then keep going up from there
so<00:03:08.050> I<00:03:08.080> go<00:03:08.290> through<00:03:08.530> all<00:03:08.800> five<00:03:09.340> of<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.700> 1

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
so I go through all five of the 1

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.230 
so I go through all five of the 1
through<00:03:10.240> 15<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.140> then<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:12.130> other<00:03:12.160> three<00:03:12.910> or

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
through 15 and then the other three or

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.490 
through 15 and then the other three or
four<00:03:13.600> of<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.050> 15<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.880> 25<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.390> then<00:03:17.110> I<00:03:17.260> keep

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
four of the 15 to 25 and then I keep

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.470 
four of the 15 to 25 and then I keep
going<00:03:17.830> up<00:03:17.950> like<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.460> so<00:03:18.850> there's<00:03:19.330> an

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
going up like that so there's an

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.510 
going up like that so there's an
incentive<00:03:19.750> because<00:03:20.080> you're<00:03:20.320> leveling<00:03:20.800> up<00:03:21.040> you

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
incentive because you're leveling up you

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.570 
incentive because you're leveling up you
know<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:22.360> need<00:03:22.660> also<00:03:23.470> you<00:03:23.530> need<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:24.070> gifts<00:03:24.490> of

know you need also you need the gifts of

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.490 
know you need also you need the gifts of
exploration<00:03:25.420> which<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:25.810> get<00:03:25.990> two<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.230> them

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
exploration which you get two of them

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.130 
exploration which you get two of them
for<00:03:26.560> completing<00:03:27.340> map<00:03:27.610> completion<00:03:28.270> you<00:03:28.990> need

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
for completing map completion you need

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.730 
for completing map completion you need
two<00:03:29.380> of<00:03:29.410> those<00:03:29.740> two<00:03:31.140> well<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:32.350> don't<00:03:32.410> need<00:03:32.560> two
