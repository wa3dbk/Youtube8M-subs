00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.630
 today for a new video on 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.860
 will start without a series of videos 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.210
 to realize of them but 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.640
 the harlequin and in this delicious 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.140
 titillate your clothes so find yourself 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.940
 will be done in three parts the first 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.619
 today we will realize the disc him 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.420
 did dance then kneels hot and a 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.370
 almond biscuit often part 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.989
 a compote of sentences and a bag in 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.140
 last part there see a chocolate 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.180
 white editing and decor so we go 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.320
 to start 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.610
 first of all the biscuit would have started 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.329
 first almond biscuit 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.230
 for that we need minced almonds 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.690
 of sugar euros and drink to moulis when 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.739
 we like to travel lightly makes a 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.840
 little too much but it's 6 3 the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.780
 mix more your beloved is 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.229
 softened the more we get to work 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.229
 in our circle 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.990
 so we 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.310
 get a slightly mellow texture 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.619
 but we can still work 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.180
 and for high school after in the circle 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.990
 so some people use 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.420
 there is no ointment butter but 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.640
 rather cold butter but cons 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.899
 they work this pink biscuit between 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.640
 two sheets of parchment paper 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.340
 we see the most practical is the block 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.200
 monk or and understand well also more 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.610
 easy and faster and in ground 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.340
 can the mold and easily in the 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:44.000
 circle so then once I 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.390
 could it be for him to go to the bottom at 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.550
 bakery goes slightly inflated you think 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.409
 to do it anyway and 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:59.060
 do this in a 170 degree oven 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:02.000
 during about varied so remember 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.920

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.380

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.549

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.350

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.280
 cookie biscuit pistachio on mix of 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.500

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:42.440

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.110

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.670
 we think of the gym and amber a background of 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:19.250
 hazel color 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:21.380
 yes neighboring colorations do not want 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.160
 to say cramer cramer it's true it's not 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.740
 very good for health 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.130

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.130

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.450
 I'm waiting I'm waiting to see the answer 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.250
 of the partnership I see having shared 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.569
 with a salon site with all these 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.030
 ingredients there and it's not bad it's 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:18.510
 natural 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.729
 the very very very very good product all 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.550
 with natural flavors or jasmine it's 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.139
 this is frankly the site and hop 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.729
 I'm waiting to see the answer is no I 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.520
 must receive products 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.380
 so if that's the case play near the 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.960
 reference the link of their site in vain to 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.790
 background so that's so I ate that of 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.360
 the pistachio tap so do not 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.720
 Warning 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.010
 when I made 7 of them but I 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.470
 did not have too many benchmarks 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.229

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.389
 amount 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.700
