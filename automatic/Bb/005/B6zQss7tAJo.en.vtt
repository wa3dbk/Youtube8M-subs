here's<00:00:15.830> the<00:00:16.039> thing<00:00:16.309> that<00:00:16.340> makes<00:00:16.730> life<00:00:17.029> so

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
here's the thing that makes life so

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.110 
here's the thing that makes life so
interesting<00:00:18.250> the<00:00:19.250> theory<00:00:19.700> of<00:00:19.730> evolution

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:20.120 
interesting the theory of evolution

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
interesting the theory of evolution
claims<00:00:20.900> only<00:00:21.410> the<00:00:21.530> strong<00:00:21.830> shall<00:00:22.250> survive

maybe<00:00:24.140> so<00:00:24.470> maybe<00:00:25.030> so<00:00:27.070> but<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:28.250> theory<00:00:28.550> of

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
maybe so maybe so but the theory of

maybe so maybe so but the theory of
competition<00:00:29.630> says<00:00:29.930> just<00:00:30.770> because<00:00:30.830> they're

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
the strong doesn't mean they can't get

but what the odds don't know is this
isn't<00:00:52.870> a<00:00:52.930> math<00:00:53.170> test<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:55.090> is<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:55.480> completely

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
isn't a math test this is a completely

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.020 
isn't a math test this is a completely
different<00:00:56.649> kind<00:00:56.949> of<00:00:57.160> test<00:00:57.839> one<00:00:58.839> where<00:00:59.140> passion

different kind of test one where passion

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.250 
different kind of test one where passion
has<00:01:01.030> a<00:01:01.059> funny<00:01:01.449> way<00:01:01.540> of<00:01:01.690> trumping<00:01:02.320> logic

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
has a funny way of trumping logic

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.560 
has a funny way of trumping logic
so<00:01:04.890> before<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.340> step<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.910> the<00:01:06.060> starting

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
so before you step up to the starting

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.160 
so before you step up to the starting
line<00:01:07.520> before<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.760> whistle<00:01:09.030> blows<00:01:09.480> and<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
line before the whistle blows and the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.070 
line before the whistle blows and the
clock<00:01:10.410> starts<00:01:10.440> ticking<00:01:11.360> just<00:01:12.360> remember<00:01:12.870> out

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
clock starts ticking just remember out

clock starts ticking just remember out
here<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.520> results<00:01:14.970> don't<00:01:15.180> always<00:01:15.510> add<00:01:15.690> up

all<00:01:27.590> bets<00:01:28.070> are<00:01:28.370> off<00:01:29.260> don't<00:01:30.260> be<00:01:30.380> surprised<00:01:30.890> if
