00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
you can see that but that's in a tan and

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.910 
you can see that but that's in a tan and
the<00:01:49.970> variation<00:01:50.659> on<00:01:50.899> this<00:01:51.110> one<00:01:51.350> is<00:01:51.470> I<00:01:51.590> don't<00:01:51.770> use

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
just I generally I like to tie it in on

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.800 
just I generally I like to tie it in on
my<00:02:13.010> side<00:02:13.540> this<00:02:14.540> is<00:02:14.600> tricky<00:02:15.489> here<00:02:16.489> put<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.480> in<00:02:17.630> a

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
my side this is tricky here put it in a

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.320 
my side this is tricky here put it in a
vise<00:02:18.200> okay<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.160> hook<00:02:22.430> on<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.730> sides<00:02:23.060> is

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
vise okay so so the hook on the sides is

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:32.080 
vise okay so so the hook on the sides is
tied<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:28.900> fold<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.110> over<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.880> actually<00:02:31.880> want

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090

tied and fold it over and actually want
to<00:02:32.180> advance<00:02:33.079> a<00:02:33.440> little<00:02:33.650> more<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.760> eye<00:02:34.790> to

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
to advance a little more to the eye to

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:44.550 
to advance a little more to the eye to
make<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.660> nice<00:02:35.930> head<00:02:38.769> fold<00:02:39.769> it<00:02:39.890> over

tournament<00:02:47.230> flip<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.380> upside<00:02:48.709> down

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:03:02.289 

tie<00:02:53.209> it<00:02:53.269> in<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.900> bottom

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.880 

this<00:03:03.299> one<00:03:03.510> has<00:03:03.810> bigger<00:03:04.140> head<00:03:04.439> than<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.709> other

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
this one has bigger head than the other

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.319 
this one has bigger head than the other
one<00:03:05.189> and<00:03:05.720> it's<00:03:06.720> just<00:03:06.930> due<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.349> fact<00:03:07.379> that

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.670 

that<00:03:12.329> produces<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:13.319> little<00:03:13.680> more<00:03:13.829> bulk<00:03:15.379> okay<00:03:16.379> I

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
that produces a little more bulk okay I

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.830 
that produces a little more bulk okay I
talked<00:03:17.519> you<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:17.970> on<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.360> other<00:03:18.450> one<00:03:19.579> but

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
this one I'm gonna do something a little

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.899 
this one I'm gonna do something a little
different<00:03:24.019> this<00:03:25.019> is<00:03:25.349> hard<00:03:25.680> as<00:03:25.890> all<00:03:26.190> had<00:03:26.610> to

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909
