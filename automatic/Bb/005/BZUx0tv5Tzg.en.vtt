00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.940
 frequently 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.490
 they are considered part of the family 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.380

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.840
 with your dreams 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.220
 Studies show that having pets benefit health, for example 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.420
 immediate benefit let's say it like that 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.430
 is the exercise 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.290
 per hundred because in question is that if you have a pet then you have to 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.950
 this case a dog you have to take out for a walk 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.820
 good or if it's a cat 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.350
 then they will play ethically with him 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.370
 It's a good way to have fun and burn more calories at the same time 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.850
 scientific studies 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.499
 have shown that having contact with animals can have 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.960
 Benefits 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.880
 physiological and psychological that include 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.280
 reduce stress lower blood pressure 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.640
 and also costs recovery aid after an illness 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.340
 serious 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.750
 pets 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.670
 a more influential rossi cat but it can also be never the rabbit 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.850
 he also held weights 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.560
 We have dimensions 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.320
 nor to improve that mood 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.429
 and they also take you 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.429
 relieve some of the common symptoms of depression 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.339
 for a person who has a pet in his house 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.869
 and suppose for a hundred that something happens to him but he gets in a bad mood 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.839
 why this person already at home and seeing his pet 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:23.649
 it is almost impossible for weapons 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:27.179
 already give us a bad mood not looking at our faithful companion today 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.770
 in the case of data like these 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.899
 70 and healthy to rub between the legs 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:35.929
 I do not know if I think that the majority 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:38.019
 has this ever touched him 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.229
 unless that's why I'm away from the data for one reason or another I do not know 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.709
 the dogs and data in a way feel 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.090
 when one is sad 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.389
 or that some means down as an option for kanouté 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.019
 that saw something 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.549
 and he gave it down means that he felt bad duties 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.399
 then when these animals see us like that 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.689
 while James was something to revive them 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.019
 just 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.810
 with looking forward to your dog running from side to side playing ball 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:09.800
 it's just goal 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.699
 see it doing that lift the mood 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:16.740
 Studies have shown that having a pet can be even 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.599
 better blood pressure stabilizer 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.059
 that many neighbors that have been made for this purpose 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:26.429
 with the pet you will never feel loneliness 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:29.849
 also always make him unconditional shadow and company 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.009
 Well how can you tell read whatever and your secret will always be safe 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:37.909
 they are monkeys listening and never criticize 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.139
 elm dimensions will never press it failed to win by someone else 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:44.250
 tend towards the end 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.530
 stronger bond with its owner and will be loyal until the end 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.280
 can help calm a person naturally without the need to use 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.079
 no medication 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.140
 conclusion 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.359
 Landa this theme 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.639
 I can say that having a pet at home 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.739
 it's really a benefit in terms of physical and psychological health 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:09.079
 min is of great help to us as human beings since many times 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.899
 we can not express our feelings clearly to three 

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:13.849
 people 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.889
 and it is our pets who in smokin 'set the example and never showed you 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.829
 his love and respect towards other living beings 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.770
 in this case humans 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.050
