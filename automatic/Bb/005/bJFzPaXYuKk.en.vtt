00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.899
 how to dissect spiders 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:11.610
 you take the body of the spider you 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:17.160
 remove the pasta base in 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:24.260
 introducing it's an instrument then 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.260
 so you have to go to the extreme one 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:33.930
 move the operation that you do not need 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.809
 to introduce too deeply 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.520
 until with like this then we 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.899
 cut the body with a knife 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.350
 so really so to be able if in 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.980
 makes them cut the body in half like 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:00.480
 these have it then you have two 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:06.650
 separate parts a flat part that 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.650
 will be very easy to unwind 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.110
 here is this alopecia part to be done 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.679
 really tell you in 30 seconds have 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.719
 validated half of the body of the tram 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:25.360
 that's who the other party is who 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:30.520
 convex part one can not do like 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.479
 it must break laws by partitions at 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.479
 level of each articulation 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.700
 but once we've done that it's 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.539
 very easy after always with 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.899
 of utensils to remove the flesh of the 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.220
 skull 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:54.000
 that's pretty done in two seconds we 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.000
 remove the crab meat
