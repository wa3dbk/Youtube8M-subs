 world we have positioned ourselves in 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.220
 thematic environmental quality 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:54.180
 renewable energy and development 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:55.830
 partners we are motivated and focused to 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.900
 develop new methodologies 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.309
 teaching that allow our 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.470
 students get an apprenticeship 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.470
 significant in the shortest possible time 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.869
 this is an innovation methodology in 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.780
 the teaching in which the student goes to 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:22.770
 evidence in the field what the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:25.190
 knowledge acquired in the classroom 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.760
 you will have to wait 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.000
 advance 234 years to be able to find out 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.410
 what you are going to do at the time of graduation 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.020
 entering the first year you will find 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.210
 with workshops learning projects of 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.860
 service which you can apply 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.860
 directly in your environment 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:53.490
 and you from 2014 you will find all the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.490
 civil engineering to 5 years 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.790
 the faculty delivers the tools 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.430
 social and academic to unwrap 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.030
 with an integral and competitive person to 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.030
 throughout the country 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.549
 the relationship between them make the 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.469
 students here in the faculty of 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.879
 engineering is close since the first 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.920
 years invite us to participate in 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.599
 different types of research the 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.500
 engineer that is formed here is a 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.500
 integral professional 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.019
 We are in constant process of 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.940
 training and learning looking 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.459
 those innovation methodologies in 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.230
 the teaching that allow us to arrive 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.819
 better to our students to be able to 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.819
 get the most out of them 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.200
 ah 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.410
 we need engineers therefore that 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.340
 have great capabilities 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.100
 innovations that are creative 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:10.140
 engineers who also believe that they give me 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.140
 employment opportunities to be 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.850
 2030 new engineering gives us the 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.860
 opportunity to review our our 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.950

 teacher training practice 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.720
 this new engineering project in 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.840
 definitive gives us the opportunity to 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.290
 offer you student and interested in 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.280
 engineering a great opportunity to
