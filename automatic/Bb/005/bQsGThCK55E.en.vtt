00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Tell us guys and it was at 22 and we're going 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.269
 do an analysis between iphone 5 and 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.490
 iphone 5 s running iphone 5 s versus 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:22.369
 iphone 5 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:22.369
 the camera 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.570
 the cameras in iphone 5 and 5 s 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.939
 are excellent 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.669
 the difference here was in the back of the 5s 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.309
 that if an improvement in the opening of the rooms 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.350
 from 2.4 to 2.0 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.629
 the flash also improved the new iphone 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.360
 counts with double flash containing a light 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.100
 white and another yellow thing that helps 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.559
 when taking pictures in low 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.250
 the front camera has not changed 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.070
 nothing and remains 1.2 mega pixels hd 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.410
 ideal for facetime calls 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.690
 the 5s also won a new feature 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.690
 totally unique slow motion camera 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.510
 capable of recording videos in 120 frames 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.510
 per second on 720p hd 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.320
 iphone 5 already had 4g connection support 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.000
 but the Brazilian band was not 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.040
 compatible with it, which made it 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.040
 Unusable in Brazil already model 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.729
 national 5s working normally 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.790
 the screen retina the screen remains the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.689
 retina display when resolution of 1,136 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.560

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.560
 videos in high resolution 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.070
 the iphone 5 s comes with a chip to 7 of 64 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.260
 which is twice as fast as the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.420
 a6 present on iphone 5 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.490
 do a benchmark test we can 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.440
 realize that the iphone 5 is if it really is 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.320
 twice as powerful as the iphone 5 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.210
 but what does this mean in everyday life? 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.100
 connect the device we can see that the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.100
 5s starts much faster 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:24.310
 it's good to see light games or even a lot 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.760
 heavy it also earns as you can 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.760

 battery life is more accurate and 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.549
 movements, for example in the compass 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.549
 touch ipad ipad and iphone tablet 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.380

 other iphones and no biometric sensor 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.170
 which gives more security but analyzing well 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.120
