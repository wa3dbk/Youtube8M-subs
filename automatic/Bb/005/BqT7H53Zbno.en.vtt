00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
mining at same time so that means

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.330 
mining at same time so that means
tracking<00:00:17.520> at<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.699> same<00:00:17.880> time<00:00:18.119> ah<00:00:19.250> and<00:00:20.250> yeah

tracking at the same time ah and yeah
I'll<00:00:20.550> get<00:00:20.730> more<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.359> loader<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.990> I'll

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
I'll get more to that loader and I'll

show you this I'm basically showing you

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.750 
show you this I'm basically showing you
how<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.930> set<00:00:25.230> up<00:00:25.380> these<00:00:25.680> out<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:26.070> some<00:00:26.369> first

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
how to set up these out on some first

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.429 
how to set up these out on some first
ones<00:00:26.939> gathering<00:00:27.390> me<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:28.260> import<00:00:29.840> all<00:00:30.840> like

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
ones gathering me you import all like

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.690 
ones gathering me you import all like
nodes<00:00:32.009> into<00:00:32.730> your<00:00:32.880> map<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.410> you<00:00:34.410> get<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.739> any

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
nodes into your map and you get on any

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.549 
nodes into your map and you get on any
if<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.180> might<00:00:36.360> then<00:00:36.660> they<00:00:36.809> should<00:00:37.079> pop<00:00:37.260> up<00:00:37.410> on

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
if you might then they should pop up on

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.470 
if you might then they should pop up on
that<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.250> know<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.579> makes<00:00:38.910> things<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.420> much

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
that you know just makes things so much

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.030 
that you know just makes things so much
easier<00:00:39.600> instead<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.290> guessing<00:00:40.530> where<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
easier instead of guessing where the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.779 
easier instead of guessing where the
nodes<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.540> herbs<00:00:42.540> are<00:00:43.040> the<00:00:44.040> next<00:00:44.340> add-on<00:00:44.610> is

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
nodes and herbs are the next add-on is

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:45.950 
nodes and herbs are the next add-on is
roots

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
roots

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.630 
roots
this<00:00:46.230> actually<00:00:46.469> creates<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:47.010> route<00:00:47.250> for<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.579> to

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
this actually creates a route for you to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.389 
this actually creates a route for you to
follow<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:49.079> basically<00:00:49.739> connected<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
follow and it's basically connected to

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.650 
follow and it's basically connected to
gatherer<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.680> yeah<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.430> haven't<00:00:54.300> forget

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
gatherer and yeah so we haven't forget

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.380 
gatherer and yeah so we haven't forget
Helen<00:00:55.050> forged<00:00:55.610> forged<00:00:56.610> at<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> moment<00:00:57.239> I'm

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
Helen forged forged at the moment I'm

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.380 
Helen forged forged at the moment I'm
because<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.989> set<00:00:58.469> up<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.620> route<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.059> stick

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
because I set up a route on so you stick

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.349 
because I set up a route on so you stick
in<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.570> name<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.670> after<00:01:02.670> you're<00:01:02.940> sticking<00:01:03.270> your

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
in a name and after you're sticking your

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.140

name you hit okay and then you scroll

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.690 
name you hit okay and then you scroll
down<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> bit<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:07.010> get<00:01:08.010> her<00:01:08.189> mean<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
down a bit and you get her mean and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.850 
down a bit and you get her mean and
mining<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.299> then<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.020> go<00:01:10.140> create<00:01:10.380> route<00:01:10.619> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
mining and then you go create route and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.910 
mining and then you go create route and
then<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.670> go<00:01:11.820> into<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> routes<00:01:12.330> tab<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.960> you

like and depends on the cpu speed and
how<00:01:49.770> many<00:01:50.009> nodes<00:01:50.159> are<00:01:50.369> actually<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.149> map

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
how many nodes are actually on the map

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.529 
how many nodes are actually on the map
like<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:53.069> things<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:53.549> ice<00:01:53.789> crown<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.329> takes

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.630 
like for things for ice crown it takes
like<00:01:54.750> five<00:01:55.200> minutes<00:01:57.709> but<00:01:58.709> yeah<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.219> you'll<00:01:59.489> be

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
like five minutes but yeah so you'll be

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.479 
like five minutes but yeah so you'll be
mining<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.179> turbine<00:02:00.599> at<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> same<00:02:00.929> time<00:02:01.489> this

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:02.489 
mining in turbine at the same time this

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:05.539 
mining in turbine at the same time this
isn't<00:02:03.090> really<00:02:03.239> done<00:02:03.629> at<00:02:03.959> all<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:05.159> don't<00:02:05.280> see

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
isn't really done at all you don't see

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.309 
isn't really done at all you don't see
people<00:02:05.969> doing<00:02:06.569> this<00:02:06.719> because<00:02:06.929> you<00:02:07.140> can't

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
people doing this because you can't

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.339 
people doing this because you can't
track<00:02:07.590> them<00:02:07.799> both<00:02:08.009> at<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> same<00:02:08.369> time<00:02:09.349> but

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
track them both at the same time but

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.259 
track them both at the same time but
I'll<00:02:10.560> be<00:02:10.769> showing<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.160> little<00:02:11.310> script<00:02:11.819> they

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
I'll be showing you a little script they

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.900 
I'll be showing you a little script they
stick<00:02:12.629> into<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> macro<00:02:13.109> umm<00:02:13.590> which<00:02:14.310> actually

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
stick into a macro umm which actually

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.680 
stick into a macro umm which actually
actually<00:02:15.980> changes<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.099> track<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.579> every<00:02:17.970> 1.8

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
actually changes the track in every 1.8

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.400 
actually changes the track in every 1.8
seconds

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
seconds

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.030 
seconds
and<00:02:20.359> here<00:02:21.359> we<00:02:21.480> switch<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.079> so<00:02:22.319> we're<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:22.620> solo

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
and here we switch and so we're in solo

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.910 
and here we switch and so we're in solo
Basin<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.819> think<00:02:24.060> it's<00:02:24.180> cool<00:02:24.389> I<00:02:25.019> already<00:02:25.799> have

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
Basin I think it's cool I already have

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.710 
Basin I think it's cool I already have
the<00:02:26.010> route<00:02:26.220> connected<00:02:26.819> enough<00:02:27.120> funds<00:02:27.389> to<00:02:27.540> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
the route connected enough funds to the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.319 
the route connected enough funds to the
best<00:02:27.959> place<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:29.160> here's<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.400> macro<00:02:29.880> how<00:02:30.209> they

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
best place so here's a macro how they

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.229 
best place so here's a macro how they
done<00:02:30.510> descriptions<00:02:31.319> put<00:02:31.829> I<00:02:32.099> mean<00:02:32.700> script<00:02:33.030> um

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
done descriptions put I mean script um

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.530 
done descriptions put I mean script um
just<00:02:34.200> put<00:02:34.349> it<00:02:34.440> into<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.650> macro<00:02:34.889> and<00:02:35.329> just<00:02:36.329> hit<00:02:36.510> it

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
just put it into a macro and just hit it

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.129 
just put it into a macro and just hit it
and<00:02:36.810> you're<00:02:36.989> on<00:02:37.049> your<00:02:37.200> way<00:02:37.549> okay<00:02:38.549> so<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.450> will

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
and you're on your way okay so I will

and you're on your way okay so I will
show<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:41.130> my<00:02:41.430> tracking<00:02:42.239> ID<00:02:42.660> both<00:02:42.959> urban<00:02:43.290> and

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
show you my tracking ID both urban and

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.740 
show you my tracking ID both urban and
mining<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:45.109> as<00:02:46.109> you<00:02:46.260> can<00:02:46.349> see<00:02:46.620> my<00:02:47.060> combat<00:02:48.060> log

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
mining and as you can see my combat log

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.289 
mining and as you can see my combat log
thing<00:02:49.079> switches<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.250> purchase<00:02:50.669> hit<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.030> mark

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
thing switches and purchase hit the mark

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.479 
thing switches and purchase hit the mark
macro<00:02:51.720> I'm<00:02:52.230> not<00:02:52.440> touching<00:02:52.829> anything<00:02:52.859> and<00:02:53.220> so

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
macro I'm not touching anything and so

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.909 
macro I'm not touching anything and so
on<00:02:53.549> Michael<00:02:53.880> Young<00:02:54.060> every<00:02:54.870> 1.8<00:02:55.349> seconds<00:02:55.799> it

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
on Michael Young every 1.8 seconds it

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.569 
on Michael Young every 1.8 seconds it
just<00:02:56.069> keeps<00:02:56.220> switching<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:59.040> yeah<00:02:59.160> so<00:02:59.370> we<00:02:59.400> can

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
just keeps switching and yeah so we can

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.580 
just keeps switching and yeah so we can
track<00:02:59.819> two<00:03:00.389> things<00:03:00.720> at<00:03:01.139> once

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
track two things at once

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.659 
track two things at once
and<00:03:02.160> here<00:03:02.730> we<00:03:02.819> fade<00:03:03.030> out<00:03:03.239> and<00:03:03.510> there<00:03:04.319> we<00:03:04.470> go

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:04.669 
and here we fade out and there we go

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.819 
and here we fade out and there we go
this<00:03:05.669> mining<00:03:06.419> curving<00:03:06.900> around<00:03:06.989> solar<00:03:07.380> basin

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
this mining curving around solar basin

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.559 
this mining curving around solar basin
for<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.190> next<00:03:08.519> 2<00:03:09.180> min

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
for the next 2 min

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.539 
for the next 2 min
oh<00:03:11.480> yeah<00:03:12.480> um

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
oh yeah um

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:19.069 
oh yeah um
see<00:03:14.549> I'm<00:03:14.939> Blizzard<00:03:15.530> says<00:03:17.090> one<00:03:18.090> action<00:03:18.719> at<00:03:18.870> one

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
see I'm Blizzard says one action at one

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.119 
see I'm Blizzard says one action at one
time<00:03:19.609> so<00:03:20.609> this<00:03:21.239> is<00:03:21.299> script<00:03:21.840> if<00:03:22.319> you're<00:03:22.590> mining

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
time so this is script if you're mining

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.420 
time so this is script if you're mining
a<00:03:23.370> node<00:03:24.239> this<00:03:24.989> script<00:03:25.349> will<00:03:25.530> stop<00:03:25.799> if<00:03:26.069> you<00:03:26.250> get

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
a node this script will stop if you get

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.080 
a node this script will stop if you get
in<00:03:26.549> combat<00:03:26.939> the<00:03:27.120> script<00:03:27.480> will<00:03:27.720> stop<00:03:28.730> if<00:03:29.730> you

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
in combat the script will stop if you

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.210 
in combat the script will stop if you
mount<00:03:30.450> up<00:03:30.629> the<00:03:30.870> script<00:03:31.200> will<00:03:31.439> stop<00:03:31.680> until<00:03:32.129> you

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
mount up the script will stop until you

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.399 
mount up the script will stop until you
stop<00:03:32.489> doing<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.939> things<00:03:33.170> because<00:03:34.170> you're

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
stop doing the things because you're

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.679 
stop doing the things because you're
still<00:03:34.590> doing<00:03:34.920> one<00:03:35.129> action<00:03:35.579> at<00:03:35.760> one<00:03:35.939> time<00:03:38.689> so

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 
still doing one action at one time so

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.979 
still doing one action at one time so
you<00:03:39.840> get<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.109> frost<00:03:40.469> loss<00:03:40.709> frost<00:03:41.639> Lotus<00:03:41.989> however

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
you get a frost loss frost Lotus however

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.960 
you get a frost loss frost Lotus however
he<00:03:43.170> said<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:46.200> yes<00:03:46.349> so<00:03:46.590> say<00:03:47.519> that<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:47.819> were<00:03:47.939> on

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
he said and yes so say that you were on

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.220 
he said and yes so say that you were on
your<00:03:48.120> daily<00:03:48.329> route<00:03:48.689> to<00:03:49.049> mine<00:03:50.510> do<00:03:51.510> mining<00:03:51.959> and

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
your daily route to mine do mining and

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.259 
your daily route to mine do mining and
you<00:03:52.859> run<00:03:53.069> into<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.340> few<00:03:53.489> herbs<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.060> said

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
you run into a few herbs and you said

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.479 
you run into a few herbs and you said
yourself<00:03:54.359> demo<00:03:54.870> should<00:03:55.260> be<00:03:55.379> my<00:03:55.590> I<00:03:55.859> wish<00:03:56.400> I

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
yourself demo should be my I wish I

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.059 
yourself demo should be my I wish I
could<00:03:56.669> gather<00:03:56.849> them<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.650> if<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.769> can<00:03:58.919> do<00:03:59.040> it

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
could gather them and if you can do it

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.069 
could gather them and if you can do it
so<00:03:59.310> yeah<00:03:59.519> twice<00:03:59.970> profit<00:04:00.480> these<00:04:00.629> are<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.870> two

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
so yeah twice profit these are the two

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.599 
so yeah twice profit these are the two
main<00:04:01.290> professions<00:04:01.829> which<00:04:01.980> give<00:04:02.189> the<00:04:02.310> biggest

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
main professions which give the biggest

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.080 
main professions which give the biggest
profit<00:04:03.000> in<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.359> game<00:04:03.569> and<00:04:04.549> you<00:04:05.549> don't<00:04:05.730> see<00:04:06.000> it

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
profit in the game and you don't see it

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.629 
profit in the game and you don't see it
much<00:04:06.239> usually<00:04:06.870> someone<00:04:07.290> has<00:04:07.500> mining<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.430> one

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
much usually someone has mining and one

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.660 
much usually someone has mining and one
