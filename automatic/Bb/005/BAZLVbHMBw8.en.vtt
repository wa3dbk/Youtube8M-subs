00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
as you can see with the UH with the

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.480 
as you can see with the UH with the
power<00:05:27.810> let<00:05:28.169> the<00:05:28.290> new<00:05:28.440> power<00:05:28.680> that<00:05:28.919> now<00:05:29.010> has<00:05:29.310> new

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
power let the new power that now has new

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.460 
power let the new power that now has new
power<00:05:29.640> to<00:05:29.790> use<00:05:30.000> it's<00:05:30.419> clearly<00:05:30.690> uh<00:05:30.840> just

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
power to use it's clearly uh just

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.190 
power to use it's clearly uh just
extreme<00:05:32.040> yang<00:05:32.280> release<00:05:32.870> and<00:05:33.870> if<00:05:34.050> you're

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
extreme yang release and if you're

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.200 
extreme yang release and if you're
familiar<00:05:34.440> with<00:05:34.770> generally<00:05:35.340> it's<00:05:35.850> the<00:05:35.910> power

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
familiar with generally it's the power

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.050 
familiar with generally it's the power
to<00:05:36.390> basically<00:05:36.660> breathe<00:05:37.320> life<00:05:37.650> into<00:05:38.060> anything

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
to basically breathe life into anything

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.110 
to basically breathe life into anything
and<00:05:39.480> so<00:05:40.020> Naruto<00:05:40.440> basically<00:05:40.860> has<00:05:41.040> has<00:05:41.970> the

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
and so Naruto basically has has the

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.260 
and so Naruto basically has has the
power<00:05:42.330> of<00:05:42.570> life<00:05:42.810> currently<00:05:43.500> and<00:05:44.030> if<00:05:45.030> you're

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
power of life currently and if you're

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.670 
power of life currently and if you're
you<00:05:45.480> know<00:05:45.510> if<00:05:45.750> you're<00:05:45.900> curious<00:05:46.200> about<00:05:46.470> what

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
you know if you're curious about what

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.470 
you know if you're curious about what
Sasuke<00:05:47.340> probably<00:05:47.610> is<00:05:47.669> can<00:05:47.790> have<00:05:47.940> on<00:05:48.060> his<00:05:48.180> moon

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
Sasuke probably is can have on his moon

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.990 
Sasuke probably is can have on his moon
on<00:05:48.810> his<00:05:48.870> on<00:05:49.290> his<00:05:49.380> left<00:05:49.590> hand<00:05:49.680> that<00:05:50.010> symbolizes

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
on his on his left hand that symbolizes

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.730 
on his on his left hand that symbolizes
you<00:05:51.180> know<00:05:51.270> having<00:05:51.570> the<00:05:51.660> inside<00:05:52.200> or<00:05:52.410> having<00:05:52.650> the

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
you know having the inside or having the

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.950 
you know having the inside or having the
yen<00:05:52.919> release<00:05:53.250> so<00:05:53.850> that's<00:05:54.060> most<00:05:54.330> likely<00:05:54.750> going

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
yen release so that's most likely going

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.860 
yen release so that's most likely going
to<00:05:55.050> be<00:05:55.169> the<00:05:55.919> power<00:05:56.130> to<00:05:56.940> create<00:05:57.360> something<00:05:57.660> out

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
to be the power to create something out

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.370 
to be the power to create something out
of<00:05:57.930> nothing

sue<00:06:45.330> and<00:06:46.139> it's<00:06:46.320> basically<00:06:46.560> how<00:06:46.740> he<00:06:46.800> created

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
sue and it's basically how he created

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.950

all<00:06:47.280> the<00:06:47.610> the<00:06:47.880> tailed<00:06:48.120> beasts<00:06:48.419> so<00:06:48.630> this<00:06:48.780> also

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
all the the tailed beasts so this also

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.170 
all the the tailed beasts so this also
ties<00:06:49.320> into<00:06:49.740> the<00:06:50.130> fact<00:06:50.370> that<00:06:50.430> Naruto<00:06:50.850> was<00:06:50.970> even

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
ties into the fact that Naruto was even

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.800 
ties into the fact that Naruto was even
able<00:06:51.419> to<00:06:51.949> kick<00:06:52.949> that<00:06:53.340> bijuu<00:06:54.180> dama<00:06:54.330> the<00:06:54.570> way<00:06:54.660> he

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
able to kick that bijuu dama the way he

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.490 
able to kick that bijuu dama the way he
did<00:06:55.050> because<00:06:55.800> that<00:06:56.160> is<00:06:56.370> a<00:06:56.400> just<00:06:57.389> just<00:06:57.750> a<00:06:57.870> form

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
did because that is a just just a form

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.040 
did because that is a just just a form
of<00:06:58.830> yin<00:06:59.130> and<00:06:59.160> yang<00:06:59.310> release<00:06:59.760> the<00:07:00.720> fact<00:07:00.930> that

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
of yin and yang release the fact that

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.689 
of yin and yang release the fact that
you<00:07:01.199> know<00:07:01.320> that<00:07:01.560> you<00:07:01.919> can<00:07:02.039> exist<00:07:02.220> in<00:07:02.370> the<00:07:02.430> form
