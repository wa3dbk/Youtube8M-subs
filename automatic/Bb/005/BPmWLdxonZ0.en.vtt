00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.690
 maybe we have photos of one 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:12.090
 mega lanier summon 48 pictures of the dragon 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.940
 Pictures of flying fire spitting 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.890
 untap up that fears the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.490
 people have sprung from them is only one 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.310
 myth 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.160
 and yet it could be different on the earth 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.160
 give just as scary reptiles 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.160
 this team wants a huge exe 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.140
 easy for this man was the mega 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.000
 lamia the scary animal 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.129
 At the time this man says the first 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.910
 aborigines australiens would have before the 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.129
 creature trembles and this man believes 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.250
 she was still alive and he could 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.140
 the impressions prove a creature 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.180
 could live here for 1000 years 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.480
 hide without anyone noticing 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.369
 Rex Kilroy would be looking for 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.400
 the monster with track reader gerry open 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:06.650
 and the reptile expert Toni Gerrard 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.000
 several days in australian wool one 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.000
 spent national park 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.299
 here are inaccessible areas 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.340
 no white person has ever walked or ever 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.140
 is entered 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.210
 until now they are standing with empty hands 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.650
 but because the camera has dropped 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.549
 maybe the proof you are looking for 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.549
 captured 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.710
 Camera traps now hang a few days 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.840
 hopefully you have some photos 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.730
 recorded 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.450
 the team is curious if the bait is still 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.580
 unhook 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:47.740
 but you will be disappointed our children 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.570
 still hang there it stays with us 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.190
 nothing but to control the camera 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.190
 and then we go to the next place 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:00.430
 are only two pictures on it at the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.090
 second camera trap is the team 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.090
 surprised 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.800
 Do not see the baits anymore 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.080
 both pieces of meat have disappeared 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.770
 the team is curious about who they are 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.770
 got that's interesting 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.540
 48 pictures 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.760
 takes the memory card out of the camera 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.840
 contains evidence for the mega lamia 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.940
 while the team is on the way back 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.040
 does study to view the photos 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.220
 donlon in melbourne a copy of the 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.090
 imprint of gilroy from the year 2007 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.010
 he is skeptical I compare that 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.780
 seem imprint with their feet and toes 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.049
 they have nothing in common 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.379
 that's not the same thing this one has here 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.370
 two very short 10 1 and 5 and two and 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.019
 three are very long 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.420
 if you look at the behind-running 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.829
 you realize that he is very symmetrical 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.540
 but this one is absolutely symmetrical 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.260
 it almost looks like it's artificial 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.260
 been prepared 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.480
 but a photo would all doubt 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.920
 survive this prehistoric relic 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.790
 wants to disperse rise camera has photos 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.860
 recorded 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.450
 the bait is gone but unfortunately it was 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.450
 not the work of lizards 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.870
 the pictures show that i have the 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.870
 have brought cooler 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.970
 gilroy is neither surprised nor 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.890
 I get irritated sooner or later 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.280
 a photo and then hopefully one 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.870
 mega narnia on me us us 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.109
 the better the stand 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.060
 opportunities at the same time moves 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.549
 Indonesian team from Rinker after 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.890
 comodoro a larger population 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:57.780
 komodowarane lies the dense vegetation 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:04:00.209
 makes the search difficult that exists 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.340
 from far maybe there is action though 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.659
 The hiding in the forest can be found 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.659
 it heavier than in the savannah 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.930
 everyone is convinced if it's a huge one 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:17.030
 exalead then you will find them again 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.070
 island komodo is home to many species 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.470
 including deer and wild boar 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.400
 these types serve the koran as 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.400
 food source 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:34.100
 as the day passes, the 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.100
 group to we separate on us 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.669
 next what no 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:45.270
 they do not just push it and rehe 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:48.289
 Wild boars can be lice but the tracks 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:51.080
 indicate komodo monitor lizard 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:54.499
 we did not find any warans but 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:05:01.080
 her teeth 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:05:03.469
 they are shown and very sharp like 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.469
 a razor blade 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.070
 the hours go by but nothing 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.870
 we have seen many deer 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.050
 and there are prevalence there 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:21.470
 usually also warane then become 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:23.330
 she witnesses a rare event in 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.980
 The mating season is a lot of people 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.980
 on the way in search of females 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.130
 The expedition is approaching its end 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.480
 maybe a huge hides 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.210
 exe out there 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:42.010
 the impressive thing about these lizards is 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:45.460
 The size of Komodo dragon is the largest 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.460
 Is that him
