painter<00:00:33.739> but<00:00:34.739> I'm<00:00:35.700> finding<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.270> there's<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
painter but I'm finding this there's a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.130 
painter but I'm finding this there's a
lot<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.500> fun<00:00:37.850> as<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.969> say<00:00:39.090> I've<00:00:39.210> not<00:00:39.329> painted<00:00:39.809> Wow

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140

really<00:00:43.020> relaxing<00:00:43.260> anyway<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.399> decided<00:00:44.879> that

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
really relaxing anyway I decided that

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.670 
really relaxing anyway I decided that
what<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> would<00:00:46.320> do<00:00:46.530> was<00:00:48.289> one<00:00:49.289> thing<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.559> never

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
what I would do was one thing I never

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.680 
what I would do was one thing I never
had<00:00:49.980> when<00:00:50.190> when<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.550> used<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:50.969> painting<00:00:51.449> the

the idea of painted tons of miniatures

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.850 
the idea of painted tons of miniatures
was<00:00:53.670> really<00:00:54.000> really<00:00:54.149> daunting<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.870> whichever

they're all too expensive for one troll
one<00:03:02.020> agar<00:03:03.090> or<00:03:04.090> maybe<00:03:04.300> not<00:03:04.480> one<00:03:04.690> ogre<00:03:05.080> but<00:03:05.740> you

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
one agar or maybe not one ogre but you

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.440 
one agar or maybe not one ogre but you
know<00:03:06.190> you've<00:03:06.370> got<00:03:06.520> to<00:03:06.580> spend<00:03:06.700> thirty<00:03:07.030> pounds

or something so I'm not spending that on
miniatures<00:03:10.960> I<00:03:10.990> think<00:03:11.290> it's<00:03:11.410> absolutely

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
miniatures I think it's absolutely

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.420 
miniatures I think it's absolutely
ridiculous<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:13.860> that's<00:03:14.860> probably<00:03:15.190> why<00:03:15.400> I

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
ridiculous and that's probably why I

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.490 
ridiculous and that's probably why I
never<00:03:15.550> get<00:03:15.850> properly<00:03:16.480> back<00:03:16.720> into<00:03:16.990> Warhammer<00:03:17.380> I

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
never get properly back into Warhammer I

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.620 
never get properly back into Warhammer I
just<00:03:17.830> think<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.310> be<00:03:18.430> honest<00:03:18.670> is<00:03:18.820> a<00:03:18.850> ripoff<00:03:20.520> so

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
just think to be honest is a ripoff so

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.240 
just think to be honest is a ripoff so
I'm<00:03:22.630> looking<00:03:22.810> at<00:03:23.050> other<00:03:23.200> miniature<00:03:23.770> ranges
