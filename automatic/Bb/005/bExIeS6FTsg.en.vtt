00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.180
 postpone 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.180
 and consider the instruction manual here 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.850
 looks like this 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:07.140

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:08.700
 bad so here is going so here 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.420
 the instruction itself looks 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:22.140
 let's now consider the set itself tact 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:26.009

 And in each kombat zonesy and movie there is 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:42.270
 its own highlight but the highlight we later 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:45.360
 consider the same consider the mini figures 1 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:51.600
 minifigure and 2 so here they look 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:54.030
 do this if behind is such a backpack 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.219
 also such a helmet 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.799
 glasses here and there they look their faces 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:04.680
 This is how it looks, and there is also 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.320
 such a print is not behind him there is no print 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.860

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.600
 face and backpack and back there so print 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.730
 and so with these don't feel 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.700
 Rikki looks nails consider such 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.390
 the barrels in the set are given only they 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.000

 there is such a lever to twist them two 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.350
 pieces in our sets 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.580
 and here is such a car that is 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:37.360
 transports these tanks with gasoline but 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.780
 so we will postpone and consider the bush 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:45.210
 Bush looks like this 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.230
 bush and let's consider this 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.170
 toolbox 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.390
 the box itself looks like this 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:58.150
 cool waiting for a lot of tools 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.510
 the first tool is such an ax 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.350
 very cool with such a handle so 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.720
