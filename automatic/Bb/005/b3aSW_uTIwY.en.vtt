fit and good so I think that's forming a
happening<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.510> real<00:01:51.810> style<00:01:52.110> statement

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
happening is the real style statement

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:08.960 
happening is the real style statement
today<00:01:52.590> I<00:02:06.200> think<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.290> today<00:02:07.650> is<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.770> best<00:02:07.979> time

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970
