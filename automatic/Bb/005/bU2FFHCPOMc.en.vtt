your<00:02:11.670> practice<00:02:11.970> let's<00:02:12.300> say<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.959> start<00:02:12.989> off

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
your practice let's say you start off

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.950 
your practice let's say you start off
and<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.709> get

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
and you get

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.110 
and you get
a<00:02:13.990> player<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.650> worth<00:02:14.980> around<00:02:15.160> 15k<00:02:15.910> on<00:02:16.030> the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
book up don't sell him on straight away

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.860 
book up don't sell him on straight away
because<00:02:18.460> when<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:18.880> console<00:02:19.300> comes<00:02:19.480> out<00:02:19.690> like

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
because when the console comes out like

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
let's just let's just quickly say that

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.950 
let's just let's just quickly say that
for<00:02:27.340> example<00:02:27.430> let's<00:02:28.000> just<00:02:28.510> look<00:02:28.690> up<00:02:28.840> a

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
for example let's just look up a

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.490 
for example let's just look up a
expensive<00:02:29.680> player<00:02:29.860> here<00:02:30.100> quickly<00:02:30.550> um<00:02:31.500> okay

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
let's quickly do this let's for example

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
let's quickly do this let's for example
say<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.920> get<00:02:36.490> for<00:02:36.910> example<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.960> benzene

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
say that you get for example the benzene

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.800 
say that you get for example the benzene
have<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.650> start<00:02:38.890> mie<00:02:39.850> Michael<00:02:40.330> for<00:02:40.510> amount

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
20,000 go into the web but as soon as

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.070 
20,000 go into the web but as soon as
the<00:02:42.940> console<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.510> when<00:02:43.660> people<00:02:43.810> are

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
going to start be playing games this guy

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.240 
going to start be playing games this guy
will<00:02:46.690> go<00:02:46.930> for<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.140> lot<00:02:47.470> more<00:02:47.530> people<00:02:47.980> like<00:02:48.070> go

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
for like 40 k instead of 20 k so it

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.800 
for like 40 k instead of 20 k so it
basically<00:02:50.950> this<00:02:51.460> is<00:02:51.520> a<00:02:51.640> method<00:02:52.000> as<00:02:52.090> well<00:02:52.270> if
