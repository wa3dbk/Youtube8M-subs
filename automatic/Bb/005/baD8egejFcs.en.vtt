00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
applications much like it doesn't do is

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.089

onto<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.209> borders<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:02.169> can<00:03:02.200> actually<00:03:02.560> apply

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
onto the borders you can actually apply

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.349 
onto the borders you can actually apply
the<00:03:02.799> filter<00:03:03.189> onto<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.639> photograph<00:03:04.120> without

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
actually compensating or losing any

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.129

color<00:03:06.370> on<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:07.180> borders<00:03:07.540> because<00:03:07.840> Instagram

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
color on the borders because Instagram

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:09.780 
color on the borders because Instagram
actually<00:03:08.590> does<00:03:08.739> recognize<00:03:09.220> this<00:03:09.400> is<00:03:09.579> one

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
actually does recognize this is one

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.819 
actually does recognize this is one
large<00:03:10.000> image<00:03:10.209> whereas<00:03:10.930> insta<00:03:11.290> size<00:03:11.500> does

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
large image whereas insta size does

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.170 
large image whereas insta size does
recognize<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.519> difference<00:03:12.819> between<00:03:12.849> the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
recognize the difference between the

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.240 
recognize the difference between the
image<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.629> letterboxing<00:03:14.319> now<00:03:15.069> besides

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
image and the letterboxing now besides

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.309 
image and the letterboxing now besides
for<00:03:15.549> that<00:03:15.669> what<00:03:15.849> you<00:03:15.879> can<00:03:16.060> also<00:03:16.209> do<00:03:16.510> is<00:03:16.810> move

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
for that what you can also do is move

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.170 
for that what you can also do is move
the<00:03:17.500> image<00:03:17.709> around<00:03:17.829> of<00:03:18.190> course<00:03:18.400> but<00:03:18.729> I<00:03:19.000> like

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
the image around of course but I like

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.740 
the image around of course but I like
keeping<00:03:19.479> it<00:03:19.599> centered<00:03:19.959> and<00:03:20.849> let's<00:03:21.849> see<00:03:22.000> okay

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
keeping it centered and let's see okay

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.050 
keeping it centered and let's see okay
so<00:03:23.199> once<00:03:23.440> you're<00:03:23.590> at<00:03:23.650> borders<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.549> layers<00:03:24.790> I'm

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
so once you're at borders and layers I'm

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.819 
so once you're at borders and layers I'm
sorry<00:03:25.269> you<00:03:25.629> can<00:03:25.780> actually<00:03:25.900> add<00:03:26.139> text<00:03:26.590> which<00:03:26.709> I

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
think looks very nice and of course

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.240 
think looks very nice and of course
there<00:03:28.449> are<00:03:28.599> overlays<00:03:29.049> so<00:03:29.290> if<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.709> hit<00:03:29.829> text

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
there are overlays so if you hit text

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.770 
there are overlays so if you hit text
there<00:03:30.370> are<00:03:30.519> also<00:03:30.879> a<00:03:30.909> plethora<00:03:31.299> of<00:03:31.540> different

there are also a plethora of different
fonts<00:03:32.109> available<00:03:32.349> my<00:03:33.190> favorite<00:03:33.579> out<00:03:33.699> of<00:03:33.729> all

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
fonts available my favorite out of all

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.219 
fonts available my favorite out of all
of<00:03:34.030> these<00:03:34.180> being<00:03:34.389> Helvetica<00:03:35.019> new<00:03:35.250> LT<00:03:36.510> STD<00:03:37.510> or<00:03:37.750> a

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:38.229 
of these being Helvetica new LT STD or a

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:40.020 
of these being Helvetica new LT STD or a
standard<00:03:38.650> but<00:03:39.040> what<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:39.280> can<00:03:39.459> do<00:03:39.549> is<00:03:39.790> actually

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
standard but what you can do is actually

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.059 
standard but what you can do is actually
double<00:03:40.389> tap<00:03:40.599> and<00:03:40.870> for<00:03:41.290> example<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:41.829> want<00:03:42.010> to

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
double tap and for example I want to

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.899 
double tap and for example I want to
type<00:03:42.250> out<00:03:42.430> BMW<00:03:43.359> because<00:03:43.479> this<00:03:43.659> is<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.810> BMW<00:03:44.470> m5<00:03:44.909> so

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
type out BMW because this is a BMW m5 so

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:47.099 
type out BMW because this is a BMW m5 so
let's<00:03:46.060> just<00:03:46.269> do<00:03:46.419> that<00:03:46.569> and<00:03:46.810> you<00:03:46.840> can<00:03:46.989> actually

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
let's just do that and you can actually

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.479 
let's just do that and you can actually
put<00:03:47.379> this<00:03:47.530> somewhere<00:03:47.799> you<00:03:48.129> can<00:03:48.250> move<00:03:48.400> it

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
put this somewhere you can move it

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.189 
put this somewhere you can move it
around<00:03:48.579> you<00:03:48.819> can<00:03:48.970> adjust<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.449> size<00:03:49.629> and<00:03:50.079> I

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
around you can adjust the size and I

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.569 
around you can adjust the size and I
think<00:03:50.379> that<00:03:50.500> is<00:03:50.650> really<00:03:50.829> nice<00:03:51.099> because<00:03:51.310> it's

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
think that is really nice because it's

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:52.920 
think that is really nice because it's
customizable<00:03:52.299> and<00:03:52.449> it<00:03:52.569> does<00:03:52.690> look<00:03:52.900> pretty

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
customizable and it does look pretty

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.349 
customizable and it does look pretty
nice<00:03:53.349> in<00:03:53.530> my<00:03:53.560> opinion<00:03:54.099> now<00:03:54.639> finally<00:03:55.000> once<00:03:55.209> you

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
nice in my opinion now finally once you

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.490 
nice in my opinion now finally once you
are<00:03:55.540> done<00:03:55.720> you<00:03:55.780> can<00:03:56.019> hit<00:03:56.109> the<00:03:56.229> share<00:03:56.470> button

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
are done you can hit the share button

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.589 
are done you can hit the share button
and<00:03:57.010> it<00:03:57.189> creates<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.669> image<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.269> then<00:03:58.389> ask

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
and it creates the image and then ask

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.849 
and it creates the image and then ask
you<00:03:58.780> where<00:03:58.959> you<00:03:59.079> would<00:03:59.229> like<00:03:59.349> to<00:03:59.500> share<00:03:59.680> your

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
photo and of course an ad does pop up at

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.360 
photo and of course an ad does pop up at
this<00:04:02.049> time<00:04:02.229> but<00:04:02.439> it<00:04:02.530> is<00:04:02.650> pretty<00:04:02.799> easy<00:04:02.979> just<00:04:03.220> to

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
this time but it is pretty easy just to

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.009 
this time but it is pretty easy just to
get<00:04:03.459> rid<00:04:03.669> of<00:04:03.699> and<00:04:04.090> then<00:04:04.479> of<00:04:04.599> course<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:04.900> does
