00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.050
 I do not want stability from the French midfielder, she just stays with me 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.029
 that speed preparation for me 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:10.079
 4 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:11.750
 we want to be in the slalom 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:12.949
 the Internet 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:16.209
 the 70 percent that is absolutely not much 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.829
 Make no mistake don't go faster 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:20.820
 cars 60 percent 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.249
 easy at the moment you think alps technology 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:25.240
 where it's right 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.270
 for stopping 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.929
 shoulders relaxed 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.320
 these guys have been in training for over two weeks and there are a few this week 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.319
 Added ahold if you are the best at it 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.350
 the staff at the same time doing the work is nonsense 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.120
 been busy for two weeks 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.610
 yes we have one 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.010
 a schedule for a build schedule to be created 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.000
 being or being taken out of it or receiving an alternative training course 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.110
 We adjust the intensity to the adjusted speed and the force with which they use it 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.600
 have to perform 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.700
 what's the most important thing in my life is my schedule 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.470
 you have to go there for a few hours 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.920
 although we most watch out for it 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.580
 it is 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.350
 that one said 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.240
 in their head they can actually do it 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.860
 that is not the problem for him at all 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.580
 if you just let them train and you give some advice 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.880
 but you will not get far with it you really have to 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.220
 get out of training and alternative work 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.990
 to offer 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.030
 yes that the musculoskeletal connective tissue is the muscles that is actually training 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.430
 with which the most peaceful omitted to 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.460
 also a long time 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.540
 others continue to live open 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.290
 that is relaxing 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.260
 I can imagine those guys don't like that at the time, that's why I make it 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
 none caught up by explaining a lot more natural 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.940
 that has to do three years younger than two years later 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.430
 He wants people to be easier behind 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.710
 To do has come the perpetrator plays for out of it 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.900
 look or something 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.920
 Office bit to distract from the running gear 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.589
 it's not easy I have to say stays 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:13.300
 I also say that it is hard to act against the experienced trainer 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.309
 sit over it and win the site 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:20.169
 leave with the game and with the technical skills and actions 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:21.729
 solve this 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:25.819
 how long does it take before they and the real can hook up and the rest of the 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.969
 group 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.149
 we actually focus with those people that last group of guys 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.139
 imagine it was time for the first competition match 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:42.059
 how is it actually with the fitness of the requirement of the group it was some of it
