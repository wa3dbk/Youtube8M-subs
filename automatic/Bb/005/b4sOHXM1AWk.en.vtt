into the second song we go to this X
which<00:01:25.660> we<00:01:25.870> were<00:01:26.050> doing<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.500> other<00:01:26.620> day<00:01:26.860> and

which we were doing the other day and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.220 
which we were doing the other day and
the<00:01:30.520> X<00:01:30.670> is<00:01:31.030> supposed<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.690> actually<00:01:31.840> be<00:01:32.200> a

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
the X is supposed to actually be a

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.040 
the X is supposed to actually be a
little<00:01:32.560> bit<00:01:32.740> like<00:01:32.890> wider<00:01:33.360> but<00:01:34.360> it's<00:01:34.780> still

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
little bit like wider but it's still

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.630 
little bit like wider but it's still
supposed<00:01:35.290> to<00:01:35.410> be<00:01:35.470> like<00:01:35.740> very<00:01:36.100> straight<00:01:36.490> up

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
supposed to be like very straight up

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.280 
supposed to be like very straight up
feed<00:01:36.940> on<00:01:37.240> both<00:01:37.630> sides<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.850> then<00:01:40.840> the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
feed on both sides and then the

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.380 
feed on both sides and then the
contagious<00:01:41.830> is<00:01:42.040> most<00:01:42.790> of<00:01:42.940> them<00:01:43.030> take<00:01:43.330> place

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
contagious is most of them take place

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.730 
contagious is most of them take place
here<00:01:43.900> and<00:01:44.820> then<00:01:45.820> after<00:01:46.180> this<00:01:46.600> X<00:01:46.840> your<00:01:47.440> lines

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
here and then after this X your lines

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.630 
here and then after this X your lines
actually<00:01:48.040> flatten<00:01:48.700> out<00:01:48.850> so<00:01:49.860> ad<00:01:50.860> would<00:01:51.190> come<00:01:51.430> up

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
actually flatten out so ad would come up

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.580 
actually flatten out so ad would come up
to<00:01:51.820> here<00:01:52.150> and<00:01:52.180> everybody<00:01:52.810> else<00:01:53.110> would<00:01:53.410> also

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
to here and everybody else would also

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.270 
to here and everybody else would also
move<00:01:53.980> up<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:54.490> move<00:01:54.870> up<00:01:55.870> and<00:01:56.170> then<00:01:56.440> this<00:01:56.680> Lydia

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
move up and move up and then this Lydia

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.030 
move up and move up and then this Lydia
would<00:01:57.640> move<00:01:57.820> down

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
would move down

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.340 
would move down
Kate<00:02:00.040> will<00:02:00.280> move<00:02:00.460> down<00:02:00.760> and<00:02:01.150> then<00:02:01.450> with<00:02:02.230> the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
Kate will move down and then with the

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.680 
Kate will move down and then with the
two<00:02:02.500> lines<00:02:02.740> moving<00:02:03.159> up<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.670> down<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.810> get<00:02:05.140> to

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
two lines moving up and down you get to

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.960 
two lines moving up and down you get to
the<00:02:07.690> second<00:02:08.289> formation<00:02:09.220> will<00:02:09.640> technically

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
the second formation will technically

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.590 
the second formation will technically
third<00:02:10.240> formation<00:02:10.750> for<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.520> second

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
third formation for the second

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.840 
third formation for the second
stop<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.040> formation<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.610> we're

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
stop and this is a formation that we're

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.370 
stop and this is a formation that we're
all<00:02:14.970> familiar<00:02:15.150> with<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.630> we<00:02:15.930> started<00:02:16.230> out

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
all familiar with that we started out

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.760 
all familiar with that we started out
with<00:02:16.530> its<00:02:17.490> formation<00:02:17.910> 5/6<00:02:18.900> because<00:02:19.260> we<00:02:19.500> switch

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
with its formation 5/6 because we switch

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.360 
with its formation 5/6 because we switch
places<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.460> lines<00:02:20.670> do<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.740> stat<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.130> mine

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
places the lines do and the stat of mine

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.630 
places the lines do and the stat of mine
represents<00:02:24.150> your<00:02:24.360> contagious<00:02:26.030> groups<00:02:28.640> so

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
represents your contagious groups so

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.700 
represents your contagious groups so
there's<00:02:29.790> three<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:31.250> those<00:02:32.250> are<00:02:32.730> all<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.390> the

there's three and those are all of the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.630 
there's three and those are all of the
