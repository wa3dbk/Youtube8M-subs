alpha<00:00:45.040> numeric<00:00:45.220> system<00:00:45.760> in<00:00:46.120> which<00:00:46.239> you

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
alpha numeric system in which you

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.170 
alpha numeric system in which you
actually<00:00:47.230> adjust<00:00:47.739> your<00:00:47.860> settings<00:00:48.100> based<00:00:48.940> on
