parts and pieces okay we have our

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.880 
parts and pieces okay we have our
profiles<00:01:05.210> we<00:01:05.690> have<00:01:05.810> our<00:01:05.900> hardware<00:01:06.290> and<00:01:06.470> we

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
profiles we have our hardware and we

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
have our panels so our next step is

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.150 
have our panels so our next step is
going<00:01:08.870> to<00:01:08.930> be<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.140> pre<00:01:09.350> loading<00:01:09.680> process

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
going to be the pre loading process

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.280 
going to be the pre loading process
right<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.610> pre<00:01:10.850> loading<00:01:11.210> it<00:01:11.660> not<00:01:11.840> only<00:01:11.990> helps

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
right the pre loading it not only helps

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.110 
right the pre loading it not only helps
you<00:01:12.380> speed<00:01:12.650> along<00:01:12.950> your<00:01:13.160> build<00:01:13.370> but<00:01:13.970> can

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
you speed along your build but can

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.760 
you speed along your build but can
prevent<00:01:14.420> frustrations<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.320> backtracking

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770
