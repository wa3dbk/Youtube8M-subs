everything went together really simple

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.910 
everything went together really simple
it<00:00:40.540> took<00:00:40.720> about<00:00:40.840> the<00:00:41.110> half<00:00:41.320> an<00:00:41.470> hour<00:00:41.590> to<00:00:41.770> get

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
it took about the half an hour to get

elevator assembly on the back and a
fine-tuning<00:00:49.750> adjusting<00:00:50.440> is<00:00:50.559> very<00:00:50.800> easy

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
fine-tuning adjusting is very easy

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.220 
fine-tuning adjusting is very easy
because<00:00:51.430> there's<00:00:51.820> a<00:00:51.879> grate<00:00:52.210> on<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.840> bottom<00:00:53.110> of

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
because there's a grate on the bottom of

really<00:00:59.350> nice<00:00:59.530> setup<00:00:59.829> everything<00:01:00.670> went

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
really nice setup everything went

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.920 
really nice setup everything went
together<00:01:00.940> very<00:01:01.329> easily

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
together very easily

together very easily
there's<00:01:02.170> cotter<00:01:02.470> pins<00:01:02.829> here<00:01:03.190> on<00:01:03.399> the<00:01:03.550> wing

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
there's cotter pins here on the wing

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.870 
there's cotter pins here on the wing
spars<00:01:04.540> which<00:01:04.899> are<00:01:05.080> quick<00:01:05.770> assembly<00:01:06.520> and

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
spars which are quick assembly and

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.700 
spars which are quick assembly and
disassembly<00:01:07.090> there's<00:01:07.990> a<00:01:08.080> couple<00:01:08.290> of<00:01:08.410> screws

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
disassembly there's a couple of screws

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.400 
disassembly there's a couple of screws
on<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.009> bottom<00:01:09.130> of<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.520> wings<00:01:09.759> here

on the bottom of the wings here
propeller<00:01:11.410> you<00:01:11.680> need<00:01:11.830> to<00:01:11.950> put<00:01:12.160> on<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:13.750> nothing

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
propeller you need to put on but nothing

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.200 
propeller you need to put on but nothing
serious<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:14.950> then<00:01:15.100> programming<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.910> radio

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
serious and then programming the radio

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.270 
serious and then programming the radio
is<00:01:16.420> about<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:16.869> most<00:01:17.080> complex<00:01:17.500> part<00:01:17.830> because

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
is about the most complex part because

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.999 
is about the most complex part because
you<00:01:18.430> got<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.790> two<00:01:18.940> position<00:01:19.420> flaps<00:01:19.780> I've<00:01:20.500> got

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
you got the two position flaps I've got

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.080 
you got the two position flaps I've got
them<00:01:21.250> on<00:01:21.280> a<00:01:21.460> slow<00:01:22.470> slowed<00:01:23.470> setting<00:01:23.950> there<00:01:24.160> it

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
them on a slow slowed setting there it

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.850 
them on a slow slowed setting there it
takes<00:01:25.210> about<00:01:25.390> three<00:01:25.750> seconds<00:01:26.200> to<00:01:26.350> go<00:01:26.530> full

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
takes about three seconds to go full

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.980 
takes about three seconds to go full
from<00:01:28.140> full<00:01:29.140> off<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.649> full<00:01:29.890> on<00:01:30.130> flaps<00:01:30.840> I'm<00:01:31.840> a

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
from full off to full on flaps I'm a

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.570 
from full off to full on flaps I'm a
little<00:01:32.200> bit<00:01:32.289> conservative<00:01:32.740> on<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.340> flap

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
little bit conservative on the flap

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.279 
little bit conservative on the flap
settings<00:01:34.060> there<00:01:34.209> I<00:01:34.240> see<00:01:34.539> that<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:34.780> lot<00:01:34.899> of<00:01:35.050> guys

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
settings there I see that a lot of guys

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.169 
settings there I see that a lot of guys
are<00:01:35.500> taking<00:01:35.860> off<00:01:36.009> and<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.819> thing<00:01:37.030> goes

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
are taking off and the thing goes

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.660 
are taking off and the thing goes
vertical<00:01:37.690> immediately<00:01:38.259> so<00:01:38.500> maybe<00:01:39.190> on<00:01:39.399> a<00:01:39.429> less

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
vertical immediately so maybe on a less

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.669 
vertical immediately so maybe on a less
windy<00:01:40.030> day<00:01:40.179> I'll<00:01:40.330> try<00:01:40.600> that<00:01:40.840> but<00:01:41.170> for<00:01:41.350> now<00:01:41.410> I've

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
windy day I'll try that but for now I've

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.650 
windy day I'll try that but for now I've
got<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.100> ailerons<00:01:43.979> rudder<00:01:45.179> got<00:01:46.179> a<00:01:46.209> nice<00:01:46.420> -<00:01:46.569> a

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
got the ailerons rudder got a nice - a

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.529 
got the ailerons rudder got a nice - a
heavy-duty<00:01:47.020> tail<00:01:47.440> wheel<00:01:47.679> on<00:01:47.860> there<00:01:48.539> elevator

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
heavy-duty tail wheel on there elevator

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.020 
heavy-duty tail wheel on there elevator
and<00:01:49.899> then<00:01:50.649> to<00:01:50.890> position<00:01:51.340> flaps<00:01:51.610> that's<00:01:51.910> a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
and then to position flaps that's a

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.320 
and then to position flaps that's a
medium<00:01:52.259> position<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:54.369> full<00:01:54.580> position<00:01:54.940> I

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
medium position and the full position I

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.210 
medium position and the full position I
noticed<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.229> flaps<00:01:56.470> came<00:01:56.770> in<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.920> little

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
noticed that the flaps came in a little

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.330 
noticed that the flaps came in a little
bit<00:01:57.340> warped<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.200> box<00:01:59.440> so<00:01:59.890> we'll<00:02:00.009> see<00:02:00.220> how

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
bit warped in the box so we'll see how

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.380 
bit warped in the box so we'll see how
that<00:02:00.520> does<00:02:02.399> I'm<00:02:03.399> gonna<00:02:03.550> take<00:02:03.819> off<00:02:04.000> with<00:02:04.030> no

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
that does I'm gonna take off with no

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.700 
that does I'm gonna take off with no
flaps<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:05.080> start<00:02:05.380> get<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.920> good<00:02:06.160> headwind<00:02:06.550> here

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:37.979 

that<00:02:12.710> was<00:02:12.830> nothing

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:50.089 

nice<00:02:38.989> aerobatic<00:02:39.709> plane

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.890 

we've<00:02:50.579> got<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.819> center<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.239> gravity<00:02:51.629> a<00:02:51.659> little

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
we've got the center of gravity a little

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.339 
we've got the center of gravity a little
bit<00:02:52.079> forward<00:02:53.090> because<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.049> windy

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
bit forward because of the windy

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.500 
bit forward because of the windy
conditions<00:02:55.920> here<00:02:56.280> but<00:02:56.819> I<00:02:56.879> think<00:02:56.939> I<00:02:57.150> can<00:02:57.329> pull

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
conditions here but I think I can pull

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:09.660 
conditions here but I think I can pull
it<00:02:57.629> back<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.840> little<00:02:58.230> bit

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.020 

Wow

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
Wow

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.830 
Wow
nice<00:03:11.390> nice<00:03:12.020> loop<00:03:12.380> let's<00:03:13.310> try<00:03:13.550> a<00:03:13.580> roll<00:03:13.850> and<00:03:14.630> a

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
nice nice loop let's try a roll and a

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.540 
nice nice loop let's try a roll and a
little<00:03:15.050> bit<00:03:15.140> slow<00:03:15.380> unroll<00:03:15.800> but<00:03:16.010> that's<00:03:16.160> you

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
little bit slow unroll but that's you

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:24.190 
little bit slow unroll but that's you
know<00:03:16.580> scale<00:03:17.030> performance

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:49.110 

that's<00:03:25.200> full<00:03:25.530> speed<00:03:25.980> right<00:03:26.220> there
