00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.050
 it is philippe 2.5 who takes care of it at its 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.789
 high-end stuff that made other 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.439
 are products that are nomadic and 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.570
 that's my little ray these stuff that 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.710
 I like the speakers like the cases this 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.599
 that small small players 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.010
 of axa correctly was my part this 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.109
 week at the lobby to watch a little 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.270
 little this Christmas log is ultimate 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.350
 ears this is the mega boom because 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.969
 last year there was the boom we had 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.890
 tested the boom there is the mega boom so 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.930
 megaliths rally prat supra 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.420
 since you want boom this time 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.829
 this product costs 299 euros this is a 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.600
 product that is quite particular because 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.700
 in its design 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.140
 it allows 360 degree radiant sound 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.760
 that is to say that the interview had 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.530
 two speakers wwoofers as well 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.100
 only passive radiators of the radiator 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.629
 passive 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.770
 the nice thing we ask it at best 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.870
 a coffee table with friends at the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.460
 house because that's my mega boom placed on 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.620
 better the coffee table and the sound is very 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.210
 radiant the whole room it's super cool 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.890
 how it works it's simple 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.020
 we can pair and bluetooth 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.030
 but be careful not ptx and also a 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.549
 application to manage the application 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.260
 boom hue and an ultimate ears with 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.210
 the application can be after two sessions 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.799
 in one like that so 600 euros when 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.509
 even you can adjust the sound with 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.439
 the application is stuff face 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.720
 a product that I like a lot 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.009
 in addition to the boom the mega 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.509
 boom and waterproof 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.979
 we plunged it into a meter of 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.990
 floats in the tub if you want 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.729
 for 30 minutes without it explodes 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.200
 in flight so this was not the case 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.610
 so small to resist the spray 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.180
 on the other hand the weight quite a bit more 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.490
 different 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.840
 we still approach 800 g 1 kg 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.340
 like that to the touch tony cotte was 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.799
 lighter it is a product that is 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.240
 very very well finished very well designed with 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.280
 always a little hook for for 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.320
 hang it like that anywhere a 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.549
 autonomy of 15 hours so go 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.990
 coutts are going to tell me go cost it's worth 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.560
 what to go for is a product that 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.180
 is very dynamic 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.340
 he sent a small deficiency in serious 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.070
 we feel that it is not the lala 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.509
 beats the xl stack happened a trick 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.590
 the stuff is pretty thin overall 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.030
 I was a bit surprised because I 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.680
 I was expecting a bit of a boom 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.479
 no it's pretty thin I was listening to it 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.579
 with some classical music with some 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.380
 piano with jazz yes with voices 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.090
 sometimes and you that it passed enough 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.860
 well the media is not aggressive 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.239
 there is a sound that is very dynamic good 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.560
 it does not spit monstrously you 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.060
 do not animate the evenings 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.260
 person with there is a little bit of 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.489
 scrambling when we start climbing 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.780
 the sound is together it misses a whole 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.590
 little bit serious but overall 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.880
 it's a product I really find 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.220
 well because what I have with this 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.660
 product it's the spatialization side on 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.300
 360 degrees that is to say that really 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.590
 when we put the sound goes everywhere and that 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.700
 it's nice in a room we want 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.099
 listen that the samu of music in 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.750
 nomadism from a smartphone for 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.430
 streamed by between cowboys from a 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.420
 pc you stream is there on you have 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.250
 100 customers all room 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.500
 so the product really pleases me for 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.120
 that's his audio spatialization side 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.620
 robustness because that's really 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.060
 a product that is very very sturdy on 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.380
 feel like you can hit on it 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.030
 they risk not much a little bit the 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.739
 to dive under the fleet we can we can 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.540
 listen to music downright in 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.370
 outside even when it's raining and other 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.640
 so it's a practical product so 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.950
 this is an ultimate and unfortunately the mega 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.930
 boom be cost of 299 euros if you 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.030
