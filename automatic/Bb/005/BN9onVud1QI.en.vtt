00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.899
 jens keller on the way to 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.000
 Press conference with all the rumors 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.030
 and noise at the time on schalke 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.010
 certainly not amusement tax 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.290
 neither for the trainer nor for manager 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.570
 horst I heldt think in the beginning that what 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.190
 bad at the beginning was the first 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.180
 months the press conference 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.090
 certainly unpleasant point reached where 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.279
 you play good table space well 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.260
 from which he holds his press conferences for 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.980
 no pressure now 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.809
 how to meet such a fa fa 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.160
 I can not confirm that I want 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.579
 also do not comment 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.379
 In the end, I can only say mine 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.680
 first contact person is and remains 1 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.530
 keller finds that jens from the first day 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:52.289
 mastered his job excellently 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.820
 and especially in the concentrated problematic 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.340
 in which he has initiated in the beginning of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.660
 the riff and is therefore and 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.850
 remains my first contact 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.309
 but my job definitely belongs too 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.640
 to play through eventualities 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.380
 possible other candidates also hold 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.390
 check this is my job belongs to 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.409
 and with whom I mature when 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.049
 I hit me with wm 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.400
 that remains uncommented in it 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.250
 I finally no position too 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.290
 relate in public 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.150
 especially for the coach, it is clear to all 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.070
 to make it only sporty 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.230
 is about the decision for the salary for 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.190
 a whole year and the prospects 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.040
 to the next 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.080
 the next game of course 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.310
 personal question number one 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.229
 jefferson farfan now has three weeks 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.430
 do not train there will be like today 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.890
 looks is not quite sure 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.450
 get involved in team training and 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.729
 then you have to look like the reaction 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.380
 this is the final training on 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.420
 Thursday afternoon then the bitter 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.130
 knowledge for more than walking is enough 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.020
 not with jefferson farfan 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.540
 That's why he is not a possibility 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.210
 for gladbach and then hurt himself 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.850
 also christian fuchs but jens 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.710
 Keller says he does not care 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.630
 the team has the last weeks 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.729
 that he shows all the failures 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.890
 we have and have and again and again 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.320
 They commented that very well 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.810
 we still have our goals anyway 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.190
 so far followed very well and there 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.170
 is also the return of the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.420
 halters klaas jan huntelaar his 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.459
 Mentality brings the whole team 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.970
 forward against home strong 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.250
 Borussia flap has the last games 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.630
 has lost at home won away 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.250
 but it is very clear that they are here 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.660
 is stronger at home and not 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.580
 Absolutely away, yes, that was true 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.380
 Last year, that's the strength 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.870
 from gladbach that you very fast 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.250
 switch over in both directions too 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.000
 get behind the ball quickly with the 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.530
 complete team and the goal 30 35 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.170
 completely defend the meter in front of the gate 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.200
 the whole team but also at 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.060
 have a good playoff and win 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.549
 We know that and we are 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.709
 We are prepared and there we will certainly be 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.549
 solutions to bring this with one 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.180
 or make another goal 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.220
 we have been playing in the last few years 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.350
 gladbach did not look good and 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.120
 that's why the picture is to improve but 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.019
 already one or two times 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.070
 Games won with which one can not help 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.720
 We had this year 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.450
 both derbys have won in dortmund 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.010
 since before in the sun before bad 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.420
 So everything is played from there 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.340
 possible team is in a good mood 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.440
 Focuses and she has that 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.480
 experience of success on the last sunday in the 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.910
 back klaas jan huntelaar also hits 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.470
 on thursday just the way he wants 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.879
 but it was not just the goalgetter 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.690
 but it was the whole 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.849
 team 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.340
 but you can see how important it is 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.930
 one in the center right striker he has 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.400
 the things then also used what us 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.310
 maybe just in the last game against 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.800
 frankfurt has perhaps missed one 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.569
 glass once stood among the 67 dingers 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.459
 simply a power we have a big one 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.040
 The foundation stone was laid with the victory at home 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.440
 against hsv we meet now on gladbach 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.970
 the five points away from us are when 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.680
 we should win the game are eight 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.730
 then points are not can we 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.230
 not catching us up that would be 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.569
 of course, a milestone to another 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.129
 to leave opponents behind us 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.019
 that is why it is very important on the 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.459
 one side is so gladbach 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.840
 age actually also has to win around 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.340
 come back to us because of that 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.260
 it will be an exciting game 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.790
 one in which perhaps the head 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.160
 it decides in terms of psychology 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.300
 is also works the game at home if 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.099
 that's a psychological advantage now 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.419
 is or not last week too 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.130
 we are under more pressure than 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.590
 hamburger was probably too 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.690
 psychologically in advantage we have 4 1 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.850
 won 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.190
 For me psychology does not matter for me 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.540
 I am the achievements and the form of the 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.540
 Team decide which is the moment 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.010
 good and that's why I'm not considering who 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.360
 because in the advantage or not in the advantage 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.360
 we drive there for points
