00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
exfoliated too much or I mean it did

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.789 
exfoliated too much or I mean it did
make<00:01:14.520> my<00:01:14.729> face<00:01:15.000> smooth<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.320> did<00:01:16.530> like<00:01:16.740> that

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
make my face smooth and I did like that

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.120 
make my face smooth and I did like that
it<00:01:17.220> made<00:01:17.400> my<00:01:17.580> skin<00:01:17.640> feel<00:01:18.240> soft<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.229> smooth<00:01:19.530> but

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it made my skin feel soft and smooth but

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.560 
it made my skin feel soft and smooth but
I<00:01:20.159> didn't<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:20.759> see<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.360> really

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
I didn't really see that it really

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.039 
I didn't really see that it really
cleaned<00:01:22.229> out<00:01:22.439> my<00:01:22.470> pores<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.790> regular<00:01:24.270> size

bottle<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.979> think<00:01:26.220> they<00:01:26.369> go<00:01:26.549> for<00:01:26.880> under

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
bottle of this I think they go for under

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.359 
bottle of this I think they go for under
$5<00:01:27.750> at<00:01:27.930> Walmart<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.590> pretty<00:01:29.130> inexpensive

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
$5 at Walmart so it's pretty inexpensive

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.060 
$5 at Walmart so it's pretty inexpensive
