00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
which is the starter didn't have one so

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.820 
which is the starter didn't have one so
well<00:02:39.180> hopefully<00:02:39.480> won't<00:02:39.870> burn<00:02:40.019> out<00:02:40.140> too<00:02:40.200> quick

all<00:02:41.160> right<00:02:41.310> was<00:02:41.549> I<00:02:41.850> guess<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.959> could<00:02:43.110> say<00:02:43.459> free

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
all right was I guess you could say free

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.800 
all right was I guess you could say free
because<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.910> did<00:02:45.030> come<00:02:45.209> off<00:02:45.239> an<00:02:45.480> old<00:02:45.600> engine

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
because it did come off an old engine
