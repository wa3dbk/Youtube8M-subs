00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
because to me they looked a little

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.019 
because to me they looked a little
swollen<00:00:30.140> so<00:00:30.590> I'm<00:00:31.070> going<00:00:31.279> to<00:00:31.310> go<00:00:31.430> ahead<00:00:31.460> and<00:00:31.850> use

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
my brush from also from coastal scents

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.399

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:38.749 
wear wig caps with my units because this

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:41.049

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:45.279 
and it just lay flat and won't shift
around<00:00:43.519> now<00:00:44.269> I<00:00:44.300> did<00:00:44.600> watch<00:00:44.839> the<00:00:44.870> wig

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
of hair I like my wigs to be really

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.150 
of hair I like my wigs to be really
really<00:03:59.240> full<00:03:59.660> the<00:04:00.200> knots<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:00.680> did<00:04:00.920> have<00:04:01.100> to

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
really full the knots I did have to

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.070 
really full the knots I did have to
camouflage<00:04:01.520> them<00:04:02.030> with<00:04:02.180> concealer<00:04:02.750> on<00:04:02.780> they

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
camouflage them with concealer on they

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.440 
camouflage them with concealer on they
looked<00:04:03.260> a<00:04:03.350> little<00:04:03.380> bit<00:04:04.130> swollen<00:04:04.430> but<00:04:04.820> you<00:04:05.300> know

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
looked a little bit swollen but you know

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.330 
looked a little bit swollen but you know
opposed<00:04:05.840> to<00:04:05.990> that<00:04:06.140> I<00:04:06.200> did<00:04:06.560> camouflage<00:04:07.100> from

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
opposed to that I did camouflage from

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.580 
opposed to that I did camouflage from
Casilla<00:04:07.610> and<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:07.940> came<00:04:08.090> out<00:04:08.270> pretty<00:04:08.420> ok<00:04:08.930> but<00:04:09.560> I

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
Casilla and it came out pretty ok but I

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.410 
Casilla and it came out pretty ok but I
just<00:04:09.890> think<00:04:09.980> that<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.550> color<00:04:10.790> needs<00:04:11.060> a<00:04:11.210> little

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
just think that the color needs a little

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.380 
just think that the color needs a little
bit<00:04:11.830> more<00:04:12.850> highlights<00:04:13.850> and<00:04:14.150> it<00:04:14.270> are

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
bit more highlights and it are

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.210 
bit more highlights and it are
highlights<00:04:14.870> in<00:04:15.050> it<00:04:15.170> all<00:04:15.320> together<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:15.830> think<00:04:16.100> it

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
highlights in it all together I think it

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.890 
highlights in it all together I think it
would<00:04:16.340> be<00:04:16.370> great<00:04:16.700> if<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:17.150> unit<00:04:17.450> had<00:04:17.630> some

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
would be great if the unit had some

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.840 
would be great if the unit had some
highlights<00:04:18.290> in<00:04:18.500> it<00:04:18.530> that<00:04:19.250> way<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.700> would

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
highlights in it that way it would

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.520 
highlights in it that way it would
really<00:04:20.090> resemble<00:04:20.750> like<00:04:20.989> a<00:04:21.020> celebrity

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
really resemble like a celebrity

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.920
