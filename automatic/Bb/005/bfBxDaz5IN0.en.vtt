00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
we see the roof does not change color so

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.099 
we see the roof does not change color so
that<00:01:07.750> it<00:01:07.930> maintains<00:01:08.080> its<00:01:08.500> new<00:01:08.740> rich<00:01:09.180> red<00:01:10.180> or<00:01:10.509> in

the case of the LOC the yellow color and

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:16.859 
the case of the LOC the yellow color and
the<00:01:14.109> quick<00:01:14.350> answer<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:14.770> Oh<00:01:15.159> sealing<00:01:15.700> and<00:01:15.909> this

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
the quick answer is Oh sealing and this

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.270 
the quick answer is Oh sealing and this
is<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.109> worst<00:01:17.320> thing<00:01:17.500> you<00:01:17.619> can<00:01:17.740> do<00:01:17.859> to<00:01:17.979> roof

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
and there's only one case where I would

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.340 
and there's only one case where I would
condone<00:01:22.719> the<00:01:23.049> use<00:01:23.079> of<00:01:23.969> a<00:01:24.969> preservative<00:01:25.929> or<00:01:26.229> a
