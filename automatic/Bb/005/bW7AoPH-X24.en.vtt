00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.290 
propel 10-footer a lot of people want to
know<00:00:21.260> what<00:00:21.650> the<00:00:22.190> differences<00:00:22.789> are<00:00:23.030> between

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
know what the differences are between

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.980 
know what the differences are between
this<00:00:23.750> and<00:00:24.020> the<00:00:24.110> Slayer<00:00:24.380> other<00:00:24.920> than<00:00:25.190> length<00:00:25.430> we

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
this and the Slayer other than length we

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.360 
this and the Slayer other than length we
added<00:00:26.990> some<00:00:27.200> width<00:00:27.470> we<00:00:27.740> won<00:00:27.950> the<00:00:28.130> same

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.370 
added some width we won the same

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.660 
added some width we won the same
capacity<00:00:28.700> as<00:00:29.450> a<00:00:29.480> 13<00:00:30.050> head<00:00:30.320> so<00:00:31.130> we<00:00:31.250> add<00:00:31.370> a<00:00:31.400> little

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
capacity as a 13 head so we add a little

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.440 
capacity as a 13 head so we add a little
bit<00:00:31.820> of<00:00:31.850> width

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
bit of width

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.950 
bit of width
you'll<00:00:32.660> see<00:00:32.899> a<00:00:32.930> little<00:00:33.200> square<00:00:33.590> Stern<00:00:34.219> but

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
you'll see a little square Stern but

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.270 
you'll see a little square Stern but
we're<00:00:35.960> actually<00:00:36.079> what<00:00:36.500> we<00:00:36.590> were<00:00:36.710> looking<00:00:37.039> for

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
we're actually what we were looking for

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.440 
we're actually what we were looking for
is<00:00:37.489> lightweight<00:00:38.090> you<00:00:38.719> know<00:00:38.900> as<00:00:40.180> those<00:00:41.180> get

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
is lightweight you know as those get

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.030 
is lightweight you know as those get
bigger<00:00:41.750> they<00:00:41.990> just<00:00:42.170> get<00:00:42.350> heavier<00:00:42.710> is<00:00:42.829> more

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
bigger they just get heavier is more

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.200 
bigger they just get heavier is more
plastic<00:00:43.340> so<00:00:43.910> we're<00:00:44.060> really<00:00:44.270> proud<00:00:44.600> we<00:00:44.900> think

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
plastic so we're really proud we think

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.100 
plastic so we're really proud we think
guesstimating<00:00:47.210> this<00:00:47.660> thing<00:00:47.900> should<00:00:48.079> come

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
guesstimating this thing should come

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.440 
guesstimating this thing should come
into<00:00:48.410> my<00:00:48.590> own<00:00:48.620> sixty<00:00:49.070> nine<00:00:49.250> pounds<00:00:49.700> so<00:00:50.300> what

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
into my own sixty nine pounds so what

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.930 
into my own sixty nine pounds so what
you're<00:00:50.600> saying<00:00:50.840> is<00:00:51.020> sometimes<00:00:51.470> shorter<00:00:51.950> water

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
you're saying is sometimes shorter water

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.180 
you're saying is sometimes shorter water
maybe<00:00:53.239> a<00:00:53.420> little<00:00:53.600> better<00:00:53.840> sometimes<00:00:54.290> shorter

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
maybe a little better sometimes shorter

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.180 
maybe a little better sometimes shorter
is<00:00:55.250> better<00:00:55.390> not<00:00:56.390> all<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.690> time<00:00:56.899> no<00:00:57.770> but<00:00:58.070> really

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
is better not all the time no but really

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.799 
is better not all the time no but really
you<00:00:58.550> know<00:00:58.670> we<00:00:58.850> have<00:00:58.970> a<00:00:59.000> lot<00:00:59.210> of<00:00:59.239> people

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.200 

it's<00:01:02.590> not<00:01:02.800> about<00:01:02.949> on<00:01:03.340> the<00:01:03.579> water<00:01:03.820> it's<00:01:04.150> just

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
it's not about on the water it's just

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.240 
it's not about on the water it's just
dealing<00:01:04.629> with<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.960> boat<00:01:05.140> off<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.379> water<00:01:05.860> and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
dealing with the boat off the water and

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.399 
dealing with the boat off the water and
you<00:01:06.520> know<00:01:06.670> taking<00:01:06.970> 10<00:01:07.299> 15<00:01:07.720> pounds<00:01:07.930> out<00:01:08.229> of<00:01:08.260> the

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
you know taking 10 15 pounds out of the

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.359 
you know taking 10 15 pounds out of the
boats<00:01:08.619> big<00:01:08.979> deal

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
boats big deal

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.950 
boats big deal
so<00:01:09.729> you're<00:01:10.240> thinking<00:01:10.420> it's<00:01:10.720> going<00:01:10.840> to<00:01:10.900> be

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
so you're thinking it's going to be

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.710 
so you're thinking it's going to be
under<00:01:11.259> 70

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
under 70

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.250 
under 70
in<00:01:13.200> all<00:01:13.670> if<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.880> computer<00:01:15.480> is<00:01:15.510> right<00:01:15.840> it

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
in all if the computer is right it

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.620 
in all if the computer is right it
should<00:01:16.620> be<00:01:16.800> understand<00:01:17.460> about<00:01:17.790> 69<00:01:18.360> pounds

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
should be understand about 69 pounds

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.960 
should be understand about 69 pounds
it's<00:01:19.140> cool<00:01:19.410> is<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:20.010> this<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.370> actually<00:01:20.550> on<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
it's cool is is this is actually on a

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.600 
it's cool is is this is actually on a
different<00:01:21.360> style<00:01:21.750> oven<00:01:22.410> called<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.980> biaxial

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
different style oven called a biaxial

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.690 
different style oven called a biaxial
oven<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.930> just<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.950> way<00:01:26.160> that<00:01:26.460> oven<00:01:27.140> forms<00:01:28.140> is

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
oven and just the way that oven forms is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.070 
oven and just the way that oven forms is
supposed<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.850> moles<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.420> end<00:01:30.690> of<00:01:30.780> an<00:01:30.870> arm

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
supposed to moles on the end of an arm

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.530 
supposed to moles on the end of an arm
it<00:01:31.410> kind<00:01:31.620> of<00:01:31.650> does<00:01:31.800> a<00:01:31.830> knuckle<00:01:32.790> movement<00:01:33.270> so

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
it kind of does a knuckle movement so

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.770 
it kind of does a knuckle movement so
you<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.990> get<00:01:34.290> coatings<00:01:35.390> around<00:01:36.390> all<00:01:36.570> these

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
you can get coatings around all these

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.690 
you can get coatings around all these
little<00:01:37.080> indentions<00:01:37.830> a<00:01:37.920> lot<00:01:38.130> better<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.640> more

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
little indentions a lot better and more

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.120 
little indentions a lot better and more
efficiently<00:01:39.510> so<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.530> cause<00:01:40.770> it's<00:01:40.980> on<00:01:41.100> a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
efficiently so it cause it's on a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.010 
efficiently so it cause it's on a
different<00:01:41.370> oven<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.570> molding<00:01:42.990> process

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
different oven in the molding process

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.910 
different oven in the molding process
and<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.310> shorter<00:01:44.960> we've<00:01:45.960> quite<00:01:46.620> a<00:01:46.680> bit<00:01:46.830> of

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
and it's shorter we've quite a bit of

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.010 
and it's shorter we've quite a bit of
weight<00:01:47.010> out<00:01:47.510> one<00:01:48.510> other<00:01:48.690> thing<00:01:48.870> I<00:01:48.960> noticed

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
weight out one other thing I noticed

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.990 
weight out one other thing I noticed
here's<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.650> have<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.800> hat<00:01:50.070> yep

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
here's you have a hat yep

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.030 
here's you have a hat yep
yeah<00:01:51.720> that's<00:01:52.020> more<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.410> couple<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.800> first

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
yeah that's more of a couple of first

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.740 
yeah that's more of a couple of first
things<00:01:53.280> people<00:01:53.520> will<00:01:53.730> notice<00:01:54.120> is<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.510> hatch

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
things people will notice is the hatch

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.110 
things people will notice is the hatch
and<00:01:55.050> we<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.710> know<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:56.100> really<00:01:56.760> love<00:01:56.970> the
