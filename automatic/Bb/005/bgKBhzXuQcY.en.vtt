if you like but when we bend the knees
the<00:00:13.710> backbone<00:00:14.280> should<00:00:15.120> be<00:00:15.360> straight<00:00:16.139> there

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
the backbone should be straight there

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.260 
the backbone should be straight there
shouldn't<00:00:16.650> be<00:00:16.710> any<00:00:16.949> sway<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.910> back<00:00:18.090> in

particular here you know in order to see
this<00:00:21.510> posture<00:00:21.960> what<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.109> tell<00:00:22.350> people<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.710> do<00:00:22.890> is

this posture what I tell people to do is
to<00:00:23.070> lie<00:00:23.340> down<00:00:23.400> on<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.789> ground<00:00:24.560> draw<00:00:25.560> your

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
to lie down on the ground draw your

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.900 
to lie down on the ground draw your
knees<00:00:25.890> up<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.130> then<00:00:26.279> see<00:00:26.490> if<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.640> can<00:00:26.670> get

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
knees up and then see if you can get

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.160 
knees up and then see if you can get
your<00:00:27.029> hand<00:00:27.300> through<00:00:27.660> there<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.140> can

your hand through there and if you can
then<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.769> should<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.070> trying<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.519> push<00:00:29.939> it

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
then you should be trying to push it

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.609 
then you should be trying to push it
down<00:00:30.240> onto<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> ground<00:00:30.810> because<00:00:31.230> that's<00:00:31.439> the

down onto the ground because that's the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.560 
down onto the ground because that's the
correct<00:00:32.219> position<00:00:32.610> for<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.850> backbone<00:00:33.300> you

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
correct position for the backbone you

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.920 
correct position for the backbone you
know<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.739> bent<00:00:34.980> need<00:00:35.309> position<00:00:36.270> it's

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
know in a bent need position it's

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.080 
know in a bent need position it's
straight<00:00:37.440> here<00:00:37.649> no<00:00:37.890> see<00:00:38.399> that's<00:00:38.610> incorrect

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
straight here no see that's incorrect

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
a straight edge down there it should be

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.260 
a straight edge down there it should be
vertical<00:01:31.650> touching<00:01:32.369> your<00:01:32.490> knee<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.880> touching

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
the front of your toe now if I look

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.940 
the front of your toe now if I look
straight<00:01:35.759> down<00:01:35.790> here<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.590> get

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
straight down here and I do this I get

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.560 
straight down here and I do this I get
up<00:01:38.220> there's<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.549> parallax<00:01:39.000> area<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.390> see

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
up there's a parallax area you see

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.870 
up there's a parallax area you see
there's<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.869> parallax<00:01:40.259> error<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.159> I'm<00:01:41.640> not

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
there's a parallax error and so I'm not

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.670 
there's a parallax error and so I'm not
really<00:01:42.150> my<00:01:42.689> knees<00:01:42.869> aren't<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:43.350> over<00:01:43.500> my

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
really my knees aren't really over my

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.560 
really my knees aren't really over my
toes<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.189> think<00:01:44.520> they<00:01:44.700> are<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.329> when<00:01:45.479> you

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
toes but I think they are so when you

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.420 
toes but I think they are so when you
look<00:01:45.750> downwards<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.470> take<00:01:46.829> your<00:01:46.979> knees<00:01:47.159> say

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
look downwards just take your knees say

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.270 
look downwards just take your knees say
about<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.880> half<00:01:48.180> an<00:01:48.360> inch<00:01:48.450> more<00:01:49.229> than<00:01:49.860> over<00:01:50.009> your

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
about a half an inch more than over your

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.069 
about a half an inch more than over your
toes<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.210> will<00:01:51.329> be<00:01:51.479> correct<00:01:51.869> because

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
toes and that will be correct because

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.260 
toes and that will be correct because
there<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> parallax<00:01:52.950> error<00:01:53.220> there<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:54.060> now

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
there is a parallax error there so now

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.060 
there is a parallax error there so now
you<00:01:54.329> see<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.840> that's<00:01:55.320> absolutely<00:01:55.530> correct

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
you see that that's absolutely correct

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.420 
you see that that's absolutely correct
with<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> knees<00:01:56.969> are<00:01:57.149> positioned<00:01:57.570> now<00:01:58.430> so

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
the sacrum is your waist so we can like

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.589 
the sacrum is your waist so we can like
inputs<00:02:21.739> for<00:02:21.920> instance<00:02:22.159> in<00:02:22.280> Taiji<00:02:22.549> we<00:02:23.269> can<00:02:23.420> have

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
inputs for instance in Taiji we can have

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.679 
inputs for instance in Taiji we can have
moves<00:02:23.870> where<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.530> hips<00:02:24.799> and<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.459> waist<00:02:25.700> turn

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
moves where the hips and the waist turn

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.140 
moves where the hips and the waist turn
together<00:02:27.140> or<00:02:27.920> we<00:02:28.189> can<00:02:28.310> have<00:02:28.489> moves<00:02:28.760> where<00:02:29.000> the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
together or we can have moves where the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.710 
together or we can have moves where the
waist<00:02:30.189> turns<00:02:31.189> independently<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.450> hips

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
waist turns independently of the hips

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.509 
waist turns independently of the hips
and<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.959> hips<00:02:33.170> don't<00:02:33.349> move<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:33.920> it's<00:02:34.250> like

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
and the hips don't move so it's like

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.840 
and the hips don't move so it's like
that<00:02:34.939> sort<00:02:35.239> of<00:02:35.359> thing<00:02:35.569> so
