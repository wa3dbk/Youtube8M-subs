00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.070
 after the unexpected defeat of the 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.260
 Week 3 against the Baltimore Ravens 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.760
 the Houston Texans receive the 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.740
 children in the brou ainstein in this 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.260
 next Sunday September 29 for the 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.430
 week four of the nfl 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.259
 houston reached the favorite game 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.970
 for several reasons like for example 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.439
 have the second best defense as soon as 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.989
 total yards allowed to your 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.460
 opponents but mainly enter from 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.349
 favorites because the ravens are not yet 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.970
 they found a good rhythm and their defense 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.220
 is still trying to recover by the 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.989
 lack of several key players but 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.640
 incredibly it was this defense that 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.250
 woke up and helps the team get their 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.480
 second victory of the season 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.949
 this same defense that there was not 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.149
 appeared in previous games managed 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.710
 stop one of the most runners 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.350
 versatile throughout the nfl 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.899
 hernÃ¡n foster with having it just 54 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.300
 total yards in 12 tries while 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.850
 that in Asia he only managed to complete 25 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.609
 of 35 passes for a total of 194 yards 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.839
 and an interception but despite leaving 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.399
 with victory on the offensive of the 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.499
 ravens you can still see what's going on 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.560
 difficult moments I skinny barely managed 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:07.990
 complete 16 of 24 passes for 171 yards 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.700
 no annotations his star runner 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.380
 brain rise could not participate in the 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.130
 I find myself having an injury in his 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.259
 hip 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.180
 and also its aerial game depends a lot on 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.100
 tour since they lost jacoby jones 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.509
 for an injury and they let and juan 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.210
 vote to bring your talent do 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.860
 francisco on the other side the seahawks 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.299
 played against one of the most teams 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.880
 loose from the nfl los jacksonville 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.500
 jaguars that inevitably lost the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.509
 I meet for your bullfight response to 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.210
 air attacks of the wolves in whom 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.770
 managed to complete 14 of 21 passes for 212 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.229
 yards and four touchdowns and one 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.909
 interception they also gave him time to 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.110
 Adverse game jacques in the second 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.970
 field marshal of the team who 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.759
 He completed seven of eight pitching attempts 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.349
 for 129 yards and a score in addition 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.849
 of the great air game also dominated 

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:51.310
 the running game with a combined 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:53.170
 156 yards but the most important thing is that 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.179
 his defense continues to impose respect 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.950
 in the league positioning itself as the best 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.720
 team defensively as to in 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.299
 how many total yards and annotations 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.069
 allowed per game in order we will have a 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.409
 quite interesting and compared game 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.849
 statistically but the performance of the 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.519
 team from houston the week before 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:10.899
 before the ravens left much to be desired 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.730
 I think they will have a difficult afternoon already 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.290
 Despite playing at home I think that 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.819
 the victory will be desired so 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.549
 we recommend a bet on the handicap of 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.940
 the hacks -3 with a quota of 20 5 or more 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.100
 hundred 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.540
 American line thanks for joining me 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.190
 in this little summary and I hope they have 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.450
 enjoyed soon is bringing them more 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.310
 information about your matches 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.080
 favorites and the best thing is free picks from 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.000
 the industry and remember the luck not 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.320
 lends or gives you only pay for the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.320
 be he reformed the dax white
