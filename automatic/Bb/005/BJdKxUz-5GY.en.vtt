more fullness as well and yeah that's
all<00:01:59.709> I<00:01:59.950> can<00:02:00.130> really<00:02:00.280> think<00:02:00.399> about<00:02:00.700> it<00:02:00.969> so<00:02:01.119> get

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
all I can really think about it so get

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.149 
all I can really think about it so get
it<00:02:01.630> ordered<00:02:01.780> in<00:02:02.079> and<00:02:02.350> I<00:02:02.409> used<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:02.679> buy<00:02:02.799> in<00:02:02.950> bulk

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
it ordered in and I used to buy in bulk

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.739 
it ordered in and I used to buy in bulk
and<00:02:03.520> that's<00:02:03.729> how<00:02:03.880> I<00:02:03.909> would<00:02:04.090> get<00:02:04.450> kind<00:02:04.630> of

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
and that's how I would get kind of

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.840 
and that's how I would get kind of
discounts<00:02:05.409> on<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:05.740> because<00:02:06.280> they<00:02:06.369> don't<00:02:06.579> sell

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
discounts on it because they don't sell

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.160 
discounts on it because they don't sell
to<00:02:07.770> individual<00:02:08.770> customers<00:02:09.310> but<00:02:09.940> they<00:02:10.929> are
