00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.560
 u2 veras and numbers understood to this 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.660
 new videos tutorials critical 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.640
 animation no doubt again in this 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.899
 I hope I have already updated 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.180
 sub-leader because I would use version 2.7 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.220
 the whole and the now consists 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.980
 just make a game of colors 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.769
 with a star with a single object that is 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.750
 put different color to each face or if 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.870
 you can also work with 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.329
 a caracas texture to begin with I will use 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.940
 this cube with our blend the bring by 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.670
 defect when we open it 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.670
 I will start by using the key 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.940
 to extract an edition or if those that do not 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.330
 they still do not handle this software well 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.229
 see once selected the object was 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.229
 here where it says 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.510
 It's 99 edition or 20 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.390
 good to choose a face we are going to 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.650
 change here and choose the one you select 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.160
 a good face because it will be the first 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.160
 knew what would be 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:40.110
 over here the material and I will add more 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:46.399
 and this I'm going to give you here again and I'm going to 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.399
 assign a name for example face 1 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.940
 and assign once assigned already I can 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.620
 change color 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.470
 as you can see the color changes only in 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.920
 that face of color that you like 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:05.170
 I'm going to leave it here green then 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:10.020
 book another face and then there is one more here 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.860
 2009 assign for example 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.860
 yellow 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:24.780
 well, there is usually another but not more here than 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:24.780
 today a new assign and I choose the color 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.900
 as you can see 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.660
 I have put a color to each charge good if 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.120
 they like to do the common with texture is what 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.950
 same simply selected the color 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.680
 for example as they already have color this 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.660
 face selected the face and see it here to 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.270
 what would be the textures and I give in 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:55.490
 again you know here picture or movie 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.280
 they look for the image everything here I have a 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.880
 father situ texture 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.390
 and here he said how you can choose this 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.930
 of the bricks 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.930
 and I will see 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.110
 I'm going here from with the projection 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.470
 example was 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.170
 a view 0 with the bed 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.740
 and learn 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.380
 as you can see in the projection of the 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.290
 texture we have to look bad to what 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.830
 we want to see here would be the bricks 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.640
 so for that simply 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.620
 I go here where it says projection and I choose 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.680
 there was 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.450
 and now give the render you will see that here 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.360
 there are the bricks 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.050
 the same can be for each face by 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.000
 example that I want to add 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.090
 a father 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.350
 I choose the color that I already have now one of 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.970
 the texture I go here in image no 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.780
 movie 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.050
 open 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.200
 was my textures filled and then the 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.879
 pending theocracy 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.879
 and what you can go to is 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:21.819
 selection has gone from here open image 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:25.200
 and I do the same thing I go to projection and 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:26.690
 go here on google 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.680
 go 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:35.380
 and apparently it's going to be dark so 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.380
 I'm going to go here in plain sight 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.680
 I will leave the movement I will move 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.680
 a little to the side 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.610
 for today 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.449
 of two 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.449
 today we have 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.810
 and I'm going to give a level 2 or because I do not 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.610
 feel 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.110
 as you can see it works the same as 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.290
 with colors with textures in it 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:10.200
 to not do it is so extensive until 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:13.950
 here said the juice example this 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:18.080
 good friends come this tutorial already 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.080
 is if they need help to something 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.160
 and comment down there from a 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.259
 description to update the 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.259
 version if you like to leave the link is 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:31.110
 Free will not like anything and my 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:34.229
 mail blend of 3d animation at 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.360
 gmail.com and gray social networks also 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.990
 is the entry of a description up
