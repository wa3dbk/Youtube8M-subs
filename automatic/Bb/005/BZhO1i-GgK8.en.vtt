00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 good morning today is saturday and 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.790
 mitra which is already in the house and 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.460
 I quickly cleaned up the house and 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.750
 I baker the news with a red spot 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.429
 on my balls not what I got of the week 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.440
 even though and then it was very youthful 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.870
 it just keeps coming back and me 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.160
 don't know what it is but yes it is 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.600
 just very annoying i can 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
 of course cover with foundation 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.800
 but it just feels very annoying 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.619
 just scratch it for a while but you do n't want to 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.539
 I just cleared up a series and I 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.060
 possible I form your waist and that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.009
 was and I thought I'm going to show you what 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.809
 inside the new air address 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.520
 collection and I have everything a bit 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.809
 sorted below kills it all 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.100
 foam is also so I have that 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.149
 thrown away 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.890
 but i thought i'm going with you 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.750
 through what's in it 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.789
 the first thing i get out is the prince 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.469
 charming showergel 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.600
 then there is also lip scrub in the box 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.800
 and this one seems very tasty 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.510
 surgeon I think the lipscrub of lush 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.969
 always really very nice so I'm going this one 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.800
 try it out 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.379
 then also the cubits 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.640
 love it and this is a soap that you can 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.039
 use for the hands or being 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.229
 body and it also smells super nice 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.760
 by the way, they smell this shower gel too 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.650
 all somewhat the same but floral 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.750
 also buzzes 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.369
 so those are and then it is also in 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.170
 the unicorn words and this is by the way 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.090
 a bubble bar and 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.060
 looks it is not super nice looking 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.920
 then and you just look awesome 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.570
 yummy 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.009
 And then there is also a heart for it 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.990
 in that is what it is called to be 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.939
 two hearts stuck together 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.400
 and in between you have some sparkles 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.829
 are golden glitter 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.270
 also very tasty from this one smells 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.560
 especially very flower overnight if you have one 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.060

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.680
