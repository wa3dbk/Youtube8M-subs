00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.530
 hello guys how are we health and 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.049
 support and this video will be semi educational 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.660
 of how a defibrillator works in the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.760
 real life clear we will not see aspects 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.400
 technical because it's too complicated 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.779
 so we'll talk about it 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.480
 basic for you to know how 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.099
 they work and obviously that has nothing 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.570
 what to do with real life when we 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.940
 those of us who have experience with these 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.340
 things in real life we see how they are used 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.260
 the games, then simply laughing 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.629
 the games we use when a person 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.960
 in quotes he dies in any 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.610
 situation but fellow person for 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.620
 we in the health sector only what 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.530
 we use on certain occasions and in cases 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.360
 very specific that I think is not good 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.760
 I will detail but the explanation more 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.699
 basic is that the defibrillator 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.190
 used to correct abnormal rhythms 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.980
 of the heart that prevent blood 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.480
 flow properly through the body and that 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.880
 previously they have to be fine 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.780
 identified by the doctor because 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.940
 effective 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.460
 these abnormal rhythms could 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.310
 unleash in a death there are many 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.290
 types of them and usually just 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.840
 can be corrected or corrected with 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.380
 one or several electric shocks of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.149
 determined intensity measured in jules and 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.940
 sometimes you have to make use of 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.399
 suitable medications for this 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.710
 certain situation an example is the 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.509
 adrenaline and without you they did not know how 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.430
 you could see an adrenaline ampule or 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.789
 Epinephrine is the same is the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.850
 presented the defibrillator very well 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.369
 we use it when the person is dead 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.020
 in the general public what for 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.409
 we want to say is that you do not 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.569
 when there is to use the systolic 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.729
 assists is a stroke in the 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.560
 electrocardiogram that is represented with 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.039
 a flat line when you see it in 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.270
 the movies is one is a sound of iu 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.039
 and the only thing that wants to tell us this is 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.990
 that there is absence of electrical activity 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.470
 of the heart in these cases is never 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.870
 they use 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.660
 and much less another thing that also gives 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.820
 laugh is that we never unload the 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.730
 palettes as well in this animation and 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.770
 we never project them into the air 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.900
 because if I did and had the 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.150
 apparatus with electric charge already prepared 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.050
 and suddenly it occurs to me to download it in 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.030
 the air 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.370
 good you could generate an arc 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.260
 electric between the pallets and get to 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.060
 my body when it touches my 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.970
 body causes a cardiac arrest 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.460
 immediate and if I'm not treated well 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.170
 obviously it causes me death 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.140
 that these are not things to be 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.480
 playing another worry when we are 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.900
 unloading the pallets is that you should not 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.240
 if there is nobody touching anything near the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.070
 patient should only be the 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.110
 person in charge of revealing that in 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.880
 this case is the doctors and from there in 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.930
 out nobody should be near nobody 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:02.170
 must touch nothing because it can result 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.090
 that the download spreads and the 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.190
 patient is touching some part of 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.330
 metal of the bed you are touching that 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.310
 metal part of the bed 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.950
 and it's up to you all the download for 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.640
 complete and I already saw it in person and it's a 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.530
 frankly situation that is horrible 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.620
 because not only do you have a person 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.870
 that is at mortal risk if there are no two and 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.370
 you have to understand them at the same time very 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.020
 well let's explain that we have here this 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.120
 is a biphasic wave defibrillator 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.090
 means that the current stops 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.680
 one pallet to another in one direction and 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.080
 just before determining the 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.820
 discharge is going to reverse the sense of 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.640
 current trip that means 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.350
 biphasic and ok we determined that the 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.300
 heart needs a download in this 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.790
 knob we select the amount of 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.290
 load in jules this is determined by a 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.680
 relationship between the weight of the person 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.450
 and the jules and if we do not know how much it weighs 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.230
 the good person becomes a 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.610
 approach and before placing the 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.950
 pallets in the patient in the torso 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.170
 naked of the patient you have to 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.080
 put a conductive gel to each of one of 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.959
 and so they rubbed but is that 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.480
 they rub but only rub themselves 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.030
 distribute the conductive gel because if not 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.780
 we use the conductive gel we provoke a 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.540
 burning 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.519
 quite considerable in the patient and 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.430
 this is reason for us to sue 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:26.090
 us and how can you see the pallets 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.430
 are labeled as apex and external 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.040
 that says stern um we put it near the 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.700
 sternum a little bit next to the sternum 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.620
 and below the clavicle the apex 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.380
 it is placed in the fifth space 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.930
 intercostal intercostal steps 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.570
 space that is between the ribs and 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.390
 the middle axillary line I show you here 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.919
 what are the axillary lines and good 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.650
 moment that we put these 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.060
 pallets in the patient to us in 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.010
 our screen begins to give us a 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.930
 electrocardiogram trace we can see 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.090
 the activity of the heart and since it is 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.910
 the story that was identified everything is 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.070
 starts charging with the knob is very 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.669
 good listen and impose the noise 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.669
 very much 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.870
 since the download is ready it 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.060
 press these two buttons at the same 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.920
 time but only when it matches 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.200
 with certain pulses of the heart that 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.510
 detect the defibrillator if it does not 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.090
 coordinates the download with the beats 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.820
 may cause other problems in or 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.220
 when you discharge the patient does not bounce 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.600
 as in the movies there is not a 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.460
 movement like when it gives you a 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.110
 how cold when you're going to breathe 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.090
 that's more or less the movement and 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.090
 basically since we see that the rhythm 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.440
 cardiac is very good it cleans up and it 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.530
 continues with the care that the 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.660
 patient requires so as you will see no 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.480
 has absolutely no game 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.030
 it requires a lot of knowledge but 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.820
 I think this video was going to interest them 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.430
 I really regret that I can not 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.620
 teach them well effectively half as 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.440
 how it is used but the rules of my 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.790
 hospital are very severe and that 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.140
 can do this recording was of 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.120
 miracle 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.520
 so comment what do you think of the 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:12.120
 Regarding this topic, they thought it was 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:15.030
 something so complicated and how has it 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.569
 changed his perspective regarding 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.699
 this one for 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:19.080
 after knowing this information good 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.330
 guys I wanted to share this with you 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.159
 you know we have our networks 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.679
 social networks of facebook twitter we are in 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:28.800
 the latam team live in tweets and that 

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:31.770
 we will be doing more transmissions more 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.499
 followed and I wait for your comments ladies 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.949
 and gentlemen, I'm not supportive and we'll see each other 

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:36.949
 the one that follows
