great but time has changed them and I

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.609 
great but time has changed them and I
can<00:01:18.270> pretty<00:01:18.299> much<00:01:18.510> guarantee<00:01:18.840> they<00:01:19.290> don't

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
can pretty much guarantee they don't

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.590 
can pretty much guarantee they don't
sound<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> same<00:01:20.189> as<00:01:20.640> they<00:01:20.790> did<00:01:20.850> back<00:01:21.330> then

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
sound the same as they did back then

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.020 
sound the same as they did back then
when<00:01:22.380> you're<00:01:22.500> working<00:01:22.860> all<00:01:23.009> digital<00:01:23.549> it's

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
when you're working all digital it's

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.640 
when you're working all digital it's
amazing<00:01:24.570> what<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.810> get<00:01:24.990> used<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.320> it's

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
amazing what you get used to it's

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.920 
amazing what you get used to it's
perfect<00:01:26.130> every<00:01:26.369> time<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:27.150> close<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.570> session

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
perfect every time you close the session

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.260 
perfect every time you close the session
you<00:01:28.049> open<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.409> up<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:28.799> exactly<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.340> same<00:01:29.549> but

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
you open it up it's exactly the same but

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.419 
you open it up it's exactly the same but
with<00:01:30.540> analog<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.229> not<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:32.009> there<00:01:32.280> are

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
with analog it's not that there are

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.929 
with analog it's not that there are
changes<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:34.100> you're<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.340> you're<00:01:35.579> hearing

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
changes and you're just you're hearing

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.209 
changes and you're just you're hearing
things<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.630> don't<00:01:36.810> normally<00:01:37.530> hear<00:01:37.979> with

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
things that you don't normally hear with

00:01:38.219 --> 00:02:00.760 
things that you don't normally hear with
all<00:01:38.399> digital

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.020 

here<00:02:01.770> we<00:02:01.950> have<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.810> beautiful<00:02:03.810> vintage<00:02:05.030> Neve

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
manufactured in around 1973 and we've

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.520 
manufactured in around 1973 and we've
actually<00:02:12.120> fitted<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.810> out<00:02:12.930> with<00:02:13.110> brand<00:02:13.350> new

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
for quite a few years now and it took a

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.600 
for quite a few years now and it took a

few goes at it I had a I had to find out

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.440 
few goes at it I had a I had to find out
the<00:02:38.790> best<00:02:39.000> gain<00:02:39.510> structure<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.940> using<00:02:41.940> the

the best gain structure and using the

the best gain structure and using the

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
1080 force to give it that little extra

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.660 
1080 force to give it that little extra
analog<00:02:47.100> warmth<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.330> we're<00:02:48.810> always

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
analog warmth that we're always

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.540 
analog warmth that we're always
desperate<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.850> get<00:02:51.600> these<00:02:51.840> days<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:52.890> we're

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
desperate to get these days so we're

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.270 
desperate to get these days so we're
kind<00:02:53.820> of<00:02:53.880> recreating<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.810> vintage<00:02:55.320> console<00:02:55.830> but

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
kind of recreating a vintage console but

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.770 
kind of recreating a vintage console but
also<00:02:56.519> with<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.570> advantages<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.440> using<00:02:58.550> a<00:02:59.780> more

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
also with the advantages of using a more

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.170 
also with the advantages of using a more
up-to-date<00:03:01.170> modern<00:03:01.650> mic<00:03:02.370> pre<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:03.350> EQ<00:03:04.350> section

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
up-to-date modern mic pre and EQ section

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.259 
up-to-date modern mic pre and EQ section
and<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.989> course<00:03:07.170> another<00:03:07.970> great<00:03:08.970> thing<00:03:09.120> about

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
and of course another great thing about

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.350 
and of course another great thing about
these<00:03:09.570> is<00:03:10.190> these<00:03:11.190> actually<00:03:11.640> use<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:12.030> original

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
these is these actually use the original
