00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:23.580
 on December 4 , 1949 in the city 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.570
 of Santa NÃ©zia in the state of Rio de 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.689
 January 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.840
 lucy gallucci as usual after the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.000
 I was reading a book on the banks. 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.550
 of a dam in the region 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.399
 she suddenly notices the presence of a 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.100
 man walking towards him when 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.520
 he came closer she saw that in the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.190
 reality was not a man to be 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.460
 he wore a white suit fitted to the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.039
 body had a big forehead with hair 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.070
 thin and smooth in white 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.000
 her ears were pointed and had no 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.149
 wolves 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.820
 for those who do not know the lobe is the part of 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.900
 under the ear where it is normally 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.869
 they put earrings on the nose of the seraphim and 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.840
 his eyes had a color between yellow and 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:17.009
 brown as well as not possessing 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.909
 The eyelashes surrounding the eyelashes began to 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.580
 talk to Lucy about the 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.979
 possibility of life on other planets 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.990
 during the conversation he revealed that 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.590
 there are numerous planets with 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.020
 extremely advanced civilizations 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.020
 than humans and that as a way of 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.659
 overcome overpopulation and maintain 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.880
 living civilization many of them 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.049
 colonized other planets not 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.720
 inhabited 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.659
 often had to change their footing 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.720
 the planets so that they could be 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.630
 to new residents 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.360
 he still told that the planet earth in 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.909
 a distant past has received three 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.240
 extraterrestrial civilizations 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.060
 colonize the planet adaptation was 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.770
 difficult and many of the settlers 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.660
 aliens regressed to brutality 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.630
 while others progressed 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.170
 technologically at a given point 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.990
 the most advanced people revolted against 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.990
 his home planet and after several 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.080
 conflict, a council responsible for 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.500
 colonization on earth decided to cut 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.680
 for an indefinite period with the 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.740
 terrestrial colony and after numerous 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.180
 catastrophic events that occurred in the 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.180
 planet Earth 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.690
 the inhabitants eventually regressed 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.460
 to the point of forgetting their 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.010
 own origins 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.740
 the board continues to observe its 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.980
 colony and following the situation of 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:59.820
 terrestrial distance without interfering and 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.240
 nor to contact after the conversation 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:06.330
 and left and was never seen again 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.480
 in this case it is interesting because being 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.050
 who contacted Lucy spoke of theories that 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.980
 would only be released 19 years later 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:20.340
 with the book were the astronaut gods 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.770
 of erick von daniken in addition what the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.590
 sir told the light if it hits the 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.470
 several other cases the information 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.740
 rich folotyn already registered 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.340
 the question that remains is why you 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.550
 told all this to Lucy that what a being 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.680
 visibly non-human was doing 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.280
 there outdoors 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.150
