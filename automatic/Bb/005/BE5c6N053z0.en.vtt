can't put it in this one right here you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.889 
can't put it in this one right here you
have<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.609> put<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.789> in<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.939> number<00:01:48.149> three<00:01:48.419> four

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
have to put it in the number three four

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.809 
have to put it in the number three four
five<00:01:49.139> six<00:01:49.380> seven<00:01:49.709> eight<00:01:49.799> or<00:01:50.009> nine<00:01:50.249> slot<00:01:50.639> and

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
five six seven eight or nine slot and

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.789 
five six seven eight or nine slot and
I'll<00:01:51.539> just<00:01:51.659> do<00:01:51.779> that<00:01:51.840> by<00:01:52.049> pressing<00:01:52.499> the<00:01:52.590> number

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
I'll just do that by pressing the number

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.849 
I'll just do that by pressing the number
3<00:01:53.039> on<00:01:53.069> it<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.700> goes<00:01:53.880> straight<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.270> my

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
3 on it and it goes straight to my

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:58.489 
3 on it and it goes straight to my
number<00:01:55.859> 3<00:01:56.039> slot<00:01:56.310> now<00:01:56.869> sometimes<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.319> bug

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
number 3 slot now sometimes this can bug

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:59.479 
number 3 slot now sometimes this can bug
out<00:01:58.679> and<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.069> will<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.369> disappear

00:01:59.479 --> 00:01:59.489 
out and it will just disappear

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:01.639 
out and it will just disappear
immediately<00:02:00.029> if<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.749> you<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:01.079> do<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.380> again

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
immediately if so you just do it again

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.010 
immediately if so you just do it again
but<00:02:02.399> if<00:02:02.639> you've<00:02:02.880> done<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.149> right<00:02:03.419> then<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.869> can

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
but if you've done it right then you can

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.819 
but if you've done it right then you can
actually<00:02:05.450> glitch<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.659> game<00:02:06.840> out<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.380> now<00:02:07.770> you

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
actually glitch the game out and now you

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.100 
actually glitch the game out and now you
see<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.190> I'm<00:02:08.399> actually<00:02:08.520> breaking<00:02:09.110> blocks

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
see that I'm actually breaking blocks

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.940 
see that I'm actually breaking blocks
with<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> sword

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
with a sword

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.040 
with a sword
now<00:02:11.160> you're<00:02:11.520> not<00:02:11.580> meant<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.850> do<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.120> in<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
now you're not meant to do that in the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.900 
now you're not meant to do that in the
PC<00:02:13.410> edition<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.220> Minecraft

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
PC edition of Minecraft

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.090 
PC edition of Minecraft
so<00:02:15.210> and<00:02:15.720> it's<00:02:15.870> also<00:02:16.020> bugged<00:02:16.410> by<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.680> fact<00:02:16.950> that

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
so and it's also bugged by the fact that

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.560 
so and it's also bugged by the fact that
there's<00:02:17.280> no<00:02:17.400> sound<00:02:17.670> effect<00:02:18.060> every<00:02:18.360> time<00:02:18.540> I

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
there's no sound effect every time I

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.330 
there's no sound effect every time I
break<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:19.110> block<00:02:19.350> it's<00:02:19.680> just<00:02:19.950> completely

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
break a block it's just completely

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.640 
break a block it's just completely
silent<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.330> this<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.630> like<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.990> bugged<00:02:22.260> sword

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
silent so this is like a bugged sword

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.170 
silent so this is like a bugged sword
but<00:02:23.220> what<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.400> can<00:02:23.520> actually<00:02:23.610> do<00:02:23.910> with<00:02:23.940> this

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
but what you can actually do with this

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.320 
but what you can actually do with this
now<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.870> sometimes<00:02:25.710> if<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.580> press<00:02:26.820> e<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.300> will

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
now is sometimes if you press e it will

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.360 
now is sometimes if you press e it will
disappear<00:02:27.930> completely<00:02:28.080> but<00:02:28.830> if<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.010> again<00:02:29.160> if

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
disappear completely but if you again if

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.920 
disappear completely but if you again if
you<00:02:29.550> do<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:29.910> just<00:02:29.940> do<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.630> trick<00:02:30.840> again

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
you do it you just do the trick again

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.190 
you do it you just do the trick again
and<00:02:31.970> all<00:02:32.970> will<00:02:33.120> be<00:02:33.210> fine<00:02:33.390> but<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.050> actually

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
and all will be fine but you actually

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.800 
and all will be fine but you actually
need<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.710> like<00:02:34.890> over<00:02:35.700> kill<00:02:36.000> an<00:02:36.210> animal<00:02:36.360> or

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
need to like over kill an animal or

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.380 
need to like over kill an animal or
break<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.350> block<00:02:37.740> with<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.490> that<00:02:39.210> means

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
break a block with this and that means

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.570 
break a block with this and that means
it's<00:02:39.750> solid<00:02:40.200> now<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.620> won't<00:02:40.830> disappear<00:02:40.980> it's<00:02:41.460> a

ghost chest plate it'll actually stay

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.680 
ghost chest plate it'll actually stay
forever<00:03:40.980> now<00:03:41.280> but<00:03:41.850> if<00:03:41.940> it<00:03:42.060> does<00:03:42.240> disappear

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
forever now but if it does disappear

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.000 
forever now but if it does disappear
then<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:42.960> just<00:03:43.140> try<00:03:43.350> it<00:03:43.380> again<00:03:43.560> and

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
then you just try it again and

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.520 
then you just try it again and
eventually<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.120> will<00:03:45.150> become<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.480> solid<00:03:45.720> chest

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
eventually it will become a solid chest

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.320 
eventually it will become a solid chest
plate<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:47.220> now<00:03:47.400> what<00:03:47.580> I<00:03:47.610> can<00:03:47.790> do<00:03:47.910> with<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:48.120> is

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
plate and now what I can do with this is

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.900 
plate and now what I can do with this is
put<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.630> back<00:03:48.750> in<00:03:48.930> my<00:03:49.050> inventory<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.890> then<00:03:50.190> do

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
put it back in my inventory and then do

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.810 
put it back in my inventory and then do
not<00:03:51.570> duplicate<00:03:52.050> but<00:03:52.770> I<00:03:52.800> can<00:03:53.040> enchant<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.520> again

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
not duplicate but I can enchant it again

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.520 
not duplicate but I can enchant it again
and<00:03:54.060> then<00:03:54.240> this<00:03:54.390> is<00:03:54.570> a<00:03:54.600> solid<00:03:54.959> one<00:03:55.080> as<00:03:55.200> well<00:03:55.350> so

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
and then this is a solid one as well so

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.010 
and then this is a solid one as well so
I<00:03:55.560> can<00:03:55.709> just<00:03:55.970> enchant<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.300> that

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
I can just enchant that and that

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.480 
I can just enchant that and that
basically<00:03:58.530> is<00:03:58.770> it<00:03:58.920> it's<00:03:59.040> quite<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.250> simple

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
basically is it it's quite a simple

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.850 
basically is it it's quite a simple
trick<00:03:59.820> but<00:04:00.260> quite<00:04:01.260> tricky<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.650> get<00:04:01.740> the<00:04:01.830> hang

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
trick but quite tricky to get the hang

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.340 
trick but quite tricky to get the hang
of<00:04:02.130> at<00:04:02.280> first<00:04:02.520> but<00:04:02.880> that<00:04:03.270> is<00:04:03.450> basically<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.050> I

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
of at first but that is basically it I
