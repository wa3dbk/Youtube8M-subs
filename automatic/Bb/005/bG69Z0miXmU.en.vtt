00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
to a source of fire you can create a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.630 
to a source of fire you can create a

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
powerful flamethrower so fire can be a

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.540 
powerful flamethrower so fire can be a
very<00:01:56.970> efficient<00:01:57.510> ally<00:02:01.040> but<00:02:02.040> fire<00:02:02.370> is<00:02:02.400> a

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
very efficient ally but fire is a

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.910 
very efficient ally but fire is a
double-edged<00:02:03.060> sword<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.410> also<00:02:04.590> become
