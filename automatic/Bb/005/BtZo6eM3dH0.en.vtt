 Osaka 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.029
 This is sad as far as here 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.440
 Oh 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.320
 They are the day of the strongest unit in Kirigakushi 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.690
 Fog student 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.690
 It is the predecessors of the new breed 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.390
 Good Iiii 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.620
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.840
 Hidden teacher Hm 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.110
 User Department Satohiro 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.490
 That two people I stopped 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.440
 I see 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:18.390
 Can't you say that Kakashi is a Zabza ? 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.390
 There are two people about eight 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:29.820
 So let's fight as much as we think 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.820
 Yes it's true ah 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.890
 Liquor Our opponent is that there is a six-man strategy 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.880
 Great teacher 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.770
 Guy it just damage is increased over time to the equivalent of spear-based mischief 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.729
 This is the number of owners 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:55.610
 Let's go in a mass defeat Reit Sakura Support me 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:59.820
 It 's too dangerous to put together that level of pleasure as much as possible 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.659
 If you let the other party out and aim at each individual defeat, you are sure 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.659
 me 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.210

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:41.030
 I also understand that Guy Sensei says 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.030
 I think it is better to work here to break down the entry into the arm 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:54.080
 I'm aware of some unreasonableness- I'm not going to spend time here 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.080
 At once annihilate the ninjatō seven Shu in our power 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:08.200
 I understand your feelings of Saga 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:14.300
 Is to minimize the results to damage people's but who fought together here is somewhat unreasonable to 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:15.810
 Pada All right, there is nothing we can not do if we combine our power 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.890
 understood 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.280
