here's<00:05:09.310> my<00:05:09.370> draft<00:05:09.730> another<00:05:10.690> shot<00:05:11.020> caller

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
here's my draft another shot caller

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.040 
here's my draft another shot caller
whoever<00:05:12.160> you<00:05:12.250> make<00:05:12.490> your<00:05:12.790> shot<00:05:13.030> caller<00:05:13.300> gets

whoever you make your shot caller gets

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.800 
whoever you make your shot caller gets
extra<00:05:14.560> points<00:05:14.610> so<00:05:15.610> it's<00:05:16.300> twenty-five<00:05:16.660> percent

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
extra points so it's twenty-five percent

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.780 
extra points so it's twenty-five percent
more<00:05:17.200> so<00:05:17.590> if<00:05:17.710> burning<00:05:18.070> gets<00:05:18.250> a<00:05:18.340> hundred<00:05:18.640> points

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790
