00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.730
 hi i am andre sticking the 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.420
 screen protector is not always even 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.400
 simple 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.010
 In this video I show how I do it 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.199
 approach with a screen protector 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.270
 always cream covers you supplied yourself 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.010
 a cleaning cloth and often there too 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.300
 a squeegee with that is a piece 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.430
 plastic that makes the scheme delicious 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.320
 easily push and we are going now 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.240
 the phone in order to the screen 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.680
 to stick the protector 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.780
 you prepare the device 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.039
 First turn off the device 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.809
 is very important that the not per 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.550
 accident can jump on and it is also 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.440
 good to the device after it is turned off 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.550
 is one of cooling 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.679
 may sound a bit weird 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.929
 a device also produces heat and that 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:45.760
 also makes the material slightly different 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:47.679
 when your device turns off 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.989
 in the meantime, you can already do it 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.129
 make the screen very grease-free and 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.539
 dust free 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.579
 you can do that by optional also 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.819
 like a skewer screenclean the bee 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.690
 take baby's cream well covers your syringe 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:01.089
 just 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.870
 screenclean on the device and according 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.370
 you can with a cloth 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.770
 cleaning everything neatly is over too 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.420
 what room you are in is important 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.920
 for example handy to do it in 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.719
 a bathroom after you shower 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.729
 since the then very little dust in the 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.380
 air is therefore making you whole 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.360
 few dust particles on your screen 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.390
 will come and therefore no cover 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.939
 it is easier to paste now 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.810
 the device cleaned properly and then 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.070
 we pick it up according to the screen tact 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.869
 that's what i can watch two 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.000
 sides a step one 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.710
 and step2 well I have one is the first 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.689
 side that is the bottom actually that 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.280
 Well also goes toward the screen 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.079
 then remove your 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.399
 so what do you do now then you love 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.500
 quiet 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.149
 the bottom a little bit off 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.640
 completely gold him 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.939
 well according to the turn the device so that 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.859
 it easy to place it is 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.189
 important to properly underside the bottom 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:56.229
 lines 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.109
 against the bottom of the phone 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.969
 because if that's good and also in it 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.429
 in the middle then I will be in tact there too 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.920
 stick well in one go 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.240
 we see that tech skin has already made 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.069
 we can now get the squeezie that comes with it 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.620
 is use is also possible 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.180
 use a pass to the rest of the 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.350
 contributors effects stick back 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.360
 you had to be careful while on 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.360
 paste here the other way 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.239
 no you also see it right in this 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.800
 Case went well here 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.540
 for example the camera and the speaker 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.880
 are properly aligned 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.830
 you will always find some air bubbles 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.870
 especially in the edges that you can 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.709
 simply press for example with the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.300
 squeezie 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.220
 you could also do a cleaning 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.200
 Use a wipe for the little one 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.330
 yes a little air bubbles, the bottom 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.010
 pressing to the sides and sometimes 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.989
 the very small bubbles remain 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.580
 they usually go away within a day 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.260
 if not then you can do that one more 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.640
 try to push away to the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.350
 the top cannot be damaged anyway 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.420
 so gram you can excuse it because 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.000
 you still have protection on this 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.730
 well now you can take the protection off 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.900
 you do that by being so careful off it 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.250
 to pull 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.470
 well now maybe i should see the self 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.580
 seen that this is the clear variant 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.860
 completely transparent 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.180
 also looks yes quite tight and good 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.260
 to see that he is nowhere about the 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.849
 edge 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.530
 well now it can occur and often 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.000
 for when there is a lot of dust in the air 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.980
 that the ergs has a little dust around it 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.180
 And that is very annoying because you 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.190
 now actually quite the screen draws one 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.750
 trot should get and that goes well 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.700
 a bit awkward anyway what 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.859
 the solution for that is normal 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.799
 normal old-fashioned tape 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.030
 you take a piece of tape that you tear off 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.450
 with that you can change the script tag 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.130
 lift 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.609
 so you paste it in here for example 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.220
 edge and you grab a second piece of tape 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.350
 already giving you the piece of fields 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.700
 can undermine what you now believe 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.299
 can do is the screen ticked and bit 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.100
 lift 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.930
 see that he comes you can with it 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.160
 remove another piece of tape from the field 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.840
 if it is on the screen of course 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.850
 down to the bottom 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.590
 and then always child I'm doing it you do 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.269
 it against the top and like that 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.870
 according to weather is good you can again 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.980
 press everything neatly with the squeegee 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.510
 and now only a little tricky is the 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.209
 tape is properly attached, it is now whole 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.920
 remove carefully 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.930
 Well you can have it removed again 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.359
 to calm down with the cleaning cloth 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.920
 push the air bubbles away and then it is 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.920
 your screen protector perfectly pasted
