today<00:00:06.180> you're<00:00:07.019> going<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.200> learn<00:00:07.349> about<00:00:08.179> the

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
today you're going to learn about the

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.350 
today you're going to learn about the
cell<00:00:09.450> membrane<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.139> you<00:00:11.090> will<00:00:12.090> see<00:00:12.390> how<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:13.110> is

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
cell membrane and you will see how it is

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.420 
cell membrane and you will see how it is
semipermeable<00:00:15.830> we're<00:00:16.830> going<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.039> do<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.160> lab

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
semipermeable we're going to do a lab

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.509 
semipermeable we're going to do a lab
that<00:00:17.460> we<00:00:17.849> have<00:00:18.150> nicknamed<00:00:19.019> the<00:00:19.470> baggy<00:00:19.710> lab<00:00:20.099> and

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:20.519 
that we have nicknamed the baggy lab and

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.640 
that we have nicknamed the baggy lab and
you'll<00:00:21.509> see<00:00:21.720> why<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.079> a<00:00:22.140> minute<00:00:22.259> we're<00:00:22.560> going

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
you'll see why in a minute we're going

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.279 
you'll see why in a minute we're going
to<00:00:22.739> use<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.919> baggie<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.929> represent<00:00:24.929> the<00:00:25.050> cell

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
to use a baggie to represent the cell

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.489 
to use a baggie to represent the cell
membrane<00:00:26.869> you'll<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:28.019> working<00:00:28.349> with<00:00:28.380> a

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:28.499 
membrane you'll be working with a

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.969 
membrane you'll be working with a
partner<00:00:29.749> one<00:00:30.749> of<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.960> will<00:00:31.169> be<00:00:31.319> in<00:00:31.439> charge<00:00:31.769> of

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:31.979 
partner one of you will be in charge of

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:36.259 
partner one of you will be in charge of
the<00:00:32.610> iodine<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:35.070> other<00:00:35.309> will<00:00:35.579> be<00:00:35.609> in<00:00:35.940> charge

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:36.269 
the iodine the other will be in charge

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.950 
the iodine the other will be in charge
of<00:00:36.649> the<00:00:37.649> starch<00:00:38.120> if<00:00:39.120> you're<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.480> charge<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
of the starch if you're in charge of the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.939 
of the starch if you're in charge of the
starch<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.769> will<00:00:40.949> need<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> baggie<00:00:42.949> graduated

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
starch you will need a baggie graduated

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.869 
starch you will need a baggie graduated
cylinder<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:45.019> some<00:00:46.019> starch<00:00:46.460> it'll<00:00:47.460> either<00:00:47.640> be

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
cylinder and some starch it'll either be

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.290 
cylinder and some starch it'll either be
in<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.059> flask<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.199> one<00:00:49.440> or<00:00:50.059> maybe<00:00:51.059> it'll

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
in a flask like this one or maybe it'll

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.439 
in a flask like this one or maybe it'll
be<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.539> beaker<00:00:52.550> so<00:00:53.550> what<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.850> need<00:00:53.999> to<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.300> is

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
be in a beaker so what you need to do is

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.720 
be in a beaker so what you need to do is
pour<00:00:54.809> measure<00:00:55.440> 40<00:00:56.010> milliliters<00:00:56.280> into<00:00:57.210> your

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
pour measure 40 milliliters into your

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.639 
pour measure 40 milliliters into your
graduated<00:00:59.730> cylinder<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:01.050> will<00:01:01.230> pour<00:01:01.499> it

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
graduated cylinder and you will pour it

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.460 
graduated cylinder and you will pour it
into<00:01:01.859> your<00:01:01.980> baggie<00:01:02.839> you<00:01:03.839> might<00:01:04.050> need<00:01:04.260> somebody

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
into your baggie you might need somebody

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.050 
into your baggie you might need somebody
to<00:01:04.680> hold<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> baggie<00:01:05.100> open<00:01:05.519> for<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.790> maybe

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
to hold the baggie open for you maybe

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.840 
to hold the baggie open for you maybe
not<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.440> is<00:01:07.590> how<00:01:07.740> you'll<00:01:07.920> measure<00:01:08.340> 40

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
not so this is how you'll measure 40

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.340 
not so this is how you'll measure 40
milliliters<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.570> starch<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:11.900> if<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.140> get<00:01:13.320> a

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
milliliters of starch and if you get a

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:26.250 
milliliters of starch and if you get a
little<00:01:13.620> bit<00:01:13.710> over<00:01:13.950> 40<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.460> okay

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.090 

so<00:01:26.860> that's<00:01:27.070> a<00:01:27.190> little<00:01:27.430> bit<00:01:27.580> over<00:01:27.880> 40<00:01:28.860> but<00:01:29.860> that

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
so that's a little bit over 40 but that

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.980 
so that's a little bit over 40 but that
is<00:01:30.220> quite<00:01:30.430> alright<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:31.210> now<00:01:31.630> you're<00:01:31.810> going<00:01:31.930> to

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
is quite alright and now you're going to

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.770 
is quite alright and now you're going to
pour<00:01:32.170> that<00:01:32.410> into<00:01:32.740> your<00:01:33.310> baggy<00:01:33.610> and<00:01:34.330> then

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
pour that into your baggy and then

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:57.069 
pour that into your baggy and then
you're<00:01:34.930> going<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:35.080> tie<00:01:35.860> your<00:01:36.070> baggy<00:01:36.340> in<00:01:36.520> a<00:01:36.640> knot

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.660 

and<00:01:58.079> now<00:01:58.530> you're<00:01:58.740> going<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.920> get<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> air<00:01:59.369> out

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
and now you're going to get the air out

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:10.309 
and now you're going to get the air out
and<00:02:01.520> this<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> whole<00:02:02.820> bunch<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.119> times<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.959> tie

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
and this a whole bunch of times and tie

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:22.040 
and this a whole bunch of times and tie
it<00:02:10.380> up<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.830> up<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:21.180> there<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.390> got<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.840> most

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
it up in and up so there I got that most

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.740 
it up in and up so there I got that most
of<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.260> air<00:02:22.410> out<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.180> is<00:02:24.239> my<00:02:24.540> little

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
of the air out so this is my little

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.690 
of the air out so this is my little
model<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.519> a<00:02:26.519> cell<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.680> this<00:02:28.680> bag<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.190> like<00:02:29.459> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
model of a cell and this bag is like the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.390 
model of a cell and this bag is like the
cell<00:02:29.910> membrane<00:02:31.790> okay<00:02:33.739> so<00:02:34.739> that's<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.130> starch

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
cell membrane okay so that's the starch

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.059 
cell membrane okay so that's the starch
person's<00:02:35.850> job<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.930> iodine<00:02:37.319> person<00:02:37.769> will<00:02:37.920> need

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
person's job the iodine person will need

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.160 
person's job the iodine person will need
a<00:02:38.310> beaker<00:02:39.299> and<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:40.350> test<00:02:40.590> tube<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.989> are

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
a beaker and a test tube and you are

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.130 
a beaker and a test tube and you are
going<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.560> measure<00:02:43.769> some<00:02:44.580> water<00:02:45.500> 20<00:02:46.500> mils<00:02:46.709> and

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
going to measure some water 20 mils and

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.470 
going to measure some water 20 mils and
some<00:02:49.140> iodine<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.849> are<00:02:50.970> going<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.209> put<00:02:51.360> it

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
some iodine and you are going to put it

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.589 
some iodine and you are going to put it
in<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.959> beaker<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:53.730> iodine<00:02:54.150> will<00:02:54.330> be<00:02:54.450> up

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
in the beaker the iodine will be up

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.539 
in the beaker the iodine will be up
front<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.230> here's<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.680> iodine<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.400> your

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
front so here's the iodine and your

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.250 
front so here's the iodine and your
beaker<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.180> graduated<00:02:57.660> cylinder<00:02:58.079> and

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
beaker and you graduated cylinder and

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.750 
beaker and you graduated cylinder and
you're<00:02:58.769> going<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:58.950> measure<00:02:59.040> 20<00:02:59.489> milliliters

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
you're going to measure 20 milliliters

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.080 
you're going to measure 20 milliliters
of<00:03:00.030> iodine<00:03:00.950> again<00:03:01.950> if<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.370> pour<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.730> little<00:03:03.000> bit

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
of iodine again if you pour a little bit

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:10.940 
of iodine again if you pour a little bit
over<00:03:03.359> it's<00:03:03.570> okay<00:03:06.560> wear<00:03:07.560> your<00:03:07.769> goggles<00:03:09.950> okay

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
over it's okay wear your goggles okay

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.090 
over it's okay wear your goggles okay
that's<00:03:11.220> about<00:03:11.400> 20<00:03:12.530> if<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.590> go<00:03:13.769> a<00:03:13.799> little<00:03:13.980> bit

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
that's about 20 if you go a little bit

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.270 
that's about 20 if you go a little bit
over<00:03:14.370> it's<00:03:14.489> alright<00:03:15.530> don't<00:03:16.530> pour<00:03:16.799> it<00:03:16.829> back<00:03:16.950> if

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
over it's alright don't pour it back if

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.340 
over it's alright don't pour it back if
you<00:03:17.310> go<00:03:17.489> over<00:03:17.820> all<00:03:18.750> right<00:03:18.810> so<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.079> are<00:03:19.170> going

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
you go over all right so you are going

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.990 
you go over all right so you are going
to<00:03:19.410> pour<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:19.829> into<00:03:20.720> your<00:03:21.720> beaker<00:03:24.079> and<00:03:26.000> you're

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
to pour that into your beaker and you're

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.849 
to pour that into your beaker and you're
also<00:03:27.150> going<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.510> measure<00:03:27.720> 20<00:03:28.170> milliliters<00:03:28.500> of

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
also going to measure 20 milliliters of

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:36.620 
also going to measure 20 milliliters of
water<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.700> put<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.090> in<00:03:30.269> there<00:03:30.450> as<00:03:30.600> well

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.270 

so<00:03:37.630> that's<00:03:37.840> about<00:03:37.990> 20<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:38.710> little<00:03:38.920> bit<00:03:39.010> over

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
so that's about 20 a little bit over

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.440 
so that's about 20 a little bit over
tiny<00:03:40.270> bit<00:03:40.480> over<00:03:40.690> that's<00:03:40.870> okay<00:03:42.090> take<00:03:43.090> your<00:03:43.270> 20

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
tiny bit over that's okay take your 20

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.450 
tiny bit over that's okay take your 20
milliliters<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:44.110> water<00:03:44.440> and<00:03:44.770> pour<00:03:44.980> that<00:03:45.160> into

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
milliliters of water and pour that into

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.370 
milliliters of water and pour that into
your<00:03:45.970> 20<00:03:46.750> milliliters<00:03:47.050> of<00:03:48.000> iodine<00:03:49.320> now<00:03:50.320> you

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
your 20 milliliters of iodine now you

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.270 
your 20 milliliters of iodine now you
have<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.620> solution<00:03:51.280> made<00:03:52.120> of<00:03:52.300> iodine<00:03:52.870> and<00:03:53.280> water

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
have a solution made of iodine and water

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.720 
have a solution made of iodine and water
notice<00:03:55.060> how<00:03:55.600> dark<00:03:55.990> the<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.890> iodine<00:03:57.310> is<00:03:57.460> here

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
notice how dark the the iodine is here

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.160 
notice how dark the the iodine is here
that's<00:03:57.880> because<00:03:58.120> there's<00:03:58.420> not<00:03:58.600> so<00:03:58.810> much<00:03:58.930> water

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
that's because there's not so much water

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.790 
that's because there's not so much water
in<00:03:59.380> it

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
in it

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.270 
in it
the<00:04:00.400> more<00:04:00.640> watery<00:04:01.090> or<00:04:01.330> it<00:04:01.540> gets<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:03.010> yellow

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
the more watery or it gets the yellow

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.600 
the more watery or it gets the yellow
where<00:04:03.460> it<00:04:03.580> gets<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:05.440> now<00:04:05.650> you<00:04:06.130> can<00:04:06.250> take<00:04:06.460> that

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
where it gets so now you can take that

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.950 
where it gets so now you can take that
back<00:04:06.670> to<00:04:07.030> your<00:04:07.120> desk<00:04:07.330> and<00:04:07.630> you're<00:04:07.810> going<00:04:07.930> to

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
back to your desk and you're going to

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.170 
back to your desk and you're going to
set<00:04:08.230> it<00:04:08.350> up<00:04:08.470> as<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.710> little<00:04:09.190> cell<00:04:09.610> and<00:04:09.850> we're

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
set it up as a little cell and we're

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.970 
set it up as a little cell and we're
back<00:04:10.300> at<00:04:10.480> your<00:04:10.600> desk<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:11.080> you<00:04:11.530> are<00:04:11.680> going<00:04:11.890> to

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
back at your desk and you are going to

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.050 
back at your desk and you are going to
pour<00:04:12.460> about<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.030> quarter<00:04:13.510> of<00:04:13.540> a<00:04:13.900> test<00:04:14.200> tube<00:04:15.060> so

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
pour about a quarter of a test tube so

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.180 
pour about a quarter of a test tube so
about<00:04:16.239> 1/4<00:04:16.359> of<00:04:16.720> a<00:04:16.780> test<00:04:16.989> tube<00:04:17.230> you're<00:04:17.980> going<00:04:18.130> to

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
about 1/4 of a test tube you're going to

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.130 
about 1/4 of a test tube you're going to
pour<00:04:18.400> your<00:04:18.690> water<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:19.840> iodine<00:04:20.380> solution<00:04:20.920> in

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
pour your water and iodine solution in

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:29.070 
pour your water and iodine solution in
so<00:04:23.140> we<00:04:23.350> need<00:04:23.500> about<00:04:23.620> 1/4<00:04:24.130> of<00:04:24.310> that<00:04:27.420> and<00:04:28.420> that's

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
so we need about 1/4 of that and that's

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.510 
so we need about 1/4 of that and that's
about<00:04:29.320> right<00:04:31.740> okay

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.689 

so<00:04:37.520> 1/4<00:04:37.940> of<00:04:38.030> a<00:04:38.060> test<00:04:38.300> tube<00:04:38.509> and<00:04:39.400> we<00:04:40.400> are<00:04:40.520> going

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
so 1/4 of a test tube and we are going

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:46.860 
so 1/4 of a test tube and we are going
to<00:04:40.910> set<00:04:41.150> that<00:04:43.270> into<00:04:44.270> our<00:04:44.300> beaker<00:04:45.580> before<00:04:46.580> you

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
to set that into our beaker before you

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.510 
to set that into our beaker before you
move<00:04:47.870> on<00:04:48.080> you<00:04:48.440> need<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:48.650> write<00:04:48.979> the<00:04:49.250> word

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
move on you need to write the word

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.589 
move on you need to write the word
before<00:04:49.940> on<00:04:50.569> this<00:04:51.560> test<00:04:51.830> tube<00:04:52.069> right<00:04:52.550> here<00:04:52.599> with

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
before on this test tube right here with

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.300
