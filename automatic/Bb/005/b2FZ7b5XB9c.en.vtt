popularized by Cristiano Ronaldo he puts

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.240 
popularized by Cristiano Ronaldo he puts
his<00:00:32.610> mercurial<00:00:33.000> superfly<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.930> hot<00:00:34.890> water<00:00:35.070> for

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
his mercurial superfly in hot water for

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.930 
his mercurial superfly in hot water for
about<00:00:35.520> 20<00:00:35.910> minutes<00:00:36.090> before<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.540> game<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.940> so

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
about 20 minutes before a game so so

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.569 
about 20 minutes before a game so so
basically<00:00:39.329> he<00:00:39.750> does<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.440> reduce<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
basically he does that to reduce the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.729 
basically he does that to reduce the
break<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.940> time<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.750> basically<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.350> hot<00:00:43.530> water

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
break in time so basically the hot water

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.680 
break in time so basically the hot water
simulates<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.579> break<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.120> time<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
simulates the break in time and

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.170 
simulates the break in time and
eventually<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:47.010> 20<00:00:47.340> minutes<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.789> as<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:48.030> you

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
eventually in 20 minutes it's as if you

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.569 
eventually in 20 minutes it's as if you
completely<00:00:48.870> broke<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> shoe<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.340> because

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
completely broke the shoe in so because

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.270 
completely broke the shoe in so because
Ronaldo<00:00:51.480> does<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.320> because<00:00:52.770> he<00:00:52.890> gets<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.160> new

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
Ronaldo does that because he gets a new

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.040 
Ronaldo does that because he gets a new
shoe<00:00:53.489> every<00:00:53.789> single<00:00:54.059> game<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.780> he<00:00:54.870> doesn't

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
shoe every single game so he doesn't

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.590 
shoe every single game so he doesn't
have<00:00:55.199> time<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.469> break<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.039> shoe<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:57.239> so

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
have time to break in a shoe but so

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.180 
have time to break in a shoe but so
there's<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.930> lot<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.079> pros<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> hot<00:00:58.980> water

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
there's a lot of pros to the hot water

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.369 
there's a lot of pros to the hot water
trip<00:00:59.460> but<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.149> think<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.660> my<00:01:00.809> opinion<00:01:00.840> there<00:01:01.350> are

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
trip but I think in my opinion there are

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.160 
trip but I think in my opinion there are
more<00:01:01.620> cons<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.460> outweigh<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> pros<00:01:03.270> so

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
more cons and that outweigh the pros so

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.780 
more cons and that outweigh the pros so
I'm<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.379> going<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> go<00:01:04.619> into<00:01:05.070> brief<00:01:05.369> detail

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.710 
I'm just going to go into brief detail

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
well with the shoe because the upper is

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.039 
well with the shoe because the upper is
glued<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> outsole<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.780> we<00:01:33.780> own<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
whole hot water with glue is not a good

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.630 
whole hot water with glue is not a good
mixture<00:01:36.659> it'll<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.590> completely<00:01:38.189> weekend

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
mixture it'll just completely weekend

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.880 
mixture it'll just completely weekend
the<00:01:38.759> attractive<00:01:39.390> forces<00:01:39.689> between<00:01:39.840> out<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.770> on

the attractive forces between out so on
the<00:01:41.040> upper<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:42.119> definitely<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.950> not<00:01:44.159> good

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the upper so definitely that is not good

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.580 
the upper so definitely that is not good

Irving<00:01:56.310> part<00:01:56.520> here<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.329> t90<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.920> gonna

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
Irving part here on the t90 it's gonna

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.289 
Irving part here on the t90 it's gonna
you're<00:01:59.280> going<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.729> flaking<00:02:00.149> off<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
you're going to see that flaking off a

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.270 
you're going to see that flaking off a
bit<00:02:00.600> you're<00:02:01.200> going<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.409> see<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.799> outsole

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
bit you're going to see the outsole

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.410 
bit you're going to see the outsole
coming<00:02:03.000> apart<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:04.320> definitely<00:02:04.829> don't<00:02:05.790> do<00:02:06.270> it

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
coming apart so definitely don't do it

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.650 
coming apart so definitely don't do it
because<00:02:07.759> it's<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:08.970> going<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.209> run<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.479> life

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
because it's just going to run the life

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.949 
because it's just going to run the life
of<00:02:09.840> your<00:02:09.929> shoe<00:02:10.430> if<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:12.360> want<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.629> get<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> new

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
of your shoe if you want to get a new

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.440 
of your shoe if you want to get a new

shoe
let's<00:02:13.840> say<00:02:13.959> every<00:02:14.260> month<00:02:14.530> then<00:02:14.920> go<00:02:15.280> right

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
let's say every month then go right

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.460 
let's say every month then go right
ahead<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.879> do<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.209> hot<00:02:16.360> water<00:02:16.569> trick<00:02:16.810> but<00:02:17.379> if

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
ahead and do the hot water trick but if

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.410 
ahead and do the hot water trick but if
you<00:02:17.560> want<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:17.739> shoot<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.040> last<00:02:18.310> don't<00:02:19.120> do<00:02:19.300> the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
you want to shoot the last don't do the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.540 
you want to shoot the last don't do the
hot<00:02:19.569> water<00:02:19.780> trick<00:02:20.080> it'll<00:02:20.500> come<00:02:20.650> it's<00:02:21.099> just<00:02:21.370> not

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
hot water trick it'll come it's just not

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.270 
hot water trick it'll come it's just not
a<00:02:21.730> good<00:02:21.849> idea<00:02:22.140> but<00:02:23.140> if<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.650> do<00:02:23.830> want<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:24.129> for

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
a good idea but if you do want it for

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.259 
a good idea but if you do want it for
those<00:02:24.400> who<00:02:24.519> do<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.730> want<00:02:24.879> to<00:02:24.910> do<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.120> hot

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
those who do you want to do the hot

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.650 
those who do you want to do the hot
water<00:02:25.480> trick<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:26.500> would<00:02:27.160> say<00:02:27.340> do<00:02:27.550> it<00:02:27.580> once<00:02:27.849> soak

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
water trick I would say do it once soak

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.080 
water trick I would say do it once soak
it<00:02:28.810> in<00:02:28.870> moderately<00:02:29.620> hot<00:02:29.830> water<00:02:30.130> for<00:02:30.640> about<00:02:30.730> 10

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
it in moderately hot water for about 10

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.960 
it in moderately hot water for about 10
minutes<00:02:31.269> and<00:02:31.510> then<00:02:32.500> just<00:02:33.250> walk<00:02:33.430> around<00:02:33.640> in<00:02:33.910> a

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
minutes and then just walk around in a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.120 
minutes and then just walk around in a
sea<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.510> know<00:02:34.590> walk<00:02:35.590> around<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:35.980> house

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
sea of it you know walk around the house

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.280 
sea of it you know walk around the house
let's<00:02:36.489> say<00:02:36.640> for<00:02:36.880> about<00:02:36.970> 10<00:02:37.239> minutes<00:02:37.450> jump

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
let's say for about 10 minutes jump

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.080 
let's say for about 10 minutes jump
around<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:39.250> know<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.370> touch<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:39.700> ball<00:02:39.819> within

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
around you know a touch the ball within

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.080 
around you know a touch the ball within
it<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.360> little<00:02:40.660> bit<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.819> will<00:02:42.819> simulate

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
it a little bit so that will simulate

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.030 
it a little bit so that will simulate
breaking<00:02:43.599> time<00:02:43.750> as<00:02:43.900> well<00:02:44.049> it<00:02:44.319> won't<00:02:44.620> reduce<00:02:44.769> it

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
breaking time as well it won't reduce it

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.650 
breaking time as well it won't reduce it
completely<00:02:45.549> but<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.120> will<00:02:46.330> reduce<00:02:46.480> the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
completely but it will reduce the

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.289 
completely but it will reduce the
break-in<00:02:47.049> time<00:02:47.200> by<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.410> lot<00:02:47.650> but<00:02:47.970> only<00:02:48.970> do<00:02:49.180> it

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
break-in time by a lot but only do it

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.089 
break-in time by a lot but only do it
another<00:02:49.840> thing<00:02:50.049> I<00:02:50.110> what<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.349> say<00:02:50.470> only<00:02:50.830> do<00:02:50.980> it

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
another thing I what to say only do it

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.789 
another thing I what to say only do it
if<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.400> have<00:02:51.549> a<00:02:51.730> carbon<00:02:52.120> fiber<00:02:52.269> so<00:02:52.959> plate<00:02:53.260> cute
