00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.900 

now<00:01:31.410> you<00:01:31.470> don't<00:01:31.710> only<00:01:31.980> see<00:01:32.310> one<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.760> know<00:01:32.850> are

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
now you don't only see one you know are

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.550 
now you don't only see one you know are
we<00:01:33.030> see<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.300> actually<00:01:33.630> more<00:01:33.840> than<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:36.560> we've

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
we see you actually more than one we've

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.760 
we see you actually more than one we've
got<00:01:37.590> clipped<00:01:38.040> fast<00:01:38.400> because<00:01:38.790> we<00:01:39.150> don't<00:01:39.770> see

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
got clipped fast because we don't see

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.030 
got clipped fast because we don't see
them<00:01:41.510> we've<00:01:42.510> got<00:01:42.780> clips<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.530> money's<00:01:43.770> really

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
them we've got clips the money's really

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:54.200 
them we've got clips the money's really
fast<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:49.100> this<00:01:50.100> theory<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.910> I'm<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:53.210> learned

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
fast so this theory that I'm in learned

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.170 
fast so this theory that I'm in learned
about<00:01:54.390> here<00:01:54.920> not<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.160> top<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.490> edge<00:01:56.760> under<00:01:57.090> the

about here not on top of edge under the
ridge<00:01:57.330> there<00:01:57.990> are<00:01:58.080> we<00:01:58.170> signed<00:01:58.410> when<00:01:59.100> he<00:01:59.130> trucks

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
ridge there are we signed when he trucks

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.700 
ridge there are we signed when he trucks
there<00:02:01.580> and<00:02:03.110> if<00:02:04.110> you're<00:02:04.530> lucky<00:02:04.710> enough<00:02:05.390> you

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710
