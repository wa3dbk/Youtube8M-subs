00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
now it is slightly off and I've tried to

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.190 
now it is slightly off and I've tried to
work<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.140> case<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:18.360> kind<00:02:18.569> of<00:02:18.629> massage<00:02:18.989> it

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
work this case to kind of massage it

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.559 
work this case to kind of massage it
into<00:02:19.349> place<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.099> can<00:02:20.129> see<00:02:20.610> when<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.450> do

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
into place and you can see when I do

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.540 
into place and you can see when I do
that<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:23.959> moves<00:02:24.959> but<00:02:25.319> then<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.590> moves<00:02:25.800> back<00:02:26.040> so

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
that it moves but then it moves back so

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.930 
that it moves but then it moves back so
there<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.239> slight<00:02:27.780> misalignment<00:02:28.349> as<00:02:29.340> you

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
there is a slight misalignment as you

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.809 
there is a slight misalignment as you
can<00:02:30.120> see<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.840> doesn't<00:02:31.200> cause<00:02:31.769> any<00:02:32.099> issues<00:02:32.400> with

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
can see it doesn't cause any issues with

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.850 
can see it doesn't cause any issues with
the<00:02:32.970> sound<00:02:33.330> or<00:02:33.720> anything<00:02:34.050> like<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.230> but<00:02:34.709> it's

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
the sound or anything like that but it's

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.559 
the sound or anything like that but it's
something<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.430> would<00:02:36.239> probably<00:02:36.540> want

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
something that you would probably want

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.220

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
much of a problem with it impacting the

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.520 
much of a problem with it impacting the
flash<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.290> that's<00:03:34.530> that's<00:03:35.010> nice<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.639> see<00:03:35.880> here

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530

but<00:03:37.530> again<00:03:37.799> over<00:03:38.250> time<00:03:38.489> this<00:03:38.819> clear<00:03:39.239> case<00:03:39.510> is

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
but again over time this clear case is

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.539 
but again over time this clear case is
going<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.230> receive<00:03:40.530> some<00:03:40.799> scratches<00:03:41.310> on<00:03:41.340> the

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
going to receive some scratches on the

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:42.979 
going to receive some scratches on the
back<00:03:41.670> that's<00:03:42.000> just<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.450> nature<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.840> the

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
back that's just the nature of the

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.440 
back that's just the nature of the
material<00:03:43.109> that<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.709> can<00:03:43.980> see<00:03:44.250> here<00:03:44.579> and

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
material that you can see here and

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.910 
material that you can see here and
you'll<00:03:45.630> want<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:45.930> make<00:03:45.989> sure<00:03:46.139> that<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.590> really

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
you'll want to make sure that you really

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.470 
you'll want to make sure that you really
keep<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.549> case<00:03:47.790> clean<00:03:48.180> on<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.450> inside

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
keep the case clean on the inside

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.080 
keep the case clean on the inside
because<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:50.130> know<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.280> wipe<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.700> case<00:03:50.880> down

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
because you know I wipe the case down

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.000 
because you know I wipe the case down
before<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:51.510> put<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:51.840> on<00:03:51.930> but<00:03:52.170> you<00:03:52.290> can<00:03:52.470> still<00:03:52.769> see

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
before I put it on but you can still see

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.449 
before I put it on but you can still see
specks<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.819> dust<00:03:54.180> on<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:55.170> underside<00:03:55.709> so<00:03:56.190> when

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
specks of dust on the underside so when

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.309 
specks of dust on the underside so when
you<00:03:56.639> install<00:03:57.120> this<00:03:57.299> case<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:57.840> might<00:03:57.989> want<00:03:58.230> to

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
you install this case you might want to

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.349 
you install this case you might want to
wipe<00:03:58.440> it<00:03:58.680> down<00:03:58.859> and<00:03:59.160> then<00:03:59.280> blow<00:03:59.639> some

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
wipe it down and then blow some

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.180 
wipe it down and then blow some
compressed<00:04:00.870> air<00:04:01.019> in<00:04:01.410> there<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.709> try<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:01.980> get

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
compressed air in there to try to get

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.970 
compressed air in there to try to get
any<00:04:02.459> dust<00:04:03.120> out<00:04:03.480> of<00:04:03.660> there<00:04:03.870> but<00:04:04.290> overall<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.950> is

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
any dust out of there but overall it is

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.430 
any dust out of there but overall it is
a<00:04:05.099> nice<00:04:05.370> case<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.030> think<00:04:06.389> that<00:04:07.109> if<00:04:07.230> maybe

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
a nice case and I think that if maybe

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.970 
a nice case and I think that if maybe
you<00:04:07.620> have<00:04:07.739> like<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.329> skin<00:04:09.329> on<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.599> back<00:04:09.750> in<00:04:10.079> sgp

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
you have like a skin on the back in sgp

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.509 
you have like a skin on the back in sgp
skin<00:04:11.310> or<00:04:11.579> a<00:04:11.609> gelaskin<00:04:12.090> or<00:04:12.510> decalgirl<00:04:12.930> skin

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
skin or a gelaskin or decalgirl skin

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.460 
skin or a gelaskin or decalgirl skin
this<00:04:14.519> might<00:04:14.910> work<00:04:15.269> really<00:04:15.720> nicely<00:04:15.870> because

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
this might work really nicely because

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.469 
this might work really nicely because
you'd<00:04:17.190> have<00:04:17.250> that<00:04:17.489> skin<00:04:17.910> you'd<00:04:18.120> be<00:04:18.239> able<00:04:18.329> to

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
you'd have that skin you'd be able to

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:19.969 
you'd have that skin you'd be able to
see<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:18.750> but<00:04:19.049> you'd<00:04:19.200> also<00:04:19.320> have<00:04:19.470> a<00:04:19.590> level<00:04:19.799> of

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
see it but you'd also have a level of

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.670 
see it but you'd also have a level of
protection<00:04:20.190> as<00:04:20.849> well<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:21.570> wish<00:04:22.229> that<00:04:22.470> these

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
protection as well I wish that these

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.420 
protection as well I wish that these
ends<00:04:23.130> were<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.340> little<00:04:23.789> bit<00:04:24.060> more<00:04:24.590> firm<00:04:25.590> because

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
ends were a little bit more firm because

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.350 
ends were a little bit more firm because
I<00:04:26.580> don't<00:04:26.760> like<00:04:26.970> how

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
I don't like how

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.499 
I don't like how
pull<00:04:27.599> away<00:04:27.719> so<00:04:27.870> easily<00:04:28.550> but<00:04:29.550> overall<00:04:29.819> it's<00:04:30.240> not

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
pull away so easily but overall it's not

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.529 
pull away so easily but overall it's not
a<00:04:30.539> bad<00:04:30.780> case<00:04:31.189> and<00:04:32.189> again<00:04:32.550> that<00:04:32.789> is<00:04:32.909> the<00:04:33.090> griffin

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
a bad case and again that is the griffin
