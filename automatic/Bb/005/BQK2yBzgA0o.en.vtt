the<00:00:11.580> blocks<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:12.300> I'm<00:00:12.450> adding<00:00:12.780> only<00:00:12.929> working

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
the blocks that I'm adding only working

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.470 
the blocks that I'm adding only working
spout<00:00:13.650> but<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> lot<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.549> commands<00:00:14.940> work<00:00:15.240> in

spout but a lot of the commands work in

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.950 
spout but a lot of the commands work in
bucket<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:17.340> if<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.550> have<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> bucket<00:00:18.000> client<00:00:18.600> or

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
bucket so if you have a bucket client or

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.179 
bucket so if you have a bucket client or
if<00:00:19.230> you're<00:00:19.410> not<00:00:19.470> about<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.800> client<00:00:20.039> if<00:00:20.100> you

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
if you're not about the client if you

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.359 
if you're not about the client if you
have<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> Bukkit<00:00:20.670> server<00:00:21.890> that<00:00:22.890> doesn't<00:00:23.250> have

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
have a Bukkit server that doesn't have

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.759 
have a Bukkit server that doesn't have
spout<00:00:23.699> installed<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.660> will<00:00:24.689> still<00:00:25.380> run<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
spout installed it will still run the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.000 
spout installed it will still run the
bucket<00:00:26.869> features<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.140> will<00:00:28.380> not<00:00:28.529> run<00:00:28.740> any<00:00:28.769> a

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
bucket features it will not run any a

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.009 
bucket features it will not run any a
spout<00:00:29.310> feature<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.880> because<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.810> don't<00:00:30.960> have

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
spout feature so because you don't have

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.150 
spout feature so because you don't have
spout<00:00:31.820> you<00:00:32.820> know<00:00:32.910> that's<00:00:33.210> kind<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.450> obvious

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160
