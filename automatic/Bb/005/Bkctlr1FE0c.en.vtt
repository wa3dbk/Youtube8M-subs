00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
close to the surface

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.840 
close to the surface
and<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.209> really<00:02:53.480> isn't<00:02:53.630> gonna<00:02:53.810> work<00:02:54.520> now<00:02:55.520> one

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
and it really isn't gonna work now one

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:56.890 
and it really isn't gonna work now one
thing<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.030> really<00:02:56.360> want<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.570> watch<00:02:56.690> out<00:02:56.870> for

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
thing you really want to watch out for

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.020 
thing you really want to watch out for
is<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:57.800> you<00:02:57.920> do<00:02:58.040> not<00:02:58.160> swim<00:02:58.610> towards<00:02:58.940> the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
is that you do not swim towards the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.090 
is that you do not swim towards the
beach<00:02:59.209> because<00:02:59.510> if<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:00.290> get<00:03:00.440> close<00:03:00.709> enough<00:03:00.980> to

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
beach because if you get close enough to

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.550 
beach because if you get close enough to
the<00:03:01.190> beach<00:03:01.930> hopefully<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:02.990> can<00:03:03.080> tell<00:03:03.320> if<00:03:03.470> it
