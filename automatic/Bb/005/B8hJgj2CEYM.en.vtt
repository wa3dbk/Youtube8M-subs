00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.900
 good good I'll show you the other game 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:11.880
 this is my club 2 also with the 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.860
 brake accelerator and steering wheel 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.430
 of changing position to get the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.430
 best view 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.720
 we have the game here 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.939
 said game in which we will have to 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.410
 steering wheel accelerator prize and squeezed the 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.410
 accelerator will be able to see 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.420
 what accelerates 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.420
 and fly to perfection 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.060
 at the same time considered look for 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.060
 behind 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.570
 well functioning to perfection clear 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:54.660
 that with the length of this cable without 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.660
 no problem this pedal as arrived 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.430
 at the bottom 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.430
 I can drive 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.010
 although it costs at the beginning a little is 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.390
 quite interesting to see that the 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.390
 fire works perfectly 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.600
 as you can see it works well 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.240
 these would be the two peoples that I have 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.470
 tested and that works perfectly 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.470
 if I could increase the brightness 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.239
 today 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.980
 as you can see with one hand I'm 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.690
 holding the phone to shoot and 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.270
 with the other I handle the steering wheel so 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.410
 certainly for those who think that in 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.720
 I'm really 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:39.730
 I'm not using dif systems so 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.730
 demarcate would be wrong 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.210
 then these would be the other part of the 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.820
 video the mini- video of three videos 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.270
 in which I show the flyer 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.340
 in the other video shows the game the 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.680
 games that I use for product works 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.270
 well and in the third video I will show how 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.340
 do the steering wheel 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.340
 thank you very much for your for your visits
