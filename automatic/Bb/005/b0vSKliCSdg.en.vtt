Smurfette<00:00:08.090> I<00:00:09.090> started<00:00:10.050> drawing<00:00:10.340> another

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
Smurfette I started drawing another

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.549 
Smurfette I started drawing another
Smurf<00:00:11.849> but<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.480> decided<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.049> didn't<00:00:13.290> want<00:00:13.469> to

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
Smurf but I decided I didn't want to

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.670 
Smurf but I decided I didn't want to
make<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.799> video<00:00:14.009> painfully<00:00:14.849> long<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.420> I

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
make this video painfully long so I

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.900 
make this video painfully long so I
decided<00:00:16.680> not<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.580> add<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:18.380> not<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.500> have<00:00:19.590> that

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
decided not to add this not to have that

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.660 
decided not to add this not to have that
okay<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:20.970> we'll<00:00:21.330> start<00:00:21.570> by<00:00:21.660> drawing<00:00:21.869> an<00:00:22.670> oval

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
okay so we'll start by drawing an oval

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.120 
okay so we'll start by drawing an oval
add<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.740> slight<00:00:25.740> angle<00:00:26.180> just<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:28.130> noble

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
add a slight angle just like that noble

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.609 
add a slight angle just like that noble
and<00:00:29.279> draw<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> guideline<00:00:30.390> through<00:00:30.840> which<00:00:31.080> right

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and draw a guideline through which right

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.470 
and draw a guideline through which right
through<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.949> center<00:00:32.309> correct<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.120> little<00:00:33.360> bit

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
through the center correct a little bit

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.590 
through the center correct a little bit
will<00:00:34.079> be<00:00:34.230> where<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.250> which<00:00:35.820> will<00:00:36.030> show<00:00:36.480> us

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
will be where in which will show us

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.360 
will be where in which will show us
through<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> eyes<00:00:36.989> go<00:00:37.260> then<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.160> draw<00:00:38.340> a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
through the eyes go then you draw a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.490 
through the eyes go then you draw a
triangle<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.390> which<00:00:39.840> will<00:00:40.020> be<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
triangle like so which will be the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.920 
triangle like so which will be the
beginning<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.010> dress<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.629> you<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.780> just

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
beginning of the dress and you can just

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.520 
beginning of the dress and you can just
draw<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.500> rectangle<00:00:44.190> they're<00:00:45.020> going<00:00:46.020> outwards

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
draw a rectangle they're going outwards

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.750 
draw a rectangle they're going outwards
and<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.489> rectangle<00:00:48.180> at<00:00:48.420> her<00:00:48.690> side<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.520> then<00:00:50.520> two

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
and a rectangle at her side and then two

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.779 
and a rectangle at her side and then two
squared<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.989> then<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.230> square<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:53.370> one<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.699> our

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
squared and then a square for one of our

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.270 
squared and then a square for one of our
hands<00:00:54.329> those<00:00:55.320> two<00:00:55.530> rectangles<00:00:55.980> with<00:00:56.070> your

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
hands those two rectangles with your

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.540 
hands those two rectangles with your
arms<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.789> then<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.090> draw<00:00:57.440> two<00:00:58.550> rectangles

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
arms and then you draw two rectangles

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.599 
arms and then you draw two rectangles
touching<00:01:00.030> at<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.320> bottom<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.160> triangle

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
touching at the bottom of the triangle

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.160 
touching at the bottom of the triangle
it'll<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:02.940> her<00:01:03.090> legs<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.840> could<00:01:03.960> draw

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
it'll be her legs and you could draw

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.090 
it'll be her legs and you could draw
just<00:01:05.159> ovals<00:01:05.580> for<00:01:05.700> her<00:01:06.030> feet<00:01:06.420> I'm<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.409> making

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
just ovals for her feet I'm just making

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.340 
just ovals for her feet I'm just making
the<00:01:08.189> head<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> little<00:01:08.610> bit<00:01:08.700> bigger<00:01:09.200> then<00:01:10.200> you

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
the head a little bit bigger then you

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.080 
the head a little bit bigger then you
draw<00:01:10.560> kind<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> triangle<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
draw kind of like a triangle for the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.859 
draw kind of like a triangle for the
other<00:01:12.360> hand<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:13.400> more<00:01:14.400> spread<00:01:14.939> out<00:01:14.970> because

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
other hand it's more spread out because

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.359 
other hand it's more spread out because
her<00:01:16.110> fingers<00:01:16.500> are<00:01:16.680> spread<00:01:16.860> out<00:01:16.950> instead<00:01:17.310> of

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
her fingers are spread out instead of

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.450 
her fingers are spread out instead of
closing<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.850> fist<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.830> here<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.860> was<00:01:20.070> drawing

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
closing the fist and here I was drawing

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.630 
closing the fist and here I was drawing
the<00:01:20.700> other<00:01:20.909> Smurfs<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.490> wouldn't<00:01:23.490> follow

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the other Smurfs but I wouldn't follow

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.460 
the other Smurfs but I wouldn't follow
along<00:01:24.240> with<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.570> because<00:01:24.750> i'm<00:01:25.020> not<00:01:25.170> going<00:01:25.439> to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
along with that because i'm not going to

show<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.860> how<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.100> finish<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:27.049> because<00:01:28.049> then

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
show you how to finish that because then

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.600 
show you how to finish that because then
the<00:01:28.470> video<00:01:28.710> would<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:28.920> been<00:01:29.009> too<00:01:29.159> long<00:01:29.310> so

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610

and<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:14.140> bottom<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.530> her<00:02:14.650> hair<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.430> started

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
and the bottom of her hair and I started

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.230 
and the bottom of her hair and I started
drawing<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.540> circle<00:02:16.810> for<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.230> tip<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.860> hat

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
drawing a circle for the tip of the hat

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.870 
drawing a circle for the tip of the hat
but<00:02:19.240> i<00:02:19.600> erase<00:02:20.410> that<00:02:20.650> because<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.310> didn't<00:02:21.700> like

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
but i erase that because I didn't like

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.820 
but i erase that because I didn't like
it<00:02:22.090> because<00:02:22.240> it<00:02:22.480> was<00:02:22.540> way<00:02:22.750> too<00:02:22.780> big<00:02:23.110> as<00:02:23.380> you

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
it because it was way too big as you

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.400 
it because it was way too big as you
could<00:02:23.950> tell<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:25.120> he<00:02:25.180> erased<00:02:25.480> that<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:28.410> I

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
could tell so he erased that and I

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:38.730 
could tell so he erased that and I
tempted<00:02:30.130> drawing<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:30.820> again<00:02:36.959> but<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:38.320> didn't

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
tempted drawing it again but that didn't

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.020 
tempted drawing it again but that didn't
turn<00:02:38.950> out<00:02:39.130> well<00:02:39.190> either<00:02:41.580> well<00:02:42.580> I<00:02:42.610> guess<00:02:42.850> it

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
turn out well either well I guess it

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.979 
turn out well either well I guess it
wasn't<00:02:43.180> as<00:02:43.450> bad<00:02:43.750> but<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:45.340> didn't<00:02:45.790> like<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:48.989> I

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
wasn't as bad but I didn't like it and I

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.990 
wasn't as bad but I didn't like it and I
just<00:02:50.370> accidentally<00:02:51.370> erased<00:02:51.670> some<00:02:51.850> of<00:02:51.880> the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
just accidentally erased some of the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.100 
just accidentally erased some of the
head<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.330> every<00:02:52.540> did<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:56.910> then<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:58.239> drew<00:02:58.690> two

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
head so every did that then I drew two

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.040 
head so every did that then I drew two
circles<00:02:59.680> touching<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.640> they're<00:03:01.390> touching<00:03:01.870> at

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
circles touching and they're touching at

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.030 
circles touching and they're touching at
the<00:03:02.230> center<00:03:02.739> line<00:03:03.400> that<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.760> drew<00:03:03.970> before<00:03:04.120> and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
the center line that you drew before and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.890 
the center line that you drew before and
I'm<00:03:06.040> just<00:03:06.220> out<00:03:06.400> running<00:03:06.580> those<00:03:06.910> of<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.209> so

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
I'm just out running those of it so

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.770 
I'm just out running those of it so
they're<00:03:08.110> pretty<00:03:08.590> much<00:03:08.650> conjoined<00:03:09.310> eyes<00:03:09.780> then

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
they're pretty much conjoined eyes then

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.470 
they're pretty much conjoined eyes then
you<00:03:10.840> could<00:03:10.989> draw<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.140> eyelids<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
you could draw the eyelids and the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.050 
you could draw the eyelids and the
eyelashes<00:03:14.290> hunter<00:03:14.890> on<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.160> side<00:03:15.400> of<00:03:15.430> her<00:03:15.910> eyes

other<00:03:51.040> Smurfs<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.610> started<00:03:52.030> so<00:03:52.420> you<00:03:52.480> can<00:03:52.570> start

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
other Smurfs I started so you can start

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.720 
other Smurfs I started so you can start
by<00:03:52.870> drawing<00:03:53.049> her<00:03:53.260> first<00:03:53.530> finger<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:54.489> then<00:03:54.579> you

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
by drawing her first finger and then you

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.520 
by drawing her first finger and then you
could<00:03:54.880> continue<00:03:55.329> down<00:03:55.540> into<00:03:55.900> her<00:03:56.019> thumb<00:03:56.320> which

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
could continue down into her thumb which

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.800 
could continue down into her thumb which
is<00:03:56.680> kind<00:03:56.950> of<00:03:57.040> at<00:03:57.130> an<00:03:57.250> odd<00:03:57.459> angle<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.239> draw<00:03:58.750> the

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
is kind of at an odd angle and draw the

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.840 
is kind of at an odd angle and draw the
rest<00:03:59.110> of<00:03:59.290> her<00:03:59.410> knuckles<00:03:59.860> like<00:04:00.280> her<00:04:00.430> knuckles

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
rest of her knuckles like her knuckles

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.850 
rest of her knuckles like her knuckles
then<00:04:01.810> we're<00:04:01.930> going<00:04:02.019> to<00:04:02.079> start<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.380> dress<00:04:02.650> you

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
then we're going to start the dress you

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.580 
then we're going to start the dress you
could<00:04:03.040> start<00:04:03.310> by<00:04:03.370> drawing<00:04:03.640> just<00:04:03.820> a<00:04:04.239> little<00:04:04.900> bit

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
could start by drawing just a little bit

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.520 
could start by drawing just a little bit
of<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.769> curved<00:04:06.130> line<00:04:06.310> for<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.360> front<00:04:07.630> and<00:04:07.900> you

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
of a curved line for the front and you

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.910 
of a curved line for the front and you
could<00:04:08.680> draw<00:04:08.860> the<00:04:08.920> neckline<00:04:09.549> and<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.920> line

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
could draw the neckline and the line

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.229 
could draw the neckline and the line
where<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.190> arm<00:04:12.519> is<00:04:13.109> and<00:04:14.519> then<00:04:15.519> I<00:04:15.549> started

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
where the arm is and then I started

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.610 
where the arm is and then I started
drawing<00:04:16.479> her<00:04:16.750> other<00:04:16.900> arm<00:04:17.049> by<00:04:17.229> drawing<00:04:17.500> her

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
drawing her other arm by drawing her

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.729 
drawing her other arm by drawing her
shoulder<00:04:18.190> there<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:19.019> her<00:04:20.019> other<00:04:20.169> hand<00:04:20.500> you

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
shoulder there and her other hand you

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.290 
shoulder there and her other hand you
can<00:04:20.919> kind<00:04:21.220> of<00:04:21.310> see<00:04:21.370> a<00:04:21.549> little<00:04:21.880> bit<00:04:22.030> of<00:04:22.090> the

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
can kind of see a little bit of the

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.719 
can kind of see a little bit of the
thumb<00:04:22.570> but<00:04:22.750> it's<00:04:23.349> just<00:04:23.620> a<00:04:23.800> partial<00:04:24.310> bit

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
thumb but it's just a partial bit

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.379 
thumb but it's just a partial bit
because<00:04:25.360> her<00:04:25.750> hand<00:04:25.990> is

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
because her hand is

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.239 
because her hand is
an<00:04:26.449> odd<00:04:26.569> angle<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:27.680> then<00:04:27.800> you<00:04:27.919> could<00:04:28.069> draw<00:04:28.189> the

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:28.249 
an odd angle and then you could draw the

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:30.999 
an odd angle and then you could draw the
other<00:04:28.939> three<00:04:29.360> fingers<00:04:29.800> just<00:04:30.800> like<00:04:30.949> that

other three fingers just like that

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.969 
other three fingers just like that
because<00:04:31.879> rounded<00:04:33.969> and<00:04:35.620> you<00:04:36.620> could<00:04:36.800> draw<00:04:36.919> the

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
because rounded and you could draw the

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.619 
because rounded and you could draw the
bottom<00:04:37.370> of<00:04:37.520> your<00:04:37.580> dress<00:04:37.939> which<00:04:38.150> is<00:04:38.300> just<00:04:38.419> like

00:04:43.239 --> 00:04:43.249 
all curvy like that and there's three

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:50.439 
all curvy like that and there's three
little<00:04:44.210> circles<00:04:44.870> as<00:04:45.289> a<00:04:45.740> little<00:04:46.039> design<00:04:49.449> then

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
little circles as a little design then

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.399 
little circles as a little design then
you<00:04:50.629> can<00:04:52.150> curve<00:04:53.150> your<00:04:53.389> legs<00:04:53.629> a<00:04:53.779> bit<00:04:53.900> more<00:04:54.080> and

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 
you can curve your legs a bit more and

continue that into the rest of that
which<00:05:53.360> it<00:05:53.930> goes<00:05:54.580> over<00:05:55.580> it<00:05:55.879> an<00:05:56.180> angle<00:05:56.599> where<00:05:56.750> the

00:05:57.119 --> 00:05:57.129 
which it goes over it an angle where the

and<00:06:13.140> yeah<00:06:14.400> continue<00:06:15.400> it<00:06:15.930> and<00:06:17.310> i<00:06:18.310> finished<00:06:18.580> the

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090

now<00:06:38.970> this<00:06:39.180> step<00:06:39.449> is<00:06:39.900> optional<00:06:40.410> as<00:06:41.310> always<00:06:41.699> in

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
now this step is optional as always in

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.240 
now this step is optional as always in
my<00:06:41.940> video<00:06:42.210> where<00:06:42.479> I<00:06:42.750> erased<00:06:43.530> over<00:06:43.830> all<00:06:44.100> the

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250 
my video where I erased over all the

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.240 
my video where I erased over all the
lines<00:06:44.490> and<00:06:45.139> go<00:06:46.139> over<00:06:46.290> them<00:06:46.530> with<00:06:46.650> a<00:06:46.710> darker

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
lines and go over them with a darker

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:56.110 
lines and go over them with a darker
pencil<00:06:48.410> such<00:06:49.410> as<00:06:49.740> a<00:06:53.240> yeah<00:06:54.240> aight<00:06:54.780> aight<00:06:55.500> beer

pencil such as a yeah aight aight beer
7b<00:06:57.120> i<00:06:57.389> think<00:06:57.930> and<00:06:59.300> go<00:07:00.300> over<00:07:00.360> the<00:07:00.510> lines<00:07:00.750> to<00:07:01.020> make

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
7b i think and go over the lines to make

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.659 
7b i think and go over the lines to make
them<00:07:01.290> darker<00:07:01.500> in<00:07:01.860> this<00:07:01.979> case<00:07:02.220> i'm<00:07:02.430> not

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:02.669 
them darker in this case i'm not

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:04.969 
them darker in this case i'm not
actually<00:07:02.940> using<00:07:03.270> a<00:07:03.570> graphite<00:07:03.990> pencil<00:07:04.500> that

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 
actually using a graphite pencil that

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:07.810 
actually using a graphite pencil that
i'm<00:07:05.100> using<00:07:05.130> an<00:07:05.729> extra<00:07:06.090> block<00:07:06.270> layout<00:07:06.630> pencil

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:07.820 
i'm using an extra block layout pencil

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.070 
i'm using an extra block layout pencil
which<00:07:08.820> i<00:07:09.300> don't<00:07:09.479> think<00:07:09.750> it's<00:07:09.870> really

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
which i don't think it's really

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.540 
which i don't think it's really
different<00:07:10.290> than<00:07:10.560> I<00:07:10.650> graphite<00:07:11.039> pencil<00:07:11.370> just

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.550 
different than I graphite pencil just

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.730 
different than I graphite pencil just
darker<00:07:12.240> so<00:07:13.050> you<00:07:13.139> don't<00:07:13.320> have<00:07:13.380> to<00:07:13.500> get<00:07:13.590> like

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 
darker so you don't have to get like

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.790 
darker so you don't have to get like
eight<00:07:14.010> be<00:07:14.340> and<00:07:14.669> 7b<00:07:15.120> and<00:07:16.110> all<00:07:16.289> those<00:07:16.470> sorts<00:07:16.770> of

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
eight be and 7b and all those sorts of

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.740
