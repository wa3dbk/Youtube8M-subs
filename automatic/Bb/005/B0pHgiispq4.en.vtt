 jean's participation can be done with a 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.170
 great surprise even if and maybe 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.020
 distant cultures because they live in 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.730
 desert but arrive in a place where the 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.400
 their culture is already known e 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:50.330
 because there is this great glue that the 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.330
 live wife music pillowcase 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.150
 he lives years but mail comes from gades 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.000
 that to the north and says that one lives there 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.920
 just the old and therefore the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.880
 traditions are are very living 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.880
 because they are in the news 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.349
 from sicily to salento for pizzica 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.980
 Ricapito cloth are thousands of 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:23.890
 territory well surely yes because 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.040
 we are cousins we are made by the same 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.209
 musical rib even if we come 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.250
 from within Sicily where this 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:38.130
 singing this is this dance is a bit 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.320
 very little but certainly practiced 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.100
 something that comes very close to us 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.020
 in the language in the dialect and in the thyme 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.990
 human sphere that we breathe in these 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.840
 days here together for one arrived 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.740
 beautiful language and indeed I take advantage 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.130
 an opportunity to say that it would be necessary 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.120
 make any take on any 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.500
 commitment to save this language 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.320
 we must have the same attention for 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.370
 languages ​​as we have for them 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:14.250
 cathedrals that fall and collapse it 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.200
 same value represents the language 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.710
 then 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.510
 ours our contribution also goes 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:28.820
 in this common sense 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.820
 an act of commitment to raise awareness 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.879
 or not 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.710
 so 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.509
 no
