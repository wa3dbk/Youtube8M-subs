00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.490 
one but this is really one of the
biggest<00:00:35.460> battery<00:00:35.880> draining<00:00:36.390> features<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:37.320> the

comfortable level now for me this is

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.830 
comfortable level now for me this is
about<00:00:43.980> half<00:00:44.309> way<00:00:44.610> depending<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.510> what<00:00:45.629> light

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840

now<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.799> next<00:01:34.860> one<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.369> quit<00:01:35.640> apps<00:01:35.880> that

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
now the next one is to quit apps that

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.999 
now the next one is to quit apps that
are<00:01:36.509> not<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.869> use<00:01:37.049> it's<00:01:37.229> an<00:01:37.290> obvious<00:01:37.470> one<00:01:37.740> again

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
are not in use it's an obvious one again

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.950 
are not in use it's an obvious one again
but<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> trick<00:01:38.880> for<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.210> if<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.780> go<00:01:39.900> to

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
but I have a trick for it if you go to

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.100 
but I have a trick for it if you go to
activity<00:01:40.530> monitor<00:01:40.920> right<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.110> actually

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
activity monitor right here and actually

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.590 
activity monitor right here and actually
bring<00:01:43.439> up<00:01:43.619> all<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.610> processes<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.479> are

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
bring up all the processes that are

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.480 
bring up all the processes that are
being<00:01:45.750> run<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.140> your<00:01:46.259> computer<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.890> if<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.280> go

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
being run on your computer and if you go

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.670 
being run on your computer and if you go
if<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.850> click<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.149> button<00:01:48.360> here<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:49.409> will

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
if you click this button here this will

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.609 
if you click this button here this will
organize<00:01:50.520> them<00:01:50.759> or<00:01:50.880> sort<00:01:51.180> them<00:01:51.360> by<00:01:51.659> whichever

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
organize them or sort them by whichever

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.370 
organize them or sort them by whichever
application<00:01:52.799> or<00:01:53.520> task<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.299> takes<00:01:54.960> up<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.140> most

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
application or task is takes up the most

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.980 
application or task is takes up the most
space<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.969> can<00:01:57.090> here<00:01:57.210> see<00:01:57.689> here<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
space so you can here see here the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.130 
space so you can here see here the
ScreenFlow<00:01:58.380> recorders<00:01:59.100> taking<00:01:59.430> up<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.579> ton<00:02:00.140> and

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
ScreenFlow recorders taking up a ton and

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.020 
ScreenFlow recorders taking up a ton and
that's<00:02:02.070> just<00:02:02.310> what<00:02:02.430> I'm<00:02:02.520> using<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.790> record

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
that's just what I'm using to record

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.639 
that's just what I'm using to record
this<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.450> obviously<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:04.049> quit<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.469> ones

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
this so obviously just quit the ones

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.230 
this so obviously just quit the ones
that<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:04.920> see<00:02:05.189> are<00:02:05.460> they<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:05.700> iTunes<00:02:06.090> you

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
that you see are they like iTunes you

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.210 
that you see are they like iTunes you
can<00:02:06.360> see<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.540> taking<00:02:06.810> quite<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.079> bit<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.979> really

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
can see is taking quite a bit so really

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.160 
can see is taking quite a bit so really
just<00:02:08.250> quit<00:02:08.580> applications<00:02:09.270> or<00:02:09.539> anything<00:02:10.080> that

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
just quit applications or anything that

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.570 
just quit applications or anything that
doesn't<00:02:10.289> have<00:02:10.379> an<00:02:10.530> application<00:02:10.920> simple<00:02:11.340> next

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
doesn't have an application simple next

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.470 
doesn't have an application simple next
to<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.730> or<00:02:11.940> something<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.510> don't<00:02:12.569> recognize

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
don't just automatically quit it because

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.430 
don't just automatically quit it because
it<00:02:15.130> could<00:02:15.280> be<00:02:15.330> something<00:02:16.330> specific<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.319> your

keep<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.280> battery<00:03:06.549> running<00:03:06.760> longer<00:03:07.620> now<00:03:08.620> the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
keep the battery running longer now the

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.640 
keep the battery running longer now the
next<00:03:08.950> one<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.370> backlit<00:03:09.819> keyboard<00:03:10.060> now<00:03:11.019> to

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
next one is the backlit keyboard now to

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.979 
next one is the backlit keyboard now to
I<00:03:12.459> think<00:03:12.910> it's<00:03:13.150> I<00:03:13.299> believe<00:03:13.480> these<00:03:13.540> two<00:03:13.750> keys

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
I think it's I believe these two keys

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.780 
I think it's I believe these two keys
next<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.590> brightness<00:03:15.040> button<00:03:15.280> the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
next to the brightness button the

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.270 
next to the brightness button the
brightness<00:03:16.180> keys<00:03:16.390> there's<00:03:17.019> a<00:03:17.500> little<00:03:18.010> keys

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
brightness keys there's a little keys

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.640 
brightness keys there's a little keys
that<00:03:18.489> look<00:03:18.670> like<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:19.209> image<00:03:19.390> of<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.570> Sun<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.560> if

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
that look like the image of a Sun and if

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.990 
that look like the image of a Sun and if
you<00:03:20.739> click<00:03:20.859> on<00:03:20.980> this<00:03:21.160> you'll<00:03:21.459> see<00:03:21.670> this<00:03:21.790> goes

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
you click on this you'll see this goes

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.780 
you click on this you'll see this goes
up<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.359> down<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.780> what<00:03:23.440> this<00:03:23.620> is<00:03:23.769> is<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.160> the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
up and down and what this is is the the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.520 
up and down and what this is is the the
light<00:03:25.120> that<00:03:25.329> comes<00:03:25.570> from<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.959> bottom<00:03:26.320> of

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
light that comes from the bottom of

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.890 
light that comes from the bottom of
underneath<00:03:27.190> your<00:03:27.489> keys<00:03:27.940> like<00:03:28.600> when<00:03:28.780> it's

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
underneath your keys like when it's

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.449 
underneath your keys like when it's
really<00:03:29.019> dark<00:03:29.109> bad<00:03:29.440> can't<00:03:30.130> really<00:03:30.220> see<00:03:30.370> the

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
really dark bad can't really see the

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.699 
really dark bad can't really see the
keys<00:03:30.670> this<00:03:31.030> is<00:03:31.090> what<00:03:31.390> controls<00:03:31.840> how<00:03:32.260> bright<00:03:32.590> it

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
keys this is what controls how bright it

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.590 
keys this is what controls how bright it
gets<00:03:32.859> underneath<00:03:33.190> them<00:03:33.489> it<00:03:33.880> eliminates<00:03:34.420> them

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
gets underneath them it eliminates them

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.360 
gets underneath them it eliminates them
basically<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:34.989> you<00:03:35.079> can<00:03:35.200> see<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:35.620> really

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
basically so you can see and you really

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.430 
basically so you can see and you really
want<00:03:36.549> this<00:03:36.670> at<00:03:36.820> 1<00:03:37.060> or<00:03:37.180> 2<00:03:37.359> depending<00:03:38.049> on<00:03:38.320> what

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
want this at 1 or 2 depending on what

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.410 
want this at 1 or 2 depending on what
again<00:03:38.709> what<00:03:38.859> brightness<00:03:39.160> situation<00:03:39.640> you<00:03:40.299> can

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
again what brightness situation you can

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.849 
again what brightness situation you can
have<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:40.600> up<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.780> there<00:03:40.930> but<00:03:41.230> this<00:03:41.470> is<00:03:41.530> another

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
have it up to there but this is another

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:42.990 
have it up to there but this is another
big<00:03:42.130> battery<00:03:42.579> drainer

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
big battery drainer

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.630 
big battery drainer
especially<00:03:43.570> if<00:03:43.900> it's<00:03:44.079> kind<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.320> later<00:03:44.530> and<00:03:44.769> its

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
especially if it's kind of later and its

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.039 
especially if it's kind of later and its
really<00:03:45.820> bright<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.390> can<00:03:46.540> turn<00:03:46.720> this<00:03:46.840> down

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
really bright you can turn this down

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.650 
really bright you can turn this down
optionally<00:03:47.799> manually<00:03:48.250> there<00:03:48.489> it<00:03:49.420> will<00:03:49.540> do

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
optionally manually there it will do

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.699 
optionally manually there it will do
automatically<00:03:50.079> but<00:03:50.260> it's<00:03:50.380> not<00:03:50.470> really<00:03:50.650> that

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
automatically but it's not really that

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.020 
automatically but it's not really that
great<00:03:50.859> and<00:03:51.190> ends<00:03:51.370> up<00:03:51.489> taking<00:03:51.640> up<00:03:51.820> a<00:03:51.880> lot<00:03:52.000> of

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
great and ends up taking up a lot of

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.990 
great and ends up taking up a lot of
your<00:03:52.150> battery<00:03:52.560> so<00:03:53.560> once<00:03:53.709> again<00:03:53.799> doing<00:03:54.640> that<00:03:54.820> as

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
that's called energy saver or sorry not

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.699 
that's called energy saver or sorry not

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
brightness now speaking of energy saver

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.670 
brightness now speaking of energy saver
now<00:04:08.079> here<00:04:08.319> we<00:04:08.410> go

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
now here we go

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
basically this is when the computer goes

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.850 
basically this is when the computer goes
to<00:04:22.599> sleep<00:04:22.720> and<00:04:22.960> when<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.169> display<00:04:23.560> goes<00:04:23.590> to

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
to sleep and when the display goes to

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.860 
to sleep and when the display goes to
sleep<00:04:24.010> now<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.640> display<00:04:25.060> you<00:04:25.120> can<00:04:25.330> go<00:04:25.810> to

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
sleep now the display you can go to

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.970 
sleep now the display you can go to
sleep<00:04:26.169> really<00:04:26.650> with

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
sleep really with

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.740 
sleep really with
in<00:04:27.040> five<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.910> ten<00:04:28.090> minutes<00:04:28.360> it's<00:04:28.540> pretty

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
in five to ten minutes it's pretty

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.050 
in five to ten minutes it's pretty
certainly<00:04:29.320> that<00:04:29.470> big<00:04:29.620> a<00:04:29.650> deal<00:04:29.800> but<00:04:30.040> that<00:04:30.910> will

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
certainly that big a deal but that will

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.940 
certainly that big a deal but that will
save<00:04:31.330> some<00:04:31.480> batteries<00:04:31.780> well<00:04:31.990> and<00:04:32.860> the

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
save some batteries well and the

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.290 
save some batteries well and the
computer<00:04:33.340> sleeps<00:04:33.550> a<00:04:33.670> lot<00:04:33.700> bigger<00:04:34.060> deal

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
computer sleeps a lot bigger deal

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.030 
computer sleeps a lot bigger deal
because<00:04:34.690> when<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.380> computer<00:04:35.680> goes<00:04:35.830> to<00:04:35.920> sleep

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
because when the computer goes to sleep

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.890 
because when the computer goes to sleep
it<00:04:36.250> basically<00:04:36.460> turns<00:04:36.880> off<00:04:37.180> everything

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
it basically turns off everything

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
computer sleep and you definitely want

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.680 
computer sleep and you definitely want
that<00:04:51.340> a<00:04:51.370> little<00:04:51.730> bit<00:04:51.820> a<00:04:52.030> little<00:04:52.360> bit<00:04:52.450> later

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
that a little bit a little bit later

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.790 
that a little bit a little bit later
just<00:04:52.810> so<00:04:53.050> that<00:04:53.140> you<00:04:53.230> don't<00:04:53.410> lose<00:04:53.560> all<00:04:53.710> your

just so that you don't lose all your
stuff<00:04:54.160> but<00:04:54.820> definitely<00:04:54.940> keep<00:04:55.180> it<00:04:55.450> below<00:04:55.660> 15

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
stuff but definitely keep it below 15

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.840 
stuff but definitely keep it below 15
minutes<00:04:56.620> especially<00:04:56.980> just<00:04:57.520> when<00:04:57.670> you're<00:04:57.790> on

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
minutes especially just when you're on

computer's<00:05:00.250> battery<00:05:00.520> a<00:05:00.550> lot<00:05:00.820> if<00:05:01.000> you<00:05:01.090> have

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
computer's battery a lot if you have

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.420 
computer's battery a lot if you have
this<00:05:01.450> set<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.720> like<00:05:01.930> an<00:05:02.020> hour<00:05:02.230> it'll<00:05:03.040> sit<00:05:03.280> there

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
this set to like an hour it'll sit there

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.740 
this set to like an hour it'll sit there
draining<00:05:03.790> your<00:05:03.880> battery<00:05:04.000> for<00:05:04.300> an<00:05:04.360> hours

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
draining your battery for an hours

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.300 
draining your battery for an hours
supposed<00:05:05.290> to<00:05:05.410> just<00:05:05.560> sitting<00:05:05.770> there<00:05:05.800> for<00:05:06.040> 15

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
supposed to just sitting there for 15

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.800 
supposed to just sitting there for 15
minutes<00:05:06.640> and<00:05:06.790> then<00:05:06.850> shutting<00:05:07.240> down<00:05:07.390> when<00:05:07.720> it

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
minutes and then shutting down when it

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.030 
minutes and then shutting down when it
realizes<00:05:08.080> that<00:05:08.260> you're<00:05:08.500> not<00:05:08.680> going<00:05:08.890> to<00:05:08.950> be

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
realizes that you're not going to be

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.190 
realizes that you're not going to be
using<00:05:09.250> it<00:05:09.340> again<00:05:09.660> however<00:05:10.660> would<00:05:10.900> power

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
using it again however would power

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.200 
using it again however would power
adapter<00:05:11.620> you<00:05:11.710> can<00:05:11.770> have<00:05:12.010> the<00:05:12.250> these<00:05:12.760> options<00:05:13.150> a

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
adapter you can have the these options a

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.730 
adapter you can have the these options a
lot<00:05:13.360> higher<00:05:13.600> because<00:05:14.260> when<00:05:14.410> you're<00:05:14.500> plugged

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
lot higher because when you're plugged

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.460 
lot higher because when you're plugged
in<00:05:15.300> you're<00:05:16.300> obviously<00:05:16.480> charging<00:05:17.020> computers

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
in you're obviously charging computers

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.570 
in you're obviously charging computers
so<00:05:17.650> you<00:05:17.710> don't<00:05:17.920> really<00:05:18.070> need<00:05:18.190> to<00:05:18.280> worry<00:05:18.370> about

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
so you don't really need to worry about

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.470 
so you don't really need to worry about
that<00:05:18.730> so<00:05:18.850> you<00:05:18.910> can<00:05:19.030> have<00:05:19.120> them<00:05:19.210> a<00:05:19.240> little<00:05:19.390> bit

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
that so you can have them a little bit

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.180 
that so you can have them a little bit
longer<00:05:19.720> like<00:05:20.410> if<00:05:20.590> you're<00:05:20.680> doing<00:05:20.770> some<00:05:21.040> big

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
longer like if you're doing some big

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.280 
longer like if you're doing some big
update<00:05:21.610> to<00:05:21.760> iTunes<00:05:22.210> or<00:05:22.510> your<00:05:22.690> computer<00:05:23.050> the

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
update to iTunes or your computer the

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.600 
update to iTunes or your computer the
software<00:05:23.710> system<00:05:23.950> anything<00:05:24.370> like<00:05:24.580> that

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
software system anything like that

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.120 
software system anything like that
definitely<00:05:25.480> have<00:05:25.810> it<00:05:26.020> plugged<00:05:26.830> into<00:05:26.950> a<00:05:27.070> power

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
definitely have it plugged into a power

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.000 
definitely have it plugged into a power
adapter<00:05:27.990> again<00:05:28.990> you<00:05:29.320> can<00:05:29.530> choose<00:05:29.770> some

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
adapter again you can choose some

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.260 
adapter again you can choose some
options<00:05:30.460> down<00:05:30.490> here<00:05:30.790> that<00:05:30.970> will<00:05:31.090> help

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
options down here that will help

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.940 
options down here that will help
automatically<00:05:31.870> reduce<00:05:32.140> brightness<00:05:32.530> before

is<00:06:04.870> obviously<00:06:05.230> a<00:06:05.290> big<00:06:05.500> one<00:06:05.650> too<00:06:05.800> bluetooth<00:06:06.370> is

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
is obviously a big one too bluetooth is

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.360 
is obviously a big one too bluetooth is
a<00:06:06.610> huge<00:06:07.090> battery<00:06:07.870> waster<00:06:08.440> definitely<00:06:09.250> turn

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
a huge battery waster definitely turn

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:10.470 
a huge battery waster definitely turn
that<00:06:09.490> off<00:06:09.640> when<00:06:09.790> you're<00:06:09.880> not<00:06:09.940> using<00:06:10.030> it<00:06:10.360> if

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
that off when you're not using it if

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
that off when you're not using it if
you're<00:06:10.570> not<00:06:10.690> using<00:06:10.840> a<00:06:10.990> wireless<00:06:11.320> mouse

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
you're not using a wireless mouse

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.990 
you're not using a wireless mouse
anything<00:06:11.980> like<00:06:12.070> that<00:06:12.100> definitely<00:06:12.760> turn<00:06:12.880> that

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
anything like that definitely turn that

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.480 
anything like that definitely turn that
off<00:06:13.180> however<00:06:14.020> if<00:06:14.110> you<00:06:14.260> are<00:06:14.290> using<00:06:14.680> a<00:06:14.830> wireless

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
off however if you are using a wireless

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.220 
off however if you are using a wireless
mouse<00:06:15.610> to<00:06:15.820> fling<00:06:16.000> or<00:06:16.210> a<00:06:16.270> keyboard<00:06:16.510> for<00:06:16.900> that<00:06:17.020> in

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.230 
mouse to fling or a keyboard for that in

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.500 
mouse to fling or a keyboard for that in
that<00:06:17.530> case<00:06:17.740> make<00:06:18.640> sure<00:06:18.760> it's<00:06:18.880> on<00:06:18.970> because<00:06:19.180> that

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
that case make sure it's on because that

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.090 
that case make sure it's on because that
is<00:06:19.630> what<00:06:19.810> it<00:06:20.020> uses<00:06:20.350> to<00:06:20.650> connect<00:06:20.890> to<00:06:20.950> those

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
is what it uses to connect to those

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.000 
is what it uses to connect to those
devices<00:06:21.870> but<00:06:22.870> bluetooth<00:06:23.230> is<00:06:23.380> another<00:06:23.650> huge

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
devices but bluetooth is another huge

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.580 
devices but bluetooth is another huge
waster<00:06:24.460> of<00:06:24.490> that<00:06:24.760> now<00:06:25.750> this<00:06:25.900> next<00:06:26.110> one<00:06:26.230> your

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
waster of that now this next one your

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.690 
waster of that now this next one your
guys<00:06:26.770> are<00:06:26.890> going<00:06:27.010> to<00:06:27.070> find<00:06:27.250> a<00:06:27.370> little<00:06:27.580> bit

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
guys are going to find a little bit

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.550 
guys are going to find a little bit
interesting<00:06:27.940> I'm<00:06:28.690> not<00:06:28.990> really<00:06:29.260> sure<00:06:29.530> a

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
interesting I'm not really sure a

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.720 
interesting I'm not really sure a
hundred<00:06:29.890> percent<00:06:29.980> I<00:06:30.310> can't<00:06:30.520> say<00:06:30.610> a<00:06:30.640> hundred

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730 
hundred percent I can't say a hundred

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.130 
hundred percent I can't say a hundred
percent<00:06:30.910> to<00:06:31.090> save<00:06:31.240> battery<00:06:31.420> life<00:06:31.660> but<00:06:31.810> a<00:06:31.870> lot

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
percent to save battery life but a lot

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.050 
percent to save battery life but a lot
of<00:06:32.230> people<00:06:32.500> have<00:06:32.590> reported<00:06:32.710> that<00:06:33.670> it<00:06:33.820> does

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
of people have reported that it does

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.940 
of people have reported that it does
extend<00:06:34.570> battery<00:06:34.690> life<00:06:34.870> and<00:06:35.170> that<00:06:35.350> is<00:06:35.440> inverted

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 
extend battery life and that is inverted

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.190 
extend battery life and that is inverted
colors<00:06:36.370> I'm<00:06:36.760> you<00:06:37.240> can<00:06:37.360> see<00:06:37.570> here<00:06:37.810> this<00:06:37.930> is<00:06:37.990> what

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.200 
colors I'm you can see here this is what

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.900 
colors I'm you can see here this is what
inverted<00:06:38.500> colors<00:06:38.740> looks<00:06:38.950> like<00:06:39.130> you<00:06:39.580> can<00:06:39.760> do

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
inverted colors looks like you can do

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.070 
inverted colors looks like you can do
this<00:06:40.120> by<00:06:40.360> holding

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
this by holding

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.040 
this by holding
trol<00:06:41.520> option<00:06:42.520> command<00:06:43.120> and<00:06:43.419> then<00:06:43.569> the<00:06:43.720> number

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
trol option command and then the number

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.290 
trol option command and then the number
8<00:06:44.289> on<00:06:44.560> your<00:06:44.620> keyboard<00:06:44.949> if<00:06:45.580> you<00:06:45.669> hold<00:06:45.879> all<00:06:46.150> those

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
8 on your keyboard if you hold all those

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.969 
8 on your keyboard if you hold all those
at<00:06:46.449> the<00:06:46.479> same<00:06:46.539> time<00:06:46.870> it'll<00:06:47.139> invert<00:06:47.560> the<00:06:47.680> colors

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:47.979 
at the same time it'll invert the colors

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:49.350 
at the same time it'll invert the colors
a<00:06:48.159> lot<00:06:48.280> of<00:06:48.340> you<00:06:48.400> guys<00:06:48.460> probably<00:06:48.610> knew<00:06:49.030> that<00:06:49.180> but

a lot of you guys probably knew that but

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.559 
a lot of you guys probably knew that but
I'll<00:06:49.479> go<00:06:49.599> over<00:06:49.870> it<00:06:50.199> anyway<00:06:50.379> and<00:06:50.849> a<00:06:51.849> lot<00:06:52.539> of

I'll go over it anyway and a lot of

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:55.140 
I'll go over it anyway and a lot of
users<00:06:52.930> just<00:06:53.800> tons<00:06:54.069> of<00:06:54.280> people<00:06:54.400> actually<00:06:54.639> have

users just tons of people actually have
been<00:06:55.300> saying<00:06:55.569> this<00:06:55.840> will<00:06:56.050> actually<00:06:56.169> extend

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590 
been saying this will actually extend

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.260 
been saying this will actually extend
the<00:06:56.650> battery<00:06:56.800> life<00:06:56.979> so<00:06:57.250> if<00:06:57.340> you're<00:06:57.490> obviously

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270 
the battery life so if you're obviously

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.209 
the battery life so if you're obviously
this<00:06:58.569> is<00:06:58.689> kind<00:06:58.900> of<00:06:58.930> annoying<00:06:59.439> to<00:06:59.590> look<00:06:59.860> at<00:07:00.009> I

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:47.830 
like that that you're using at that

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.430 
like that that you're using at that
moment<00:07:48.279> and<00:07:48.449> when<00:07:49.449> you<00:07:49.539> go<00:07:49.690> to<00:07:49.750> private

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:50.440 
moment and when you go to private

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.899 
moment and when you go to private
browsing<00:07:50.800> it<00:07:51.009> doesn't<00:07:51.219> save<00:07:51.400> all<00:07:51.550> that<00:07:51.580> stuff

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:51.909 
browsing it doesn't save all that stuff

00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:53.670 
browsing it doesn't save all that stuff
so<00:07:52.300> it<00:07:52.330> puts<00:07:52.690> less<00:07:52.870> strain<00:07:53.199> on<00:07:53.259> your<00:07:53.500> battery

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 
so it puts less strain on your battery

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.200 
so it puts less strain on your battery
and<00:07:54.039> it<00:07:54.190> extends<00:07:54.550> the<00:07:54.580> battery<00:07:54.909> a<00:07:54.940> little<00:07:55.000> bit

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:55.210 
and it extends the battery a little bit

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.689 
and it extends the battery a little bit
longer<00:07:55.389> once<00:07:56.289> again<00:07:56.560> these<00:07:56.949> are<00:07:57.009> all<00:07:57.250> smaller

00:07:57.689 --> 00:07:57.699 
longer once again these are all smaller

00:07:57.699 --> 00:07:59.730 
longer once again these are all smaller
things<00:07:58.060> but<00:07:58.300> they<00:07:58.389> do<00:07:58.449> add<00:07:58.690> up<00:07:58.719> to<00:07:59.110> overall<00:07:59.650> a

00:07:59.730 --> 00:07:59.740 
things but they do add up to overall a

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.980

better<00:08:00.009> battery<00:08:00.370> experience<00:08:00.969> and<00:08:01.180> longer

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:01.990
