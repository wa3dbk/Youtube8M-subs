okay<00:00:12.799> this<00:00:13.009> is<00:00:13.250> al<00:00:13.519> Barry's<00:00:13.999> Hasbrouck<00:00:14.629> v2

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
okay this is al Barry's Hasbrouck v2

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.769 
okay this is al Barry's Hasbrouck v2
simple<00:00:15.589> with<00:00:16.250> double<00:00:16.640> Stephenson<00:00:17.300> links<00:00:17.630> in

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
simple with double Stephenson links in

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.100 
simple with double Stephenson links in
it<00:00:17.930> and<00:00:18.109> they<00:00:18.710> shifting<00:00:19.400> mechanism<00:00:19.609> up<00:00:20.539> on<00:00:20.810> top

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
it and they shifting mechanism up on top

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.720 
it and they shifting mechanism up on top
that<00:00:23.289> goes<00:00:24.289> from<00:00:24.710> one<00:00:24.919> direction<00:00:25.070> to<00:00:25.699> the

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
that goes from one direction to the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.119 
that goes from one direction to the
other<00:00:25.910> and<00:00:26.750> let's<00:00:27.259> start<00:00:27.560> it<00:00:27.710> running<00:00:27.859> on

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:28.129 
other and let's start it running on

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:39.630 
other and let's start it running on
compressed<00:00:28.550> air<00:00:29.079> and<00:00:30.079> we'll<00:00:30.290> start<00:00:30.559> it<00:00:30.680> slowly

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.330 

rolling<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:40.730> reversing<00:00:41.210> mechanism<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:43.190> you

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
rolling the reversing mechanism and you

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.250 
rolling the reversing mechanism and you
can<00:00:43.579> see<00:00:43.760> it<00:00:43.879> reverses<00:00:44.420> very<00:00:44.630> well

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
can see it reverses very well

00:00:45.260 --> 00:01:01.389 
can see it reverses very well
let's<00:00:45.590> go<00:00:45.770> back<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:59.780> you<00:00:59.899> can<00:01:00.050> see<00:01:00.130> this<00:01:01.130> one

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
let's go back and you can see this one

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.580 
let's go back and you can see this one
here<00:01:01.579> is<00:01:01.790> a<00:01:01.820> water<00:01:02.120> pump<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:03.110> it<00:01:03.230> has<00:01:03.380> an

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
here is a water pump so it has an

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:17.879 
here is a water pump so it has an
intrical<00:01:04.070> water<00:01:04.339> pump<00:01:04.780> -<00:01:05.780> such<00:01:06.049> a<00:01:06.079> diesel

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:17.889 

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:20.679 

right<00:01:18.889> there<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:19.340> then<00:01:19.909> turn<00:01:20.149> it<00:01:20.179> around<00:01:20.389> and

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
right there and then turn it around and

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:29.559 
right there and then turn it around and
get<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.929> other<00:01:21.079> side<00:01:28.029> okay<00:01:29.029> so<00:01:29.060> this<00:01:29.389> is<00:01:29.509> the

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
get the other side okay so this is the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.840 
get the other side okay so this is the
back<00:01:29.749> side<00:01:29.779> of<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.200> engine<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:31.219> can<00:01:31.399> see<00:01:31.639> the

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
back side of the engine you can see the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.840 
back side of the engine you can see the
there's<00:01:32.240> a<00:01:32.299> wiggler<00:01:32.869> up<00:01:33.049> here<00:01:33.340> going<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.429> to

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
there's a wiggler up here going to to

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.899 
there's a wiggler up here going to to
cross<00:01:35.119> slides<00:01:35.509> and<00:01:35.979> area<00:01:36.979> cylindrical<00:01:37.670> cross

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
cross slides and area cylindrical cross

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.559 
cross slides and area cylindrical cross
sides<00:01:38.209> and<00:01:39.729> we'll<00:01:40.729> run<00:01:40.939> it<00:01:41.060> now<00:01:41.240> in<00:01:41.450> this

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:41.569 
sides and we'll run it now in this

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.149 
sides and we'll run it now in this
position<00:01:44.560> typically<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.770> part<00:01:46.009> you're

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
position typically the part you're

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.160 
position typically the part you're
looking<00:01:46.189> at<00:01:46.609> now<00:01:46.789> faces<00:01:47.329> forward<00:01:47.599> if<00:01:47.840> it's<00:01:48.020> in

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
looking at now faces forward if it's in

00:01:48.170 --> 00:02:17.880 
looking at now faces forward if it's in
a<00:01:48.229> hole

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.790 

taken<00:02:18.890> by<00:02:19.099> reverse

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:34.590 

over<00:02:26.130> there

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.410 

but

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.790 

and<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.540> can<00:02:41.660> see<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:41.870> very<00:02:42.140> pretty<00:02:42.350> in<00:02:42.530> Gina's

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
and you can see it very pretty in Gina's

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.500 
and you can see it very pretty in Gina's
wall<00:02:45.280> should<00:02:46.280> run<00:02:46.460> a<00:02:46.490> nice<00:02:46.670> boat<00:02:46.940> up<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.180> about

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
wall should run a nice boat up to about

00:02:47.510 --> 00:03:00.040 
wall should run a nice boat up to about
20<00:02:47.870> feet<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:49.190> run<00:02:49.460> it<00:02:49.550> pretty<00:02:49.790> well

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050
