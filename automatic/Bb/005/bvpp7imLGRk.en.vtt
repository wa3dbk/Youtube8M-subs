easily actually there's a a rubber boot
on<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.160> front<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.609> connects<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.240> engine

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
on the front that connects to the engine

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.980 
on the front that connects to the engine
there's<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.289> rubber<00:00:29.119> boot<00:00:30.119> here<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.869> goes

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
there's a rubber boot here that goes

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.990 
there's a rubber boot here that goes
between<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.410> carb<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.219> airbox<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.910> this

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
between the carb and the airbox and this

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.639 
between the carb and the airbox and this
thing's<00:00:33.180> got<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> weird<00:00:33.600> shape<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.140> looks<00:00:34.410> like

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
thing's got a weird shape it looks like

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.130 
thing's got a weird shape it looks like
it's<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.920> big<00:00:35.070> puffy<00:00:35.910> ball<00:00:36.149> between<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.840> airbox

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
it's a big puffy ball between the airbox

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.920 
it's a big puffy ball between the airbox
and<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:38.070> actually<00:00:38.430> you've<00:00:38.579> got<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.930> shock

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
and it but actually you've got a shock

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.930 
and it but actually you've got a shock
that<00:00:40.620> goes<00:00:40.739> over<00:00:40.950> here<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.219> other<00:00:41.250> side<00:00:41.399> so

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
that goes over here on the other side so

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.970 
that goes over here on the other side so
really<00:00:42.200> you<00:00:43.200> end<00:00:43.350> up<00:00:43.440> having<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.770> little

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
really you end up having this little

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.830 
really you end up having this little
thing<00:00:44.129> that's<00:00:44.340> like<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.910> narrow<00:00:45.300> right<00:00:45.600> here

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
thing that's like this narrow right here

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.600 
thing that's like this narrow right here
and<00:00:45.989> then<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.200> expands<00:00:46.590> out<00:00:46.680> really<00:00:46.950> wide<00:00:47.280> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
and then it expands out really wide to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.430 
and then it expands out really wide to
go<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> airbox<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:49.140> you've<00:00:49.260> got<00:00:49.350> this

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
go to the airbox so you've got this

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.709 
go to the airbox so you've got this
massive<00:00:49.739> air<00:00:50.309> filter<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.239> tiny<00:00:51.510> little

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
massive air filter and this tiny little

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.360 
massive air filter and this tiny little
passageway<00:00:52.410> for<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.710> go<00:00:52.829> through<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.280> then

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
passageway for it to go through and then

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.580 
passageway for it to go through and then
it<00:00:53.460> chokes<00:00:53.969> up<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.480> only<00:00:54.600> about<00:00:54.899> yay<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.170> tall

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
it chokes up to only about yay so tall

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.619 
it chokes up to only about yay so tall
and<00:00:55.920> then<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.430> rounds<00:00:56.789> out<00:00:56.940> from<00:00:57.210> being<00:00:57.329> flat

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
and then it rounds out from being flat

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.340 
and then it rounds out from being flat
to<00:00:58.100> do<00:00:59.100> about<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> 40<00:00:59.760> 45<00:01:00.210> millimeter<00:01:00.690> hole<00:01:00.960> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
to do about a 40 45 millimeter hole that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.729 
to do about a 40 45 millimeter hole that
goes<00:01:01.879> connects<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> carb<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:04.559> all-in-all

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
goes connects on the carb so all-in-all

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.500 
goes connects on the carb so all-in-all
that's<00:01:05.129> kind<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.729> up<00:01:05.880> way<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.150> do<00:01:06.360> it

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
that's kind of a up way to do it

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.719 
that's kind of a up way to do it
I'm<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.780> sure<00:01:07.110> why<00:01:07.260> why<00:01:07.710> Suki<00:01:08.369> thought<00:01:08.549> that

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
I'm not sure why why Suki thought that

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.880 
I'm not sure why why Suki thought that
was<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.880> right<00:01:09.000> way<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.510> with<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.350> with

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
was the right way to do it with the with

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.170 
was the right way to do it with the with
the<00:01:10.950> way<00:01:11.040> they<00:01:11.220> did<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> shock<00:01:11.700> everything

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
the way they did the shock everything

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.030 
the way they did the shock everything
though<00:01:12.390> there's<00:01:12.600> there's<00:01:13.260> no<00:01:13.409> way<00:01:13.439> around<00:01:13.710> it

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
though there's there's no way around it

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.289 
though there's there's no way around it
that's<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.610> way<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:14.880> gotta<00:01:15.030> be

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
that's just the way it's gotta be

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.670 
that's just the way it's gotta be
it's<00:01:15.540> also<00:01:15.659> why<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.140> ever<00:01:16.290> take<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> look

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
it's also why if you ever take a look

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.770 
it's also why if you ever take a look
from<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> top<00:01:17.100> you'll<00:01:17.729> see<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.299> car

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
from the top you'll see that the car

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.539 
from the top you'll see that the car
braid<00:01:19.020> here's<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.350> engine<00:01:19.549> carburetor

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
braid here's the engine carburetor

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.010 
braid here's the engine carburetor
notice<00:01:20.820> how<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.000> mounts<00:01:21.299> at<00:01:21.390> an<00:01:21.509> angle

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
notice how that mounts at an angle

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.859 
notice how that mounts at an angle
towards<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.909> left-hand<00:01:23.909> edge<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> bike

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
towards the left-hand edge of the bike

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.520 
towards the left-hand edge of the bike
see<00:01:25.880> you<00:01:26.880> can<00:01:27.030> see<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.810> angled<00:01:28.290> away

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
see you can see that it's angled away

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.020 
see you can see that it's angled away
like<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.509> angled<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.579> that's<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.759> exact

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
like it's angled and that's the exact

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.050 
like it's angled and that's the exact
reason<00:01:33.329> why<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:34.049> my<00:01:34.650> tip<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.310> if<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.640> ever<00:01:35.790> have

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.950 
this on both rear and in the front you
can<00:01:44.820> try<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.060> leave<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.270> rear<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:45.720> I

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
can try and leave the rear one on I

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.179 
can try and leave the rear one on I
thought<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.290> was<00:01:46.380> easier<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.890> take<00:01:47.040> it

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
thought it was easier just to take it

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.190 
thought it was easier just to take it
off<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.490> pulled<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.000> out<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.420> put<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:49.049> in

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
off I pulled this out I put this one in

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.289 
off I pulled this out I put this one in
like<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.770> would<00:01:49.920> pull<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.280> out<00:01:50.460> then<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.240> took

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
like I would pull this out then I took

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.300 
like I would pull this out then I took
the<00:01:51.509> carb<00:01:51.720> off<00:01:51.869> backwards<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:52.979> could<00:01:53.189> get

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
the carb off backwards so I could get

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.969 
the carb off backwards so I could get
this<00:01:53.430> off<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> engine<00:01:54.439> putting<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.710> did

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
this off the engine putting it on I did

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.830 
this off the engine putting it on I did
the<00:01:56.070> same<00:01:56.219> way<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.790> know<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.210> put<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.659> car

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
the same way I you know I I put the car

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.179 
the same way I you know I I put the car
be<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.110> area<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.770> put<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> boot

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
be in the area and then I put the boot

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.850 
be in the area and then I put the boot
on<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.759> carb<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.180> there's<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.659> tab<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.680> that

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
on to the carb and there's a tab on that

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.219 
on to the carb and there's a tab on that
on<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> top<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.719> bottom<00:02:04.079> to

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
on the top of it and on the bottom to

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.810 
on the top of it and on the bottom to
make<00:02:04.290> sure<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:04.649> rotated<00:02:05.219> correctly<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
make sure it's rotated correctly on the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.819 
make sure it's rotated correctly on the
engine<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.270> carb<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.229> got<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.530> correct

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
engine in the carb so I got that correct

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.290 
engine in the carb so I got that correct
on<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.069> carb<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.429> tightened<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:08.970> then<00:02:09.209> I

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
on the carb I tightened it on then I

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.880 
on the carb I tightened it on then I
popped<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.690> carb<00:02:09.899> under<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.200> engine<00:02:10.500> got<00:02:10.739> it

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
popped the carb under the engine got it

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.800 
popped the carb under the engine got it
rotated<00:02:11.310> correctly<00:02:11.640> tighten<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.060> then<00:02:12.780> I

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
rotated correctly tighten it on then I

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.809 
rotated correctly tighten it on then I
shove<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.200> thing<00:02:13.260> in

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
shove this thing in

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.140 
shove this thing in
I<00:02:13.879> put<00:02:14.299> the<00:02:14.420> front<00:02:14.629> edge<00:02:14.840> in<00:02:15.549> and<00:02:16.549> I<00:02:16.609> shoved<00:02:16.999> it

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
I put the front edge in and I shoved it

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.420 
I put the front edge in and I shoved it
in<00:02:17.239> sideways<00:02:17.659> and<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:17.950> fiddled<00:02:18.950> with<00:02:19.069> it<00:02:19.129> for

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
in sideways and I fiddled with it for

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.860 
in sideways and I fiddled with it for
about<00:02:19.519> you<00:02:19.819> know<00:02:19.939> four<00:02:20.180> or<00:02:20.209> five<00:02:20.389> minutes<00:02:20.689> got

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
about you know four or five minutes got

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.420 
about you know four or five minutes got
it<00:02:20.959> all<00:02:21.079> situated<00:02:21.379> on<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.769> airbox<00:02:22.069> got

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
it all situated on the airbox got

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.920 
it all situated on the airbox got
situated<00:02:22.939> in<00:02:22.999> the<00:02:23.060> carb<00:02:23.299> made<00:02:23.599> sure<00:02:23.749> nothing

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
situated in the carb made sure nothing

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.309 
situated in the carb made sure nothing
was<00:02:24.200> bound<00:02:24.469> up<00:02:24.739> then<00:02:25.280> I<00:02:25.310> put<00:02:25.609> the<00:02:25.930> two<00:02:26.930> straps

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
was bound up then I put the two straps

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.809 
was bound up then I put the two straps
back<00:02:27.590> on<00:02:27.859> and<00:02:28.099> tighten<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.400> down

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
back on and tighten it down

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.849 
back on and tighten it down
overall<00:02:29.629> it's<00:02:29.900> actually<00:02:30.230> quite<00:02:30.409> easy<00:02:30.439> to<00:02:30.709> work

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:30.859 
overall it's actually quite easy to work

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.589 
overall it's actually quite easy to work
on<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.159> on<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.370> dizzer<00:02:31.700> if<00:02:32.000> you've<00:02:32.299> never<00:02:32.389> done

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
on it on a dizzer if you've never done

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.229 
on it on a dizzer if you've never done
it<00:02:32.659> this<00:02:32.840> is<00:02:33.109> a<00:02:33.139> continuous<00:02:34.069> velocity<00:02:34.519> CV<00:02:35.000> carb

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
it this is a continuous velocity CV carb

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.690 
it this is a continuous velocity CV carb
that<00:02:36.200> means<00:02:36.349> there's<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.620> diaphragm<00:02:37.310> here<00:02:37.639> in

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
that means there's a diaphragm here in

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.379 
that means there's a diaphragm here in
the<00:02:37.760> top<00:02:37.969> of<00:02:38.000> it

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:38.389 
the top of it

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.110 
the top of it
and<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:39.500> spring<00:02:39.859> that<00:02:40.189> holds<00:02:40.459> this<00:02:40.549> diaphragm

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
and a spring that holds this diaphragm

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.420 
and a spring that holds this diaphragm
down<00:02:41.150> think<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:41.959> like<00:02:42.049> a<00:02:42.109> balloon<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.889> as

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
down think of it like a balloon and as

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.059 
down think of it like a balloon and as
air<00:02:43.700> flows<00:02:44.090> in<00:02:44.359> from<00:02:44.419> the<00:02:44.900> airbox<00:02:45.260> based<00:02:45.889> on

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
air flows in from the airbox based on

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.270 
air flows in from the airbox based on
engine<00:02:46.430> vacuum<00:02:46.609> a<00:02:47.120> little<00:02:47.480> tiny<00:02:48.349> hole<00:02:48.709> pushes

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
engine vacuum a little tiny hole pushes

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.659 
engine vacuum a little tiny hole pushes
air<00:02:49.430> up<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:49.969> it<00:02:50.510> lifts<00:02:51.079> that<00:02:51.230> diaphragm

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:51.669 
air up and it lifts that diaphragm

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.159 
air up and it lifts that diaphragm
upward<00:02:52.669> on<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:52.909> inside<00:02:53.299> and<00:02:53.599> that<00:02:53.689> lifts<00:02:54.049> up

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:54.169 
upward on the inside and that lifts up

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:55.479 
upward on the inside and that lifts up
the<00:02:54.199> needle<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.859> higher<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.040> needle

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
the needle and the higher the needle

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.550 
the needle and the higher the needle
lifts<00:02:55.760> up<00:02:55.909> the<00:02:56.090> more<00:02:56.510> fuel<00:02:56.840> comes<00:02:57.199> from<00:02:57.439> the

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
lifts up the more fuel comes from the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.580 
lifts up the more fuel comes from the
float<00:02:57.799> Bowl<00:02:58.010> up<00:02:58.639> into<00:02:59.389> and<00:02:59.689> into<00:03:00.199> the<00:03:00.290> engine

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
float Bowl up into and into the engine

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.830 
float Bowl up into and into the engine
now<00:03:01.400> that's<00:03:01.909> a<00:03:02.090> simplified<00:03:02.540> way<00:03:02.719> of

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
now that's a simplified way of

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.490 
now that's a simplified way of
explaining<00:03:03.139> a<00:03:03.349> CV<00:03:03.650> carb<00:03:04.659> but<00:03:05.659> in<00:03:05.780> short<00:03:06.079> that's

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
explaining a CV carb but in short that's

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.110 
explaining a CV carb but in short that's
the<00:03:06.709> way<00:03:06.799> they<00:03:06.949> work<00:03:07.129> now<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.579> downside<00:03:07.849> of

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
the way they work now the downside of

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.800 
the way they work now the downside of
that<00:03:08.239> is<00:03:08.359> you<00:03:09.290> twist<00:03:09.919> the<00:03:10.129> throttle<00:03:10.810> that

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
that is you twist the throttle that

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.439 
that is you twist the throttle that
opens<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.379> throttle<00:03:12.739> plate<00:03:13.449> vacuum

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:14.449 
opens the throttle plate vacuum

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:17.349 
opens the throttle plate vacuum
increases<00:03:15.199> then<00:03:16.069> more<00:03:16.370> air<00:03:16.639> starts<00:03:17.060> going

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
increases then more air starts going

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.149 
increases then more air starts going
through<00:03:17.389> then<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:18.199> air<00:03:18.349> starts<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.859> lift<00:03:19.009> the

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 
through then the air starts to lift the

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.649 
through then the air starts to lift the
diaphragm<00:03:19.699> then<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.090> get<00:03:20.209> a<00:03:20.239> little<00:03:20.540> more

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
diaphragm then you get a little more

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.499 
diaphragm then you get a little more
fuel<00:03:21.049> coming<00:03:21.650> in<00:03:21.859> and<00:03:22.099> then<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.699> the<00:03:23.180> engine

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:23.509 
fuel coming in and then the the engine

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:25.719 
fuel coming in and then the the engine
rpm<00:03:23.900> starts<00:03:24.259> to<00:03:24.379> increase<00:03:24.889> creating<00:03:25.519> more

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:25.729 
rpm starts to increase creating more

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:28.839 
rpm starts to increase creating more
vacuum<00:03:26.299> which<00:03:27.259> lifts<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:27.769> in<00:03:27.919> turn<00:03:28.129> higher<00:03:28.459> and

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
vacuum which lifts it in turn higher and

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.059 
vacuum which lifts it in turn higher and
then<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.120> get<00:03:29.239> faster<00:03:30.079> increasing<00:03:30.739> of<00:03:30.919> the

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
then you get faster increasing of the

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:32.409 
then you get faster increasing of the
RPM<00:03:31.459> because<00:03:31.729> you're<00:03:31.849> making<00:03:31.909> a<00:03:32.150> little<00:03:32.299> bit

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
RPM because you're making a little bit

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:34.629 
RPM because you're making a little bit
more<00:03:32.509> power<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.169> then<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.739> RPMs<00:03:34.220> start<00:03:34.519> to

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
more power and then the RPMs start to

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.219 
more power and then the RPMs start to
rise<00:03:34.790> faster<00:03:35.120> then<00:03:35.569> it<00:03:35.689> starts<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:36.049> lift

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:36.229 
rise faster then it starts to lift

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:37.780 
rise faster then it starts to lift
faster<00:03:36.769> and<00:03:36.889> then<00:03:36.979> it<00:03:37.069> starts<00:03:37.340> to<00:03:37.430> rise<00:03:37.609> even

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
faster and then it starts to rise even

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.399 
faster and then it starts to rise even
faster<00:03:38.299> so<00:03:38.449> it's<00:03:38.569> an<00:03:38.659> exponential<00:03:39.229> increase

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
faster so it's an exponential increase

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.589 
faster so it's an exponential increase
when<00:03:40.310> you<00:03:40.400> twist<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:40.759> throttle<00:03:40.970> all<00:03:41.359> the<00:03:41.389> way

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
when you twist the throttle all the way

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.289 
when you twist the throttle all the way
the<00:03:42.379> downside<00:03:42.829> of<00:03:42.979> it<00:03:43.040> is<00:03:43.189> there's<00:03:43.549> a<00:03:43.639> lag<00:03:43.909> when

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
the downside of it is there's a lag when

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.640 
the downside of it is there's a lag when
you<00:03:44.389> twist<00:03:44.659> the<00:03:44.750> throttle<00:03:44.930> you<00:03:45.319> have<00:03:45.439> to<00:03:45.530> wait

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
you twist the throttle you have to wait

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.469 
you twist the throttle you have to wait
for<00:03:45.859> the<00:03:45.919> engine<00:03:46.280> vacuum<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.849> increase<00:03:47.239> to

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479 
for the engine vacuum to increase to

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.360 
for the engine vacuum to increase to
lift<00:03:47.659> the<00:03:47.810> diaphragm<00:03:48.259> to<00:03:48.290> make<00:03:48.620> more<00:03:48.829> power<00:03:49.069> to

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
lift the diaphragm to make more power to

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.729 
lift the diaphragm to make more power to
increase<00:03:49.759> the<00:03:49.909> RPM<00:03:50.060> faster<00:03:50.780> before<00:03:51.379> you<00:03:51.500> start

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
increase the RPM faster before you start

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.469 
increase the RPM faster before you start
making<00:03:51.919> significant<00:03:52.790> amounts<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.120> extra

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:53.479 
making significant amounts of extra

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.469 
making significant amounts of extra
power<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:54.049> can<00:03:54.620> snap<00:03:54.889> the<00:03:55.040> throttle<00:03:55.370> on<00:03:55.519> but

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:56.479 
power you can snap the throttle on but

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:57.909 
power you can snap the throttle on but
you're<00:03:56.629> really<00:03:56.780> not<00:03:56.989> getting<00:03:57.229> the<00:03:57.469> benefit<00:03:57.889> of

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
you're really not getting the benefit of

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.439 
you're really not getting the benefit of
that<00:03:58.009> throttle<00:03:58.340> being<00:03:58.609> all<00:03:58.729> the<00:03:58.939> way<00:03:59.060> open

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
that throttle being all the way open

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.059 
that throttle being all the way open
until<00:03:59.870> you're<00:04:00.019> you<00:04:00.319> know<00:04:00.409> half<00:04:00.620> second

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
three-quarters of a second later like

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.689 
three-quarters of a second later like
the<00:04:04.639> KTM<00:04:05.540> however<00:04:06.169> there's<00:04:06.709> a<00:04:06.859> bit<00:04:07.549> of<00:04:07.639> a

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:07.699 
the KTM however there's a bit of a

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.390 
the KTM however there's a bit of a
difference<00:04:08.000> there<00:04:08.439> at<00:04:09.439> carburetor<00:04:10.039> and<00:04:10.129> there

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
difference there at carburetor and there

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.339 
difference there at carburetor and there
is<00:04:10.609> giant<00:04:11.060> it's<00:04:11.509> it's<00:04:11.810> I<00:04:11.900> mean<00:04:12.019> it<00:04:12.079> goes<00:04:12.169> from

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
is giant it's it's I mean it goes from

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.589 
is giant it's it's I mean it goes from
like<00:04:12.590> here<00:04:12.889> all<00:04:13.129> the<00:04:13.250> way<00:04:13.340> up<00:04:13.430> to<00:04:13.579> here<00:04:14.180> it's

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
like here all the way up to here it's

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.830 
like here all the way up to here it's
it's<00:04:14.900> twice<00:04:15.199> as<00:04:15.409> tall<00:04:15.590> as<00:04:15.859> the<00:04:15.919> one<00:04:16.159> in<00:04:16.400> the

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
it's twice as tall as the one in the

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.449 
it's twice as tall as the one in the
MIDI<00:04:17.840> or<00:04:17.959> Z<00:04:18.109> over<00:04:18.320> here<00:04:18.530> and<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:19.099> difference

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
MIDI or Z over here and the difference

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.600 
MIDI or Z over here and the difference
is<00:04:19.639> on<00:04:19.849> the<00:04:19.880> KTM<00:04:20.299> you<00:04:21.139> twist<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:21.979> throttle<00:04:22.190> and

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
is on the KTM you twist the throttle and

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.810 
is on the KTM you twist the throttle and
a<00:04:23.419> mechanical<00:04:23.960> linkage<00:04:24.110> Yanks<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.279> needle<00:04:25.580> up

of extra air being sucked in because the

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.920 
of extra air being sucked in because the
throttle<00:04:40.409> plate<00:04:40.530> opens<00:04:41.009> up<00:04:41.189> and<00:04:41.460> it<00:04:42.360> blows<00:04:42.659> in

throttle plate opens up and it blows in

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.719 
throttle plate opens up and it blows in
a<00:04:42.960> bunch<00:04:43.169> of<00:04:43.229> extra<00:04:43.530> fuel<00:04:43.770> immediately<00:04:44.580> to

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
a bunch of extra fuel immediately to

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.219 
a bunch of extra fuel immediately to

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
help benefit with a little extra power

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.279 
help benefit with a little extra power
and<00:04:46.590> it<00:04:47.280> pulls<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.729> needle<00:04:48.000> open<00:04:48.330> forcibly<00:04:48.990> so

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
and it pulls the needle open forcibly so

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.499 
and it pulls the needle open forcibly so
the<00:04:49.439> needle<00:04:49.740> just<00:04:50.069> Rises<00:04:50.639> because<00:04:51.360> you've

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
the needle just Rises because you've

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.689 
the needle just Rises because you've
twisted<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:52.139> throttle<00:04:52.500> so<00:04:53.219> the<00:04:53.370> throttle

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
twisted the throttle so the throttle

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.399 
twisted the throttle so the throttle

point probably gonna replace this this
weave<00:07:11.749> that<00:07:12.169> protects<00:07:12.619> this<00:07:12.740> line<00:07:12.949> for<00:07:13.249> the

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:13.309 
weave that protects this line for the

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:15.639 
weave that protects this line for the
radiator<00:07:13.699> lower<00:07:14.509> hose<00:07:14.809> here<00:07:15.080> you<00:07:15.319> know<00:07:15.409> but

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:15.649

lines<00:07:21.139> and<00:07:21.469> fuel<00:07:21.649> lines<00:07:21.679> on<00:07:22.459> an<00:07:22.729> older<00:07:23.119> bike

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.300 
lines and fuel lines on an older bike

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.779 
lines and fuel lines on an older bike
this<00:07:23.479> one<00:07:23.719> only<00:07:23.959> being<00:07:24.139> six<00:07:24.740> years<00:07:24.949> old<00:07:25.129> I<00:07:25.339> I'm

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:28.580 
not gonna do it but when the older bikes

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.369 
not gonna do it but when the older bikes
ten<00:07:28.849> fifteen<00:07:29.240> years<00:07:29.269> old<00:07:29.569> I<00:07:29.719> go<00:07:29.869> and<00:07:29.990> I<00:07:30.050> replace

00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:31.909 
all those lines they get hard over time

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:36.909 
all those lines they get hard over time
so<00:07:32.979> anyway<00:07:33.979> that's<00:07:34.459> it<00:07:34.639> for<00:07:34.819> now
