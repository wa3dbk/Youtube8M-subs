our motion protein handles make this a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:12.370 
our motion protein handles make this a
very<00:00:57.989> easy<00:00:58.289> job

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.620 

next<00:01:13.380> we'll<00:01:13.530> take<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.740> top<00:01:14.479> component<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
next we'll take the top component of the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.930 
next we'll take the top component of the
steering<00:01:15.900> stabilizer<00:01:16.200> itself<00:01:16.710> off<00:01:17.220> we'll

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
steering stabilizer itself off we'll

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.800 
steering stabilizer itself off we'll
undo<00:01:18.180> these<00:01:18.299> two<00:01:18.750> bolts<00:01:19.080> first<00:01:23.630> make<00:01:24.630> sure

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
undo these two bolts first make sure

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.440 
undo these two bolts first make sure
that<00:01:24.990> they<00:01:25.140> are<00:01:25.259> completely<00:01:25.649> loose<00:01:26.270> I'm<00:01:27.270> not

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
that they are completely loose I'm not

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.910 
that they are completely loose I'm not
going<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.690> attempt<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.200> take<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.560> off<00:01:28.710> yet

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
going to attempt to take it off yet

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.990 
going to attempt to take it off yet
because<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.399> need<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.670> undo<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.060> clamp<00:01:30.299> bolts

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
because we need to undo the clamp bolts

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.520 
because we need to undo the clamp bolts
now<00:01:33.000> when<00:01:33.149> you<00:01:33.240> use<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.509> Allen<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.049> undo<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
now when you use this Allen to undo the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.410 
now when you use this Allen to undo the
clamp<00:01:34.860> component<00:01:35.670> here<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.569> that<00:01:36.600> nice<00:01:36.899> loose

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
clamp component here get that nice loose

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.669 
clamp component here get that nice loose
now<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.569> should<00:01:39.750> be<00:01:39.869> able<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.170> go<00:01:40.350> ahead<00:01:40.560> and

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
now it should be able to go ahead and

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.290 
now it should be able to go ahead and
remove<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.039> steering<00:01:41.310> damper<00:01:41.580> easily<00:01:42.090> which

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
remove the steering damper easily which

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.370 
remove the steering damper easily which
we<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.770> leave<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.520> base<00:01:44.700> plate<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.210> place<00:01:45.390> now

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.490 
and shows past review our trusty mallet
wonderful<00:02:15.500> tool<00:02:15.740> however<00:02:17.140> going<00:02:18.140> through<00:02:18.380> the

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
wonderful tool however going through the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.470 
wonderful tool however going through the
toolbox<00:02:18.950> we<00:02:19.130> actually<00:02:19.460> have<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.760> real<00:02:19.910> Suzuki

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
toolbox we actually have the real Suzuki

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.050 
toolbox we actually have the real Suzuki
component<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:21.640> this<00:02:22.640> has<00:02:22.850> to<00:02:23.030> take<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:23.870> break<00:02:24.140> go

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
component so this has to take a break go

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.300 
component so this has to take a break go
ahead<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.270> use<00:02:26.720> our<00:02:26.990> component<00:02:27.620> from<00:02:27.740> Suzuki

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
ahead and use our component from Suzuki

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.050 
ahead and use our component from Suzuki
so<00:02:28.610> we'll<00:02:28.760> lift<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.120> tank<00:02:30.760> we'll<00:02:31.760> go<00:02:31.940> ahead

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
so we'll lift the tank we'll go ahead

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.360 
so we'll lift the tank we'll go ahead
and<00:02:32.210> set<00:02:32.570> that<00:02:32.600> through<00:02:33.470> there<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.920> we<00:02:34.190> will

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
and set that through there and we will

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.150 
and set that through there and we will
set<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:34.610> in<00:02:34.940> there<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:36.290> now<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.530> tank<00:02:36.920> is

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
set that in there and now the tank is

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.520 
set that in there and now the tank is
safely<00:02:37.820> up<00:02:37.940> in<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.210> air<00:02:38.330> I'm<00:02:39.080> not<00:02:39.230> going<00:02:39.350> to<00:02:39.440> do

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
safely up in the air I'm not going to do

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.020

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
much more than this because our air box

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.370 
much more than this because our air box
is<00:02:41.420> right<00:02:41.630> here<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.650> we<00:02:42.920> need<00:02:43.130> to<00:02:43.250> remove<00:02:43.670> our

is right here so we need to remove our

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.000 
is right here so we need to remove our
relays<00:02:45.380> on<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.740> top<00:02:46.960> we<00:02:47.960> need<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.290> remove<00:02:48.770> the

relays on the top we need to remove the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.010 
relays on the top we need to remove the
connector<00:02:49.930> there<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.370> now<00:02:52.370> our<00:02:53.330> air<00:02:53.570> box<00:02:53.600> is

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
connector there and now our air box is

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.230 
connector there and now our air box is
free<00:02:54.320> we<00:02:54.560> have<00:02:54.590> one<00:02:54.980> hour<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.280> remove<00:02:55.550> here<00:02:56.030> and

just work you work your way around the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.130 
just work you work your way around the
air<00:03:13.010> box<00:03:13.250> no<00:03:13.970> rush<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.209> do<00:03:14.480> this<00:03:14.690> just<00:03:14.930> take

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
air box no rush to do this just take

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.810 
air box no rush to do this just take
your<00:03:15.290> time<00:03:17.650> once<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.800> screw<00:03:19.070> hits<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.459> top<00:03:19.670> of

your time once the screw hits the top of

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.280 
your time once the screw hits the top of
the<00:03:19.910> thread<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.180> it's<00:03:20.450> released<00:03:20.840> you'll<00:03:21.080> hear

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.400 
where you can hear that on every single
screw<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:28.580> there's<00:03:28.760> a<00:03:28.820> bunch<00:03:29.030> of<00:03:29.150> under<00:03:29.420> so

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
screw and there's a bunch of under so

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:42.410 
screw and there's a bunch of under so
this<00:03:30.800> will<00:03:30.950> take<00:03:31.160> you<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:31.310> couple<00:03:31.640> minutes

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420
