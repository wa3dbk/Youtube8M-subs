00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.920
 When I go to Moscow region, Where it smells of mowed grass, 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:26.000
 Nature whispers to me with love Her cherished words. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.240
 In the distance, the strip of dawn is burning with an autumn flame. 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:43.480
 My familiar birch. To me quietly, quietly says: 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:53.160
 Russia, Russia - Native, free lands! 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.160
 Russia, Russia, Russia - My Motherland! 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:10.440
 Russia, Russia, Russia - My Motherland! 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:19.880
 When the Moscow train takes me to distant places, 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:28.040
 Bread bow to me in the belt, Flashing early star. 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:36.440
 To the voice of the motherland, I will go out. How are you, Russia, good! 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.600
 I look around and hear with my heart 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.640
 Sings, sings, my soul: 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:54.280
 Russia, Russia - Native, free lands! 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:02.360
 Russia, Russia, Russia - My Motherland! 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:21.040
 Russia, Russia, Russia - My Motherland!
