00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.080 
done well there you have it there's my
version<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.530> macaroni<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.160> cheese<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.820> really

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
version of macaroni and cheese it really

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.910 
version of macaroni and cheese it really
is<00:02:43.210> a<00:02:43.240> simple<00:02:43.690> dish<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:43.870> make<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:44.590> think<00:02:44.800> the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
is a simple dish to make and I think the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.080 
is a simple dish to make and I think the
combination<00:02:45.130> of<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.700> three<00:02:45.730> different

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
combination of the three different

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.210 
combination of the three different
cheeses<00:02:46.480> really<00:02:47.170> set<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.560> dish<00:02:47.770> off<00:02:47.980> and

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
cheeses really set that dish off and

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.830 
cheeses really set that dish off and
that<00:02:48.580> baking<00:02:48.940> this<00:02:49.030> adds<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.420> little<00:02:49.570> bit<00:02:49.750> of

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
that baking this adds a little bit of

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.870 
that baking this adds a little bit of
something<00:02:50.050> -<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:51.010> really<00:02:51.220> hope<00:02:51.460> you<00:02:51.610> enjoyed
