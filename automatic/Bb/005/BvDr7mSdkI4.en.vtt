00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
 the planes an element for the world 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.520
 audiovisual 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.300
 do not 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.590
 i 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.680
 hi renders how are you I hope you 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.390
 find my name very well is mario 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.760
 Herrera and today we are going to talk about a 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.340
 quite peculiar theme the planes 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.309
 audiovisuals and audiovisual plans 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.680
 are the perspective of the camera something like that 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.989
 like the director's eyes that you 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.239
 they want to show something either an object or 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.100
 an action a reaction or a place 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.739
 determinant but the planes 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.080
 audiovisuals are not exclusive to the cinema 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.809
 we can find them also in the 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.750
 world of comics photography or 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.940
 even from the cartoon plus the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.650
 plans are already pre-established and you 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.780
 can help tell the story to 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.000
 through the images that come together in 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.000
 a sequence ok but for that we 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.659
 they serve the plans and how they are used 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.909
 to start we have the video those that 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.330
 they are used to detail a part of the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.050
 face to perfection for example 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.360
 the lips maybe the cheek but 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.120
 they are always enough enough 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.460
 closed we will help provide details 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.740
 perfection a part of the rose and then 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.770
 we have the extreme close shop is a 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.320
 it is still much more closed than 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.420
 what we saw earlier this one is going to 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.790
 help to detail actions as they are 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.710
 when someone had a boyfriend when 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.080
 someone breathes and be like they inflate their 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.910
 nostrils or for example also 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.500
 when someone cries and you see the 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.260
 travel that makes his tear 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.200
 cheek maybe up his neck 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.110
 but it's a shot that helps you still 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.450
 express myself in a more contemptuous sense 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.340
 some action and it can be confused with 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.369
 the thickness but you have to have a lot 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:04.580
 be careful because they are very different and all 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.580
 we have the familiar plane 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:15.080
 but the difference with us is that 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.080
 will allow us to know the expression 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:27.090
 the expression then we have the middle a 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.489
 gloss or a pretty used take on 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.760
 especially in TV shows 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.010
 magazine type with the news we see it 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.720
 also in some bloggers it 's a take 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.849
 that always goes from the waist towards 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.400
 above shows a little of the posture 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.720
 of our character and maybe a 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.610
 bit environment where 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.319
 find but no more does not have much 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.350
 science as I tell you from the waist 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.560
 upwards 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.900
 and then we have the american showdown 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.760
 American plane a curious fact about 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.220
 This is born with the arrival of 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.740
 western genre and good of the need 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.250
 to show the players almost by 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.590
 complete but not so much allowed us to see 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.390
 that action while fighting against the 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.520
 clean but I also hope that a 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.460
 know that they brought their guns to the 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.860
 good waist we merida see environments not 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.990
 they found that there was maybe 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.510
 walk towards a point around him 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.100
 but not completely this plane 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.380
 generally goes of the calves 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.180
 upwards is to say allows us 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.180
 know three quarters of our 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.730
 character on stage now let's see the 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.770
 general plane or drive a plane that 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.050
 will allow us to meet our 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.180
 full body character this plane 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.370
 announces too much information but 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.000
 we have to be very careful if 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.000
 we already know 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.599
 we have to respect rules of 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.489
 composition of two thirds and many 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.650
 others that good intervene in the 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.630
 composition of a good take now 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.030
 let's talk about two larger planes 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.489
 particular the first is the applied 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.069
 in this we are going to get the effect that 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.000
 our arising is lower is by 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.680
 example when an adult sees a child 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.720
 from top to bottom the trick to 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.090
 get good our age listeners 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.750
 little one the little one is to position the 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.269
 camera approximately at 45 degrees about 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.299
 the person you want to give this 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.430
 effect and subsequently good we will have 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.510
 the result is a person without 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.550
 importance 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.590
 is a person intimidated by the 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.419
 otherwise we have the graphical one that does not 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.690
 it's nothing but the reverse effect 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.600
 we obtain the result and unipersonal with 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.090
 great gifts of superior 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.400
 what we have to do here is to cook 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.860
 our bed on the floor and good 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.710
 we will get this result from a 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.620
 big person strong but remember 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.370
 It should also be at 45 degrees to 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.470
 acquired from this body another very flat 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.950
 used in the world of cinematography 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.570
 the photograph is the large plane that 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.620
 This will help us generate a 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.570
 tension environment a little bit of 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.550
 development agrees to say it as to 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.430
 the image this is nothing more than 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.790
 tilt the camera a little 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.880
 for 40 to 45 degrees and achieve an effect 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.590
 that things are falling and not 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.130
 it requires a lot of science only 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.950
 we need to position our camera to 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.840
 45 degrees or so on the axis 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.900
 horizontal to give the effect that it 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.210
 things fall either to the right or 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.510
 to the left you have to take care of it very 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.790
 well because it's a very delicate plane 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.940
 Finally, it should be noted that these are 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.490
 some of the most important plans do not 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.120
 they are all but they are the basis of the 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.680
 realization of football plans 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.140
 then the only way to achieve 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.480
 add this technique to our mind is 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.030
 practicing and practicing 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.850
 with time we will obtain the 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.790
 almost unconscious results and these 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.449
 blueprints 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.330
 easy easy 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:07.529
 very easy then we only have left 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:10.050
 go out to the street to take pictures because if 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:14.039
 we are given this Mexican practice of 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:16.100
 artistic way drawing because good 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:18.050
 we have reached the end 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.070
 but before we leave we want to send 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.420
 special greetings to manuel a 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:27.110
 thank you very much for your comments and 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:31.090
 share remember my name is bigger and 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.090
 we are also growing in networks 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:35.930
 to be in contact 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.650
 and 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.930
