00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:08.370
 It is a corner of the institute that has started to fail . 

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:10.500
 I will answer your questions 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.930
 It is said that 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:18.510
 And let me know 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:22.950
 Although Nexon's impressed Te'll also previous lord had said Nate 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:29.850
 It was not in Kobayashi Heavy Industries oa 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:31.770
 It is necessary that there is an episode at the time of launch or there is also a long time 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.490
 It's a draw . 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.490
 It is this 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:46.030
 It was quite 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:48.060
 In this probably bristles to painful episode Tsurako' and the episode is that Japan is not through 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.360
 It is English that 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.360
 No 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.740
 a I I'd like to this in this kind of business 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.579
 This Japan is 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.560
 Without knowing the other party 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.369
 Haberfa 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.570
 Oh, there were a lot 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.010
 so 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.560
 that 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:17.420
 Because the mystery 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.470
 The clothes on the use of the place say flying the goods 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:27.130
 It seems that you sell well 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:29.680
 That, for example, Do not say go to the consumer from your Miseya's the time being hit by your Miseya's 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.460
 It will or was a pattern 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:41.760
 Source the first First was the shops and fraud goofy 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:44.900
 To jar to your Miseya's in is talking to human beings Tteyuu your Miseya's person in charge 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.740
 The person in charge did not understand Japanese 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.570
 Not a sense 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.080
 I understand the meaning of living yes 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.510
 I understand 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.800
 Hey 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:03.409
 The product of this is the issue 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:07.579
 Also do not know is it to say in in Tsu'm incense 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.530
 Does Mase Mechamechai fine were many people there were plenty to say 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:14.720
 I guess I'm a prisoner now 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.240
 In that and say it and why 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.650
 I wonder of the orchid in 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:25.670
 There is a person's friendship on that one day 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.470
 Is not the case I'm there is Kokorone to say was this faded doing this 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.530
 Study something 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:35.330
 There is such a new proposal 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:39.170
 Over over that it did not accept the other because there is progress 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.580
 Hey not hate my house as Bun'iwa pleasing because this 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.319
 Sorry I'm sorry 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.030
 Ummamae 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.330
 so 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.310
 Kedomo that it's it Iiii do 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:54.350
 I wonder what that 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:58.730
 It is something that doesn't make sense 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:02.960
 It's because you're like this 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.780
 If you think in the world and do not do this now, it is no good 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.220
 I do not feel that day is 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.750
 So 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.750
 I believe this faith will no longer change English in the future 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.580
 If you 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.960
 I could not understand the words of setting 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:27.500
 Although it is not so strong though it is 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:32.100
 Oh , I think it's like that . 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:36.300
 More something another when the people say anymore so try cormorant 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.240
 Don't say that it's tempting to break something with power 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.560
 Heaven of over 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:47.560
 Surgery It was quite difficult at times 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.560
 Episode of the character after that stood Akechi 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.630
 yeah 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.230
 Well if you do this separately 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.000
 Hmm 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.750
 Ne Ja unconstitutional 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.750
 Let's think 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:10.330
 This large is it anyway because quite okay Once you have made during this that 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.900
 I'm blind 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.900
 make 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:22.380
 It's Kotonan is difficult over sedge of Tteyuu'll by the idea of the new that god there 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:26.120
 What 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.120
 I understood that I was angry with myself 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.639
 Say
