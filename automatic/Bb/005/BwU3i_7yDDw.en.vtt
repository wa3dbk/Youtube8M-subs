00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.679
 March 25, 1948 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.699
 aspec new mexico 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.739
 what starts as a normal day for local oil workers is 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.089
 turns into an encounter with the unknown 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.430
 as they approach their workplace 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.190
 poznan silvery object 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.190
 it catches their attention 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.070
 When the workers arrived they found a disk of 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.070
 approximately 30 meters in diameter 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.710
 as the ship is intact more it looks like an end landing 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.710
 an accident 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.479
 the witnesses with whom I spoke 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:01.700
 the project that nolan 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.700
 both young for the time did not enter the ship 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.820
 suddenly the foreman sounded, exhorted the workers 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.630
 to leave there 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.740
 except for a broken port 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.700
 there were no visible signs of damage 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.580
 two novels 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.580
 He informed me that he gave two bodies through the porthole 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.700
 in a few hours trucks arrive supposedly from this geo field 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.530
 Apparently the United States government 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.530
 and in another case of ortiz in his hands 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.060
 having learned from their own mistakes to vuoso 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.060
 the army quickly took control of the situation 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.460
 nine months before yao sole had lost his peace of mind by appearing in 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.460
 the front pages of many newspapers 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.220
 I think the military acted on time 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.220
 they rushed to get to the place and took the frisbee 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.670
 yes just arrived the military immediately covered everything with a cloak 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.089
 of mistery 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:18.789
 3 spoke with the local inhabitants and reminded them of their patriotic duties 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:20.919
 to the United States 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:23.739
 if they were sworn to keep the secret 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.799
 58 years ago 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.409
 they did not talk to us about national security we kept quiet because 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.789
 we respected and believed in government 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:36.009
 the military wanted that object to collaborate with 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.009
 because there was so much to take away from you 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:53.109
 according to the eyewitnesses the army took between 14 and 16 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.259
 calcined bodies of the aircraft 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.370
 the rescue team took both the mother and the corpses 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.570
 to a safe place 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.570
 away from the media 

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:12.319
 you have to take the remains to the nearest military base where one 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.779
 can control access and then move to another suitable place 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:20.819
 depending on what you want to do and once again the clumsy month was known 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.619
 own site 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:26.789
 due to the number of extraterrestrial bodies of aspe 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.799
 it is considered to be the largest UFO find to date 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:37.099
 but researchers say there are many other cases related to the 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.849
 base fae 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.779
 October 1947 and tablalis Hispalis of Arizona 

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:45.679
 May 1953 kidman arizona 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:51.119
 june 1953 laredo texas and december 5, 1965 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.809
 Enke ex multiple faces 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:57.959
 are just some alleged cases of flying saucers accidents 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.129
 in United States 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.779
 it does not matter where the premieres landed 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:07.259
 it seems that all roads lead to the root base paterson qian hangar 18 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:14.130
 roa and paterson was like a kind of cemetery for all these things 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.560
 surely they kept them under certain patterns until the technology 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.969
 I knew what to do with them 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:25.270
 but despite the innumerable books and public interest in UFOs 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.740
 there was never an official confirmation about the presence of any ship 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.979
 alien in hangar 18 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.939
 finally people stopped paying attention to the base city is fake 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:43.679
 nevertheless the interest was revived in 1978 when the lillo ufologist did not 

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:44.689
 restrict or 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:49.759
 gave a speech at the annual symposium of the mutual held network as a forum for 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.020
 its acronym in English 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.810
 coincidentally in fact did not fail headquarters of the base there paterson 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.690
 I'm on the ground I was doing things in this field that nobody else had done 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.790
 He had even formed a team of people who needed information 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.060
 who gave him testimony of things they had seen and done was not a person 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.319
 but a whole group of people who trusted him 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.280
 and whose testimonies the public aria these people gave him information 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.610
 that he correlated with those of others to determine what was true and what 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.610
 do not 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.710
 he wrote he wrote several books about UFO crashes and his rescue 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:38.689
 due to the prevailing secrecy many of their clients did not want their names 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:42.479
 appeared published for fear of losing their highly confidential 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.479
 jobs in government 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.590
 between the stories that have run about the investment and 8 of the base there 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.510
 four are 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.510
 is that of a navy pilot identified as pj which together with 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.620
 several others accidentally entered a restricted access hangar 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.229
 for a brief 30 seconds a metallic object was seen in forms of 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.960
 pisco about four and a half meters wide by two and a half high I can not 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.960
 secure another thing but it was there 

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:17.549
 according to the extinction investigation these men were 

00:06:17.549 --> 00:06:20.669
 confronted by guards and quickly pulled him out of the hangar 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:24.979
 watson has left out murillo we were all sure that the government 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:28.889
 had developed and already in the cymbal eye the hard in service 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:39.080
 as these stories were coming to light they began to appear 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.300
 witnesses 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.599
 the offset specialist and doctor from the university of stanford the detective 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:46.130
 the washington police 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.110
 clarkson fins 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.199
 public city hall 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:53.279
 former employee of the faes paterson base in the Russo era 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:58.389
 I agreed to offer a recorded interview and 1997 clarkson to his 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:02.209
 time has allowed him to register and chanel spread the interview for the first time 

00:07:02.209 --> 00:07:05.469
 in TV 

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:10.229
 the history of cain goes back to the early years of the 1950s 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:13.240
 agreement with the documents that he provided to clarkson was a 

00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:17.719
 typist with access to secret hidden information one afternoon a lieutenant the 

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:20.719
 surprised with an unusual piece of metal 

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:25.199
 and here I at my desk and my son yoon 

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:28.559
 you are a good worker, go away, break days 

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:31.369
 and I took it 

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:34.479
 and double and twisted 

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:37.479
 but returned alone to its original form 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.949
 it is a very thick material propersa anything 

00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:42.990
 nothing at all 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.380
 It was like a feather I asked him then what it was and he told me a piece 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.580
 of spacecraft told me later that I had just brought those from nelson mej√≠a
