00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
little restocking area if you can't be

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.649 
little restocking area if you can't be
stairs<00:01:26.540> see<00:01:27.540> these<00:01:27.810> are<00:01:27.869> farming<00:01:28.500> suppliers

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
stairs see these are farming suppliers

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.649 
stairs see these are farming suppliers
is<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.070> weapons<00:01:32.509> these<00:01:33.509> are<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> tools<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
is the weapons these are the tools and

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.490 
is the weapons these are the tools and
this<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.900> food<00:01:37.140> here<00:01:38.479> same<00:01:39.479> with<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> other

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
this the food here same with the other

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.620 
this the food here same with the other
side<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:42.420> will<00:01:42.509> all<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.020> correct<00:01:43.259> place

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
side it will all be in the correct place

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.789 
side it will all be in the correct place
so<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.659> thought<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
so I thought this is just going to be a

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.580 
so I thought this is just going to be a
little<00:01:47.070> video<00:01:47.579> where<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> show<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.479> off<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.350> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
little video where I show it off it's a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.950 
little video where I show it off it's a
little<00:01:49.860> bit<00:01:50.100> more<00:01:50.250> harder<00:01:50.640> redstone<00:01:51.180> if<00:01:51.780> you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
little bit more harder redstone if you

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.969 
little bit more harder redstone if you
can<00:01:52.110> see<00:01:52.380> here<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.700> redstone<00:01:54.509> oh<00:01:54.979> no

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
can see here this is the redstone oh no

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.700 
can see here this is the redstone oh no
this<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.490> actually<00:01:56.610> even<00:01:56.939> more<00:01:57.090> difficult

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
this is actually even more difficult

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.230 
this is actually even more difficult
it's<00:01:58.710> actually<00:01:59.070> pretty<00:01:59.219> easy<00:01:59.340> adding<00:02:00.119> on

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
it's actually pretty easy adding on

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.080 
it's actually pretty easy adding on
categories<00:02:00.990> i<00:02:01.170> could<00:02:01.320> probably<00:02:01.500> do<00:02:01.740> like

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
categories i could probably do like

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.959 
categories i could probably do like
possibly<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> 10<00:02:03.829> category<00:02:04.829> thing<00:02:05.189> if<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.700> wanted

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
possibly a 10 category thing if I wanted

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.369 
possibly a 10 category thing if I wanted
to<00:02:06.030> which<00:02:06.930> would<00:02:07.110> be<00:02:07.229> pretty<00:02:07.469> cool<00:02:09.140> but<00:02:10.140> I'm

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
to which would be pretty cool but I'm

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.869 
to which would be pretty cool but I'm
not<00:02:10.920> going<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.250> because<00:02:11.489> they<00:02:11.670> can't<00:02:11.819> be

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:12.940 
not going to because they can't be

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.920 

but<00:02:13.950> anyway<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:15.000> hope<00:02:15.209> you've<00:02:15.510> enjoyed<00:02:15.599> this

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
but anyway I hope you've enjoyed this

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.789
