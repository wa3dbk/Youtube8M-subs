00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.750
 make a strawberry is a real 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.460
 experience 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.010
 homemade jam in each jar 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.410
 is a lot of fun and a lot of love 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.820
 petra would like to be honored for the first time 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.010
 make jam yourself 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.529
 the fruits are picked and the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.000
 matching gelierzucker selected what 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.550
 She should cook the jam 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.859
 respect, think highly of 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.179
 in the dr oetker trial kitchen you show 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.919
 petra elsholz how easy it is 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.849
 The strawberries really do emerge in the 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.739
 to wash water 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.879
 Erdmann are just sensitive 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.120
 fruits and if you have one 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:41.320
 water jet directly on it then gives times 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.550
 lose the live goes on 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.550
 first the strawberries are cleaned 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.190
 and then in small pieces 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.190
 sliced 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.170
 if it is to go very fast 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.140
 Just take a potato mash 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.210
 and to squeeze the fruits for it 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:18.390
 packet he trains sugar needed 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:21.000
 Exactly 1000 strawberries are still a genius 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.580
 sugar we take it in china 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.130
 jam fruits have all 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.600
 different let acid content and 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.899
 with the gelierzucker it is so that 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.430
 suitably matched to the strawberry 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.740
 strawberries and gelatin sugar 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.960
 be in a big pot with each other 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.509
 stirred and brought to a boil 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.310
 in july sugar is the chemistry 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.380
 with opec team that for the typical 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.289
 Consistency of strawberry jam says 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.649
 so it has to be successful every three minutes 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.649
 Cook 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.979
 It starts to cook and that's how it starts 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.479
 a bit to write on now 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.710
 that is also so slowly up and that is 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.600
 then just such a character that is 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.820
 really thoroughly cooked from now on 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.899
 we can use the three minutes will present 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.009
 we'll fill it up right now 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.750
 content clock come 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.099
 I 've already prepared the readers 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.349
 that means the glasses I have just 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.090
 rinsed with hot water and the 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.920
 Cover I have five minutes in 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.709
 boiling water boiled off, so to speak 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.319
 The three minutes are sterile 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.390
 Expired before the jam bottled 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.870
 should still be made a sample 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.880
 become 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.349
 in addition the hot fruit mass arrives 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.810
 a plate is faster if 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:40.500
 this is cooled and now look 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:42.540
 just think that is now stuck 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.610
 Bottling the jam is helpful 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.849
 to use a filling judge 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.950
 so the preserving jar stays nice and clean 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.810
 it is important to fill the glass to the brim 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:59.250
 so that the air space between the lid and 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:01.440
 jam remains as low as possible rotates 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.239
 it again on the head and left to 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.620
 that stand five minutes and so 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.780
 then you can glass again 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.000
 turn around and you're done 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.030
 look over homemade jam 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.130
 Family and friends through something 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.500
 Decoration is a wonderful creation 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.790
 personal gift 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.950
 so that the jam is as long as possible 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.990
 it should be kept cool and cool 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.410
 be stored for example in dark 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.730
 a carton in her cellar 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.170
 to get pleasure in being made 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.170
 try it at home 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:37.090
 it's quite out of the doctor 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.090
 easy and guaranteed
