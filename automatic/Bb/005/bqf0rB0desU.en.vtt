00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 maybe you do not think much about the 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.100
 accumulator that has your car but when 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.259
 reflect on how much you depend 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.300
 of and how many times do you start your engine at 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.460
 year dedicate a little more time to 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.509
 know about your accumulator is a good 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.309
 decision 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.260
 the patented grating technology 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.210
 power frame is the technology that is 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.850
 found inside the accumulator which 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.680
 provides authentic strength strength that 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.660
 only die-cut positive grids 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.310
 accurately they can offer you since 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.439
 the positive grid provides the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.599
 energy needed to start your car 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.969
 it is a key component in an accumulator 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.070
 start after start so you have to go 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.630
 to work pick up the children get to 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.430
 time to the airport to take a flight 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.350
 or simply attend to pending 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.329
 You need an accumulator that will give your 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.340
 vehicle the strength to do what 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.140
 is made with power technology 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.420
 frame 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.730
 everything starts with the lead alloy 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.399
 which is cast in a long strip and 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.770
 compressed to a specific thickness this 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.480
 process is inspected by a strict 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.670
 automated control that ensures that 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.370
 Each power frame grid reaches the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.440
 precise thickness which means that your 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.000
 accumulator will have the optimum strength to 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.610
 start your car 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.280
 the power frame grids are characterized 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.960
 by the patented die-cutting technique 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.510
 this process stamps on each stroke a 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.490
 optimized design the design minimizes the 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.410
 stress on the metal and gives each of 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.080
 the grids power frame a pattern 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.729
 uniform and ideal since the consistency 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.070
 is the key to reliable performance 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.020
 the design of each power frame grid 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.820
 it is optimized so that there is a flow 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.680
 stable electron which looks 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.930
 reflected in the performance of the accumulator 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.940
 that means you can count on him 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.410
 whenever you need it the frame 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.030
 around the grid creates a 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.830
 integrated structure to prevent 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.869
 fractures caused by variations 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.790
 extremes of temperature that weaken 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.320
 accumulators reason why 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.360
 have an engineering and manufacturing 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.460
 smarter it becomes so 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.740
 important but the grid power frame 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.810
 Not only is it smarter but also 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.320
 greener the manufacturing process 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.119
 uses 20% less energy and emits 20% 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.280
 less greenhouse gases than 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.229
 other methods also has the ability 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.240
 to recycle the excess metal making 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.550
 Waste- free manufacturing is 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.320
 intelligent and ecological seal 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.510
 power frame placed on the outside of 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.870
 the accumulators represents the authentic 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.090
 portal 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.360
