00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.119 

alright<00:00:01.439> in<00:00:01.560> this<00:00:01.620> lesson<00:00:01.800> we're<00:00:01.979> going<00:00:02.010> to

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
alright in this lesson we're going to

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.860 
alright in this lesson we're going to
begin<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.429> process<00:00:02.610> of<00:00:02.820> rendering<00:00:03.360> out<00:00:03.659> our

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
begin the process of rendering out our

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.579 
begin the process of rendering out our
cloud<00:00:04.230> bank<00:00:05.569> ok<00:00:06.569> so<00:00:06.839> if<00:00:07.049> I<00:00:07.140> were<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.290> come<00:00:07.470> in

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
cloud bank ok so if I were to come in

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.799 
cloud bank ok so if I were to come in
and<00:00:07.740> take<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.550> particle<00:00:09.240> simulation<00:00:09.360> that<00:00:09.719> we

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
and take the particle simulation that we

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.870 
and take the particle simulation that we
left<00:00:09.990> off<00:00:10.139> within<00:00:10.380> our<00:00:10.530> previous<00:00:10.860> lesson<00:00:11.010> you

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
left off within our previous lesson you

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.310 
left off within our previous lesson you
can<00:00:11.910> see<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.210> we<00:00:12.300> are<00:00:12.330> just<00:00:12.509> still<00:00:13.080> rendering

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
can see that we are just still rendering

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.609 
can see that we are just still rendering
with<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.620> default<00:00:13.920> font<00:00:14.130> Irial<00:00:15.470> so<00:00:16.470> I'll

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
with the default font Irial so I'll

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.960 
with the default font Irial so I'll
start<00:00:16.800> by<00:00:16.920> coming<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.279> selecting<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.730> point

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
start by coming in selecting this point

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.120 
start by coming in selecting this point
cloud<00:00:18.180> let's<00:00:18.660> go<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.930> either<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.800> model

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
cloud let's go to either the model

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.220 
cloud let's go to either the model
animate<00:00:20.490> or<00:00:20.520> render<00:00:20.939> menus<00:00:21.240> let's<00:00:21.840> go<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.050> get

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
animate or render menus let's go to get

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.500 
animate or render menus let's go to get
material<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.830> we'll<00:00:23.730> assign<00:00:23.939> something<00:00:24.269> like

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
material and we'll assign something like

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.540 
material and we'll assign something like
a<00:00:24.750> constant<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.740> particular<00:00:26.189> example

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
a constant in this particular example

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.099 
a constant in this particular example
I'm<00:00:26.849> not<00:00:27.000> going<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.210> start<00:00:27.420> off<00:00:27.510> by<00:00:27.570> using<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
I'm not going to start off by using the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.080 
I'm not going to start off by using the
ice<00:00:28.380> particle<00:00:28.920> volume<00:00:29.039> because<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.849> actually

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
ice particle volume because I actually

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.089 
ice particle volume because I actually
want<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.449> create<00:00:30.660> sort<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.050> my<00:00:31.170> own<00:00:31.380> particle

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
want to create sort of my own particle

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.580 
want to create sort of my own particle
shape<00:00:32.340> or<00:00:32.550> results<00:00:33.270> which<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.780> particle<00:00:34.260> shaper

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
shape or results which a particle shaper

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.959 
shape or results which a particle shaper
nodes<00:00:34.829> automatically<00:00:35.370> created<00:00:35.730> with<00:00:35.850> this

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
nodes automatically created with this

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.299 
nodes automatically created with this
one<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.930> I'll<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.350> kind<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.950> go<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.190> and

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
one so I'll just kind of go in and

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.700 
one so I'll just kind of go in and
create<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.610> by<00:00:38.790> hand<00:00:39.170> so<00:00:40.170> we'll<00:00:40.410> start<00:00:40.620> with

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
create this by hand so we'll start with

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.990 
create this by hand so we'll start with
a<00:00:40.770> constant<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:41.399> can<00:00:41.520> assign<00:00:41.730> something

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
a constant just we can assign something

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.200 
a constant just we can assign something
different<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.629> object<00:00:43.700> let's<00:00:44.700> press<00:00:44.910> 7

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
different to this object let's press 7

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.639 
different to this object let's press 7
on<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.420> keyboard<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.079> open<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> render

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
on the keyboard to open up the render

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.690 
on the keyboard to open up the render
tree<00:00:48.530> all<00:00:49.530> right<00:00:49.710> I'm<00:00:49.800> going<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.950> go<00:00:50.010> into<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
tree all right I'm going to go into the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.060 
tree all right I'm going to go into the
particle<00:00:51.480> section<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.960> let's<00:00:52.710> start<00:00:52.920> with

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
particle section and let's start with

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.510 
particle section and let's start with
the<00:00:53.309> particle<00:00:53.699> renderer<00:00:55.129> so<00:00:56.129> we'll<00:00:56.250> take<00:00:56.370> this

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the particle renderer so we'll take this

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.189 
the particle renderer so we'll take this
connect<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:56.969> into<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.449> volume<00:00:59.059> and<00:01:00.199> let's

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
connect this into the volume and let's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.270 
connect this into the volume and let's
see<00:01:01.320> what<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.530> get<00:01:03.470> ok<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.949> see<00:01:05.129> we

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
see what we get ok so you can see we

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.300 
see what we get ok so you can see we
have<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.610> volume<00:01:06.570> that's<00:01:06.780> being<00:01:06.930> rented<00:01:07.140> out

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
have the volume that's being rented out

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.130 
have the volume that's being rented out
but<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.729> see<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.360> begin<00:01:09.630> with<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.960> kind<00:01:10.110> of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
but you can see to begin with it kind of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.080 
but you can see to begin with it kind of
starts<00:01:10.409> off<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.830> yellowish<00:01:11.460> color<00:01:11.820> which

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
starts off as this yellowish color which

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.330 
starts off as this yellowish color which
is<00:01:12.119> completely<00:01:12.659> normal<00:01:12.860> so<00:01:13.860> all<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
is completely normal so all we have to

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.830 
is completely normal so all we have to
do<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.729> go<00:01:14.939> into<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> particle<00:01:15.540> renderer

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
do is go into the particle renderer

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.960 
do is go into the particle renderer
let's<00:01:16.470> take<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> look<00:01:16.830> inside<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.610> particle

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
let's take a look inside the particle

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.109 
let's take a look inside the particle
color<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.299> begin<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.880> if<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.000> were<00:01:21.060> to

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
color to begin with so if we were to

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.710 
color to begin with so if we were to
take<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.840> quick<00:01:22.140> region<00:01:23.090> let's<00:01:24.090> first<00:01:24.330> turn<00:01:24.540> on

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
take a quick region let's first turn on

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.240 
take a quick region let's first turn on
override<00:01:25.290> particle<00:01:25.680> color<00:01:25.830> which<00:01:26.040> will<00:01:26.159> give

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
override particle color which will give

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.240 
override particle color which will give
these<00:01:26.400> particles<00:01:26.790> sort<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.030> pink<00:01:27.299> color<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
these particles sort of a pink color and

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.530 
these particles sort of a pink color and
let's<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:29.310> set<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.610> color<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.970> white<00:01:30.119> so

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
let's just set this color to white so

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.630 
let's just set this color to white so
that<00:01:30.780> way<00:01:30.960> these<00:01:31.619> particles<00:01:32.130> sort<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.400> render

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
that way these particles sort of render

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.569 
that way these particles sort of render
out<00:01:32.759> with<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.030> white<00:01:33.240> color<00:01:34.310> right<00:01:35.310> now<00:01:35.460> when

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
out with this white color right now when

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.249 
out with this white color right now when
it<00:01:35.670> comes<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.000> actually<00:01:36.390> rendering<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.020> with

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
it comes to actually rendering this with

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.710 
it comes to actually rendering this with
any<00:01:37.439> kind<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.650> ambience<00:01:38.130> or<00:01:38.310> diffuse<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.939> lot<00:01:39.630> of

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
any kind of ambience or diffuse a lot of

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.539 
any kind of ambience or diffuse a lot of
times<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.110> find<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.950> really<00:01:41.250> not

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
times I find that it's really not

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.850 
times I find that it's really not
necessary<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:42.270> start<00:01:43.140> off<00:01:43.229> with<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> high<00:01:43.590> level

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
necessary to start off with a high level

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.429 
necessary to start off with a high level
of<00:01:43.950> ambience<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.970> typically<00:01:45.540> i'll<00:01:45.720> begin<00:01:45.930> by

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
of ambience so typically i'll begin by

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.350 
of ambience so typically i'll begin by
bringing<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.250> value<00:01:47.850> all<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.119> way<00:01:48.180> down<00:01:48.329> to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
bringing this value all the way down to

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.450 
bringing this value all the way down to
zero<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.869> bringing<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> diffuse<00:01:50.220> all<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
zero and bringing the diffuse all the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.399 
zero and bringing the diffuse all the
way<00:01:50.579> up<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.729> one<00:01:51.000> or<00:01:51.360> at<00:01:51.420> least<00:01:51.479> some<00:01:52.140> kind<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.320> a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
way up to one or at least some kind of a

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.740 
way up to one or at least some kind of a
higher<00:01:52.590> value<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.220> then<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.119> i<00:01:54.240> need<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.600> at

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
higher value and then if i need to at

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.940 
higher value and then if i need to at
some<00:01:54.869> point<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.170> time<00:01:55.200> i<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.530> always<00:01:55.649> come<00:01:55.860> in

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
some point in time i can always come in

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.429 
some point in time i can always come in
and<00:01:56.100> add<00:01:56.189> any<00:01:56.880> ambience<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:58.200> doesn't

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
and add any ambience but just doesn't

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.719 
and add any ambience but just doesn't
matter<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.680> personal<00:01:58.860> preference<00:01:59.219> i<00:01:59.430> kind<00:01:59.700> of

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
matter of personal preference i kind of

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.620 
matter of personal preference i kind of
like<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.000> start<00:02:00.270> with<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:02.990> ok<00:02:04.040> now<00:02:05.630> let's

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
like to start with this ok now let's

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.080 
like to start with this ok now let's
start<00:02:06.950> by<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:08.369> kind<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.580> setting<00:02:08.849> up<00:02:08.970> our

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
start by just kind of setting up our

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.850 
start by just kind of setting up our
basic<00:02:09.479> light<00:02:09.690> source<00:02:09.899> because<00:02:10.259> as<00:02:10.649> i

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
basic light source because as i

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.229 
basic light source because as i
mentioned<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.250> some<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.489> our<00:02:11.550> earlier<00:02:11.910> lessons

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
mentioned in some of our earlier lessons

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.000 
mentioned in some of our earlier lessons
it's<00:02:12.870> really<00:02:13.200> really<00:02:13.500> important<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:13.890> we

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
it's really really important that we

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.770 
it's really really important that we
get<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.129> decent<00:02:14.430> idea<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:15.060> how<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.239> lighting<00:02:15.659> is

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
get a decent idea of how the lighting is

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.649 
get a decent idea of how the lighting is
affecting<00:02:16.349> these<00:02:16.950> objects<00:02:17.489> or<00:02:17.610> these<00:02:17.819> volumes

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
affecting these objects or these volumes

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.589 
affecting these objects or these volumes
before<00:02:19.110> we<00:02:19.230> start<00:02:19.439> to<00:02:19.530> get<00:02:19.650> too<00:02:19.920> far<00:02:20.159> into<00:02:20.220> the

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
before we start to get too far into the

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.720 
before we start to get too far into the
manipulation<00:02:21.599> of<00:02:21.659> that<00:02:21.780> volume<00:02:22.049> material<00:02:22.730> so

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
manipulation of that volume material so

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.949 
manipulation of that volume material so
I'll<00:02:23.849> start<00:02:24.000> by<00:02:24.120> just<00:02:24.180> selecting<00:02:24.390> my<00:02:24.689> default

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
I'll start by just selecting my default

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.410 
I'll start by just selecting my default
light<00:02:25.110> press<00:02:25.829> H<00:02:26.099> on<00:02:26.430> my<00:02:26.519> keyboard<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.970> unhide

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
light press H on my keyboard to unhide

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.009 
light press H on my keyboard to unhide
it<00:02:27.480> here<00:02:28.170> in<00:02:28.409> the<00:02:28.439> viewport<00:02:29.750> switch<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.900> my

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
it here in the viewport switch to my

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.600 
it here in the viewport switch to my
rotate<00:02:31.560> tool<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:34.110> what<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:34.920> want<00:02:35.099> to<00:02:35.159> try<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.430> do

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
rotate tool and what I want to try to do

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.910 
rotate tool and what I want to try to do
is<00:02:35.819> kind<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.299> get<00:02:36.450> this<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.720> where<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.079> kind<00:02:37.829> of

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
is kind of get this to where it kind of

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.740 
is kind of get this to where it kind of
looks<00:02:38.069> like<00:02:38.099> these<00:02:38.310> clouds<00:02:38.610> are<00:02:38.730> being<00:02:38.940> sort

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
looks like these clouds are being sort

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.440 
looks like these clouds are being sort
of<00:02:39.810> lit<00:02:40.109> from<00:02:40.349> behind<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:42.030> I'll<00:02:42.120> try<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.299> get

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
of lit from behind so I'll try to get

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.479 
of lit from behind so I'll try to get
this<00:02:42.569> light<00:02:42.810> sort<00:02:43.049> of<00:02:43.109> shining<00:02:43.470> from<00:02:44.220> back

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
this light sort of shining from back

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:51.649 
this light sort of shining from back
behind<00:02:44.700> here<00:02:48.200> there<00:02:49.200> we<00:02:49.349> go<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:50.569> with<00:02:51.569> this

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
behind here there we go and with this

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:52.940 
behind here there we go and with this
light<00:02:51.840> selected<00:02:52.170> I'll<00:02:52.260> press<00:02:52.440> enter<00:02:52.769> on<00:02:52.799> my

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
light selected I'll press enter on my

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.539 
light selected I'll press enter on my
keyboard<00:02:53.720> turn<00:02:54.720> on<00:02:54.900> shadows<00:02:58.190> take<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> quick

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
keyboard turn on shadows take a quick

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.740 
keyboard turn on shadows take a quick
render<00:02:59.790> let's<00:03:00.000> see<00:03:00.090> what<00:03:00.180> we<00:03:00.299> have<00:03:02.450> okay<00:03:03.450> so

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
render let's see what we have okay so

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.270 
render let's see what we have okay so
looks<00:03:04.139> like<00:03:04.200> we<00:03:04.440> could<00:03:04.560> probably<00:03:04.739> stand<00:03:05.129> to

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
looks like we could probably stand to

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.250 
looks like we could probably stand to
bring<00:03:05.670> these<00:03:05.819> shadows<00:03:06.150> down<00:03:06.329> a<00:03:06.359> little<00:03:06.510> bit<00:03:06.659> we

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
bring these shadows down a little bit we

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.830 
bring these shadows down a little bit we
aren't<00:03:07.500> actually<00:03:07.620> are<00:03:08.250> getting<00:03:09.060> some<00:03:09.420> decent

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
aren't actually are getting some decent

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.210 
aren't actually are getting some decent
illumination<00:03:10.349> on<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.620> back<00:03:10.829> side<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.099> this

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
illumination on the back side of this

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.979 
illumination on the back side of this
cloud<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:12.120> reason<00:03:12.389> is<00:03:12.510> because<00:03:12.540> the

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
cloud and the reason is because the

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.809 
cloud and the reason is because the
shadows<00:03:13.200> have<00:03:13.590> by<00:03:14.040> default<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.489> pretty<00:03:14.639> high

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
shadows have by default a pretty high

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.879 
shadows have by default a pretty high
Umbra<00:03:15.239> setting<00:03:15.599> which<00:03:15.930> allows<00:03:16.379> these<00:03:16.560> shadows

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
Umbra setting which allows these shadows

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.770 
Umbra setting which allows these shadows
to<00:03:17.010> have<00:03:17.159> a<00:03:17.190> little<00:03:17.370> bit<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.549> kind<00:03:18.329> of<00:03:18.389> opacity

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
to have a little bit of kind of opacity

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.689 
to have a little bit of kind of opacity
to<00:03:19.139> them<00:03:19.290> now<00:03:20.129> if<00:03:20.190> we<00:03:20.280> were<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.430> bring<00:03:20.549> this

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
to them now if we were to bring this

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.220 
to them now if we were to bring this
Umbra<00:03:21.090> all<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.480> way<00:03:21.569> down<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.750> zero<00:03:22.049> you<00:03:22.139> can

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
Umbra all the way down to zero you can

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.720 
Umbra all the way down to zero you can
see<00:03:22.440> we<00:03:22.560> get<00:03:22.889> these<00:03:22.980> really<00:03:23.310> really<00:03:23.609> intense

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
see we get these really really intense

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.680 
see we get these really really intense
dark<00:03:24.690> shadows<00:03:25.139> and<00:03:25.319> in<00:03:26.069> my<00:03:26.160> case<00:03:26.239> that's<00:03:27.239> not

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
dark shadows and in my case that's not

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.330 
dark shadows and in my case that's not
quite<00:03:27.959> what<00:03:28.139> I'm<00:03:28.379> looking<00:03:28.410> for<00:03:30.889> so<00:03:31.889> let's

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
quite what I'm looking for so let's

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.849 
quite what I'm looking for so let's
maybe<00:03:32.489> start<00:03:32.849> with<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:33.329> number<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:33.989> point<00:03:34.470> 5<00:03:34.650> or

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
maybe start with a number of point 5 or

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.670 
maybe start with a number of point 5 or
point<00:03:35.040> 6<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.599> can<00:03:36.720> see<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:36.930> we<00:03:37.530> get<00:03:37.650> a

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
point 6 so you can see that we get a

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.439 
point 6 so you can see that we get a
relatively<00:03:38.669> decent<00:03:38.760> amount<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.299> illumination

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
relatively decent amount of illumination

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.629 
relatively decent amount of illumination
on<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.959> back<00:03:40.230> side<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.530> this<00:03:40.739> cloud<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.400> it

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
on the back side of this cloud and it

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:42.500 
on the back side of this cloud and it
really<00:03:41.760> just<00:03:41.819> sort<00:03:42.060> of<00:03:42.120> saves<00:03:42.299> us<00:03:42.389> the<00:03:42.419> trouble

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
really just sort of saves us the trouble

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.970 
really just sort of saves us the trouble
having<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:43.019> use<00:03:43.109> any<00:03:43.290> kind<00:03:43.410> of<00:03:43.500> additional

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
having to use any kind of additional

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.720 
having to use any kind of additional
fill<00:03:44.250> lights<00:03:44.489> for<00:03:44.940> this<00:03:45.030> particular<00:03:45.480> scene

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
fill lights for this particular scene

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.500 
fill lights for this particular scene
all<00:03:47.730> right<00:03:47.879> now<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.030> feel<00:03:48.239> like<00:03:48.359> my

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
all right now I feel like my

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.259 
all right now I feel like my
illuminations<00:03:49.019> a<00:03:49.169> little<00:03:49.470> bit<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.829> a<00:03:50.129> week<00:03:50.970> so

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
illuminations a little bit to a week so

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.729 
illuminations a little bit to a week so
I'm<00:03:51.359> going<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.510> just<00:03:51.720> begin<00:03:52.049> by<00:03:52.379> taking<00:03:52.560> this

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
I'm going to just begin by taking this

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.649 
I'm going to just begin by taking this
intensity<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.639> you<00:03:53.669> bring<00:03:53.849> this<00:03:53.970> up<00:03:56.359> so<00:03:57.359> as<00:03:57.510> we

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
intensity and you bring this up so as we

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.689 
intensity and you bring this up so as we
start<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.959> render<00:03:58.169> this<00:03:58.290> out<00:03:58.549> see<00:03:59.549> we<00:03:59.669> have

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
start to render this out see we have

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.909 
start to render this out see we have
kind<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.060> these<00:04:00.180> backlit<00:04:00.599> clouds<00:04:00.900> with<00:04:01.560> just<00:04:01.829> a

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
kind of these backlit clouds with just a

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.890 
kind of these backlit clouds with just a
little<00:04:02.220> bit<00:04:02.370> of<00:04:02.609> shadow<00:04:02.909> detail<00:04:03.209> on<00:04:03.599> the

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
little bit of shadow detail on the

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.129 
little bit of shadow detail on the
underside<00:04:05.299> all<00:04:06.299> right<00:04:06.449> now<00:04:06.569> i<00:04:06.599> might<00:04:06.780> go<00:04:06.930> ahead

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
underside all right now i might go ahead

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.339 
underside all right now i might go ahead
and<00:04:07.319> create<00:04:07.709> sort<00:04:08.010> of<00:04:08.069> a<00:04:08.190> sky<00:04:08.849> type<00:04:09.840> background

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
and create sort of a sky type background

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.479 
and create sort of a sky type background
of<00:04:10.440> this<00:04:10.530> because<00:04:10.739> right<00:04:11.010> now<00:04:11.040> it<00:04:11.280> is<00:04:11.370> just

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
of this because right now it is just

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.030 
of this because right now it is just
sort<00:04:11.669> of<00:04:11.699> rendering<00:04:12.030> out<00:04:12.150> black<00:04:12.419> so<00:04:13.260> quick<00:04:13.919> and

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
sort of rendering out black so quick and

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.610 
sort of rendering out black so quick and
easy<00:04:14.190> way<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:15.239> do<00:04:15.359> this<00:04:15.510> we<00:04:15.989> can<00:04:16.109> drop<00:04:16.260> in<00:04:16.440> just

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
easy way to do this we can drop in just

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.509 
easy way to do this we can drop in just
something<00:04:16.829> like<00:04:16.949> a<00:04:17.539> polygon<00:04:18.539> sphere<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:20.280> take

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
something like a polygon sphere and take

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.620 
something like a polygon sphere and take
this<00:04:20.639> and<00:04:20.880> scale<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.090> out<00:04:21.269> until<00:04:21.479> it

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
this and scale it out until it

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.659 
this and scale it out until it
encompasses<00:04:21.959> pretty<00:04:22.469> much<00:04:23.250> everything<00:04:23.580> in

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
encompasses pretty much everything in

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.890 
encompasses pretty much everything in
the<00:04:23.729> scene<00:04:24.380> let's<00:04:25.380> go<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.590> model

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
the scene let's go to model

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.379 
the scene let's go to model
get<00:04:27.380> material<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:28.030> again<00:04:29.030> we'll<00:04:29.180> give<00:04:29.300> this

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
get material and again we'll give this

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.230 
get material and again we'll give this
something<00:04:29.660> like<00:04:29.690> a<00:04:29.810> constant<00:04:30.229> material<00:04:30.620> i

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
something like a constant material i

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.310 
something like a constant material i
find<00:04:32.240> this<00:04:32.300> is<00:04:32.449> a<00:04:32.479> pretty<00:04:32.720> good<00:04:32.870> material<00:04:33.259> to

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
find this is a pretty good material to

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.040 
find this is a pretty good material to
use<00:04:33.380> for<00:04:33.500> things<00:04:34.009> like<00:04:34.070> sky<00:04:34.460> or<00:04:35.180> any<00:04:35.780> kind<00:04:35.930> of<00:04:35.990> a

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
use for things like sky or any kind of a

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.420 
use for things like sky or any kind of a
background<00:04:36.320> where<00:04:36.680> we<00:04:36.889> don't<00:04:37.130> really<00:04:37.310> need

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
background where we don't really need

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.830 
background where we don't really need
there<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:37.639> be<00:04:37.729> any<00:04:37.940> sort<00:04:38.060> of<00:04:38.180> highlight<00:04:38.630> or

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
there to be any sort of highlight or

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.870 
there to be any sort of highlight or
shadow<00:04:39.169> detail<00:04:39.440> just<00:04:39.860> a<00:04:39.949> nice<00:04:40.160> flat<00:04:40.580> color<00:04:42.880> now

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
shadow detail just a nice flat color now

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.129 
shadow detail just a nice flat color now
what<00:04:44.060> we'll<00:04:44.180> probably<00:04:44.389> see<00:04:44.690> whenever<00:04:44.900> we

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
what we'll probably see whenever we

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.890 
what we'll probably see whenever we
rented<00:04:45.440> this<00:04:45.530> is<00:04:45.800> a<00:04:46.699> very<00:04:47.240> very<00:04:47.539> different

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
rented this is a very very different

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.570 
rented this is a very very different
result<00:04:48.350> now<00:04:48.470> you<00:04:48.530> can<00:04:48.740> see<00:04:48.860> these<00:04:48.979> clouds<00:04:49.280> have

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
result now you can see these clouds have

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.090 
result now you can see these clouds have
really<00:04:50.090> started<00:04:50.240> to<00:04:50.509> change<00:04:50.750> color<00:04:50.960> and<00:04:51.259> the

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
really started to change color and the

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.279 
really started to change color and the
reason<00:04:52.370> for<00:04:52.400> that<00:04:52.520> is<00:04:52.759> that<00:04:52.850> by<00:04:53.479> default<00:04:53.660> this

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
reason for that is that by default this

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.770 
reason for that is that by default this
sphere<00:04:54.740> is<00:04:54.919> actually<00:04:55.430> blocking<00:04:56.300> out<00:04:56.570> any

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
sphere is actually blocking out any

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.749 
sphere is actually blocking out any
shadows<00:04:57.229> that<00:04:57.470> are<00:04:58.039> coming<00:04:58.280> from<00:04:58.370> this<00:04:58.520> light

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
shadows that are coming from this light

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.510 
shadows that are coming from this light
from<00:04:59.060> this<00:04:59.240> infinite<00:04:59.870> light<00:05:00.100> so<00:05:01.100> let's<00:05:01.370> select

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
from this infinite light so let's select

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.820 
from this infinite light so let's select
the<00:05:01.699> sphere<00:05:01.970> go<00:05:02.930> into<00:05:03.410> the<00:05:03.500> selection

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
the sphere go into the selection

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
the sphere go into the selection
explored<00:05:04.160> take<00:05:04.340> a<00:05:04.370> look<00:05:04.520> inside<00:05:04.729> the

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
explored take a look inside the

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.500 
explored take a look inside the
visibility<00:05:06.610> so<00:05:07.610> it<00:05:07.820> over<00:05:08.090> in<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.210> rendering

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
visibility so it over in the rendering

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.960 
visibility so it over in the rendering
tab<00:05:08.990> let's<00:05:09.289> go<00:05:09.440> into<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:09.860> shadow<00:05:10.100> and<00:05:10.340> tell<00:05:10.850> it

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
tab let's go into the shadow and tell it

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.180 
tab let's go into the shadow and tell it
not<00:05:11.449> to<00:05:11.510> cast<00:05:11.930> or<00:05:12.139> receive<00:05:12.470> any<00:05:12.500> shadows<00:05:12.979> that

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
not to cast or receive any shadows that

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.370 
not to cast or receive any shadows that
way<00:05:14.120> any<00:05:14.270> shadows<00:05:14.539> should<00:05:14.780> now<00:05:14.900> pass<00:05:15.139> right

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
way any shadows should now pass right

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.010 
way any shadows should now pass right
through<00:05:15.440> the<00:05:15.680> sphere<00:05:15.949> and<00:05:16.810> there<00:05:17.810> we<00:05:17.930> go

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
through the sphere and there we go

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.159 
through the sphere and there we go
that's<00:05:18.320> much<00:05:18.530> better<00:05:19.690> all<00:05:20.690> right<00:05:20.840> so<00:05:21.020> we're

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
that's much better all right so we're

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.469 
that's much better all right so we're
off<00:05:21.320> to<00:05:21.560> a<00:05:21.770> relatively<00:05:22.580> decent<00:05:22.669> start<00:05:23.150> with

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
off to a relatively decent start with

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.990 
off to a relatively decent start with
this<00:05:23.660> cloud<00:05:24.500> bank<00:05:24.770> so<00:05:25.400> what<00:05:25.610> will<00:05:25.699> start<00:05:25.849> to<00:05:25.910> do

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
this cloud bank so what will start to do

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.430 
this cloud bank so what will start to do
in<00:05:26.120> our<00:05:26.210> next<00:05:26.360> lesson<00:05:26.539> is<00:05:26.870> begin<00:05:27.199> the<00:05:27.259> process

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
in our next lesson is begin the process

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.230 
in our next lesson is begin the process
of<00:05:27.710> coming<00:05:27.919> in<00:05:28.099> and<00:05:28.310> now<00:05:28.729> beginning<00:05:29.150> to

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
of coming in and now beginning to

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.450 
of coming in and now beginning to
actually<00:05:29.720> build<00:05:29.990> out<00:05:30.259> some<00:05:30.620> different

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
actually build out some different

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.370 
actually build out some different
fractals<00:05:32.030> and<00:05:32.180> starting<00:05:32.720> to<00:05:32.810> combine<00:05:33.110> a<00:05:33.139> few

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
fractals and starting to combine a few

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.480 
fractals and starting to combine a few
different<00:05:33.440> textures<00:05:33.949> so<00:05:34.099> that<00:05:34.220> we<00:05:34.340> can

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
different textures so that we can

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.010 
different textures so that we can
actually<00:05:34.580> start<00:05:34.789> to<00:05:34.970> control<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.539> density

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
actually start to control the density

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.960 
actually start to control the density
and<00:05:36.169> get<00:05:36.979> a<00:05:37.010> lot<00:05:37.250> more<00:05:37.400> control<00:05:37.669> over<00:05:37.760> the

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
and get a lot more control over the

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.390 
and get a lot more control over the
overall<00:05:38.270> shape<00:05:38.300> of<00:05:38.810> this<00:05:39.199> cloud<00:05:39.470> Bank<00:05:39.710> so

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
overall shape of this cloud Bank so

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.740 
overall shape of this cloud Bank so
we'll<00:05:40.639> continue<00:05:40.820> this<00:05:41.060> process<00:05:41.240> in<00:05:41.539> our<00:05:41.630> next

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
we'll continue this process in our next

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.930 
we'll continue this process in our next
lesson
