let's whoa we almost looped out that was

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.300 
let's whoa we almost looped out that was
potentially<00:03:33.780> disaster<00:03:34.680> but<00:03:34.830> it<00:03:34.980> was<00:03:35.130> not

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.449 
because I did not move out quite yet
real<00:03:39.360> that<00:03:39.660> burn<00:03:39.900> oh<00:03:40.880> there<00:03:41.880> he<00:03:42.180> stepped<00:03:42.600> down

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459

launched that not quite gonna grab the

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.080 
launched that not quite gonna grab the
triple<00:03:46.860> I<00:03:46.980> think<00:03:47.220> I'm<00:03:47.400> still<00:03:47.670> got<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.880> pretty

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
triple I think I'm still got a pretty

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.729 
triple I think I'm still got a pretty
sizable<00:03:48.780> weed<00:03:49.110> though<00:03:49.380> so<00:03:49.590> I'm<00:03:49.739> ok<00:03:50.190> with<00:03:50.220> this

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
sizable weed though so I'm ok with this

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.640 
sizable weed though so I'm ok with this
and<00:03:52.739> we<00:03:53.730> shouldn't<00:03:54.150> go<00:03:54.330> on<00:03:54.390> her<00:03:54.480> nice<00:03:54.750> I<00:03:55.110> think

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
and we shouldn't go on her nice I think

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.170 
and we shouldn't go on her nice I think
there<00:03:55.800> might<00:03:56.190> be<00:03:56.250> some<00:03:56.610> ruts<00:03:56.790> starting<00:03:57.120> to

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
there might be some ruts starting to

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.120 
there might be some ruts starting to
develop<00:03:57.270> I<00:03:57.480> don't<00:03:57.660> know<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:58.200> can't<00:03:58.770> really<00:03:58.890> tell

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130

gets<00:05:17.360> corner<00:05:17.810> faster<00:05:18.200> case<00:05:19.190> that<00:05:19.520> I<00:05:19.730> think

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
gets corner faster case that I think

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.550 
gets corner faster case that I think
either<00:05:20.570> case<00:05:20.840> I<00:05:20.960> worked<00:05:21.110> out<00:05:21.260> I'm<00:05:21.380> not<00:05:21.530> really

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
either case I worked out I'm not really
