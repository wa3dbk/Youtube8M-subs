00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.630
 few could imagine that the company 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.910
 popcap authors arcade hit plan 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.390
 top zombies will transfer their creation to 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.640
 3d 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.369
 Yes, and change the genre to cooperative 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.010
 shooter game screwed 3 requests 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.510
 added character customization modes 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.790
 the possibility of a full game for 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.970
 dead expired on called it all 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.129
 plans versus zombie garden warfare only 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.940
 But from this cooperative game, it is not 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.370
 it became both good and bad 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.740
 well since the authors have managed to keep 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.800
 the same spirit of the original arcade 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.590
 parts it is visible in all treason design 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.120
 zombie plants their ability to voice acting with 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.829
 this is what is happening 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.900
 I want to praise the game properly 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.940
 precisely for the totality of these 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.120
 the factors that spilled out wonderful 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.120
 the atmosphere 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.660
 garden warfare looks amazing on 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.759
 The third is a simple byte, although you can 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.640
 destroy not all the picture all 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.979
 equal excellent bright paint effects and 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.960
 funny animation models but bad 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.909
 it's all exactly the same reason 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.070
 wanted a normal cooperative they 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.090
 just transfer a two-dimensional arcade to 3d 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.830
 for those who want to play the original but he 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.900
 engine there is a separate mode when 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.880
 need to fend off several waves of zombies 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.280
 and then escape the flying van 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.930
 Dave's all crazy for everyone else 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.390
 go over standard modes for 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.700
 cooperative shooter defmatch and grabs 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.400
 points or bomb transportation and here 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.020
 there it turns out that garden warfare 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.390
 practically does not have a cooperative 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.150
 frankly completely incomprehensible 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.280
 how is there to do it yes there is a standard 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.590
 a bunch of medical classes plus someone else 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.540
 and even then only plants have a zombie doctor 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.729
 a scientist can only scatter on the ground 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.500
 counterparts dispensers from team fortress and 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.180
 everything else on the battlefield 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.890
 there is a natural fight 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.920
 resembling military battles from 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.899
 history textbooks 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.240
 everyone is running somewhere ahead they are bombarded 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.100
 dough for this answers die hard result 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.900
 win those who responded faster and 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.390
 crushed by the number of the enemy the whole team play 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.640
 is that the player with good 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.860
 soul can revive you on the battlefield 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.230
 true in a second both gamers can 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.390
 die from the shots of the enemies in time 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.739
 but then with the revival of the team mate 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.390
 keep shooting this is a definite plus 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.880
 what is happening at this time in the report 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.430
 can be described in one word some chaos 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.250
 other sounds music children's voices 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.780
 and almost all foreign I mean this 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.760
 no one even thinks in ice 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.830
 cooperate the same team fortress 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.050
 even in the very noob topic is always possible 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.790
 was yelling at people and more or less 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.890
 fellow for the decisive shot 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.390
 although there are similar moments here 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.500
 only they occur during the regime 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.810
 capture points and nowhere else is that 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.489
 the most long gone feeling when you're in 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.180
 companies of several people hold 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.819
 defense 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.549
 or storming the post around the explosion 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.410
 smoke pipes it throw someone raise 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.829
 immediately they fire at you and you spit on 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.930
 everything 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.090
 you throw an ally to save yourself 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.459
 or throw a suicide grenade in th 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.880
 little face here it is all there and looks 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.880
 very cool 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.700
 the game has a similar situation with 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.860
 playability I mean there is like 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.780
 pros and cons popcap decided 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.390
 problem with a small number of classes 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.830
 with the help of hats, strange as it is 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.020
 was but it worked 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.060
 the essence of the system is that for each 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.920
 class there is a challenge to perform 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.230
 who raises kissed that same 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.470
 class and overall player level 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.790
 which is in fact no matter what no effect 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.040
 character level opens new 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.690
 each has three abilities as well 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.400
 gives the right to the loss of class 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.870
 boosters are most often domestic 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.730
 turn out cosmetic items 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.650
 so if you want to pump 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.050
 existing class or open new 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.630
 will have to buy more expensive booster 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.150
 packs the first time i was naturally proud 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.370
 politics i and system developers all 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.930
 kits could only be bought for 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.420
 game Coin who no problem 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.220
 stuffed for everything from 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.109
 killing enemies or their traps and up 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.910
 victories in the round but joy lasted 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.640
 not long before the game was introduced 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.890
 buying coins for real money is 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.930
 not really ruined the balance 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.730
 which here and so was not so hot but led 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.330
 to the emergence of a large number of players with 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.200
 new varieties of classes and guns 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.550
 that generally represents 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.590
 alternative classes 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.600
 This modelki with new skins and slightly 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.040
 modified by primary weapon for example 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.620
 default pea shoots solitary 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.760
 large shells and its variation scorches 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.070
 fraction and vice versa 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.870
 Zombie Soldier Solve all petty queues 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.980
 and in alternative mode it shoots where 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.540
 as accurate but in bursts of three to five bullets 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.490
 there are three slots for each class 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.590
 improvements that pump passive 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.940
 abilities still alternative proteins 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.950
 changing active skills 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.230
 the first are any increase 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.210
 speed clips a to second variation 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.250
 saved trap or shooting 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.900
 for example, a zombie soldier can be put 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.360
 shooting one powerful charge 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.360
 rocket launcher or replace it with a string 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.340
 shots of a smaller radius and damage all 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.410
 it falls out of the same boosters which gives 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.419
 some advantages to players with large 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.470
 wallet 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.300
 it turns out that on the one hand me 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.310
 makes play a desire to open everything 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.080
 classes and improvements but on the other I 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.550
 I perfectly understand that as soon as I do it 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.720
 made the game instantly lose the lionâ€™s share 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.730
 the irises are the main problem in 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.560
 the result is a plan on top with a zombie garden 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.990
 warfare turned out one of the most 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.850
 controversial games this year in it 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.650
 It turns out to play long but small 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.180
 doses of several boy each 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.100
 in the evening she looks great 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.840
 another thing is that at this time you 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.710
 absolutely not feeling among 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.630
 live players 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.610
 simply no feedback from them 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.500
 all my too 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.540
 part of the round I do the challenge for the sake of 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.220
 future varnishes and every time I think 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.440
 comes the same question how do 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.950
 long live the game on my hardy after 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.440
 how everything will be open popcap 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.880
 made an incredibly bright and fun game 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.170
 which leaves ambiguous 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.420
 impression 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.940
 but what exactly you can say is 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.860
 what the cooperative year gardanova fair 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.020
 don't see her banally missing 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.730
 deep multiplayer gameplay and 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.860
 mechanics classes just 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.750
 and the interaction is minimally short 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.970
 skirmishes leads to recall various 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.040
 Korean games are the most important 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.230
 the rule is which of the two players before 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.160
 I saw the enemy and pressed the button 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.900
 and I won it all with you 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.060
 joker keep watching me 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:47.490
