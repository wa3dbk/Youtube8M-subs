these two sisters this story definitely
gets<00:02:22.970> very<00:02:23.150> twisted<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.050> kind<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.260> dark<00:02:24.620> it's

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
gets very twisted and kind of dark it's

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.220 
gets very twisted and kind of dark it's
not<00:02:25.550> scary<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.120> wouldn't<00:02:26.360> say<00:02:26.450> it's<00:02:26.600> scary<00:02:26.930> but

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
not scary I wouldn't say it's scary but

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.450 
not scary I wouldn't say it's scary but
it<00:02:27.380> has<00:02:27.590> a<00:02:27.790> ominous<00:02:28.790> dark<00:02:29.300> tone<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.620> I

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
it has a ominous dark tone to it and I

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.910 
it has a ominous dark tone to it and I
think<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.270> name<00:02:32.780> fits<00:02:33.050> it<00:02:33.230> perfectly<00:02:33.260> it's

think the name fits it perfectly it's

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.220 
think the name fits it perfectly it's
definitely<00:02:34.490> a<00:02:34.520> story<00:02:34.850> of<00:02:35.090> twisted<00:02:35.540> fate<00:02:35.750> my

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
definitely a story of twisted fate my

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.500 
definitely a story of twisted fate my

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.260 
I usually do like multiple point of view
stories<00:02:48.320> but<00:02:48.980> these<00:02:49.430> point<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.820> views<00:02:50.060> were

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
stories but these point of views were

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.060 
stories but these point of views were
very<00:02:50.630> confusing<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.680> feel<00:02:51.860> like<00:02:51.980> they

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
very confusing and I feel like they

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.520 
very confusing and I feel like they
didn't<00:02:52.280> really<00:02:52.400> stick<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.600> their<00:02:54.050> point<00:02:54.410> of

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
didn't really stick to their point of

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.770 
didn't really stick to their point of
view<00:02:54.709> like<00:02:54.920> if<00:02:55.130> it<00:02:55.520> said<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:55.970> was<00:02:56.209> Sydney's

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
view like if it said it was Sydney's

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.479 
view like if it said it was Sydney's
point<00:02:57.050> of<00:02:57.140> view<00:02:57.350> I<00:02:57.380> felt<00:02:57.739> like<00:02:57.830> we<00:02:57.980> also<00:02:58.280> got

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
point of view I felt like we also got

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.979 
point of view I felt like we also got
the<00:02:58.640> point<00:02:58.850> of<00:02:58.970> view<00:02:59.090> of<00:02:59.239> other<00:02:59.450> people<00:02:59.810> and

the point of view of other people and

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.810 
the point of view of other people and
not<00:03:00.080> just<00:03:00.140> Sydney<00:03:00.739> so<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.280> was<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.430> little<00:03:01.640> weird

a<00:03:02.180> little<00:03:02.680> disorienting<00:03:03.680> at<00:03:03.800> times<00:03:04.070> maybe<00:03:04.489> it

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
a little disorienting at times maybe it

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.699

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
was supposed to be like that because the

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.140 
was supposed to be like that because the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.100 
what was gonna happen in the end but I
think<00:03:22.610> that's<00:03:22.790> just<00:03:22.850> because<00:03:23.269> I've<00:03:23.750> read<00:03:24.080> a

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
think that's just because I've read a

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.400 
think that's just because I've read a
few<00:03:24.200> books<00:03:24.709> like<00:03:25.040> this<00:03:25.280> one<00:03:25.489> before<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:26.299> it<00:03:27.290> was

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
few books like this one before so it was

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.340 
few books like this one before so it was
a<00:03:27.440> little<00:03:28.040> a<00:03:28.370> little<00:03:28.549> predictable<00:03:29.209> but<00:03:29.390> if<00:03:29.780> you

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
a little a little predictable but if you

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.170 
a little a little predictable but if you
don't<00:03:30.530> typically<00:03:30.830> read<00:03:31.190> books<00:03:31.459> like<00:03:31.640> this<00:03:31.880> I

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
don't typically read books like this I

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.820 
don't typically read books like this I
think<00:03:32.299> it<00:03:32.510> would<00:03:32.630> take<00:03:32.660> you<00:03:32.780> by<00:03:33.019> surprise<00:03:33.049> and

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
think it would take you by surprise and

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.070 
think it would take you by surprise and
it<00:03:34.190> is<00:03:34.340> a<00:03:34.370> good<00:03:34.700> ending<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.209> is<00:03:35.330> a<00:03:35.360> good<00:03:35.630> twist<00:03:35.900> I

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
it is a good ending it is a good twist I

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.050 
it is a good ending it is a good twist I
think<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:36.320> was<00:03:36.440> done<00:03:36.620> well<00:03:36.860> but<00:03:37.280> it<00:03:37.400> also<00:03:37.580> left

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
think it was done well but it also left

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.060 
think it was done well but it also left
me<00:03:38.269> a<00:03:38.299> little<00:03:38.570> confused<00:03:39.140> again<00:03:39.380> this<00:03:39.860> whole

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
me a little confused again this whole

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.030 
me a little confused again this whole

at<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.459> same<00:03:43.670> time<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.299> I<00:03:44.660> was<00:03:45.110> kind<00:03:45.320> of<00:03:45.380> mixed

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
at the same time and I was kind of mixed

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.350 
at the same time and I was kind of mixed
on<00:03:45.769> my<00:03:45.920> feelings<00:03:46.130> about<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.549> because<00:03:47.000> it

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
on my feelings about it because it

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.729 
on my feelings about it because it
entertained<00:03:47.870> me<00:03:48.080> like<00:03:48.290> I<00:03:48.350> couldn't<00:03:48.650> stop

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
entertained me like I couldn't stop

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.410 
entertained me like I couldn't stop
reading<00:03:49.040> it<00:03:49.280> but<00:03:49.670> I<00:03:49.700> didn't<00:03:50.090> think<00:03:50.239> that

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
reading it but I didn't think that

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.600 
reading it but I didn't think that

that<00:06:21.720> they<00:06:22.020> form<00:06:22.410> so<00:06:22.740> there's<00:06:23.010> a<00:06:23.100> few

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
that they form so there's a few

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.770

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.580 
and I think it definitely kept the plot
moving<00:06:26.730> at<00:06:27.060> a<00:06:27.090> fast<00:06:27.570> pace<00:06:27.750> I<00:06:28.200> didn't<00:06:28.410> really

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
moving at a fast pace I didn't really
