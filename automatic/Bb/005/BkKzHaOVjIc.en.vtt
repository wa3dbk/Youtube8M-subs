like<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.930> board<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.740> think<00:01:53.369> its<00:01:53.520> nine<00:01:54.450> plies<00:01:54.990> or

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
like the board I think its nine plies or

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.459 
like the board I think its nine plies or
something<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.009> don't<00:01:56.430> know<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.850> but<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
something I don't know it is but it the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.310 
something I don't know it is but it the
the<00:01:59.310> design<00:01:59.700> has<00:01:59.939> fiberglass<00:02:00.600> over<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the design has fiberglass over it so the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.010 
the design has fiberglass over it so the
design<00:02:01.469> won't<00:02:01.860> scratch<00:02:02.100> off<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.810> you

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
design won't scratch off but if you you

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.319 
design won't scratch off but if you you
might<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.290> might<00:02:04.320> if<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:05.180> rub<00:02:06.180> it
