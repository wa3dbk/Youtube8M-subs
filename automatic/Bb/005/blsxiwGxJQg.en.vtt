I<00:03:52.299> feel<00:03:52.419> about<00:03:52.780> this<00:03:53.139> but<00:03:53.410> some<00:03:53.650> people

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:53.949 
I feel about this but some people

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:57.689

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
probably like it the way he does because

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.319 
probably like it the way he does because
I<00:03:57.910> mean<00:03:58.150> this<00:03:58.299> is<00:03:58.629> a<00:03:58.660> pancake<00:03:59.319> style<00:03:59.859> sheath

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329

those two pieces of Kydex put together

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.960 
those two pieces of Kydex put together

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
and he puts he bends a little thumb ramp

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.780 
and he puts he bends a little thumb ramp
on<00:04:07.329> it<00:04:07.949> kind<00:04:08.949> of<00:04:09.010> like<00:04:09.129> you<00:04:09.280> would<00:04:09.370> normally

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:17.670 
have with the taco style sheet
I<00:04:13.919> guess<00:04:14.919> it's<00:04:15.129> I<00:04:15.310> guess<00:04:15.489> I<00:04:15.639> like<00:04:15.879> it<00:04:16.090> I<00:04:17.019> mean<00:04:17.560> it

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
I guess it's I guess I like it I mean it

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.509 
I guess it's I guess I like it I mean it

feels good
pushing<00:04:18.970> off<00:04:19.090> but<00:04:19.599> generally<00:04:20.470> speaking<00:04:20.500> with

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
pushing off but generally speaking with

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.820 
pushing off but generally speaking with
with<00:04:22.030> kayaks<00:04:22.539> I<00:04:22.840> don't<00:04:23.229> think<00:04:23.470> you<00:04:23.590> really

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
with kayaks I don't think you really

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.070 
with kayaks I don't think you really
need<00:04:24.039> that<00:04:24.280> I<00:04:24.610> mean<00:04:25.300> if<00:04:25.419> it<00:04:25.570> was<00:04:25.659> over<00:04:25.810> here<00:04:26.050> on

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
need that I mean if it was over here on

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.690 
need that I mean if it was over here on
the<00:04:26.289> other<00:04:26.320> side<00:04:26.740> I<00:04:26.770> could<00:04:26.979> just<00:04:27.310> as<00:04:27.639> easily

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
the other side I could just as easily

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.050 
the other side I could just as easily
push<00:04:28.419> off<00:04:28.630> of<00:04:28.659> that

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
push off of that

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.790 
push off of that
and<00:04:30.180> and<00:04:30.570> it<00:04:30.720> would<00:04:30.840> look<00:04:30.990> nice<00:04:31.230> and<00:04:31.530> uniform

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
and and it would look nice and uniform

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.159 
and and it would look nice and uniform
so<00:04:32.310> I'm<00:04:32.430> kind<00:04:32.669> of<00:04:32.730> on<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:32.940> fence<00:04:33.150> about<00:04:33.360> how<00:04:33.750> I

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
so I'm kind of on the fence about how I

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.250 
so I'm kind of on the fence about how I
feel<00:04:35.070> about<00:04:35.310> this<00:04:35.610> but<00:04:35.940> as<00:04:36.090> far<00:04:36.330> as<00:04:36.480> him<00:04:36.840> doing

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
think with my pancakes though I just

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.860 
think with my pancakes though I just
performed<00:04:44.850> a<00:04:44.940> look<00:04:45.090> a<00:04:45.180> little<00:04:45.330> bit<00:04:45.480> more

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
performed a look a little bit more

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.020 
performed a look a little bit more
uniform<00:04:46.169> and<00:04:46.680> I<00:04:46.770> can<00:04:46.950> push<00:04:47.160> off<00:04:47.370> of<00:04:47.580> it<00:04:47.669> just<00:04:47.700> as

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
uniform and I can push off of it just as

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.990 
uniform and I can push off of it just as
easily<00:04:48.240> but<00:04:49.230> overall<00:04:49.710> I've<00:04:50.040> been<00:04:50.280> IDI<00:04:50.580> seeing

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
easily but overall I've been IDI seeing

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.670 
easily but overall I've been IDI seeing
this<00:04:51.180> knife<00:04:51.480> for<00:04:52.550> about<00:04:53.550> two<00:04:53.820> weeks<00:04:54.680> sometimes

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
this knife for about two weeks sometimes

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.120 
this knife for about two weeks sometimes
I<00:04:56.070> rotate<00:04:56.520> in<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:56.820> Genesis<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.810> gns<00:04:58.380> but

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
I rotate in the Genesis and the gns but

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.330 
I rotate in the Genesis and the gns but
this<00:04:59.310> one<00:04:59.550> in<00:04:59.700> particular<00:05:00.389> is<00:05:00.510> just<00:05:00.889> it<00:05:01.889> the

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
this one in particular is just it the

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.040 
this one in particular is just it the
bushcrafter<00:05:03.030> is<00:05:03.090> a<00:05:03.120> little<00:05:03.330> smaller<00:05:03.660> I<00:05:03.960> want

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
bushcrafter is a little smaller I want

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.190 
bushcrafter is a little smaller I want
to<00:05:04.290> say<00:05:04.410> it's<00:05:04.530> a<00:05:04.590> four<00:05:04.860> inch<00:05:05.040> blade<00:05:05.780> it's<00:05:06.780> it's

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
to say it's a four inch blade it's it's

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.740 
to say it's a four inch blade it's it's
it's<00:05:07.440> just<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.680> perfect<00:05:07.950> size<00:05:08.160> for<00:05:08.310> EDC<00:05:08.820> so<00:05:09.720> I

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
it's just the perfect size for EDC so I

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.070 
it's just the perfect size for EDC so I
really<00:05:10.229> like<00:05:10.410> this<00:05:10.680> one<00:05:10.919> and<00:05:11.810> the<00:05:12.810> sheath

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
really like this one and the sheath

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.500 
really like this one and the sheath
looks<00:05:13.350> nice<00:05:13.590> it's<00:05:14.040> nice<00:05:14.220> that<00:05:14.610> I've<00:05:14.940> got<00:05:15.240> a

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
looks nice it's nice that I've got a

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.400 
looks nice it's nice that I've got a
Ferro<00:05:15.870> rod<00:05:15.930> on<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.919> sheath<00:05:17.160> I've<00:05:17.490> got<00:05:17.669> a

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
Ferro rod on the sheath I've got a

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.469 
Ferro rod on the sheath I've got a
redundant<00:05:19.410> light<00:05:19.590> source<00:05:19.950> on<00:05:20.250> the<00:05:20.520> sheath<00:05:20.760> it

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
redundant light source on the sheath it

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.830 
redundant light source on the sheath it
looks<00:05:21.780> cool<00:05:22.110> it's<00:05:22.979> not<00:05:23.160> too<00:05:23.430> big<00:05:23.729> so<00:05:24.540> that's

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
looks cool it's not too big so that's

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.930 
looks cool it's not too big so that's
why<00:05:25.080> this<00:05:25.320> one<00:05:25.530> has<00:05:25.680> been<00:05:25.919> getting<00:05:26.310> IDI<00:05:26.580> seed

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
why this one has been getting IDI seed

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.360 
why this one has been getting IDI seed
probably<00:05:27.660> more<00:05:27.900> than<00:05:28.110> any<00:05:28.380> of<00:05:28.530> my<00:05:28.560> other<00:05:28.710> fixed

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
probably more than any of my other fixed

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.760 
probably more than any of my other fixed
blades<00:05:29.610> here<00:05:29.880> recently<00:05:30.120> and<00:05:30.600> the<00:05:31.440> smaller

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
blades here recently and the smaller

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.010 
blades here recently and the smaller
knives<00:05:32.070> the<00:05:32.490> smaller<00:05:32.760> bushcraft<00:05:33.300> knife<00:05:33.540> is

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
knives the smaller bushcraft knife is

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.440 
knives the smaller bushcraft knife is
just<00:05:34.460> it's<00:05:35.460> really<00:05:35.640> comfortable<00:05:36.180> to<00:05:36.300> do

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
just it's really comfortable to do

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.240 
just it's really comfortable to do
things<00:05:36.750> you<00:05:37.080> know<00:05:37.169> bushcraft<00:05:37.710> II<00:05:37.890> with<00:05:38.039> it

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
things you know bushcraft II with it

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.980 
things you know bushcraft II with it
it's<00:05:38.669> not<00:05:38.820> too<00:05:39.060> big<00:05:39.330> I<00:05:39.690> really<00:05:40.470> like<00:05:41.990> that

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
it's not too big I really like that

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.650 
it's not too big I really like that
little<00:05:43.380> indentation<00:05:44.070> for<00:05:44.729> the<00:05:44.820> index<00:05:45.180> finger

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
little indentation for the index finger

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.170 
little indentation for the index finger
so<00:05:45.990> I<00:05:46.050> have<00:05:46.320> something<00:05:46.680> similar<00:05:46.890> on<00:05:47.550> my<00:05:47.850> chest

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
so I have something similar on my chest

so I have something similar on my chest
Nick<00:05:48.390> I<00:05:48.510> just<00:05:48.539> like<00:05:49.260> the<00:05:49.440> way<00:05:49.470> that<00:05:49.770> it<00:05:49.860> feels

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
Nick I just like the way that it feels

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.400

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
but as far as the sheath goes I think

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.550
