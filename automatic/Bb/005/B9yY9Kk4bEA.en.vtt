also you don't want to go that you don't
want<00:01:32.820> too<00:01:33.060> deep<00:01:33.210> because<00:01:33.330> you<00:01:33.509> don't<00:01:33.659> want<00:01:33.780> to

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
want too deep because you don't want to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.450 
want too deep because you don't want to
go<00:01:33.930> fall<00:01:34.140> through<00:01:34.439> or<00:01:34.619> too<00:01:34.979> large<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.369> they'll

fall<00:01:35.580> through<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:35.909> then<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.119> kind<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.299> defeats

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
fall through and then it kind of defeats

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.179 
fall through and then it kind of defeats
the<00:01:36.659> purpose<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.140> little<00:01:37.320> little<00:01:37.979> jig

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the purpose of this little little jig

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.649 
the purpose of this little little jig
here<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:39.060> what<00:01:39.150> we're<00:01:39.240> going<00:01:39.330> to<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.509> we're

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
here so what we're going to do we're

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.179 
here so what we're going to do we're
going<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.810> mark<00:01:40.020> about<00:01:40.380> every<00:01:40.799> two<00:01:40.950> inches

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
going to mark about every two inches

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.620 
going to mark about every two inches
we're<00:01:41.340> gonna<00:01:41.460> mark<00:01:41.580> a<00:01:41.670> hole<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.119> drill<00:01:42.299> six

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
we're gonna mark a hole and drill six

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.020 
we're gonna mark a hole and drill six
holes<00:01:42.810> right<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:46.759> hopefully<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.850> part

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
holes right here hopefully this part

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.249 
holes right here hopefully this part
will<00:01:48.119> be<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.240> fast<00:01:48.450> motion<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:48.990> got<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
will be in fast motion so you got the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:58.420 
will be in fast motion so you got the
block<00:01:49.409> control<00:01:49.770> six<00:01:49.979> holes

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430

years<00:02:24.190> old<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.700> suppose<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.239> then<00:02:25.810> what<00:02:26.020> I

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
years old I suppose and then what I

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.690 
years old I suppose and then what I
think<00:02:26.110> is<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.440> most<00:02:26.590> important<00:02:26.980> part<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.340> dis

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
think is the most important part is dis

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.970 
think is the most important part is dis
otter<00:02:27.910> we<00:02:28.660> use<00:02:28.840> simply<00:02:29.230> just<00:02:29.380> use<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.590> Radio

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
otter we use simply just use a Radio

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
a solder this is the one I would use I'm

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.740 
a solder this is the one I would use I'm
sure<00:02:45.640> there<00:02:45.819> are<00:02:45.850> hundreds<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.450> others<00:02:46.660> that

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
sure there are hundreds of others that

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.240 
sure there are hundreds of others that
work<00:02:46.900> out<00:02:47.080> there<00:02:47.260> but<00:02:47.500> this<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:47.980> one<00:02:48.100> we

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
work out there but this is the one we

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.880 
work out there but this is the one we
use<00:02:48.430> right<00:02:48.580> here<00:02:49.410> well<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:50.530> what<00:02:50.650> we're<00:02:50.769> going

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
use right here well so what we're going

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.880 
use right here well so what we're going
to<00:02:50.920> do<00:02:51.100> is<00:02:51.450> we're<00:02:52.450> going<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.630> take<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.319> hot<00:02:53.680> the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
to do is we're going to take the hot the

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.220 
to do is we're going to take the hot the
heat<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:54.880> we're<00:02:55.390> going<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.569> heat<00:02:55.870> up<00:02:55.900> the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
heat and we're going to heat up the

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.479 
heat and we're going to heat up the
outside<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:58.709> bullet<00:02:59.709> connector<00:03:00.069> here<00:03:00.250> and

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
outside of the bullet connector here and

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.220 
outside of the bullet connector here and
what<00:03:01.330> that's<00:03:01.510> going<00:03:01.630> to<00:03:01.690> do<00:03:01.840> it's<00:03:02.049> going<00:03:02.110> to

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
what that's going to do it's going to

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.199 
what that's going to do it's going to
basically<00:03:02.380> heat<00:03:03.370> this<00:03:03.549> whole<00:03:03.700> area<00:03:04.000> up<00:03:04.090> and

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
basically heat this whole area up and

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.940 
basically heat this whole area up and
then<00:03:04.299> we're<00:03:04.450> going<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.600> fill<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:05.080> little<00:03:05.170> cup

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
then we're going to fill the little cup

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.270 
then we're going to fill the little cup
if<00:03:06.100> you<00:03:06.220> will<00:03:06.370> up<00:03:06.819> with<00:03:07.030> solder<00:03:07.530> again<00:03:08.530> we'll

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
if you will up with solder again we'll

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.100 
if you will up with solder again we'll
put<00:03:09.310> our<00:03:09.580> heat<00:03:09.730> on<00:03:09.910> there<00:03:10.090> let<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:10.840> get<00:03:10.989> nice

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
put our heat on there let it get nice

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.410 
put our heat on there let it get nice
and<00:03:11.170> hot<00:03:11.519> I'll<00:03:12.519> try<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.760> let<00:03:12.940> this<00:03:13.030> one<00:03:13.180> see

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
and hot I'll try to let this one see

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:22.600 
and hot I'll try to let this one see
here

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
this is be tough for the camera can see

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.820 
this is be tough for the camera can see
here<00:03:24.860> but<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:25.910> get<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.180> idea<00:03:26.530> we're<00:03:27.530> going<00:03:27.650> to

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
here but you get the idea we're going to

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.780 
here but you get the idea we're going to
feather<00:03:28.010> sucker<00:03:28.370> up

when your cut like I didn't do here is

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.150 
when your cut like I didn't do here is
you<00:05:44.480> make<00:05:44.630> sure<00:05:44.660> your<00:05:44.960> lines<00:05:45.260> are<00:05:45.500> your<00:05:45.890> cuts

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
you make sure your lines are your cuts

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.370 
you make sure your lines are your cuts
which<00:05:46.310> are<00:05:46.460> square<00:05:47.120> if<00:05:47.330> you<00:05:47.870> have<00:05:48.050> them<00:05:48.200> off

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
which are square if you have them off

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.540 
which are square if you have them off
you're<00:05:48.800> going<00:05:48.920> to<00:05:48.980> have<00:05:49.040> definitely<00:05:49.430> have

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
you're going to have definitely have

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.730 
you're going to have definitely have
some<00:05:49.730> exposure<00:05:50.060> so<00:05:50.780> if<00:05:51.080> you<00:05:51.230> have<00:05:51.410> a<00:05:51.440> square

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
some exposure so if you have a square

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.530 
some exposure so if you have a square
side<00:05:52.070> always<00:05:52.370> keep<00:05:52.550> that<00:05:52.670> up<00:05:52.820> and<00:05:53.060> the<00:05:53.150> bottom

side always keep that up and the bottom

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.670 
side always keep that up and the bottom
side<00:05:53.660> you<00:05:53.720> could<00:05:53.900> be<00:05:53.990> off<00:05:54.110> a<00:05:54.140> little<00:05:54.260> bit<00:05:54.500> so

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
side you could be off a little bit so

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.350 
side you could be off a little bit so
what<00:05:55.370> I<00:05:55.400> like<00:05:55.550> to<00:05:55.610> do<00:05:55.760> is<00:05:55.910> make<00:05:56.120> sure<00:05:56.150> it's

right up to the top or right below the

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.930 
right up to the top or right below the
springs<00:06:00.160> and<00:06:01.160> we'll<00:06:01.310> get<00:06:01.430> the<00:06:01.520> other<00:06:01.640> two<00:06:01.790> on

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
springs and we'll get the other two on

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.770 
springs and we'll get the other two on
here<00:06:06.130> and<00:06:07.130> here's<00:06:07.430> our<00:06:07.550> big<00:06:07.790> log<00:06:08.090> one<00:06:08.330> I'll<00:06:08.660> let

you look what that one looks like this
is<00:06:09.950> actually<00:06:10.160> gonna<00:06:10.250> call<00:06:10.370> most<00:06:10.520> cover<00:06:10.700> the

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
is actually gonna call most cover the

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.190 
is actually gonna call most cover the
whole<00:06:10.970> wire<00:06:11.150> here<00:06:13.690> this<00:06:14.690> one's<00:06:14.930> a<00:06:14.990> little

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
whole wire here this one's a little

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.650 
whole wire here this one's a little
painting<00:06:15.410> it<00:06:15.530> on<00:06:15.590> to<00:06:16.000> okay<00:06:17.000> so<00:06:17.300> right<00:06:17.480> below

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660 
painting it on to okay so right below

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.060 
painting it on to okay so right below
the<00:06:17.780> springs<00:06:18.050> we<00:06:18.230> have<00:06:18.320> all<00:06:18.440> three<00:06:18.680> and<00:06:18.920> now

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
the springs we have all three and now

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.040 
the springs we have all three and now
it's<00:06:19.220> time<00:06:19.400> to<00:06:19.430> get<00:06:19.670> our<00:06:19.790> heat<00:06:20.000> gun<00:06:20.030> we<00:06:20.930> have<00:06:20.960> a

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
it's time to get our heat gun we have a

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.300 
it's time to get our heat gun we have a
heat<00:06:21.260> gun<00:06:21.350> I'm<00:06:21.560> sure<00:06:21.680> you<00:06:21.770> can<00:06:21.890> use<00:06:21.980> a<00:06:22.010> lighter

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
heat gun I'm sure you can use a lighter

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.520 
heat gun I'm sure you can use a lighter
you<00:06:22.730> can<00:06:22.910> use<00:06:23.120> just<00:06:23.750> about<00:06:23.900> anything<00:06:24.170> what<00:06:24.500> you

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
you can use just about anything what you

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.620 
you can use just about anything what you
can<00:06:24.770> do<00:06:24.890> but<00:06:25.340> I<00:06:25.400> would<00:06:25.610> recommend<00:06:26.330> is<00:06:26.420> wait<00:06:26.600> for

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
can do but I would recommend is wait for

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.540 
can do but I would recommend is wait for
the<00:06:27.020> wires<00:06:27.230> and<00:06:27.470> the<00:06:27.890> bullet<00:06:28.190> characters<00:06:28.430> to

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
the wires and the bullet characters to

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.010 
the wires and the bullet characters to
cool<00:06:28.700> down<00:06:28.880> after<00:06:29.150> your<00:06:29.390> solder<00:06:29.570> them<00:06:29.780> because

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
cool down after your solder them because

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.900 
cool down after your solder them because
if<00:06:30.620> you<00:06:30.680> put<00:06:30.860> them<00:06:30.920> on<00:06:31.040> too<00:06:31.190> quick<00:06:31.430> and<00:06:31.640> it's

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
if you put them on too quick and it's

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.100 
if you put them on too quick and it's
not<00:06:32.030> in<00:06:32.120> perfect<00:06:32.570> position<00:06:32.660> it<00:06:33.050> will

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
not in perfect position it will

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.270 
not in perfect position it will
definitely<00:06:33.380> will<00:06:33.680> shrink<00:06:33.860> on<00:06:33.980> you<00:06:34.100> and<00:06:34.190> then

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
definitely will shrink on you and then

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.920 
definitely will shrink on you and then
you<00:06:34.370> have<00:06:34.400> a<00:06:34.550> heat<00:06:35.270> shrink<00:06:35.420> that's<00:06:35.600> a<00:06:35.750> boy

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
you have a heat shrink that's a boy

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.380 
you have a heat shrink that's a boy
stuck<00:06:36.230> on<00:06:36.380> the<00:06:36.530> on<00:06:37.040> the<00:06:37.160> wire<00:06:37.370> which<00:06:37.580> is<00:06:37.610> pain

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390 
stuck on the on the wire which is pain

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.520 
stuck on the on the wire which is pain
if<00:06:38.570> you<00:06:38.660> get<00:06:38.780> it<00:06:38.870> cut<00:06:38.990> it<00:06:39.080> off<00:06:39.170> and<00:06:39.320> basically

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.530 
if you get it cut it off and basically

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.740 
if you get it cut it off and basically
redo<00:06:40.160> the<00:06:40.280> sugar<00:06:40.490> up<00:06:40.610> so<00:06:41.240> what<00:06:41.330> we<00:06:41.420> have<00:06:41.540> here

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
redo the sugar up so what we have here

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.990 
redo the sugar up so what we have here
we<00:06:41.900> just<00:06:42.020> have<00:06:42.200> our<00:06:42.620> shrink<00:06:43.010> wrap<00:06:43.190> exactly

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
we just have our shrink wrap exactly

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.820 
we just have our shrink wrap exactly
where<00:06:44.150> I<00:06:44.180> left<00:06:44.210> the<00:06:44.360> earlier<00:06:44.660> this<00:06:45.350> part<00:06:45.620> is

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
where I left the earlier this part is

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.810 
where I left the earlier this part is
really<00:06:46.310> simple

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
really simple

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.340 
really simple
you<00:06:47.000> just<00:06:47.150> leave<00:06:47.300> it<00:06:47.330> on<00:06:47.480> and<00:06:47.720> like<00:06:48.200> you<00:06:48.320> just

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
you just leave it on and like you just

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.930 
you just leave it on and like you just
hold<00:06:48.590> it<00:06:48.740> hold<00:06:49.010> it<00:06:49.160> down<00:06:49.310> make<00:06:49.640> sure<00:06:49.670> doesn't

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
hold it hold it down make sure doesn't

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.490 
hold it hold it down make sure doesn't
go<00:06:50.060> anywhere<00:06:50.300> with<00:06:50.420> the<00:06:50.510> wind<00:06:50.690> but<00:06:51.260> turn<00:06:51.470> the

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500 
go anywhere with the wind but turn the

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.930 
go anywhere with the wind but turn the
heat<00:06:51.740> on

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.170 

give<00:06:57.940> it<00:06:58.030> a<00:06:58.060> little<00:06:59.640> curl<00:07:00.640> around<00:07:00.790> to<00:07:01.090> the

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:01.180 
give it a little curl around to the

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.390 
give it a little curl around to the
other<00:07:01.240> side

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.850 

and<00:07:06.300> wallah<00:07:06.480> we<00:07:07.260> are<00:07:07.380> done<00:07:07.530> with<00:07:07.710> our<00:07:08.000> motor

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860 
and wallah we are done with our motor

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.930 
and wallah we are done with our motor
there<00:07:10.860> is<00:07:10.889> our<00:07:11.070> motor<00:07:11.280> there<00:07:11.610> are<00:07:11.730> bullet

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:11.940 
there is our motor there are bullet

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.540 
there is our motor there are bullet
connectors<00:07:12.770> it<00:07:13.770> took<00:07:13.919> us<00:07:14.040> probably<00:07:14.070> what

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.550 
connectors it took us probably what

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.520 
connectors it took us probably what
about<00:07:14.790> five<00:07:15.060> minutes<00:07:15.270> to<00:07:15.419> do<00:07:15.479> that<00:07:15.690> and<00:07:16.260> it's<00:07:16.470> a

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.530 
about five minutes to do that and it's a

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.050 
about five minutes to do that and it's a
professional<00:07:17.040> look<00:07:17.220> and<00:07:17.310> we<00:07:17.460> also<00:07:17.610> made<00:07:17.880> their

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 
professional look and we also made their

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.700 
professional look and we also made their
little<00:07:18.210> jig<00:07:18.479> okay<00:07:19.110> we<00:07:19.320> have<00:07:19.440> the<00:07:19.530> speed

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:19.710 
little jig okay we have the speed

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.290 
little jig okay we have the speed

the<00:07:23.130> speed<00:07:23.400> controller<00:07:23.729> I<00:07:23.820> like<00:07:24.090> to<00:07:24.210> if<00:07:24.479> you

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:24.510 
the speed controller I like to if you

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.540 
the speed controller I like to if you
can<00:07:24.720> see<00:07:24.870> here<00:07:25.080> I<00:07:25.260> like<00:07:25.710> to<00:07:25.889> keep<00:07:26.070> the<00:07:26.280> the

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:26.550 
can see here I like to keep the the

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.950 
can see here I like to keep the the
shrink-wrap<00:07:26.910> all<00:07:27.180> the<00:07:27.270> way<00:07:27.330> to<00:07:27.389> the<00:07:27.540> very<00:07:27.690> tip

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960 
shrink-wrap all the way to the very tip

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.150 
shrink-wrap all the way to the very tip
because<00:07:28.169> what<00:07:28.290> happens<00:07:28.620> you<00:07:28.710> don't<00:07:28.830> leave<00:07:29.070> an

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 
because what happens you don't leave an

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.520 
because what happens you don't leave an
idea<00:07:29.460> these<00:07:29.639> is<00:07:29.790> to<00:07:29.910> keep<00:07:30.120> the<00:07:30.720> gold

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:31.530 
idea these is to keep the gold

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.379 
idea these is to keep the gold
connectors<00:07:31.919> not<00:07:32.280> to<00:07:32.460> touch<00:07:32.639> the<00:07:32.880> shrinkage<00:07:33.210> so

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:33.389 
connectors not to touch the shrinkage so

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:34.790 
connectors not to touch the shrinkage so
if<00:07:33.449> you<00:07:33.570> have<00:07:33.690> a<00:07:33.720> tux<00:07:34.020> you<00:07:34.110> can<00:07:34.290> short<00:07:34.500> that<00:07:34.680> out

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 
if you have a tux you can short that out

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.710 
if you have a tux you can short that out
but<00:07:35.070> so<00:07:35.490> I<00:07:35.520> like<00:07:35.639> to<00:07:35.729> keep<00:07:35.850> mine<00:07:36.060> extra-long

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 
but so I like to keep mine extra-long

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.330 
but so I like to keep mine extra-long
and<00:07:36.960> sometimes<00:07:37.229> I<00:07:37.380> if<00:07:37.620> you<00:07:37.770> can<00:07:37.889> see<00:07:38.040> here<00:07:38.220> I'd

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:38.340 
and sometimes I if you can see here I'd

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.180 
and sometimes I if you can see here I'd
even<00:07:38.490> like<00:07:38.760> overhang<00:07:39.180> them<00:07:39.740> and<00:07:40.740> what<00:07:40.950> you<00:07:41.070> do

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:41.190 
even like overhang them and what you do

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.379 
even like overhang them and what you do
you<00:07:41.220> simply<00:07:41.729> just<00:07:41.940> get<00:07:42.090> them<00:07:42.180> all<00:07:42.270> together

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:42.389 
you simply just get them all together

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:45.680 
you simply just get them all together
and<00:07:42.750> you<00:07:42.990> just<00:07:43.020> plug<00:07:43.290> them<00:07:43.440> in<00:07:43.590> and<00:07:44.540> I'd<00:07:45.540> the

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:45.690 
and you just plug them in and I'd the

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.659
