00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
work up the height and I pretty much

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.880 
work up the height and I pretty much
used<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.910> mini-map<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> align<00:01:03.930> my<00:01:04.229> arrow<00:01:04.530> with

the<00:01:10.170> beauty<00:01:10.680> about<00:01:10.770> using<00:01:11.280> recon<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.850> your

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
the beauty about using recon to your

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.880 
the beauty about using recon to your
advantage<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.350> use<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.500> stun

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
advantage is that if you use a stun

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.380 
advantage is that if you use a stun
grenade<00:01:14.040> as<00:01:14.400> well<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.880> hits<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> target

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
grenade as well and it hits the target

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.179 
grenade as well and it hits the target
it<00:01:15.720> makes<00:01:15.900> them<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.170> much<00:01:16.409> slower<00:01:16.680> target

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
it makes them a much slower target

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.740 
it makes them a much slower target
therefore<00:01:17.670> easier<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.240> hit<00:01:18.420> with<00:01:18.600> that

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
therefore easier to hit with that

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.450 
therefore easier to hit with that

invisible inside on the target

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.600 
invisible inside on the target
take<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> look<00:02:01.049> at<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.229> clip<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.770> throw<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> stun

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
take a look at this clip I throw a stun

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.310 
take a look at this clip I throw a stun
grenade<00:02:02.939> right<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> air<00:02:03.540> there<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.990> get<00:02:04.290> a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
grenade right in the air there I get a

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.350 
grenade right in the air there I get a
hit<00:02:04.560> marker<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.040> obviously<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.939> enemy<00:02:06.299> should

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
hit marker so obviously the enemy should

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.479 
hit marker so obviously the enemy should
be<00:02:06.719> around<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.200> area<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.710> cuz<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> stun

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
be around that area and cuz the stun

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.190 
be around that area and cuz the stun
grenade<00:02:08.789> slowed<00:02:09.060> them<00:02:09.209> down<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.660> increased<00:02:10.140> my

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
grenade slowed them down it increased my

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.420 
grenade slowed them down it increased my
chance<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.709> actually<00:02:10.890> hitting<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.430> target<00:02:11.849> as

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
chance of actually hitting the target as

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.800 
chance of actually hitting the target as
