going to show you how it rides so yeah
frame<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.890> everything<00:02:38.069> is<00:02:38.430> fine<00:02:38.670> built<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.239> or

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
frame and everything is fine built in or

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.550 
frame and everything is fine built in or

seat because it's so much easy to remove

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.479 
seat because it's so much easy to remove
the<00:02:53.519> seed<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:53.970> know<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.330> can<00:02:54.660> remove<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.080> seed

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
the seed you know I can remove the seed

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.430 
the seed you know I can remove the seed
less<00:02:56.489> than<00:02:56.730> like<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.180> 50-second<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:58.019> can<00:02:58.200> remove

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
less than like a 50-second I can remove

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.190 
less than like a 50-second I can remove
it<00:02:58.620> as<00:02:59.190> far<00:02:59.459> as<00:02:59.940> far<00:03:00.180> as<00:03:00.269> my<00:03:00.390> Bashar<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.959> zero

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
it as far as far as my Bashar that zero

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.289 
it as far as far as my Bashar that zero
is<00:03:01.319> concerned<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:01.830> know<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.459> seed<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:03.060> can

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
is concerned you know the seed I can

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.699 
is concerned you know the seed I can
remove<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.660> seed<00:03:03.840> but<00:03:03.930> it's<00:03:04.080> quite<00:03:04.230> difficult

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
remove the seed but it's quite difficult

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.210 
remove the seed but it's quite difficult
it<00:03:05.430> takes<00:03:05.880> some<00:03:06.209> like<00:03:06.500> four<00:03:07.500> five<00:03:07.709> minutes<00:03:07.890> not

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
it takes some like four five minutes not

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.729 
it takes some like four five minutes not
to<00:03:08.370> reason<00:03:08.549> to<00:03:08.880> remove<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.599> seed<00:03:09.810> but<00:03:10.530> here

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
to reason to remove the seed but here

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.589 
to reason to remove the seed but here
and<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:10.980> really<00:03:11.310> like<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.610> seed<00:03:11.849> and<00:03:12.030> these

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
and I really like the seed and these

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.949 
and I really like the seed and these
know<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.590> can<00:03:13.769> see<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.099> that<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:15.330> the
