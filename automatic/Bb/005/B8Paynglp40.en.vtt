yeah<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.619> thought<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.890> episode<00:01:59.280> kind<00:01:59.459> of

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
yeah and I thought this episode kind of

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.559 
yeah and I thought this episode kind of
also<00:01:59.670> showed<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.090> little<00:02:00.330> bit<00:02:00.420> more

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
also showed a little bit more

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.149

characterization<00:02:01.319> of<00:02:01.350> Shikamaru<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:01.979> how

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
characterization of Shikamaru and how

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.399 
characterization of Shikamaru and how
great<00:02:02.429> of<00:02:02.459> a<00:02:02.640> leader<00:02:02.850> he<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.479> while<00:02:03.929> he'll

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
great of a leader he is and while he'll

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.469 
great of a leader he is and while he'll
probably<00:02:04.709> never<00:02:05.220> really<00:02:05.580> be<00:02:05.700> Hokage<00:02:06.179> because

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
probably never really be Hokage because

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.999 
probably never really be Hokage because
not<00:02:06.780> only<00:02:06.810> do<00:02:07.080> you<00:02:07.170> need<00:02:07.289> to<00:02:07.380> be<00:02:07.530> smart<00:02:07.890> and

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
wise and tactician 'el and fair he's

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.780 
wise and tactician 'el and fair he's
just<00:02:10.229> good<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.769> mind<00:02:11.009> but<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.459> also<00:02:11.580> need

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
just good in the mind but you also need

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.130 
just good in the mind but you also need

to back the strength with that as well

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.660

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
but he would definitely make a great

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.000 
but he would definitely make a great

Obito<00:04:08.400> she<00:04:08.580> should<00:04:08.700> be<00:04:08.760> feeling<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:09.120> certain

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
Obito she should be feeling a certain

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.480 
Obito she should be feeling a certain
way<00:04:09.450> about<00:04:09.750> his<00:04:09.960> teacher<00:04:10.290> so<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:11.010> anime<00:04:11.370> is

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
in that aspect yeah you can't really

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.240 
in that aspect yeah you can't really
blame<00:04:36.810> him<00:04:37.200> to<00:04:37.380> a<00:04:37.410> certain<00:04:37.740> degree<00:04:37.860> but
