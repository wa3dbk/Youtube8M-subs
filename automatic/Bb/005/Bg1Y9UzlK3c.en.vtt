00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
doing a review of this app now basically

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.500 
doing a review of this app now basically
what<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.649> app<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.040> called<00:00:44.219> as<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.510> action

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
what this app is called as a action

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.360 
what this app is called as a action
movie<00:00:45.780> an<00:00:45.989> action<00:00:46.500> movie<00:00:46.620> basically<00:00:47.129> allows

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
movie an action movie basically allows

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.139 
movie an action movie basically allows
you<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.579> apply<00:00:48.149> some<00:00:48.590> filters<00:00:49.610> 3d<00:00:50.610> filters<00:00:51.000> I

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
you to apply some filters 3d filters I

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.209 
you to apply some filters 3d filters I
guess<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.510> kind<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.809> complicated<00:00:52.559> adds<00:00:53.039> a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
guess is kind of complicated adds a

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.049 
guess is kind of complicated adds a
little<00:00:53.460> bit<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:54.149> CGI<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> mix<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.850> made

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
little bit of CGI to the mix it is made

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.990 
little bit of CGI to the mix it is made
by<00:00:57.090> bad<00:00:57.780> robot<00:00:58.340> interactive<00:00:59.340> which<00:00:59.699> are<00:00:59.879> is

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
by bad robot interactive which are is

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000 
by bad robot interactive which are is
basically<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.870> guys<00:01:01.050> who<00:01:01.320> brought<00:01:01.559> us<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010

lost series on television and basically
it's<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.720> really<00:01:06.810> simple<00:01:07.369> CGI<00:01:08.369> sort<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.000> effect

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
it's a really simple CGI sort of effect

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.700 
it's a really simple CGI sort of effect
as<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.840> see<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.110> has<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.320> couple<00:01:11.570> stock<00:01:12.710> effects

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.999 
but we can just go back here and we're
gonna<00:01:23.670> look<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.750> main<00:01:24.990> ones<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.770> video

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
gonna look at the main ones the video

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.710 
gonna look at the main ones the video
that<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.220> made<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.580> actually<00:01:26.700> used<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.540> effect

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that I made it actually used this effect

car smash

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.790 
car smash
and<00:01:30.670> basically<00:01:30.940> once<00:01:31.750> you<00:01:31.870> have<00:01:31.990> head<00:01:32.140> start

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
and basically once you have head start

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.270 
and basically once you have head start
it<00:01:33.670> will<00:01:34.000> load<00:01:34.450> up<00:01:34.480> the<00:01:34.660> thing<00:01:35.010> and<00:01:36.010> it<00:01:36.190> will

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
it will load up the thing and it will

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.460 
it will load up the thing and it will
activate<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:37.270> camera<00:01:37.630> so<00:01:38.760> using<00:01:39.760> camera<00:01:40.180> here

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
activate the camera so using camera here

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.510 
activate the camera so using camera here
you're<00:01:41.470> not<00:01:41.560> going<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:41.800> be<00:01:41.890> able<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.070> see<00:01:42.310> this

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
you're not going to be able to see this

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.010 
you're not going to be able to see this
very<00:01:42.850> well<00:01:43.150> and<00:01:43.390> I'm<00:01:43.570> running<00:01:43.750> for<00:01:43.960> the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
very well and I'm running for the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.500 
very well and I'm running for the
battery<00:01:44.380> but<00:01:45.010> I<00:01:45.190> just<00:01:45.430> have<00:01:45.670> a<00:01:45.880> little<00:01:46.150> bit<00:01:46.300> up

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
battery but I just have a little bit up

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.130 
battery but I just have a little bit up
off<00:01:46.780> camera<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:47.920> recorded<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.840> I'm<00:01:49.960> just

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
off camera and recorded so I'm just

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.340 
off camera and recorded so I'm just
going<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.440> record<00:01:50.860> some<00:01:51.100> footage<00:01:51.130> of<00:01:51.640> that

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
going to record some footage of that

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.850 
going to record some footage of that
like<00:01:53.350> so<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:55.450> once<00:01:55.720> you're<00:01:55.870> done<00:01:55.900> it<00:01:56.380> requires

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
like so and once you're done it requires

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.380 
like so and once you're done it requires
at<00:01:57.040> least<00:01:57.070> five<00:01:57.550> seconds<00:01:58.000> so<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:58.180> just

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
at least five seconds so you just

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
it the free price is only temporary so

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.789 
it the free price is only temporary so
if<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.510> really<00:02:37.780> like<00:02:37.930> this<00:02:38.080> app<00:02:38.320> you<00:02:38.769> should

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
if you really like this app you should

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.440 
if you really like this app you should
really<00:02:39.190> jump<00:02:39.430> into<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.700> app<00:02:39.820> store<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.209> get

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
really jump into the app store and get

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.470 
really jump into the app store and get
it<00:02:40.600> while<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.200> can

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
it while you can

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.789 
it while you can
personally<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:43.510> think<00:02:43.630> it's<00:02:43.930> kind<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.380> gimmicky

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
personally I think it's kind of gimmicky

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.320 
personally I think it's kind of gimmicky
but<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.040> does<00:02:45.190> have<00:02:45.370> potential<00:02:45.760> like<00:02:46.090> they

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
but it does have potential like they

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.380 
but it does have potential like they
allow<00:02:46.570> others<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.290> add<00:02:47.739> their<00:02:48.010> own<00:02:48.250> 3d<00:02:48.820> CGI

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
allow others to add their own 3d CGI

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.140 
allow others to add their own 3d CGI
filters<00:02:49.870> this<00:02:50.350> could<00:02:50.739> have<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.220> lot<00:02:51.610> of

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
filters this could have a lot of

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.229 
filters this could have a lot of
potential<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.840> idea<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.290> has<00:02:53.880> at<00:02:54.880> least<00:02:55.060> a

potential the idea that has at least a

potential the idea that has at least a

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
little bit of motion tracking could go

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.300 
little bit of motion tracking could go
into<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.580> very<00:02:57.850> useful<00:02:58.150> pro<00:02:59.019> editing<00:02:59.530> suite<00:02:59.799> for
