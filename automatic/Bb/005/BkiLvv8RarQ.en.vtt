00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hey people there i am again i catch in 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.359
 this tutorial is a topic for me 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.790
 ever treated something like that and 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.160
 Although I got the question how to 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.790
 this box or these stones from this 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.410
 level here from dr 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.830
 After that, here you build, I see 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.480
 repent this stone and it flies away 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.300
 then I 'll continue this here 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.849
 whole stones here are free 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.830
 mobile and they all move in 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.080
 different directions and then come 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.950
 so here you can do that as well 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.120
 said push away 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.660
 why I have the video here again 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.820
 It is because the idea I had 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.890
 how to solve something that simple 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.850
 and not so moving 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.170
 that looked so similar but 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.059
 they were not free to move but 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.949
 have open a specific orbit 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.180
 moves if you watch the video then 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.949
 are you what I mean 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.010
 and now with the help of 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.649
 mister order get out or he has 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.500
 told me how to make such stones 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.299
 makes or well I do not think anymore 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.979
 I have this and that whole thing here 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.570
 prepared as I said the level here 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.450
 It's not mine, it's Munster 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.430
 order and here are two such stones 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.180
 I repent this stone and rises 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.189
 it's still good 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.000
 that the relatively fast out of the picture 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.280
 fly 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.810
 but we will be the same 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.490
 make things slower 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.920
 move 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.350
 So what's behind this first time this 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.640
 balls are different 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.130
 Politics and so composed 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.090
 Here I'll show you how to speak 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.340
 group these are very many small ones here 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.820
 here so politics he built so and 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.000
 a circle so beautiful again everything 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.110
 composed make heal 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.439
 ok and in the middle of this ball is a 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.380
 jet attached and which is located entirely 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.240
 up there when I go all the way up here 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.600
 much further up 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:09.629
 there is a jet that is now no 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.430
 I always have that john poole the 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.520
 is now on power 2 for example 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.860
 is set 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.160
 he just fixes that up and up 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.860
 he now draws this stone as it were 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.410
 up how to build the whole thing 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.060
 is actually quite easy I do 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.590
 this time away and show you 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.660
 So here you take the jet that is 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.560
 here at special items uhl and there 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.350
 movement jet then takes now 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.330
 a bit bigger so power 2 so he 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.780
 the thing also ten can here on the edge 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:47.260
 then put a job tool over it and 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.380
 if the joint tool yes here at the jet 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.900
 associated with this thread and in the 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.880
 In the middle you can see that 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:01.180
 Pull up so best here in the right 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.980
 angle so that the stone is not 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.540
 somehow uncontrolled by the 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.620
 area flies so now I have that time 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.860
 not so far away 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.110
 Now you might know if this is here now 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.850
 No more darling is here 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.250
 if not the favorite 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.959
 then he immediately picks up yes and 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.870
 otherwise wait until you have it once 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.360
 touched and yes then the stone flies 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.140
 away if you continue the thing here 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.310
 above does the effect is better 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.740
 and you have just seen that is 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.870
 in such a tilting motion to the side of the 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.060
 Not so much happens when he does that 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.610
 especially far away and besides 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.870
 you can not hear the jet anymore 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.550
 ok now I wanted to show how 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.040
 you can do that I slow down 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.530
 I am moving to break this first 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.360
 whole group here again and we are looking for 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.180
 the circle where everything is fixed 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.660
 here and there you can go up here 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.390
 Here you can adjust as I would 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.510
 So that's the poetry I'll do it 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.390
 I did not test that on 20 now 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.050
 then the thing is a good piece 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:08.200
 heavier so 20 times as hard 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:11.820
 and yes, the whole thing back to a group 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:17.070
 the turn of a jet on sleeping 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.070
 and yes this job still connect 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:27.600
 high with you and the thing here so 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:31.590
 Align a bit so yes that comes 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.060
 pixeln and of course the jet up 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.740
 sleeping zone 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.920
 We touch the thing and it falls 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.460
 just hard hard down so 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.200
 the jetta at 6 and it still falls 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.040
 downward 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:49.340
 ok madoff full full is full before 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.820
 booming to 10 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.300
 that shows me the thing is not fixed 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.620
 maybe that was it 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.460
 no, the whole shows me now 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.810
 that the thing with 20 is too heavy 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:09.090
 then we'll do the group again 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:15.030
 Do not go away and do not exaggerate 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:20.580
 on 59 tool again then here 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:24.660
 connect farm with you here the thing there 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.060
 Therefore it was up to the middle 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:32.180
 i forgot it out there yet 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.180
 group to make beginner mistakes 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.760
 okay that as a group very quickly 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.680
 I do not want it too long so 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:46.080
 the video takes so long here 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:48.090
 so you also still on the fixed 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.480
 ding here darling and look there 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:54.350
 Let's yes as you can see it goes 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.480
 not uphill so fast anymore 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.870
 and yes it is so slow off the good 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.220
 Things are so hard for me now 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.080
 not that easy to push in front of me 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.100
 can 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.150
 but if you like this a bit 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.860
 adjust a bit 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.200
 Fingertip feeling can be there nice 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.410
 create effects with now you see 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.120
 already that I penz the stone just so 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.740
 can move but if i am not 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.050
 touch then falls down 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.310
 and yes as I said if now in jet 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.950
 then he goes upstairs and hears that 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.770
 neither and that's all 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.960
 what is behind this level so more 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.250
 There is nothing to say about it 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.800
 I hope I could help you with that 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.790
 and then a lot of fun when rebuilding and 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.770
 See you 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.770
 on my last page
