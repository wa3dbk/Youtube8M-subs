mineral that has recently been found in
a<00:00:05.879> meteorite<00:00:06.450> that<00:00:06.480> crashed<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:07.140> earth

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.610 
a meteorite that crashed to earth

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.360 
a meteorite that crashed to earth
perhaps<00:00:08.610> fifteen<00:00:09.389> thousand<00:00:09.840> years<00:00:09.960> ago<00:00:10.370> and

perhaps fifteen thousand years ago and

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.860 
perhaps fifteen thousand years ago and
this<00:00:12.360> holds<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.380> one-of-a-kind<00:00:13.920> crystal<00:00:14.870> that

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
this holds a one-of-a-kind crystal that

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.849 
this holds a one-of-a-kind crystal that
up<00:00:16.080> until<00:00:16.379> now<00:00:16.650> had<00:00:16.859> never<00:00:17.130> been<00:00:17.310> discovered

up until now had never been discovered
now<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.070> newfound<00:00:20.460> mineral<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.150> called<00:00:21.539> a

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
now this newfound mineral is called a

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.620 
now this newfound mineral is called a
quasi<00:00:22.080> crystal<00:00:22.760> because<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.970> resembles<00:00:24.510> a

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
quasi crystal because it resembles a

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.080 
quasi crystal because it resembles a
crystal<00:00:25.050> but<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.740> atoms<00:00:26.189> are<00:00:26.369> not<00:00:26.519> arranged

crystal but the atoms are not arranged

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.230 
crystal but the atoms are not arranged
as<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.869> regular<00:00:28.429> crystal<00:00:29.429> would<00:00:29.880> have<00:00:30.060> its

as a regular crystal would have its
atoms<00:00:30.599> arranged<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:32.250> all<00:00:32.369> know<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.880> this

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
atoms arranged and we all know that this

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.139 
atoms arranged and we all know that this
process<00:00:33.630> when<00:00:34.250> things<00:00:35.250> come<00:00:35.430> crashing<00:00:35.969> into

the earth most things don't survive

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.840 
the earth most things don't survive
because<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.079> massive<00:00:40.500> blast<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.309> mean<00:00:41.579> just

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
because it's a massive blast I mean just

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.940 
because it's a massive blast I mean just
