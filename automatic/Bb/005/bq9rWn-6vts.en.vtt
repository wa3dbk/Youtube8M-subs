this is kind of a hybrid between
mechanical<00:00:10.469> play<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.880> mental<00:00:12.330> game<00:00:12.570> and

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
mechanical play and the mental game and

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.770 
mechanical play and the mental game and
this<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.099> essentially<00:00:14.639> how<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:15.150> get<00:00:15.570> in<00:00:15.690> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
let's take an example so we've got a

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.289 
let's take an example so we've got a
shotgun<00:01:31.500> user<00:01:31.920> he<00:01:32.430> runs<00:01:32.759> around<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:33.180> that

how do we get better well it's the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.910 
how do we get better well it's the
mixture<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.480> play<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.990> that<00:02:25.290> analysis

mixture of the play and that analysis

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.560 
mixture of the play and that analysis
it's<00:02:26.160> not<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.460> much<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.910> are<00:02:26.940> getting

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
it's not so much that you are getting

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.270 
it's not so much that you are getting
mechanically<00:02:28.380> better<00:02:28.590> that's<00:02:28.860> going<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.100> come

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
mechanically better that's going to come

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.880 
mechanically better that's going to come
with<00:02:29.310> time<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:30.480> it's<00:02:30.630> limiting<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.500> mistakes

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
with time but it's limiting the mistakes

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.340 
with time but it's limiting the mistakes
you<00:02:32.040> make<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:33.180> see<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.810> difference<00:02:34.200> between

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
you make you see the difference between

you make you see the difference between

where I you know completely sucked and
and<00:02:44.910> my<00:02:45.120> mechanics<00:02:45.630> were<00:02:45.750> completely<00:02:46.080> off

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
and my mechanics were completely off

most<00:02:46.770> of<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.920> time<00:02:47.070> is<00:02:47.220> just<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.520> small<00:02:47.790> error

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
most of the time is just a small error

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.150 
most of the time is just a small error
in<00:02:48.300> judgment<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:48.990> let<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.500> shot<00:02:49.710> gunner<00:02:49.950> get<00:02:50.130> a

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.520 
in judgment I let a shot gunner get a
little<00:02:50.400> bit<00:02:50.520> too<00:02:50.670> close<00:02:50.880> I<00:02:51.300> dove<00:02:52.080> in<00:02:52.260> with<00:02:52.410> my

little bit too close I dove in with my

little bit too close I dove in with my
super<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> little<00:02:53.250> too<00:02:53.400> early<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.910> those

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
super a little too early and those

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.240 
super a little too early and those
things<00:02:54.690> are<00:02:54.900> what<00:02:55.200> we<00:02:55.320> learn<00:02:55.560> from<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:56.070> is

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
what we improve on I understand if you

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.980 
what we improve on I understand if you
watch<00:02:59.310> some<00:02:59.520> of<00:02:59.550> my<00:02:59.670> gameplays<00:03:00.240> I<00:03:00.450> land<00:03:00.900> a

there is no way I will land that shot

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.540 
there is no way I will land that shot
maybe<00:03:06.330> not<00:03:06.600> yet<00:03:06.890> absolutely<00:03:07.890> maybe<00:03:08.100> not<00:03:08.340> yet

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
let's move on from that what's what's

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.210 
let's move on from that what's what's
the<00:03:46.260> next<00:03:46.440> big<00:03:46.739> thing

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
the next big thing

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.960 
the next big thing
well<00:03:48.290> optimizing<00:03:49.290> optimizing<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.610> next

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
well optimizing optimizing is the next

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.640 
well optimizing optimizing is the next
big<00:03:51.120> thing<00:03:51.390> in<00:03:51.480> destiny<00:03:51.870> that<00:03:52.080> some<00:03:52.410> people

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
big thing in destiny that some people

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.520 
big thing in destiny that some people
really<00:03:52.890> don't<00:03:53.070> care<00:03:53.280> about<00:03:53.570> now<00:03:54.570> let's<00:03:55.230> put<00:03:55.410> it

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
really don't care about now let's put it

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.900 
really don't care about now let's put it
let's<00:03:55.739> get<00:03:55.890> an<00:03:56.010> example<00:03:56.370> here<00:03:56.520> let's<00:03:56.700> look<00:03:56.790> at

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
let's get an example here let's look at

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.540 
let's get an example here let's look at
