00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.710
 so it speaks your guys there rodriguinho 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.320
 This video to speak of English weather 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.800
 that I'm playing at the moment it's a 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.840
 despicable me minimum is one in good 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.269
 Portuguese is the game in my evil 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.489
 favorite that is currently available 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.620
 to go or this and android and of course 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.960
 I found this here because of the franchise. 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.480
 who is famous and has very 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.129
 charismatic but also because the world and 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.410
 people had been indicating here 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.680
 comments as it 's free I downloaded 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.180
 without thinking twice 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.700
 as you see the game follows the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.489
 style of a samba and sanchez of life or 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.320
 be three lanes being that the change 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.640
 among them is made by swype the sides 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.879
 and oil has already been 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.280
 I'll have to face it now I've tried 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.180
 do I before but once supported 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.180
 I win this time. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.170
 the group now yes 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.730
 but I found it interesting that they 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.960
 added a lot of variations of this 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.180
 gameplay 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.160
 first because the paths you 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.210
 every match is always 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.610
 many different 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.770
 then because in some moments the 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.150
 camera switches to a view through the side 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.040
 that also enjoy and of zero because in 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.500
 some parts control is on account of 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.300
 the accelerometer or the movement that 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.729
 you do with your device on my 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.410
 if the ipod what ended up leaving the game 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.470
 - repetitive, right? 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.200
 but the coolest thing is that there are 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.600
 some missions to fulfill and this 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.850
 in itself is not new nÃ© several emblems 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.630
 sales nowadays so missions for you 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.060
 do 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.270
 only some missions here at least 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.100
 luxury are the kind of defeats the boss and there 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.860
 You 're in the middle of a race and 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.600
 the boss appears there what evaluation well 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.220
 Nice thing I do not remember having 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.380
 seen in another game of this style 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:21.420
 extremely protective we give deviants 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.420
 here I want to comment 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.430
 who goes from Brazil has a horse there 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.989
 think crazy music beauty 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.300
 I'm stirring here by the accelerometer. 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.840
 and I'm basically enjoying this game 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.880
 on here 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.739
 apparently needless to stay if 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.380
 worrying about spending real money 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.959
 because the points I needed to use 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.860
 So far to buy the progress this 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.690
 kind of thing 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.920
 were all the gains in the 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.180
 matches and this is always very good 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.430
 I hope you have enjoyed this
