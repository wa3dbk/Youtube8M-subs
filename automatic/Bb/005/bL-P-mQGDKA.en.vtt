00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
is just a little bit smaller

the<00:00:15.330> Hanul<00:00:15.509> materials<00:00:15.929> are<00:00:16.379> pretty<00:00:16.710> much<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
the Hanul materials are pretty much the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.840 
the Hanul materials are pretty much the
same<00:00:17.250> as<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.170> sage<00:00:19.170> one<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:20.189> it's<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.460> like

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
same as the sage one so it's that like

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.179

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
that carbon fiber and it actually has

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.529

I would put something like the Chris
Reeve<00:01:19.049> em<00:01:20.040> Nandi<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:21.770> possibly<00:01:22.770> some<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
Reeve em Nandi and possibly some of the

Reeve em Nandi and possibly some of the
the<00:01:24.900> different<00:01:25.259> variations<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> strider

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
similar shape to the PT in that you can

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.520 
similar shape to the PT in that you can
have<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> three<00:01:39.060> finger<00:01:39.210> grip<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.439> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
it's going to be sent off soon but I've

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.850 
it's going to be sent off soon but I've
been<00:02:12.690> very<00:02:12.720> impressed<00:02:13.110> with<00:02:13.500> it

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
been very impressed with it

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.770 
been very impressed with it
extremely<00:02:14.760> comfortable<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.420> think<00:02:15.450> it's

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
extremely comfortable and I think it's

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.640 
extremely comfortable and I think it's
extremely<00:02:16.050> functional<00:02:17.720> as<00:02:18.720> far<00:02:19.020> as<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.200> little

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
extremely functional as far as a little

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.450 
extremely functional as far as a little
EDC<00:02:20.040> knife<00:02:20.070> goes<00:02:20.870> let<00:02:21.870> me<00:02:21.960> compare<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.890> the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
EDC knife goes let me compare it to the

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.510 
EDC knife goes let me compare it to the
delica<00:02:23.970> which<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:24.960> another<00:02:25.170> another<00:02:25.650> popular

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
delica which is another another popular

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.840 
delica which is another another popular
knife<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:27.570> I<00:02:27.720> think<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.020> can<00:02:28.460> kind<00:02:29.460> of<00:02:29.490> see

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
knife and I think you can kind of see

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.770 
knife and I think you can kind of see
the<00:02:30.420> blade<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:31.520> very<00:02:32.520> similar<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.210> shape<00:02:33.240> or

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
the blade is very similar in shape or

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.230 
the blade is very similar in shape or
not<00:02:33.810> shape<00:02:34.170> size<00:02:34.670> but<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.790> handle<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.180> can

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
not shape size but the handle you can

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.760 
not shape size but the handle you can
see<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.110> large<00:02:37.290> difference<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.680> the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
see the the the large difference in the

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.220 
see the the the large difference in the
handle<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.770> course<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.130> blade<00:02:41.430> shape

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
handle and of course the blade shape

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.360 
handle and of course the blade shape
being<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:44.000> little<00:02:45.000> different<00:02:45.740> but<00:02:46.740> I<00:02:46.800> think<00:02:47.070> I

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
being a little different but I think I

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.740 
being a little different but I think I
prefer<00:02:48.890> I'd<00:02:49.890> say<00:02:50.070> for<00:02:50.250> EDC<00:02:50.550> like<00:02:51.030> normal<00:02:51.390> EDC

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
prefer I'd say for EDC like normal EDC

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.940 
prefer I'd say for EDC like normal EDC
what<00:02:51.959> from<00:02:52.080> wearing<00:02:52.260> jeans<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.709> would<00:02:52.800> prefer

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
what from wearing jeans I would prefer

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.930 
what from wearing jeans I would prefer
the<00:02:53.160> delica<00:02:53.550> but<00:02:54.180> if<00:02:54.270> I'm<00:02:54.360> wearing<00:02:55.940> I'm

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
the delica but if I'm wearing I'm

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.300 
the delica but if I'm wearing I'm
wearing<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.510> suit<00:02:57.870> pants<00:02:58.380> I'd<00:02:58.709> rather<00:02:58.890> I'd

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
wearing a suit pants I'd rather I'd

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.280 
wearing a suit pants I'd rather I'd
rather<00:02:59.489> have<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.970> chaparral<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.930> think<00:03:01.170> it's

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
rather have the chaparral I think it's

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.890 
rather have the chaparral I think it's
just<00:03:01.700> it<00:03:02.700> fits<00:03:02.940> in<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.120> pocket<00:03:03.239> better<00:03:03.570> in<00:03:03.780> my

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
just it fits in the pocket better in my

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.170 
just it fits in the pocket better in my
opinion<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.470> less<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.130> sticks<00:03:05.610> out<00:03:05.820> if<00:03:06.090> you

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
opinion and less of it sticks out if you

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.490 
opinion and less of it sticks out if you
want<00:03:06.420> her<00:03:06.510> work<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.840> clip<00:03:07.020> it<00:03:07.140> in<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.320> pocket

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
want her work to clip it in the pocket

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.470 
want her work to clip it in the pocket
so<00:03:08.250> oops<00:03:08.940> as<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.660> reference<00:03:11.239> this<00:03:12.239> is

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
so oops as a reference this is

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.420 
so oops as a reference this is
approximately<00:03:13.350> how<00:03:13.440> much<00:03:13.590> sticks<00:03:14.130> out<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.459> the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
approximately how much sticks out of the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.680 
approximately how much sticks out of the
specimens<00:03:17.430> Milan<00:03:18.000> both<00:03:18.150> up<00:03:19.250> compared<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.690> the

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
specimens Milan both up compared to the

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.920 
specimens Milan both up compared to the
chaparral<00:03:25.610> see<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.730> difference<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.750> think

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
chaparral see the difference and I think

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.800 
chaparral see the difference and I think
that<00:03:28.200> if<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:29.370> were<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:30.000> wear<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.269> in<00:03:30.360> an<00:03:30.450> office

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
that if you were to wear it in an office

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.630 
that if you were to wear it in an office
or<00:03:31.080> with<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.410> suit<00:03:31.799> pants<00:03:32.130> whether<00:03:32.430> you're

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
or with a suit pants whether you're

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.759 
or with a suit pants whether you're
going<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.570> a<00:03:33.600> formal<00:03:33.930> function<00:03:34.320> or<00:03:34.470> not<00:03:34.590> I

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
going to a formal function or not I

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.039 
going to a formal function or not I
think<00:03:35.130> that<00:03:35.430> actually<00:03:35.910> plays<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:36.330> big<00:03:36.750> role<00:03:36.780> in

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
think that actually plays a big role in

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.009 
think that actually plays a big role in
what<00:03:37.560> pot<00:03:38.250> with<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.519> knife<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.730> would<00:03:39.090> pick<00:03:39.720> and

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
what pot with a knife you would pick and

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.509 
what pot with a knife you would pick and
I<00:03:40.080> think<00:03:40.320> for<00:03:40.799> me<00:03:40.920> I<00:03:41.100> would<00:03:41.250> go<00:03:41.340> with<00:03:41.459> the

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
I think for me I would go with the

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.770 
I think for me I would go with the
chaparral<00:03:44.030> but<00:03:45.030> overall<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:45.420> think<00:03:45.540> it's<00:03:45.720> a

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
chaparral but overall I think it's a

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.470 
chaparral but overall I think it's a
great<00:03:46.080> little<00:03:46.380> knife<00:03:46.530> it's<00:03:46.830> not<00:03:47.239> in<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.330> 9th

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
great little knife it's not in the 9th

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.880 
great little knife it's not in the 9th
community<00:03:48.840> we<00:03:48.930> always<00:03:49.049> talk<00:03:49.290> about<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.470> hard

community we always talk about a hard

community we always talk about a hard
use<00:03:50.070> knives<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.640> people<00:03:51.600> talk<00:03:51.720> about<00:03:51.840> maybe

use knives and people talk about maybe

use knives and people talk about maybe
the<00:03:52.430> Emerson's<00:03:53.430> or<00:03:53.610> Striders<00:03:54.090> or<00:03:54.450> talk<00:03:54.750> about

the Emerson's or Striders or talk about

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.740 
the Emerson's or Striders or talk about
how<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.400> paramilitary<00:03:56.400> two<00:03:56.580> can<00:03:56.880> take<00:03:57.690> a

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
how the paramilitary two can take a

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.930 
how the paramilitary two can take a
beating<00:03:58.170> but<00:03:58.830> I<00:03:58.920> think<00:03:59.100> we<00:03:59.160> forget<00:03:59.459> that

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
beating but I think we forget that

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.140 
beating but I think we forget that
they're<00:04:00.810> not<00:04:01.519> knives<00:04:02.519> aren't<00:04:02.760> indestructible

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
they're not knives aren't indestructible

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.199 
they're not knives aren't indestructible
and<00:04:04.040> if<00:04:05.040> we<00:04:05.190> use<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.340> knife<00:04:05.549> as<00:04:05.820> its<00:04:05.940> intended

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
and if we use a knife as its intended

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.539 
and if we use a knife as its intended
purpose<00:04:06.570> is<00:04:06.720> just<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:06.989> cutting<00:04:07.290> tool<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.709> think

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
purpose is just a cutting tool I think

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.910 
purpose is just a cutting tool I think
this<00:04:08.730> knife<00:04:08.940> would<00:04:10.370> shine<00:04:11.370> in<00:04:11.549> almost<00:04:11.760> any

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
this knife would shine in almost any

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.949 
this knife would shine in almost any
reasonable<00:04:13.920> EDC<00:04:14.340> task<00:04:14.579> it<00:04:15.090> has<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.269> quite<00:04:15.930> a

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
reasonable EDC task it has a quite a

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.259 
reasonable EDC task it has a quite a
thin<00:04:16.229> blade<00:04:16.609> now<00:04:17.609> let<00:04:17.729> me<00:04:17.790> see<00:04:17.940> if<00:04:18.030> it's<00:04:18.150> as

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
thin blade now let me see if it's as

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.230 
thin blade now let me see if it's as
thin<00:04:18.510> as<00:04:18.660> this<00:04:20.209> this

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
thin as this this

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.080 
thin as this this
delica<00:04:23.550> it's<00:04:24.550> hard<00:04:24.760> to<00:04:24.880> see<00:04:25.300> on<00:04:25.330> camera<00:04:25.510> but<00:04:26.350> i

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
delica it's hard to see on camera but i

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.180 
delica it's hard to see on camera but i
want<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.150> say<00:04:28.360> it's<00:04:28.600> just<00:04:28.960> a<00:04:29.950> little<00:04:30.100> bit

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
want to say it's just a little bit

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.160 
want to say it's just a little bit
thinner<00:04:30.400> than<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:30.670> delica<00:04:31.090> i<00:04:31.300> think<00:04:32.080> you're

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
thinner than the delica i think you're

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.390 
thinner than the delica i think you're
gonna<00:04:32.260> be<00:04:32.350> able<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.560> pick<00:04:32.800> that<00:04:32.830> up<00:04:32.980> on<00:04:33.220> that

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
gonna be able to pick that up on that

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.420 
gonna be able to pick that up on that
camera<00:04:33.840> at<00:04:34.840> least<00:04:35.080> not<00:04:35.260> with<00:04:35.410> it's<00:04:36.220> just<00:04:36.400> a

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
camera at least not with it's just a

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.800 
camera at least not with it's just a
little<00:04:36.610> bit<00:04:36.700> filipino<00:04:37.180> than<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.420> delica

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
little bit filipino than the delica

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.130 
little bit filipino than the delica
which<00:04:39.180> um<00:04:40.180> is<00:04:40.210> interesting<00:04:40.660> because<00:04:40.750> it's

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
which um is interesting because it's

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.210 
which um is interesting because it's
also<00:04:41.350> taller

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
also taller

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.080 
also taller
well<00:04:43.020> taller<00:04:44.020> that<00:04:44.290> way<00:04:44.470> so<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.430> edge<00:04:45.550> should

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
well taller that way so the edge should

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.960 
well taller that way so the edge should
be<00:04:46.180> thinner<00:04:46.480> on<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:47.380> chaparral<00:04:47.740> at<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.520> at

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
be thinner on the chaparral at the at

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.670 
be thinner on the chaparral at the at
the<00:04:49.120> bevel<00:04:49.450> thinner<00:04:49.900> than<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.170> delica<00:04:50.560> at

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
the bevel thinner than the delica at

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.440 
the bevel thinner than the delica at
least<00:04:50.970> which<00:04:51.970> is<00:04:52.000> interesting<00:04:52.350> um<00:04:53.350> I<00:04:54.450> don't

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
least which is interesting um I don't

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.620 
least which is interesting um I don't
see<00:04:56.080> any<00:04:56.290> big<00:04:56.650> difference<00:04:57.040> in<00:04:57.190> performance

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
see any big difference in performance

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.160 
see any big difference in performance
honestly<00:04:58.630> but<00:04:59.410> I<00:04:59.800> like<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.820> looks<00:05:01.570> of<00:05:01.840> the

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
honestly but I like the looks of the

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.020 
honestly but I like the looks of the
chaparral<00:05:02.620> and<00:05:02.770> I<00:05:02.950> like<00:05:03.160> its<00:05:03.340> functionality

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
chaparral and I like its functionality

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.850 
chaparral and I like its functionality
and<00:05:04.300> I<00:05:04.600> think<00:05:04.720> it's<00:05:04.840> a<00:05:04.870> great<00:05:04.990> knife<00:05:05.200> I<00:05:05.530> think<00:05:05.800> I

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
and I think it's a great knife I think I

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.020 
and I think it's a great knife I think I
mentioned<00:05:06.250> before<00:05:06.430> it's<00:05:06.790> all<00:05:06.850> right<00:05:06.940> around

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
mentioned before it's all right around

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.430 
mentioned before it's all right around
hundred<00:05:07.330> dollars<00:05:09.150> so<00:05:10.150> about<00:05:11.110> what<00:05:11.320> you're

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
hundred dollars so about what you're

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.780 
hundred dollars so about what you're
getting<00:05:11.530> is<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.770> carbon<00:05:12.250> fiber<00:05:12.460> and<00:05:12.610> that's

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
getting is the carbon fiber and that's

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.820 
getting is the carbon fiber and that's
30<00:05:12.970> V<00:05:13.210> in<00:05:13.420> the<00:05:13.840> nice<00:05:13.990> little<00:05:14.230> shape<00:05:14.410> here<00:05:14.680> and<00:05:14.770> I

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
30 V in the nice little shape here and I

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.640 
30 V in the nice little shape here and I
think<00:05:15.330> it<00:05:16.330> would<00:05:16.480> beat<00:05:16.780> sout<00:05:17.050> many<00:05:17.380> of<00:05:17.530> its

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
think it would beat sout many of its

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.440 
think it would beat sout many of its
