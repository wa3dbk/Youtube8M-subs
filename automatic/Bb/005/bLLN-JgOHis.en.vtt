00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 I greet everyone, I am Natalia Nevzorova and 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.130
 today I will answer you one question 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.599
 which to us in our project is my kitchen 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.099
 dreams sent by one of our readers 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.170
 Hello looked your videos on 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.840
 youtube here you already have a blender 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.350
 philips how is it you generally pros and cons 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.390
 how do you do without the corolla now i 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.510
 I will tell you about the pros and cons of this 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:33.660
 blender often use of course 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:38.879
 here is this foot that clings to 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.890
 engine and, accordingly, most 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.870
 I certainly stir the liquid in 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.700
 a bowl at all road gullies at 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.180
 we are attached here such here 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.520
 measuring cup which is very convenient but sometimes 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.500
 I mix in some ordinary 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.239
 here for example pancakes did 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.520
 just recently and here this foot 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.379
 I used to say that she hangs 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.120
 perfect very fast what else i need 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.850
 I liked this button 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.450
 switching speeds can for example 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.549
 mix products at low speed 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.210
 or assume at high speed up 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.869
 that is, the twenty is high enough 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.150
 still there is a turbo button this at completion 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.689
 process, you can click on several 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.380
 like seconds and she is very good 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.700
 completes the mixing process and the second 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.590
 about using my mesh edge and 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.439
 what does not like at all this blender 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.850
 why did I choose him so that 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:45.450
 Here is this cutting of course perfectly cuts 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.579
 In general, fruits, vegetables, well, for example 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.220
 you can cut the potatoes into soup and so 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.850
 these are the small squares on 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.520
 diced or she suppose salad or 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.100
 night enemy that is to me this is very 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.380
 nozzle like suppose a salad from 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.700
 tomatoes and cucumbers can be made 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.580
 literally there in a minute I am of course very 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.380
 happy i bought it 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.620
 blender because it facilitates me 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.300
 a very large amount of work and here 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.060
 my husband always says I we faster 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.640
 cut my hands but you know when 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.180
 tomatoes you cut with your hands sometimes they are 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.730
 just bend and still on the plate 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.290
 it turns out or big pieces or too 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.620
 small pieces or they just 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.720
 falling apart all the cubes cuts at all 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.450
 cool that is, it doesn't transform 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.620
 the flesh the tomatoes that is they keep 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.200
 its shape means that it is not like 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:47.570
 here in this glass 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.610
 I usually chop nuts and chop greens 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.640
 for example, if not once a cheesecake and 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.840
 here is shredded cookies this very 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.720
 good helper that is enough for me 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.410
 helps in the kitchen and yet here I have 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.180
 even my husband asked me a question tell me in general 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.280
 how effective is it that you are 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.050
 bought this blender and i say yes i 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.050
 I don’t regret it 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.360
 makes it easier to work in the kitchen in this 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.519
 the blender still has such a hook for 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.860
 kneading dough is reason for something 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.980
 another there in the ingredients well, that's how it 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.739
 here is yet I especially not baking not 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.989
 was engaged seriously yes and this circle 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.590
 ul I probably used a couple of times and 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.630
 all the things that were in the blender no corolla I 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.910
 also very pleased that there is no halo 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:40.070
 because I want to buy all the same mixer 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:44.510
 here for kneading dough for baking precisely 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:47.000
 for cakes or suppose for creams 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.730
 there for example yes for not only for porridge 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.570
 data for creams in general of course 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.620
 A mixer would be more perfect than 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:01.459
 than under the whisk nozzle on this blender 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:05.480
 if included in the package here 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:07.530
 assortment of attachments then for maybe 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.530
 corolla 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:14.260
 Well, not quite well adapted 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.199
 this is this construction why because 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.389
 here yourself think here you are if the eggs 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:24.130
 you will beat for example yes you are their hands 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:26.530
 You will eat the whisk there is such 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.380
 wonderful corolla here i use 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.660
 now him in order to shoot down 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.210
 I did not like it very much is not here this 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.900
 nice pen cool he's very good 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.479
 Dishwasher and can be washed and here 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.729
 with such movements yes and so and so here 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:50.940
 shake for example that is what is very 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:54.760
 comfortable and I was like this wooden 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.500
 such a cheap daughter brought but 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.289
 watch it washed a couple of times 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:03.090
 dishwasher ion rusted all this 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:05.800
 that's perfect at all looks cool 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.240
 these are the corolla i use so i 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.800
 now ordered a mixer to 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.580
 he performed the main function precisely by 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:19.720
 mixing the dough means me here 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.870
 not really liked it in a blender 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:26.200
 only minus which i would for myself 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:29.710
 This is something that can not be washed 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:33.520
 here are these two covers that is this 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:36.520
 a lid that fits on a big bowl 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.310
 and here is this little cap which 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:43.440
 puts on a small bowl 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:46.720
 look see here there is leftover food 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.539
 that is, well, there is no garlic in my opinion I 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.889
 last shredded 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:57.970
 on this in this bowl and you see in small 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:00.250
 pieces of garlic got there and there was no way 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.800
 impossible to clean out the most important thing 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:06.190
 what's written in the instructions that this 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.070
 the cap can not be washed and 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:12.340
 here is the same here 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:14.680
 there are some mechanisms obvious and 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.860
 I can't wash this cover either 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.410
 Of course I rinse it 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:24.400
 for example, I wet my hand with water 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:28.270
 rinse but was born I bought here 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.610
 such paper towels and just became 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:34.090
 tear off and wipe them like that is 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.490
 only i use blender i tear off 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.190
 towel wet it with water and wipe 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.560
 covers with this towel all the rest 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.320
 I wash the parts in the dishwasher 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.880
 except knives because well sharp knives 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.800
 somehow not recommended to wash in 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.410
 dishwasher because not be dumb 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.260
 from this here is that hot yo drops 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.810
 water or hot water so here I am 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.810
 in principle, do not touch my just under 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:01.840
 a tap with a sponge so that's it 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:06.310
 the only minus that I have for myself 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:08.800
 noted and happy with my purchase and I 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.340
 I recommend women if they are facing 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.350
 choice after all this choice i make 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.600
 I know for sure that you will not regret with you 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.850
