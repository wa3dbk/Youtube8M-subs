took the lead my opponent then decided

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:53.059 
took the lead my opponent then decided
to<00:02:39.780> become<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.349> ballerina

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.580 

and<00:02:53.420> just<00:02:54.420> when<00:02:54.569> I<00:02:54.629> thought<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.959> momentum<00:02:55.439> was

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
and just when I thought the momentum was

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.490 
and just when I thought the momentum was
completely<00:02:56.280> shifting<00:02:56.670> over<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:57.180> great<00:02:58.019> hero

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
completely shifting over a great hero

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.190 
completely shifting over a great hero
emerged<00:02:59.280> it's<00:03:00.209> believed<00:03:00.659> that<00:03:00.840> there<00:03:01.049> was

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
emerged it's believed that there was

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.809 
emerged it's believed that there was
once<00:03:01.469> a<00:03:01.620> man<00:03:01.859> who<00:03:02.189> could<00:03:02.340> pull<00:03:02.519> up<00:03:02.640> them

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
once a man who could pull up them

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.339 
once a man who could pull up them
anywhere<00:03:03.209> past<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.750> half-court<00:03:04.230> line

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
anywhere past the half-court line

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.559 
anywhere past the half-court line
