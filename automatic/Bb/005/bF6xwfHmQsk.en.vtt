00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Hello friends with you Armen and in this 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.029
 video I'll tell you about my new 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.379
 headset called plantronics 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.379
 gamecom 380 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.340
 This will not be a review with a bunch of characteristics 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.320
 and so on, but rather my experience 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.590
 use and my opinion about 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.980
 this headset and so i needed 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.070
 headset with a good microphone and I have it 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:46.720
 He found here a very high quality 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:49.180
 comparable to my old recorder under 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.850
 called zoom and Schwann Well, at least he's my 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.059
 old but the sound quality he has on 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.809
 level if you are interested can 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.970
 to google 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.030
 Yes, and I have a review on this channel 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.089
 recorder and so microphone here 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.790
 tune in degrees that is possible 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.369
 one time adjust the microphone to the desired one 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.270
 you degree and then just stand it 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:16.300
 to the level you want it is convenient to 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.240
 the headband we have fabric as well as on the ears 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:23.410
 it is velor and it is very pleasant to the touch 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.140
 but unfortunately a little dirty 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.500
 Well, I think it is not very critical for 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.380
 at least it's very convenient for me 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.400
 nothing shakes even after an hour 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.380
 of use 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.150
 do not feel well now is hot and 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.880
 maybe a little bit ears sweat but 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.450
 not very critical that is 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.420
 almost in communication does not notice that you 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.869
 I have completely ears on my headphones 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.170
 placed in this cup and 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:01.000
 how better to communicate in contact with 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:03.310
 velor on top of the same yes show myself 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.740
 after all the headphones here we have a logo 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.649
 game.com 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.160
 do not know better why this is 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.160
 done 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.400
 maybe someone will also need them 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.730
 adjustable in height to my 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.330
 relatively large head they sit down 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:28.170
 as I said very comfortable and everything 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:33.620
 quite cool here we have a wheel 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:38.160
 volume control and switch 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.350
 off and on the microphone wire 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.510
 it's pretty fat here and basically 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.460
 enduring, I think rather the headphones will die than 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.040
 perry bends somewhere will break this 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:54.000
 wire at the end we have two minijack 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.850
 on the microphone and headphones, respectively 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.180
 but cool headset to be honest this 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.780
 My first gaming headset for more 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.910
 less normal money before this i 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.090
 used any cheap headphones 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.300
 there for two hundred three hundred rubles it is quite 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.230
 myself in music listen to them basically 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.330
 can not say that the sound is straight 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.080
 super duper but I have enough bass 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:26.220
 probably a little bit lacking is not very 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.830
 they are deep but I repeat 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.100
 we have glossy plastic here 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.400
 well, so far he is not gathering dust 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:39.060
 but over time, maybe something will be 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.120
 but agree if you take the headphones 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.200
 of such quality they are pretty 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.530
 quality 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.350
 with such a microphone and for such a price 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.200
 I think you should not find fault with such 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.540
 little things and yes at the end will tell you about 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.330
 the one and only minus which i 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.510
 I found this bad insulation 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.870
 noise insulation in the sense that if you 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.800
 sit and listen or watch 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.100
 in these headphones 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.530
 all very audible 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.230
 what do u play headphone now 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.800
 demonstrated and so turn on the music 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.800
 at full volume 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.389
 as you probably heard yourself heard 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.160
 very loud 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.009
 but hardly anyone would listen like that 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.500
 music because it is very comfortable to sit 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:33.009
 and headphones with such loudness I never 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:37.330
 so probably not listening even the volume is not 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:38.410
 reached up to half it's on iphone on 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.470
 that's probably all 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.169
 I repeat once again this headset to me in 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.410
 principle very much quite liked 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:50.020
 satisfied and the goal is certainly completely 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.360
 justifies if you need a headset with 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.539
 good microphone and good sound 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.340
 I thought it was your choice and on this I have everything 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:01.259
 like subscribe to the channel and 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.259
