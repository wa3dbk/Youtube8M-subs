environmental impact of that such
success<00:01:12.000> let's<00:01:12.630> now<00:01:13.080> simulate<00:01:13.380> an<00:01:13.619> SSX<00:01:14.009> gas

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
success let's now simulate an SSX gas

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.120 
success let's now simulate an SSX gas
leak<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.270> if<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:15.780> simulated<00:01:16.200> SSX<00:01:16.710> gas<00:01:16.890> leak

in conclusion as we discussed we know
sf6<00:02:12.650> gas<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:13.160> everywhere<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:13.670> in<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.330> future

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
sf6 gas is everywhere and in the future

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.540 
sf6 gas is everywhere and in the future
it's<00:02:15.050> going<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.320> be<00:02:15.410> regulated<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.340> will
