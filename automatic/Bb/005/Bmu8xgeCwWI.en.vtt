00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.590
 Hello, how are you doing? 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.550
 we live with a hairstyle in this case 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:20.410
 is a bow that is very fashionable is of 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.939
 tendency is the bun or not or top not me 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.070
 heard it in the two ways that's why 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.669
 I put it in the title that basically is 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.189
 very high up here and having a shape 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.220
 as a wool piojillo that looks like 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.470
 let's have a steer here 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.180
 formal in a more repeted plan than 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.850
 stays with the lacquer and stays very 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:44.920
 defined or for the journal that would be 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.809
 remembered up here from water test tube me 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.149
 I put two pints and it's done 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.220
 Well, I'm going to say what I 'm going to 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.040
 use to make a little more 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.110
 to make a bun a hairstyle I do not like 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.829
 the clamp so that's easy but it's 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.310
 a little more for 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.800
 go out for a night or to go eat 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:09.150
 a little more combed hairstyle I'm going to 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.610
 use a brush and comb 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.340
 a normal bulb and I use 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.960
 these that have two comfortable hooks 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.930
 a but 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.750
 I use in this case he 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.430
 the stuffing of bows 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.680
 finite and that is also made with 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.910
 stocking sock only not with 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.950
 fat sock 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.140
 this is also sold but we can do 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.310
 rolling a pair of stocking socks 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.860
 Normal fork on the flat lists 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.990
 here already open and a lacquer pot for 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.760
 define it when chain the first thing that 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.760
 we must do is a tail up here 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.310
 it's a hairstyle to do it back 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.410
 but I have this long bangs 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.540
 then I leave my bangs straight 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.270
 Well here the same with the ones you have 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.420
 long hair and you want to leave a 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:04.210
 Tuft well nothing to everyone's taste 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.210
 I'm going to cut here 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.910
 leave me in the front 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.910
 if they stay but what we do not want 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.860
 for outside then we solve it with a 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.040
 little from the street as high as 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.040
 we can 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.670
 to Sunday in the middle 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.090
 we press well 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.090
 42 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.520
 I'm going to open my hair in two and 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.430
 front to back 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.430
 and I take the two I start to spin 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.310
 and when we have the two ends here 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.159
 on the inside 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.159
 we take flat hairpin 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.880
 as they will only access more danger as 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.930
 here I pick them up although 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.930
 and I grab it here 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.500
 now 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.620
 so that it does not release us well we take 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.620
 they are open we can in some places 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.560
 look so you do not see this little dot that 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.050
 I do not like 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.639
 I'm going to introduce the comb here 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.639
 east corner of silver 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.080
 and he pushed it forward 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.380
 and pick up 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.980
 now with the hairs these have 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.360
 more cameras 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.360
 then the lacquer and comb 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.870
 and dew 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.919
 and I apply nothing 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.310
 Now for those of you who have a small 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.460
 just like me 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:35.990
 I would like you to stay 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:38.930
 here but rounded to the 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.530
 ears we look forward we leave 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.530
 the comb like that 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.720
 and with your hands you can see the tips 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.939
 and we hold and apply a little bit of lacquer 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:08.009
 and we have made our bow 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:09.389
 no or if you can not it is very simple I am going 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:13.500
 to leave some pictures that seen in magazines 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:16.800
 digital and online so you can see 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.930
 well also another type of bows that are 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.400
 more refined larger to get 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.580
 more hair will also be many 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.660
 big bows also so hairstyle and 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.039
 good you see how it is also with the 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.289
 effect of wearing an evening dress or 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:31.050
 things because nothing I hope that I have 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:33.270
 liked and that you practice and you will tell me 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:37.099
