00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.810
 Today we will teach you how to start skating 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.580
 back the first thing that you have to 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.289
 keep in mind is that the weights change 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.509
 totally from the weight position 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.220
 advance we will go to all the weight 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.450
 backwards the first exercise is very 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.340
 similar to learning to skate towards 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.289
 front baby steps backwards 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.880
 remember to put the weight back and 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.230
 look over your shoulder to avoid 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.500
 take vices that you later have to 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.500
 remove 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.730
 second exercise is very simple you 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.160
 we will call 8th lemon is next to 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.810
 tips of your skates and put a little bit 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.200
 the true weight as tempered back 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.200
 unintentionally 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.119
 when you have dominated the eights 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.890
 Lemons try to do it with only one foot 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.890
 first with one and then with the other 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.450
 we almost have it now the only thing 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.840
 you have to do is alternate a foot and 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.840
 then the other 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.100
 the last technique you need to 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.780
 to learn is the crossed one takes advantage of 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.780
 give you momentum or to turn 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.040
 once you know how to move backwards 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.420
 you will have to learn to do the 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.790
 skid transition forward 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.920
 back the first and simplest 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.170
 transition is to turn on your tips 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.790
 place yourself in a safe position and 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.110
 You will see that the shoulder that you have 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.110
 mark towards the side that you have to turn 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.219
 to get back on your face you can 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:13.810
 do the same thing in reverse tour about 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:16.139
 your heels removes all the weight of the 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.139
 tips 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.590
 the next transition is a little more 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.510
 complicated you have to make a small turn 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.579
 cloud to stand on your back and then 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.849
 equalize the skates so as not to lose 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.849
 impulse 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.390
 If you go too fast it is better to avoid 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.299
 the humidity that you can stabilize is 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.569
 better to use the jump technique 180 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.569
 degrees 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.470
 ah
