over to my mac and I'll just discuss
briefly<00:00:05.490> here<00:00:06.150> how<00:00:06.420> we<00:00:06.480> deal<00:00:07.140> with<00:00:08.450> using

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
briefly here how we deal with using

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.280 
briefly here how we deal with using
peripheral<00:00:09.870> devices<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.620> Mac<00:00:11.160> so<00:00:12.170> it's<00:00:13.170> a

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
peripheral devices on Mac so it's a

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.959 
peripheral devices on Mac so it's a
little<00:00:13.440> bit<00:00:13.559> easier<00:00:13.860> when<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.400> comes<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.820> doing

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
little bit easier when it comes to doing

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.430 
little bit easier when it comes to doing
these<00:00:15.179> things<00:00:15.389> in<00:00:15.570> Mac<00:00:15.780> because<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.230> don't

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
these things in Mac because we don't

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.019 
these things in Mac because we don't
have<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.740> same<00:00:16.770> problem<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.699> do<00:00:17.880> on

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
have the same problem that we do on

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
first light is lit there and I've got it

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.250 
first light is lit there and I've got it
to<00:03:22.280> rotate<00:03:22.459> when<00:03:22.819> the<00:03:22.940> second<00:03:23.299> line<00:03:23.420> is<00:03:23.569> is<00:03:23.840> is

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
to rotate when the second line is is is

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.050 
to rotate when the second line is is is
lit<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:24.709> then<00:03:24.889> I've<00:03:25.010> got<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.400> other<00:03:25.489> ones<00:03:25.730> to

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
lit and then I've got the other ones to

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.509 
lit and then I've got the other ones to
not<00:03:26.930> do<00:03:27.109> anything<00:03:27.349> and<00:03:27.620> then<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:27.769> can<00:03:28.040> hit<00:03:28.430> the

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
not do anything and then I can hit the

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.879 
not do anything and then I can hit the
toggle<00:03:28.760> there<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:29.209> switch<00:03:29.480> between<00:03:29.630> them<00:03:30.019> so

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
toggle there to switch between them so

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.250 
toggle there to switch between them so
that<00:03:31.700> can<00:03:32.269> be<00:03:32.299> a<00:03:32.419> useful<00:03:32.569> way<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:32.900> setting

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
that can be a useful way of setting

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.229 
that can be a useful way of setting
things<00:03:33.410> up<00:03:33.650> if<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.099> want<00:03:34.280> to<00:03:34.489> be<00:03:34.730> able<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:35.030> zoom

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
things up if you want to be able to zoom

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.809 
things up if you want to be able to zoom
and<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:36.169> rotate<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.799> canvas<00:03:36.980> with<00:03:37.400> your<00:03:37.609> touch

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
and to rotate the canvas with your touch

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.150 
and to rotate the canvas with your touch
ring<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:39.049> that's<00:03:39.410> pretty<00:03:39.590> much<00:03:39.680> all<00:03:39.889> that<00:03:40.069> you

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
ring so that's pretty much all that you

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.470 
ring so that's pretty much all that you
need<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.400> know<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:40.730> then<00:03:40.819> once<00:03:41.030> you've<00:03:41.239> got

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
need to know and then once you've got

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.319 
need to know and then once you've got
that<00:03:41.510> done<00:03:42.049> then<00:03:42.290> you<00:03:42.500> can<00:03:42.709> run<00:03:43.329> the

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
that done then you can run the

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:45.520 
that done then you can run the
application<00:03:44.450> that<00:03:45.019> you're<00:03:45.109> interested<00:03:45.290> in

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
application that you're interested in

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.809 
application that you're interested in
running<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:45.980> double<00:03:46.220> check<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.609> see<00:03:46.790> that

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
running and double check to see that

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.180 
running and double check to see that
everything<00:03:47.510> is<00:03:47.540> working<00:03:47.780> correctly<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.560> in

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
everything is working correctly so in

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.069 
everything is working correctly so in
this<00:03:49.280> case<00:03:49.489> I'll<00:03:49.700> just<00:03:49.880> open<00:03:50.090> up<00:03:50.329> harmony<00:03:50.870> and

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
this case I'll just open up harmony and

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.750 
this case I'll just open up harmony and
I'll<00:03:51.380> pop<00:03:51.709> open<00:03:51.859> a<00:03:52.099> scene<00:03:52.280> file<00:03:52.489> and<00:03:52.700> I<00:03:52.730> had

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
I'll pop open a scene file and I had

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.539 
I'll pop open a scene file and I had
opened<00:03:53.269> earlier<00:03:53.630> just<00:03:54.049> to<00:03:54.220> make<00:03:55.220> things<00:03:55.400> a

opened earlier just to make things a
little<00:03:55.639> bit<00:03:55.819> easier<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:57.220> now<00:03:58.220> that<00:03:58.430> I'm<00:03:58.519> in<00:03:58.819> my

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
little bit easier and now that I'm in my

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.030 
little bit easier and now that I'm in my
scene<00:03:59.269> file<00:03:59.480> here<00:03:59.780> I<00:03:59.810> can<00:04:00.049> just<00:04:00.319> select<00:04:00.560> a

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
scene file here I can just select a

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.610 
scene file here I can just select a
drawing<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:02.000> I<00:04:02.510> can<00:04:02.720> try<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.019> draw<00:04:03.290> in<00:04:03.440> there

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620

and will notice that I do get my

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.000 
and will notice that I do get my
pressure<00:04:05.480> sensitivity<00:04:06.019> i<00:04:06.260> get<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.650> thick<00:04:06.829> and

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
pressure sensitivity i get the thick and

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.120 
pressure sensitivity i get the thick and
thin<00:04:07.159> on<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.459> line<00:04:07.670> and

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130
