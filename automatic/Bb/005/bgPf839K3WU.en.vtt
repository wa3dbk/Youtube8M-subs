ahead of time the ripening period would

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.500 
ahead of time the ripening period would
be<00:05:32.630> March<00:05:32.990> but<00:05:33.410> they<00:05:34.010> did<00:05:34.250> their<00:05:34.760> well<00:05:35.150> enough

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
be March but they did their well enough

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:43.409 
be March but they did their well enough
to<00:05:35.690> o<00:05:35.720> develop<00:05:36.410> to<00:05:36.620> ripen<00:05:37.430> as<00:05:37.820> it<00:05:37.970> was
