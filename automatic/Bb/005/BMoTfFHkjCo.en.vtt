00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:09.809
 rather one more soy unt 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.359
 it's a real real application really like 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:15.440
 let's open it 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.900
 this application that does not think and that will identify us 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.950
 the song 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.119
 by artist 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.829
 percent the song is identified by cosmetic video the song if it is that 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.210
 we hummed it we sing it still 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.579
 percent 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.070
 the player who 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.920
 has themes and very good for example is what jazz is at that moment what 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.059
 the right thing or not 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.290
 we both can drought cause it 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.030
 in the song, let's put it back 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.820
 april what better will be everything to talk inc 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.050
 practically as much music 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.840
 songs forgive both musical and lyrics like osorio soto video for example 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.600
 has ugaz vicki wife bowl and we can sing what we want 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.010
 the town next to accountant who 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.330
 an environment a 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.140
 I like the straight line 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.300
 after a Tuesday gen 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.700
 titus no nicole singing half but because he did not recognize me 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.830

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.180
 by 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.780
 the Buddhist culture 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.780
 a whole 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.410
 these rules 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.850
 and plus I do not think so much chase half hair you sing pretty 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.300
 lesson too 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.380
 well that song plot in Spanish there is practically nothing because we 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.409
 we want you a bad point a song a song 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.409

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.750
 the song of music 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.750
 let's all stand up and 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.970
 although the grijalva river 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.969

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.909
 the bottom we have what is percent 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.909
 the sale of the album 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:24.169

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:25.649
 what is the video of it 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:29.469

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:33.069

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.299

 official singer of his page 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.769
