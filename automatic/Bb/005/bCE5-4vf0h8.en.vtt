00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.670

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.980
 Internet us every day 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.929
 lure some kind of online game often 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.190
 we of course poke on a colorful banner 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.470
 swing the game 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.810
 recorded go and see more often 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.420
 total disheartened because the game is not 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.160
 lives up to our expectations today and 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.600
 I'm starting to shoot a new video cycle on 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.090
 title online album 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.939
 I will choose the best online projects and 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.000
 cast away the worst online games today 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.770
 we will choose the best online shooter 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.840
 let's go i think future gaming 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.129
 the industry is certainly beyond the quality 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.440
 online projects 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.180
 so does the kraytek company which 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.940
 in the twelfth year food reveal to all 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.340
 the world about the excellent online shooter warface 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.440
 in the same year, the company mail.ru took up 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.539
 its localization in Russia and here in it 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.110
 plays already there were millions of gamers with 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.110
 the whole country 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.890
 what attracts players to the face 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.719
 great graphics excellent physics 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.670
 detailed study of all weapons 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.289
 a huge number of cards this again 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.420
 proves that the warface 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.479
 great shooter but if you remember something 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.670
 that besides the pvp and pve modes 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.590
 I can safely say that in warf one 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.590
 of the best online shooters in Russia 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.310
 and the next contender for the title of best 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.110
 online shooter yes of course the game 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.900
 crossfire which we walked tasks on for a long time 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.420
 2009 and to this day this project on 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.880
 afloat and loved by millions and 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.720
 players in Russia and localizes the company 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.820
 mail.ru 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.580
 only the difference from the game is not 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.680
 physics and poor graph he played still 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.540
 Many people like what's in it 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.370
 interesting perhaps the main advantage 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.400
 is the difference modes here them 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.340
 very, very much you like a meat grinder escape 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.140
 zombie frezer and mutations for new megacres 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.780
