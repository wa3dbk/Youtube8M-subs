00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.110
 at 54 dollars they look pretty so 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.110
 let's see how much they seem 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.309
 hello good morning today 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.650
 video is about a comparison makes 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.180
 a few days ago I in my instagram that 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.320
 if you do not follow me on instagram I'll leave it with you 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.660
 here 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.189
 I put a post and a photo where he compared these 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.110
 two pallets and they look pretty like 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.579
 switches so let's start to see 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.250
 and what they palettes 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:31.640
 talked about the naked 3 of today van dyke and 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.380
 of the palette news of choosing this costs 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.420
 less than $ 10 and you get in your 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.100
 website and can check on ebay 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.660
 I also think that nike in house there 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.790
 several online places where you get 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.910
 I do not know what store is available but 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.100
 online if there are several and the naked 3 that 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.470
 estate brand and that costs 54 dollars and 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.180
 you get sephora ulta 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.190
 with those are the two places that 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.710
 also on the organdÃ­ key page 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.090
 online, we're going to compare it and I'm going to 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.800
 show so if you want to know what 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.560
 they look alike as long as you watch the video 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.790
 that prohibited and pretty 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.790
 forward glenda dale 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.190
 Here I am showing roughly the 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.370
 palette colors up and lakers and 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.590
 down here or that three of bp andy what if 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.810
 they see colors that look like they are 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.310
 similar because they are not identical no 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.500
 they are in the same order I am going to try 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.150
 to make the switches according to what 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.060
 that I see that it looks a lot and the 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.350
 I'm going to make them with a brush and 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.730
 I'm not going to do it with my finger because 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.190
 I think with the brush it's how best 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.920
 come so I will not start anything 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.290
 show the switches the palette of the 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.390
 newsletter palette lakers does not have 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.340
 names the colors the palette below 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.280
 of naked has names so what 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.810
 I'm going to do is that nothing that I tell you 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.510
 names of the naked but the one above does not 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.930
 has a name so no name goes 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:52.720
 here we start this is the shade more 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.750
 clarita de la paleta news and this is the 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.970
 strange de verdi that comes and search 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.910
 you look like them are the 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.410
 two are imposed with brushes there is no 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.180
 evidence in my hand is only in the 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.570
 shadow is that you are seeing 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.580
 here is the 2 of today van dyke 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.240
 it's fine doing the comparison or the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.530
 that looks a lot like each other 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.360
 there comes the brightness 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.390
 is what you see here is the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.090
 birdie that this one is called seeing out and this 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.170
 is the similarity more or less of the palette 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.170
 of news 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.819
 they look pretty 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:38.780
 this is called limits of wendy which is 12 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.700
 shots on a mate and this is the resemblance 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.700
 from the news palette 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.080
 You do not see much but it's like a rose 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.780
 old more or less 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.819
 more clarita the grand one and that this is 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:00.560
 the voice and you already see the similar 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.870
 look at it here here it looks better 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.709
 it's pretty 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.709
 metallica 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.560
 there are the two 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.540
 just as metallic the color looks like 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.230
 quite in real life it seems 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.480
 quite 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.700
 just like what you are seeing 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.440
 this is called trick and this is the shadow 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.050
 of the plan of this palette that less to me 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.000
 I like it because it has a bugbear of 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.950
 that does not pigment very well although it has a 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.319
 very nice finish 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.010
 and this is the shadow that most resembles 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:35.709
 the palette does not pigment very well 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.680
 if he comes from seeing band and that he has more 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:43.150
 fragmentation this is more a shine 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.150
 so in this as I do not 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.760
 they do not look that much alike but this is another 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.250
 the matte colors this is called buner 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.220
 and this the most similar that there is in that 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.830
 palette because you do not have a name but 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.750
 look at the resemblance is pretty 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.260
 It's a brown and a transition color 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.290
 very nice on both pallets 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.209
 here we have this one called layer and 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.250
 this is the closest thing I got 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:15.450
 although it has the same color half of 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:17.790
 what they saw in what I showed earlier what 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.600
 that the one in this news palette does not have 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.970
 that double color because if I turn my hand 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.419
 see that here it looks like a brown cited 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.850
 but in the newt not only the 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.900
 brightness is more a glitter because the 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.300
 pnd and that has a little more than 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.759
 pigmentation 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.949
 but it's a reasonable facsimile here 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:41.660
 I'm showing this which is the color 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.970
 factory and the other 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.130
 this is the color a lot to this one does not 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.169
 I found similar so that's why I 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.599
 I'm showing alone 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.599
 in fine grayish metallic 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:58.999
 is this is the naked palette this is 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:00.800
 the dark side and this is what it looks like 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:03.199
 the more I found it that is more 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.879
 like here are two for 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.569
 that you look for yourself look like 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:10.520
 There are quite a lot of them and they are and this is 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.919
 the last shadow of the palette this is 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.990
 black heart that is beautiful I do not know if 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.629
 you get to see this black that 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.979
 It has pink glitters and it looks beautiful and 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.110
 this is the closest thing I found in 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.060
 this palette does not look that much because 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.499
 this one does not pepper very well but this is 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.470
 bella is beautiful this is the 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:28.820
 protagonist of the palette 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.650
 but what would I hope they have 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.450
 enjoyed this video comparing these 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.070
 two super pallets already saw that 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.630
 they seem pretty are not the same but they 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.210
 they seem pretty and if this is a 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.710
 reasonable facsimile of this and if you 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.840
 like these videos leave a little finger for 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.790
 up if you want us to keep bloating 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.010
 here are my social networks I invite you 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.020
 to visit there and we continue in the 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.850
 bouncer snap and 'no what are the new 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.260
 we are in the plant only remains if I 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.880
 follow snap I always follow you for 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.050

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.680
 presents good if I have a good kiss 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.680
 big and until the next video
