00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
Baggins and 326 bobbins done something

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.920 
Baggins and 326 bobbins done something
called<00:01:55.070> range<00:01:55.340> shift<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.450> I've<00:01:56.540> moved<00:01:56.750> the

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
called range shift so I've moved the

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.410 
called range shift so I've moved the
bottom<00:01:57.380> up<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:58.009> I'd<00:01:58.159> be<00:01:58.310> on<00:01:58.430> see<00:01:58.729> any<00:01:59.060> strong

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
bottom up so I'd be on see any strong

bottom up so I'd be on see any strong
returns<00:01:59.840> under<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:00.409> bottom<00:02:00.740> show<00:02:01.310> me<00:02:01.369> a

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
returns under the bottom show me a

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.910 
returns under the bottom show me a

I've<00:02:04.159> used<00:02:04.369> Roman<00:02:04.700> reigns<00:02:04.850> true<00:02:05.210> zoom<00:02:05.509> feature

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
I've used Roman reigns true zoom feature

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.340 
I've used Roman reigns true zoom feature
and<00:02:06.590> we<00:02:06.680> can<00:02:06.860> see<00:02:07.100> these<00:02:07.820> returns<00:02:08.360> here<00:02:08.660> to

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
and we can see these returns here to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.420 
and we can see these returns here to
shot<00:02:09.649> so<00:02:10.069> much<00:02:10.340> clearer

okay<00:02:29.720> Greg<00:02:29.930> can<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.230> just<00:02:30.379> run<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.530> through

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
okay Greg can you just run it through

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.940 
okay Greg can you just run it through

very<00:03:10.579> simple<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.180> change<00:03:11.420> so<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:11.840> just<00:03:12.109> hit<00:03:12.290> the

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
very simple to change so I just hit the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.039 
very simple to change so I just hit the

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
the channel and force I like that

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.509 
the channel and force I like that
we<00:03:21.169> can<00:03:21.349> see<00:03:21.530> all<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.709> different<00:03:22.160> sounder
