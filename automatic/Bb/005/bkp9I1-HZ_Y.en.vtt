we're<00:00:08.280> in<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.580> test<00:00:09.059> plot<00:00:09.559> where<00:00:10.559> we<00:00:10.590> had<00:00:10.920> in

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
we're in a test plot where we had in

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.430 
we're in a test plot where we had in
this<00:00:11.610> section<00:00:11.849> we<00:00:12.120> had<00:00:13.190> crimson<00:00:14.190> clover<00:00:14.460> and

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
while the the crimson clover that was in

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.540 
while the the crimson clover that was in

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
here was six to eight inches tall you

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.130 
here was six to eight inches tall you
can<00:00:20.820> see<00:00:21.090> there's<00:00:21.330> been<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.480> little<00:00:21.630> dose<00:00:21.930> been

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
can see there's been a little dose been

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.439 
can see there's been a little dose been
some<00:00:22.350> tillage<00:00:22.680> done<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.250> field<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:24.390> is

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
some tillage done in this field this is

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.029 
some tillage done in this field this is
obviously<00:00:25.019> not<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.439> be<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.590> no-till

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
obviously not going to be a no-till

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:40.360 
obviously not going to be a no-till
situation<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.390> had

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.990 

bad<00:00:41.150> roots<00:00:41.450> that<00:00:41.630> were<00:00:41.840> over<00:00:42.460> 20<00:00:43.460> inches<00:00:43.640> deep

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
bad roots that were over 20 inches deep

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.200 
bad roots that were over 20 inches deep
out<00:00:44.240> here<00:00:44.270> and<00:00:44.780> I<00:00:45.230> believe<00:00:45.560> that<00:00:46.160> again<00:00:46.940> just

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
out here and I believe that again just

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.000 
out here and I believe that again just
kind<00:00:47.390> of<00:00:47.420> looking<00:00:47.720> at<00:00:47.900> it<00:00:47.930> it<00:00:48.530> looks<00:00:48.590> like<00:00:48.800> we

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
kind of looking at it it looks like we

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.950 
kind of looking at it it looks like we
got<00:00:49.100> a<00:00:49.160> pretty<00:00:49.370> good<00:00:49.490> kill<00:00:49.910> but<00:00:50.630> then<00:00:50.810> we've

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
got a pretty good kill but then we've

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.050 
got a pretty good kill but then we've
got<00:00:51.110> some<00:00:51.350> individual<00:00:51.980> plans<00:00:52.280> some<00:00:52.580> pockets

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
got some individual plans some pockets

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.030 
got some individual plans some pockets
that<00:00:53.270> I<00:00:53.390> believe<00:00:53.750> are<00:00:54.350> going<00:00:54.410> to<00:00:54.620> need<00:00:54.770> to<00:00:54.890> be

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
that I believe are going to need to be

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.400 
that I believe are going to need to be
come<00:00:55.580> back<00:00:55.610> in<00:00:55.970> now<00:00:56.180> this<00:00:56.300> is<00:00:56.480> one<00:00:56.660> be<00:00:56.840> going<00:00:57.290> in

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
come back in now this is one be going in

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.350 
come back in now this is one be going in
the<00:00:57.500> corn<00:00:57.770> so<00:00:58.430> we<00:00:58.520> can<00:00:58.640> come<00:00:58.760> back<00:00:58.910> in<00:00:59.180> with

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
the corn so we can come back in with

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.420 
the corn so we can come back in with
some<00:00:59.510> chemicals<00:00:59.990> to<00:01:00.200> do<00:01:00.320> a<00:01:00.350> post<00:01:00.680> application

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
some chemicals to do a post application

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.250 
some chemicals to do a post application
after<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.760> corn<00:01:02.000> is<00:01:02.090> planted<00:01:02.260> but

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
after the corn is planted but

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.380 
after the corn is planted but
nevertheless<00:01:04.040> I<00:01:04.550> think<00:01:04.760> we're<00:01:04.940> going<00:01:05.089> to<00:01:05.180> need

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
nevertheless I think we're going to need

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.650 
nevertheless I think we're going to need
to<00:01:05.630> knock<00:01:06.260> back<00:01:06.530> this<00:01:06.770> crimson<00:01:07.250> clover<00:01:07.660> kill

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
to knock back this crimson clover kill

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.020 
to knock back this crimson clover kill
it<00:01:08.810> out<00:01:08.930> all<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.320> way<00:01:09.350> all<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.770> way<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:10.460> I

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
it out all the way all the way and I

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.310 
it out all the way all the way and I
think<00:01:11.060> that<00:01:11.330> that<00:01:11.600> would<00:01:11.780> be<00:01:11.900> very<00:01:12.050> valuable

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
think that that would be very valuable

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.140 
think that that would be very valuable
you<00:01:12.800> can<00:01:12.890> see<00:01:13.070> up<00:01:13.250> over<00:01:13.550> the<00:01:13.670> ridge<00:01:13.820> there

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
you can see up over the ridge there

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.180 
you can see up over the ridge there
where<00:01:14.750> there's<00:01:14.960> quite<00:01:15.170> a<00:01:15.200> bit<00:01:15.410> of<00:01:15.440> green<00:01:15.800> on

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
where there's quite a bit of green on

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.960 
where there's quite a bit of green on
that<00:01:16.700> plot<00:01:17.290> just<00:01:18.290> over<00:01:18.619> here<00:01:18.800> to<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:19.850> the

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
that plot just over here to the to the

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.120 
that plot just over here to the to the
south<00:01:20.210> so<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:20.840> think<00:01:21.290> that<00:01:21.619> it's<00:01:21.740> gonna<00:01:21.860> be<00:01:21.920> very

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
south so I think that it's gonna be very

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.219 
south so I think that it's gonna be very
key<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.970> make<00:01:23.119> sure<00:01:23.150> we<00:01:23.479> get<00:01:23.600> all<00:01:23.780> these<00:01:23.960> cover

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
key to make sure we get all these cover

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.650 
key to make sure we get all these cover
crops<00:01:24.320> completely<00:01:25.070> dead<00:01:25.280> again<00:01:26.119> driving<00:01:26.420> down

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
crops completely dead again driving down

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.150 
crops completely dead again driving down
the<00:01:26.810> road<00:01:26.990> yeah<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:27.350> see<00:01:27.650> a<00:01:27.680> little<00:01:27.830> bit<00:01:27.979> of<00:01:28.040> a

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
the road yeah you see a little bit of a

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.570 
the road yeah you see a little bit of a
green<00:01:28.400> tint<00:01:28.780> in<00:01:29.780> this<00:01:30.050> section<00:01:30.500> but<00:01:31.160> the

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
green tint in this section but the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.820 
green tint in this section but the
reality<00:01:32.000> is<00:01:32.119> there's<00:01:32.360> quite<00:01:32.600> a<00:01:32.630> bit<00:01:32.869> of<00:01:32.900> quite

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
reality is there's quite a bit of quite

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.130 
reality is there's quite a bit of quite
a<00:01:33.860> bit<00:01:34.070> of<00:01:34.190> clover<00:01:34.550> that<00:01:34.580> has<00:01:35.300> still<00:01:35.509> survived

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
a bit of clover that has still survived

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.280 
a bit of clover that has still survived
so<00:01:36.590> we'll<00:01:37.490> investigate<00:01:37.940> this<00:01:38.240> further<00:01:38.479> as<00:01:38.840> we

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
so we'll investigate this further as we

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.710 
so we'll investigate this further as we
get<00:01:39.830> this<00:01:40.310> planted<00:01:40.790> and<00:01:40.940> get<00:01:41.060> out<00:01:41.210> here<00:01:41.240> and
