00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.830 
side wall to bounce it off of here's
some<00:01:01.079> example<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.590> took<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.219> myself<00:01:03.149> sorry

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
some example I took of the myself sorry

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.140 
some example I took of the myself sorry
I<00:01:04.290> couldn't<00:01:04.949> get<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> better<00:01:05.250> looking<00:01:05.670> subject

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
I couldn't get a better looking subject

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.580 
I couldn't get a better looking subject
so<00:01:06.979> you<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.130> got<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.340> deal<00:01:08.580> with<00:01:08.760> my<00:01:08.909> mug<00:01:09.590> over

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
so you just got to deal with my mug over

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.080 
so you just got to deal with my mug over
on<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.920> left<00:01:11.360> this<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:13.340> taken<00:01:14.340> with<00:01:14.909> the

bracket<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:16.369> landscape<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.580> cropped<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.210> out<00:01:18.420> so

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
bracket on landscape I cropped it out so

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.810 
bracket on landscape I cropped it out so
I<00:01:18.840> could<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> comparison<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> pictures

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
I could do a comparison for the pictures

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.440 
I could do a comparison for the pictures

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
you don't have a bracket what it does is

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.300 
you don't have a bracket what it does is
it<00:02:45.220> turned<00:02:45.430> your<00:02:45.580> flash<00:02:45.850> sideways<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:47.310> you

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
it turned your flash sideways and you

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.660 
it turned your flash sideways and you
have<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:48.610> rotate<00:02:48.819> your<00:02:49.239> flash<00:02:49.600> all<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.080> way<00:02:50.670> up

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
have to rotate your flash all the way up

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
to point to the same length or opening

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.120 
to point to the same length or opening
it<00:02:54.310> up<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:55.000> right<00:02:55.209> or<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.780> left<00:02:55.959> to<00:02:56.860> bounce

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
it up to the right or the left to bounce

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.490 
it up to the right or the left to bounce
it<00:02:57.310> off<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.640> wall<00:02:57.849> so<00:02:58.690> with<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:58.989> bracket<00:02:59.410> it

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
it off the wall so with the bracket it

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.259 
it off the wall so with the bracket it
allows<00:02:59.709> you<00:02:59.890> just<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.250> point<00:03:00.910> it<00:03:01.000> straight<00:03:01.150> at

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
allows you just to point it straight at

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.360 
allows you just to point it straight at
the<00:03:01.480> ceiling<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.380> that<00:03:02.680> gives<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.040> better

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
the ceiling and that gives you a better

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.680 
the ceiling and that gives you a better
color<00:03:04.299> tone<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:05.620> doesn't<00:03:05.799> bleach<00:03:06.160> out<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.690> the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
color tone it doesn't bleach out the the

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.839 
color tone it doesn't bleach out the the
color<00:03:07.989> it<00:03:08.799> gives<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.250> more<00:03:09.459> natural<00:03:09.519> look

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
color it gives you a more natural look

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.610 
color it gives you a more natural look
but<00:03:12.849> I<00:03:13.120> can't<00:03:13.690> recommend<00:03:14.140> this<00:03:14.470> particular

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
but I can't recommend this particular

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.650 
but I can't recommend this particular
product<00:03:15.160> because<00:03:15.910> if<00:03:16.090> you're<00:03:16.269> running<00:03:16.480> around

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
product because if you're running around

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.090 
product because if you're running around
and<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:18.760> try<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.000> zoom<00:03:19.709> this<00:03:20.709> is<00:03:20.920> what

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
and you try to zoom this is what

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.150 
and you try to zoom this is what
happened<00:03:21.489> there's<00:03:21.940> no<00:03:22.180> lock<00:03:22.480> mechanism<00:03:23.160> it

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
happened there's no lock mechanism it

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.569 
happened there's no lock mechanism it
just<00:03:24.459> dangled<00:03:25.209> back<00:03:25.359> and<00:03:25.570> forth<00:03:25.780> like<00:03:25.989> that<00:03:26.019> I

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
just dangled back and forth like that I

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.940 
just dangled back and forth like that I
can't<00:03:27.579> recommend<00:03:27.850> that<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:29.319> only<00:03:29.530> reason<00:03:29.829> I

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
can't recommend that the only reason I

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:40.170 
can't recommend that the only reason I
kept<00:03:34.440> is<00:03:35.609> because<00:03:36.609> I<00:03:36.850> do<00:03:36.910> videos<00:03:38.819> this<00:03:39.819> allows

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
kept is because I do videos this allows

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:48.450 
kept is because I do videos this allows
me<00:03:40.510> to

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.960 

hold<00:03:49.360> it<00:03:49.510> as<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.720> like<00:03:50.200> a<00:03:50.230> stabilizer<00:03:50.890> if<00:03:51.820> I'm

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
hold it as a like a stabilizer if I'm

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.020 
hold it as a like a stabilizer if I'm
running<00:03:52.360> around<00:03:52.480> or<00:03:52.990> or<00:03:54.300> or<00:03:55.300> on<00:03:56.020> the<00:03:56.170> move<00:03:56.440> I

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
running around or or or on the move I

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.520 
running around or or or on the move I
would<00:03:58.030> do<00:03:58.270> this<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.720> just<00:03:58.930> just<00:03:59.140> carry<00:03:59.440> it

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
would do this and just just carry it

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.330 
would do this and just just carry it
around<00:03:59.650> i<00:04:00.070> stabilize<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.120> shot<00:04:01.360> really<00:04:01.660> well

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
around i stabilize the shot really well

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.130 
around i stabilize the shot really well
and<00:04:03.340> sure<00:04:03.970> beats<00:04:04.180> going<00:04:04.540> buying<00:04:04.720> another<00:04:05.020> one

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
and sure beats going buying another one

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.340 
and sure beats going buying another one
so<00:04:05.950> it<00:04:06.730> does<00:04:06.940> kind<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.270> double<00:04:07.570> duty<00:04:07.810> for<00:04:08.020> me<00:04:08.050> so

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
so it does kind of double duty for me so

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.440 
so it does kind of double duty for me so
that's<00:04:08.470> why<00:04:08.680> I'm<00:04:08.800> keeping<00:04:09.220> it<00:04:09.340> but<00:04:10.120> if<00:04:10.300> you're

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
that's why I'm keeping it but if you're

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.700 
that's why I'm keeping it but if you're
just<00:04:10.740> planning<00:04:11.740> to<00:04:11.920> keep<00:04:12.220> it<00:04:12.430> just<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:13.660> you<00:04:13.720> do

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
just planning to keep it just so you do

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.780 
just planning to keep it just so you do
your<00:04:15.750> portrait<00:04:16.750> or<00:04:16.870> landscape<00:04:17.550> and<00:04:18.550> you're

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790
