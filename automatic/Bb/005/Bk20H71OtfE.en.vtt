minute off there we can see that we've
cut<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.309> polystyrene<00:00:11.700> arm<00:00:12.950> which<00:00:13.950> matched<00:00:14.400> the

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
cut a polystyrene arm which matched the

cut a polystyrene arm which matched the
arm<00:00:17.220> on<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.460> drawings<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.240> we've<00:00:18.449> cut<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:19.170> by

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
arm on the drawings so we've cut that by

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.370 
arm on the drawings so we've cut that by
using<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:20.300> we've<00:00:21.300> traced<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.960> with<00:00:22.140> good

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
using it we've traced it with good

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.500 
using it we've traced it with good
plastic<00:00:22.949> we<00:00:23.369> trace<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.699> plastic<00:00:24.210> onto<00:00:24.359> the

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
plastic we trace the plastic onto the

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.050 
plastic we trace the plastic onto the
polystyrene<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.320> now<00:00:25.949> we<00:00:26.010> have<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.789> place

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
polystyrene and now we have it in place

it's the way out of the new squeeze you
jus<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.280> was<00:00:47.280> thinking<00:00:47.399> if<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:47.879> could<00:00:47.910> invent<00:00:48.300> to

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
jus I was thinking if we could invent to

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.090 
jus I was thinking if we could invent to
get<00:00:48.600> hand<00:00:48.809> lotion<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.440> cement<00:00:49.770> we'd<00:00:49.980> be

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
get hand lotion in the cement we'd be

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.470 
get hand lotion in the cement we'd be
doing<00:00:50.250> well<00:00:50.520> wouldn't<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:50.850> would<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> new

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
doing well wouldn't we would have a new

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.270 
doing well wouldn't we would have a new
invention<00:00:51.809> totally<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.949> she's<00:00:53.100> spreading

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
invention totally so she's spreading

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.799 
invention totally so she's spreading
that<00:00:53.550> out<00:00:53.730> now<00:00:53.879> what<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.090> want<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> show<00:00:54.539> Apple

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
that out now what I want to show Apple

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.060 
that out now what I want to show Apple
is<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> bit<00:00:55.289> hard<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.559> spread<00:00:55.860> because

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
is if it's a bit hard to spread because

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.160 
is if it's a bit hard to spread because
it's<00:00:56.370> tipsy<00:00:56.760> up<00:00:56.910> likes<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.420> cling<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.960> mesh

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
it's tipsy up likes to cling to the mesh

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.200 
it's tipsy up likes to cling to the mesh
is<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.920> here's<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> damp<00:00:59.399> sponge<00:00:59.670> here<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.059> are

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
is it here's a damp sponge here you are

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.330 
is it here's a damp sponge here you are
and<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:01.109> will<00:01:01.289> help<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.160> little

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and that will help you see the little

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.929 
and that will help you see the little
bit<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.640> dampness<00:01:02.969> will<00:01:03.750> spread<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.400> over<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
bit of dampness will spread it over and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.670 
bit of dampness will spread it over and
if<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.180> needs<00:01:06.420> more<00:01:06.659> water<00:01:06.930> I'll<00:01:07.260> bring<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.560> out

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
if it needs more water I'll bring it out

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.200 
if it needs more water I'll bring it out
for<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.070> might<00:01:08.189> be<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> bit<00:01:08.610> driving<00:01:08.909> before

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
for you it might be a bit driving before

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.390 
for you it might be a bit driving before
but<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.710> if<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.860> put<00:01:10.979> your<00:01:11.040> finger<00:01:11.250> there

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
but that so if you put your finger there

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.970 
but that so if you put your finger there
because<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.850> need<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.060> feel<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.450> control

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
because you need to feel the control

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.900 
because you need to feel the control
and<00:01:14.070> spread<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.240> over<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.520> rub<00:01:17.790> it

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
and spread that over and really rub it

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.150 
and spread that over and really rub it
in<00:01:18.000> your<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.270> sort<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.450> masking<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.380> then

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
in your just sort of masking it and then

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.530 
in your just sort of masking it and then
we've<00:01:20.310> got<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.550> get<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:20.910> that<00:01:21.090> that's<00:01:21.270> it

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
we've got to get it on that that's it

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.240 
we've got to get it on that that's it
doesn't<00:01:22.410> matter<00:01:22.530> what<00:01:22.620> Wiggles<00:01:22.920> eviction

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
doesn't matter what Wiggles eviction

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.650 
doesn't matter what Wiggles eviction
always<00:01:23.460> fix<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:23.940> then<00:01:24.000> you've<00:01:24.480> got<00:01:24.510> to

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
always fix it and then you've got to

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.390 
always fix it and then you've got to
plunge<00:01:24.870> it<00:01:25.020> down<00:01:25.170> into<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.560> side<00:01:25.800> so<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
plunge it down into the side so the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.220 
plunge it down into the side so the
whole<00:01:26.580> thing<00:01:26.850> should<00:01:27.120> be<00:01:27.270> no<00:01:27.420> polystyrene

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
whole thing should be no polystyrene

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.870 
whole thing should be no polystyrene
showing<00:01:28.650> then<00:01:29.310> we're<00:01:29.430> going<00:01:29.550> to<00:01:29.610> put<00:01:29.730> a<00:01:29.790> little

showing then we're going to put a little

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.400 
showing then we're going to put a little
bit<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.120> mesh<00:01:30.330> on<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.630> top<00:01:30.870> when<00:01:31.050> we've<00:01:31.200> done

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
bit of mesh on the top when we've done

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.090 
bit of mesh on the top when we've done

keep going there but yeah we'd open de
Chardin<00:01:37.890> more<00:01:38.100> yet<00:01:38.630> but<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.750> will<00:01:39.780> need<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
Chardin more yet but we will need a

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.350 
Chardin more yet but we will need a
movie<00:01:40.590> there<00:01:41.160> you<00:01:41.250> go<00:01:41.400> see<00:01:41.610> your<00:01:41.730> dad<00:01:41.880> sponges

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
movie there you go see your dad sponges

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.320 
movie there you go see your dad sponges
so<00:01:42.990> we've<00:01:43.140> coated<00:01:43.410> the<00:01:43.620> polystyrene<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:45.030> you

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
so we've coated the polystyrene but you

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.910 
so we've coated the polystyrene but you
can<00:01:45.450> see<00:01:45.660> down<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:46.050> we<00:01:46.170> can<00:01:46.290> still<00:01:46.530> see<00:01:46.710> mesh

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
can see down here we can still see mesh

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.190 
can see down here we can still see mesh
everywhere<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.700> we're<00:01:47.850> going<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.240> then<00:01:48.450> bring

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
everywhere so we're going to then bring

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.990 
everywhere so we're going to then bring
it<00:01:49.320> over<00:01:49.800> and<00:01:49.950> feel<00:01:50.190> that's<00:01:50.460> right<00:01:50.700> there's<00:01:50.880> no

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
it over and feel that's right there's no

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.100 
it over and feel that's right there's no
other<00:01:51.150> way<00:01:51.300> than<00:01:51.330> just<00:01:51.570> getting<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.930> there

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
other way than just getting in there

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.930 
other way than just getting in there
with<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.350> fingering<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.460> could<00:01:53.640> wear<00:01:53.760> gloves

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
with the fingering you could wear gloves

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.320 
with the fingering you could wear gloves
if<00:01:54.120> you<00:01:54.240> wanted<00:01:54.510> to<00:01:54.690> but<00:01:55.440> we're<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.710> okay<00:01:56.700> and

just so you it's nice feeling it's like

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.320 
just so you it's nice feeling it's like
sculpting<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.910> how<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.030> can<00:02:03.210> build

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
sculpting and this is how you can build

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.000 
sculpting and this is how you can build
shape<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.930> out<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.290> anything<00:02:04.620> by<00:02:04.770> just

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
shape so I out of anything by just

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.880 
shape so I out of anything by just
gluing<00:02:05.190> polystyrene<00:02:05.940> and<00:02:06.030> shaping<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.890> and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
gluing polystyrene and shaping it and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.210 
gluing polystyrene and shaping it and
see<00:02:08.130> it<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.630> then<00:02:09.630> see<00:02:10.290> these<00:02:10.470> scraps<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.980> mesh

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
see it and then see these scraps of mesh

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.100 
see it and then see these scraps of mesh
here<00:02:11.490> at<00:02:11.700> all<00:02:11.910> after<00:02:12.390> you've<00:02:12.540> got<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.840> sides

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
here at all after you've got the sides

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.710 
here at all after you've got the sides
done<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:14.040> cut<00:02:14.250> little<00:02:14.610> snippets<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.270> put<00:02:15.600> on

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
done just cut little snippets and put on

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.510 
done just cut little snippets and put on
the<00:02:15.810> top<00:02:15.990> see<00:02:16.200> I've<00:02:16.320> done<00:02:16.470> over<00:02:16.500> here<00:02:16.740> on<00:02:17.070> the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
the top see I've done over here on the

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.520 
the top see I've done over here on the
Apple<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.060> reinforce<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.870> we're<00:02:19.290> just<00:02:19.350> going

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
Apple to reinforce it we're just going

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.720 
Apple to reinforce it we're just going
to<00:02:19.590> put<00:02:19.680> little<00:02:19.830> bits<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.130> there<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.370> rub<00:02:20.520> some

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
to put little bits in there and rub some

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.790 
to put little bits in there and rub some
more<00:02:20.850> glue<00:02:21.000> on<00:02:21.240> and<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.570> will<00:02:21.720> dry

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
more glue on and that will dry

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.940 
more glue on and that will dry
so<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.250> just<00:02:23.520> go<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.790> do<00:02:23.910> that
