00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
other games left off do we go for a

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.369 
other games left off do we go for a
similar<00:00:42.270> type<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.480> game<00:00:42.780> do<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:42.989> take<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.290> in

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
idea phase however wouldn't it came to

that we put out that other companies put
out<00:01:34.860> there's<00:01:35.579> definitely<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> trend<00:01:36.390> toward

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
out there's definitely a trend toward

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.330 
out there's definitely a trend toward
free<00:01:36.750> realistic<00:01:37.259> graphics<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:38.070> could<00:01:38.250> have

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
free realistic graphics we could have

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.380 
free realistic graphics we could have
done<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.640> Capcom<00:01:38.880> certainly<00:01:39.299> has

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
done that Capcom certainly has

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.640 
done that Capcom certainly has
technology<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.960> they<00:01:40.020> know<00:01:40.140> how<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.290> do<00:01:40.500> that

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
technology and they know how to do that

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.410 
technology and they know how to do that
but<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.490> look<00:01:41.640> back<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.820> history<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
screen even back when we were using dots

and<00:01:58.409> pixels<00:01:58.890> when<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.790> comes<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.210> using<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
loop effects in the game we certainly

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.149 
loop effects in the game we certainly
thought<00:02:03.570> about<00:02:03.750> putting<00:02:03.899> more<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.350> in

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
thought about putting more of it in

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.739 
thought about putting more of it in
but<00:02:05.429> really<00:02:05.789> we<00:02:05.909> have<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.149> remember<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.539> is<00:02:06.659> a

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:06.749 
but really we have to remember that is a

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:08.330 
but really we have to remember that is a
fighting<00:02:06.960> game<00:02:07.109> if<00:02:07.409> there's<00:02:07.560> too<00:02:07.710> much<00:02:07.740> stuff

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
fighting game if there's too much stuff

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.380 
fighting game if there's too much stuff
going<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.879> screen

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
going on in the screen

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.880 
going on in the screen
it<00:02:09.690> would<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:09.869> be<00:02:10.019> difficult<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.470> play<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:10.800> we

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
it would just be difficult to play so we

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.140 
it would just be difficult to play so we
have<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.069> strike<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> balance<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.879> has<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.060> be

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
have to strike a balance it has to be

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.970 
have to strike a balance it has to be
clear<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.660> user<00:02:12.690> what's<00:02:13.050> happening<00:02:13.440> but

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
clear to the user what's happening but

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.259 
clear to the user what's happening but
enough<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.250> look<00:02:14.400> cool<00:02:14.610> as<00:02:14.730> well<00:02:14.879> so<00:02:15.150> if<00:02:15.209> you

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
enough to look cool as well so if you

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.610 
enough to look cool as well so if you
play<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:15.540> later<00:02:15.720> latest<00:02:16.140> version<00:02:16.500> you'll

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
play this later latest version you'll

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.770 
play this later latest version you'll
see<00:02:16.799> that<00:02:16.980> there<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:17.940> bit<00:02:18.299> of<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.660> there

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
see that there is a bit of that in there

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.180 
see that there is a bit of that in there
and<00:02:19.019> will<00:02:19.170> probably<00:02:19.470> increase<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:20.069> and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
and will probably increase it here and

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.589 
and will probably increase it here and
there<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:20.760> we<00:02:20.879> certainly<00:02:21.239> don't<00:02:21.360> want<00:02:21.540> to

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
there but we certainly don't want to

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.059 
there but we certainly don't want to
take<00:02:21.750> away<00:02:21.870> from<00:02:21.989> from<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.620> game<00:02:22.769> itself

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
take away from from the game itself

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.759 
take away from from the game itself
that's<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.459> last<00:02:23.610> thing<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.849> want<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.060> do<00:02:27.769> I

a<00:02:41.340> horribly<00:02:41.670> unbalanced<00:02:42.180> screen<00:02:42.480> I'll<00:02:43.079> say

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
a horribly unbalanced screen I'll say

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.930 
a horribly unbalanced screen I'll say
that<00:02:43.530> much<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:43.950> certainly<00:02:44.340> something's<00:02:44.819> gonna

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
that much so certainly something's gonna

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.850 
that much so certainly something's gonna
go<00:02:45.090> down<00:02:45.120> there<00:02:45.510> as<00:02:45.900> far<00:02:46.079> as<00:02:46.140> specifics<00:02:46.709> if

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
go down there as far as specifics if

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.170 
go down there as far as specifics if
there's<00:02:47.040> any<00:02:47.129> new<00:02:47.310> characters<00:02:47.760> more<00:02:47.940> old

right now what I can say is that right
now<00:02:51.690> as<00:02:51.810> we<00:02:51.930> speak<00:02:52.200> there's<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.470> location<00:02:52.739> test

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
now as we speak there's a location test

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.920 
now as we speak there's a location test
happening<00:02:53.519> in<00:02:53.610> Japanese<00:02:53.970> arcades<00:02:54.329> we're

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
happening in Japanese arcades we're

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.089 
happening in Japanese arcades we're
going<00:02:55.079> to<00:02:55.140> use<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> lot<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.650> data<00:02:55.829> there<00:02:56.069> a

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
going to use a lot of the data there a

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.589 
going to use a lot of the data there a
lot<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.400> feedback<00:02:56.790> there<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.150> decide<00:02:57.390> on

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
lot of the feedback there to decide on

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.539 
lot of the feedback there to decide on
if<00:02:58.290> we<00:02:58.470> should<00:02:58.590> put<00:02:58.709> more<00:02:58.739> new<00:02:58.980> characters<00:02:59.400> in

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
if we should put more new characters in

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.619 
if we should put more new characters in
if<00:02:59.640> we<00:02:59.700> should<00:02:59.849> put<00:02:59.970> more<00:03:00.060> old<00:03:00.209> characters

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
if we should put more old characters

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.449 
if we should put more old characters
then<00:03:00.780> how<00:03:00.989> many<00:03:01.049> of<00:03:01.440> each<00:03:01.590> these<00:03:02.340> are

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
then how many of each these are

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.520 
then how many of each these are
decisions<00:03:02.819> that<00:03:02.910> have<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.090> be<00:03:03.239> made<00:03:03.540> once<00:03:04.410> we

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
decisions that have to be made once we

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.809 
decisions that have to be made once we
know<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.680> good<00:03:04.890> direction<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.340> go<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.670> way

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
know a good direction to go that way

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.550 
know a good direction to go that way
we'll<00:03:06.120> aim<00:03:06.359> for<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.690> summer<00:03:06.959> release<00:03:07.290> and

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
we'll aim for the summer release and

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.869 
we'll aim for the summer release and
you'll<00:03:07.769> have<00:03:07.859> a<00:03:07.920> much<00:03:08.160> better<00:03:08.310> idea<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:08.790> the

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
you'll have a much better idea in the

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.069 
you'll have a much better idea in the
coming<00:03:09.120> months<00:03:09.359> so<00:03:09.389> exactly<00:03:09.900> how<00:03:09.989> that's

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
coming months so exactly how that's

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:15.120 
coming months so exactly how that's
going<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.349> shape<00:03:10.500> up

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130

you<00:03:43.430> know<00:03:43.490> arcades<00:03:43.880> are<00:03:44.060> still<00:03:44.300> there<00:03:44.450> and

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
you know arcades are still there and

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.880 
you know arcades are still there and
maybe<00:03:44.720> we<00:03:44.870> can<00:03:45.050> do<00:03:45.230> our<00:03:45.320> part<00:03:45.380> to<00:03:45.650> bring<00:03:45.740> him

maybe we can do our part to bring him
back

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239

hi<00:03:53.170> let<00:03:54.170> me<00:03:54.200> preface<00:03:54.470> this<00:03:54.650> by<00:03:54.770> saying<00:03:54.920> that

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
hi let me preface this by saying that

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.560 
hi let me preface this by saying that
right<00:03:55.400> now<00:03:55.459> we've<00:03:55.790> definitely<00:03:56.030> got<00:03:56.330> our<00:03:56.420> hands

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
right now we've definitely got our hands

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.940 
right now we've definitely got our hands
full<00:03:56.720> getting<00:03:56.959> their<00:03:57.050> cave<00:03:57.260> game<00:03:57.440> finished<00:03:57.800> up

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
full getting their cave game finished up

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.350 
full getting their cave game finished up
so<00:03:58.459> we're<00:03:58.580> not<00:03:58.640> really<00:03:58.820> at<00:03:58.970> a<00:03:59.000> point<00:03:59.120> where<00:03:59.300> you

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
so we're not really at a point where you

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.910 
so we're not really at a point where you
can<00:03:59.450> talk<00:03:59.630> too<00:03:59.810> much<00:03:59.930> about<00:03:59.989> home<00:04:00.380> conversions

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
can talk too much about home conversions

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.699 
can talk too much about home conversions
what<00:04:01.100> I<00:04:01.130> can<00:04:01.370> say<00:04:01.580> is<00:04:01.730> we're<00:04:01.880> certainly<00:04:02.420> on<00:04:03.200> the

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
what I can say is we're certainly on the

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:04.900 
what I can say is we're certainly on the
path<00:04:03.860> to<00:04:04.040> getting<00:04:04.100> as<00:04:04.280> many<00:04:04.370> people<00:04:04.489> to<00:04:04.760> play

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
path to getting as many people to play

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.160 
path to getting as many people to play
the<00:04:04.940> game<00:04:05.090> as<00:04:05.300> possible<00:04:05.480> it's<00:04:05.810> certainly<00:04:06.020> our

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
the game as possible it's certainly our

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.440 
the game as possible it's certainly our
goal<00:04:06.380> so<00:04:07.130> for<00:04:07.310> what<00:04:07.430> it's<00:04:07.550> worth<00:04:07.610> we<00:04:07.970> may

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
goal so for what it's worth we may

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.760 
goal so for what it's worth we may
indeed<00:04:08.720> see<00:04:08.959> some<00:04:09.140> sort<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.350> movement<00:04:09.560> that

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
indeed see some sort of movement that

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.650 
indeed see some sort of movement that
direction<00:04:10.070> certainly<00:04:10.940> if<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.090> fans<00:04:11.300> want<00:04:11.570> it

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
we'd like to do is take a slightly

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.850 
we'd like to do is take a slightly
different<00:04:35.960> or<00:04:36.200> person<00:04:36.470> what<00:04:36.590> you've<00:04:36.680> seen

might<00:04:39.140> be<00:04:39.169> a<00:04:39.290> little<00:04:39.440> vague<00:04:39.560> but<00:04:39.890> let's<00:04:40.070> think

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160

the same rules but there's lots of ways

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.430 
the same rules but there's lots of ways
to<00:04:43.460> play<00:04:43.669> chess<00:04:44.000> you<00:04:44.030> have<00:04:44.270> casual<00:04:44.690> people

of<00:04:51.500> different<00:04:51.770> levels<00:04:52.040> we<00:04:52.160> think<00:04:52.340> that<00:04:52.430> Street

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
of different levels we think that Street

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.190 
of different levels we think that Street
Fighter<00:04:52.790> is<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:52.970> same<00:04:53.180> way<00:04:53.330> so<00:04:53.900> we<00:04:53.930> need<00:04:54.050> to

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
Fighter is the same way so we need to

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.840 
Fighter is the same way so we need to
concentrate<00:04:54.560> on<00:04:54.710> if<00:04:54.979> let<00:04:55.160> me<00:04:55.250> do<00:04:55.400> online

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
concentrate on if let me do online

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.670 
concentrate on if let me do online
functionality<00:04:56.270> for<00:04:56.720> a<00:04:56.780> home<00:04:56.930> version<00:04:57.110> would

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
functionality for a home version would

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.380 
functionality for a home version would
be<00:04:57.740> to<00:04:58.010> allow<00:04:58.310> these<00:04:58.550> different<00:04:58.910> layers<00:04:59.090> these

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
be to allow these different layers these

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.940 
be to allow these different layers these
different<00:04:59.720> skill<00:04:59.960> levels<00:05:00.290> to<00:05:00.410> be<00:05:00.530> separate

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
different skill levels to be separate

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.000 
different skill levels to be separate
and<00:05:01.910> really<00:05:02.360> kind<00:05:02.600> of<00:05:02.710> you<00:05:03.710> know<00:05:03.800> get<00:05:03.919> the
