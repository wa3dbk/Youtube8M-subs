00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
shift lock all shift lock is a technique

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.200 
shift lock all shift lock is a technique
that<00:00:10.139> real<00:00:10.740> drifters<00:00:11.250> use<00:00:11.580> it's<00:00:11.849> when<00:00:12.030> they

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
that real drifters use it's when they

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.079 
that real drifters use it's when they
shift<00:00:13.170> down<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> gear<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:14.070> break<00:00:14.340> traction<00:00:14.700> in

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
shift down a gear to break traction in

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.029 
shift down a gear to break traction in
the<00:00:15.120> rear<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.509> get<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.080> rear<00:00:16.289> end<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.740> step

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
the rear and get the rear end to step

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.090 
the rear and get the rear end to step
out<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.539> Gran<00:00:18.539> Turismo<00:00:18.869> it's<00:00:19.410> kind<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.830> hard<00:00:20.010> to

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
out in Gran Turismo it's kind of hard to

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.870 
out in Gran Turismo it's kind of hard to
do<00:00:20.310> because<00:00:20.550> there's<00:00:21.090> no<00:00:21.529> real<00:00:22.529> clutch<00:00:23.160> per<00:00:23.609> se

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
do because there's no real clutch per se

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
do because there's no real clutch per se
unless<00:00:24.449> you're<00:00:24.750> lucky<00:00:25.140> enough<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.500> have<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.650> g25

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
unless you're lucky enough to have a g25

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.720 
unless you're lucky enough to have a g25
but<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.990> do<00:00:28.050> find<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.949> technique<00:00:29.369> shift

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
but I do find that the technique shift

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.440 
but I do find that the technique shift
lock<00:00:29.880> does<00:00:30.210> work<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.630> Gran<00:00:30.869> Turismo<00:00:31.109> as<00:00:31.590> well

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
lock does work in Gran Turismo as well

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.209 
lock does work in Gran Turismo as well
so<00:00:33.450> let's<00:00:33.719> try<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.230> demonstrate<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.950> for<00:00:35.160> you

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
so let's try and demonstrate it for you

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.250 
so let's try and demonstrate it for you
Jeff<00:00:35.730> Locke<00:00:36.000> you're<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.780> be<00:00:36.989> in

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
Jeff Locke you're just going to be in

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.360 
Jeff Locke you're just going to be in
one<00:00:38.250> gear<00:00:38.579> higher<00:00:38.969> than<00:00:39.710> you<00:00:40.710> would<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
one gear higher than you would for the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.090 
one gear higher than you would for the
corner<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.270> shift<00:00:42.690> down<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> lower<00:00:43.680> gear

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
corner just shift down to the lower gear

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.459 
corner just shift down to the lower gear
as<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.030> turn<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.450> corner<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.989> that

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
as you can turn the corner and that

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.310 
as you can turn the corner and that
should<00:00:46.739> stop<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> back<00:00:47.399> end<00:00:47.640> up<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.170> it<00:00:49.170> will

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
should stop the back end up and it will

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.580 
should stop the back end up and it will
come<00:00:49.559> around<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.420> it's<00:00:51.420> primarily<00:00:51.989> used

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
come around on you it's primarily used

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.240 
come around on you it's primarily used
on<00:00:52.949> high<00:00:53.460> speed<00:00:53.520> corners<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.629> doing<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.250> low

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
on high speed corners of doing it on low

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.549 
on high speed corners of doing it on low
speed<00:00:56.309> corners<00:00:57.149> or<00:00:57.360> high<00:00:57.539> breaking<00:00:57.870> car<00:00:58.350> is

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
speed corners or high breaking car is

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.160 
speed corners or high breaking car is
kind<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.070> tough<00:00:59.359> so<00:01:00.359> let's<00:01:00.600> try<00:01:00.930> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
kind of tough so let's try and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.500 
kind of tough so let's try and
demonstrate<00:01:01.460> shift<00:01:02.460> lock<00:01:02.699> for<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.359> this

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
demonstrate shift lock for you on this

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.390 
demonstrate shift lock for you on this

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
final quarter off Fuji just want to be a

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.990 
final quarter off Fuji just want to be a
gear<00:01:48.729> hire<00:01:49.440> shift<00:01:50.440> to<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.740> lower<00:01:50.920> gear<00:01:51.250> steps

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
gear hire shift to the lower gear steps

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.340 
gear hire shift to the lower gear steps
the<00:01:52.210> back<00:01:52.390> out<00:01:52.660> like<00:01:52.900> so<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.750> start<00:01:56.200> your

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
the back out like so and start your

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:04.790 
the back out like so and start your
drink<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.670> shift<00:02:01.150> lock<00:02:01.360> is<00:02:01.660> a<00:02:01.780> technique<00:02:02.440> that

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
drink so shift lock is a technique that

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.249 
drink so shift lock is a technique that
usually<00:02:05.800> works<00:02:06.039> if<00:02:06.610> you're<00:02:07.000> you<00:02:07.899> know<00:02:08.050> what

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
usually works if you're you know what

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.710 
usually works if you're you know what
gear<00:02:08.729> corner<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:10.000> go<00:02:10.179> in<00:02:12.090> once<00:02:13.090> again<00:02:13.480> it's

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
gear corner to go in once again it's

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.560 
gear corner to go in once again it's
primarily<00:02:14.500> used<00:02:14.890> on<00:02:15.220> those<00:02:15.459> fast<00:02:15.940> corners

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
primarily used on those fast corners

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.130 
primarily used on those fast corners
where<00:02:17.440> little<00:02:17.830> breaking<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.430> needed<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:20.050> on

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
where little breaking is needed so on

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.050 
where little breaking is needed so on
these<00:02:20.380> corners<00:02:20.860> where<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:21.520> have<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.820> brake

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
these corners where you have to brake

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.190 
these corners where you have to brake
hard<00:02:22.360> i<00:02:22.780> usually<00:02:23.470> don't<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.489> shift<00:02:24.820> lock

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
hard i usually don't I and shift lock

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.420 
hard i usually don't I and shift lock
usually<00:02:26.200> stick<00:02:26.440> with<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.739> other<00:02:26.860> techniques

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
usually stick with the other techniques

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:35.520 
usually stick with the other techniques
of<00:02:27.670> painting<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.880> feather<00:02:31.600> final<00:02:32.380> three<00:02:34.530> but

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
of painting and feather final three but

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.310 
of painting and feather final three but
this<00:02:35.709> next<00:02:35.920> corner<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.519> we're<00:02:36.700> going<00:02:36.880> to

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
this next corner that we're going to

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.350 
this next corner that we're going to
enter<00:02:38.320> is<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.500> good<00:02:38.890> corner<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.580> demonstrate

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
enter is a good corner to demonstrate

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.170 
enter is a good corner to demonstrate
shift<00:02:40.720> lock<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.860> let's<00:02:42.100> go<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.489> higher<00:02:42.820> gear

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
shift lock so let's go to higher gear

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.170 
shift lock so let's go to higher gear
that's<00:02:43.450> necessary<00:02:44.170> right<00:02:45.040> before<00:02:45.250> we<00:02:45.700> come<00:02:45.970> in

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
that's necessary right before we come in

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.810 
that's necessary right before we come in
we<00:02:46.209> ship<00:02:46.600> down<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.190> gets<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.610> back

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
we ship down and that gets the back

00:02:48.820 --> 00:03:07.740 
we ship down and that gets the back
stepped<00:02:49.299> out

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:15.539 

so<00:03:08.750> let's<00:03:08.989> try<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.349> on<00:03:09.590> this<00:03:09.829> low<00:03:10.790> speed<00:03:11.209> corner

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.190 

let's<00:03:16.549> get<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.970> back<00:03:17.180> out<00:03:17.420> and<00:03:17.720> somebody

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
let's get the back out and somebody

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.500 
let's get the back out and somebody
catch<00:03:18.709> it<00:03:19.959> accelerate<00:03:20.959> through<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:23.180> practice

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
catch it accelerate through so practice

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.099 
catch it accelerate through so practice
shift<00:03:24.079> lock<00:03:24.290> buy<00:03:24.650> or<00:03:24.829> sell<00:03:25.069> from<00:03:25.569> fast<00:03:26.569> corners

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
shift lock buy or sell from fast corners

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.360 
shift lock buy or sell from fast corners
or<00:03:27.319> wherever<00:03:27.590> you<00:03:27.739> feel<00:03:27.950> like<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.340> need

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
or wherever you feel like you need

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.879 
or wherever you feel like you need
little<00:03:28.819> breaking<00:03:29.420> it<00:03:29.780> does<00:03:30.109> just<00:03:30.500> break

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
little breaking it does just break

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.720 
little breaking it does just break
traction<00:03:31.250> right<00:03:31.819> as<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.209> enter<00:03:32.359> the<00:03:32.540> corner

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
traction right as you enter the corner

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.750 
traction right as you enter the corner
so<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:34.819> just<00:03:35.000> want<00:03:35.239> to<00:03:35.299> be<00:03:35.450> in<00:03:35.569> gear<00:03:35.930> higher

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
so you just want to be in gear higher

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.699 
so you just want to be in gear higher
before<00:03:37.760> you<00:03:38.150> just<00:03:38.359> want<00:03:38.599> to<00:03:38.629> shift<00:03:38.930> down<00:03:39.049> that

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
before you just want to shift down that

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:45.069 
before you just want to shift down that
gets<00:03:39.889> about<00:03:40.250> lighting<00:03:41.120> for<00:03:41.540> you<00:03:43.810> so<00:03:44.810> this<00:03:45.049> is

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
gets about lighting for you so this is

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.959 
gets about lighting for you so this is
just<00:03:45.409> another<00:03:45.680> way<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.280> initiate<00:03:47.239> your<00:03:47.659> drift
