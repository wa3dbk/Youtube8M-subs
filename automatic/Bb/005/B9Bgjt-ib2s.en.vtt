00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:12.370
 We introduce how to attack when this side left one and became 5 to 6 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.670
 I'm currently quite doing a lot of team 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.420
 Side and side 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.430
 Cross 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.970
 Cross from the play side 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.670
 I think I will go into the post as it is 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:33.070
 I will return to myself 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.110
 That's why I 'm doing quite well, so why not collect the defense in the center 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.910
 Gather 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.160
 At that time 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:46.910
 I will collect it in the center again and spread it outside to create a large space to attack 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.240
 I think it is an intention, but let's make some improvements 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.180
 Side is 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:57.200
 Until I cut it and put it in the post 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.930
 Cross unchanged Let's go into the post 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.210
 Let's enter the post 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.449
 Also one of the results will return but I 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.820
 Abandoned people keep in steps 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.800
 there 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.260
 Without balls 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.520
 Do cross 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.520
 Cross without a loan 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.180
 When it becomes 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:25.750
 This defense is dead at this time to suppress the front I do not have Markman 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.930
 If there is no mark beans, it will be here 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.909
 S 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.810
 Do you see a large space here? 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.810
 It is this part 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.880
 this part 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.880
 I want to use this part well 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:50.280
 By say 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:51.440
 The post will be attacking in line with that taking center position 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:58.770
 Beat 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:01.700
 Teku enthusiastic number of crew And After the post opens post Science 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.480
 Going to be in over pharynx 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.930
 Shift 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.130
 Also the minced meat pass 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.960
 tomorrow 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.510
 The wind Tteyuu 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.690
 Make a large space 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:19.120
 You can attack 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:23.040
 As a way of thinking, where do you create space and how to attack 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:30.209
 Even if one person leaves when at a numerical disadvantage 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:33.150
 Where do you create space, create numerically equal situations and attack them there or 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.830
 How to use the numerical disadvantage situation 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:41.930
 I think that the point is to make 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:44.130
 As it is something you can do for a few minutes, how about making a reference ? 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.750
 A committee of team you're doing now 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.140
 It is interesting if you try 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.140
 Then
