thinking yeah i just want to try the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.770 
thinking yeah i just want to try the
regular<00:02:39.080> one<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:40.150> matching<00:02:41.150> pipe<00:02:41.360> for<00:02:41.630> this

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
regular one a matching pipe for this

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.070 
regular one a matching pipe for this
would<00:02:41.959> be<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.200> works<00:02:42.410> 2013<00:02:43.370> pipe<00:02:43.930> this<00:02:44.930> is

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
would be the works 2013 pipe this is

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.630 
would be the works 2013 pipe this is
this<00:02:45.470> setup<00:02:45.680> just<00:02:46.100> supposed<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.459> have<00:02:46.580> a

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
this setup just supposed to have a

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.440 
this setup just supposed to have a
killer<00:02:47.090> bottom<00:02:47.630> end<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:48.459> we'll<00:02:50.020> we'll<00:02:51.020> see

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
killer bottom end so we'll we'll see

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.060 
killer bottom end so we'll we'll see
hopefully<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.750> does<00:02:53.930> from<00:02:54.320> everything<00:02:54.950> i've

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
hopefully it does from everything i've

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.470 
hopefully it does from everything i've
been<00:02:55.100> reading<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.670> hearing<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:56.620> seeing

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
been reading and hearing and and seeing

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.550 
been reading and hearing and and seeing
so<00:02:59.480> these<00:02:59.630> motors<00:03:00.050> are<00:03:00.110> supposed<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.440> be

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
so these motors are supposed to be

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.560 
so these motors are supposed to be
pretty<00:03:00.739> killer<00:03:01.130> for<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.640> price<00:03:01.940> that's<00:03:02.239> i<00:03:02.540> mean

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
pretty killer for a price that's i mean

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.350 
pretty killer for a price that's i mean
this<00:03:03.260> is<00:03:03.320> a<00:03:03.500> two-hundred-dollar<00:03:04.100> motor<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.790> a

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
this is a two-hundred-dollar motor and a

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.090 
this is a two-hundred-dollar motor and a
lot<00:03:05.630> of<00:03:05.660> people<00:03:05.959> are<00:03:06.080> racing<00:03:06.410> these<00:03:06.530> you<00:03:06.980> know

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
lot of people are racing these you know

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
against three four five hundred dollar

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.490 
against three four five hundred dollar
setups<00:03:09.410> so<00:03:09.830> I<00:03:10.150> guess<00:03:11.150> it's<00:03:11.180> uh<00:03:11.510> from<00:03:11.870> what<00:03:12.380> I've

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
setups so I guess it's uh from what I've

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.860 
setups so I guess it's uh from what I've
heard<00:03:12.530> they're<00:03:12.950> pretty<00:03:13.190> good<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:14.750> I'll<00:03:14.840> use

and then real quick i'll be running thus

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:31.540 
and then real quick i'll be running thus
a<00:04:25.130> box<00:04:26.320> this<00:04:27.320> is<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.700> 1258<00:04:29.320> for<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.550> throttle

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
a box this is the 1258 for the throttle

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.300 
a box this is the 1258 for the throttle
and<00:04:31.640> brake<00:04:31.880> this<00:04:32.600> is<00:04:32.750> like<00:04:32.960> point<00:04:33.350> 06<00:04:33.860> for

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
and brake this is like point 06 for

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.400 
and brake this is like point 06 for
speed<00:04:34.580> I<00:04:34.790> believe<00:04:35.600> it's<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.840> fastest<00:04:36.230> one

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
speed I believe it's the fastest one

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.410 
speed I believe it's the fastest one
they<00:04:36.590> makes<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:37.160> titanium<00:04:37.670> gear<00:04:37.820> fastest<00:04:38.210> one

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
they makes the titanium gear fastest one

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.890 
they makes the titanium gear fastest one
so<00:04:38.690> this<00:04:39.260> will<00:04:39.440> be<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:40.120> steering<00:04:41.120> I'm<00:04:41.660> sorry

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
so this will be the steering I'm sorry

maybe one of them has a 5955 yeah i
think<00:05:26.120> but<00:05:26.510> everything<00:05:26.990> they're<00:05:27.500> all<00:05:27.620> the

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
think but everything they're all the

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.520 
think but everything they're all the
same<00:05:28.180> so<00:05:29.180> I'm<00:05:29.270> done<00:05:29.420> decided<00:05:29.930> I<00:05:30.080> will<00:05:30.350> be

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
same so I'm done decided I will be

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.080 
same so I'm done decided I will be
running<00:05:30.680> a<00:05:30.890> lipo<00:05:31.310> for<00:05:31.670> the<00:05:31.730> receiver<00:05:32.060> pack<00:05:32.390> so

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
running a lipo for the receiver pack so

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.610 
running a lipo for the receiver pack so
it'll<00:05:35.090> be<00:05:35.120> regulated<00:05:35.900> with<00:05:36.110> this<00:05:38.470> this<00:05:39.470> is

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
it'll be regulated with this this is

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.190 
it'll be regulated with this this is
made<00:05:39.800> by<00:05:40.100> I<00:05:40.460> believe<00:05:41.180> it's<00:05:41.330> called<00:05:41.390> much<00:05:41.900> more

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
made by I believe it's called much more

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.250 
made by I believe it's called much more
much<00:05:42.590> more<00:05:42.860> whatever<00:05:43.400> that<00:05:43.990> company's<00:05:44.990> called

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
much more whatever that company's called

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.400 
much more whatever that company's called
this<00:05:46.040> will<00:05:46.220> drop<00:05:46.370> it<00:05:46.550> from<00:05:46.780> 77.2<00:05:47.780> down<00:05:48.200> to<00:05:48.380> a

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
this will drop it from 77.2 down to a

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.740 
this will drop it from 77.2 down to a
six<00:05:48.860> point<00:05:49.040> five<00:05:49.250> volts<00:05:50.170> um<00:05:52.360> and<00:05:53.360> then<00:05:53.480> i'll<00:05:53.600> be

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
six point five volts um and then i'll be

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:01.180 
six point five volts um and then i'll be
running<00:05:53.900> the<00:05:56.020> SR<00:05:57.340> 3100<00:05:59.290> so<00:06:00.290> i'm<00:06:00.770> waiting<00:06:01.010> for

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
running the SR 3100 so i'm waiting for

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.590 
running the SR 3100 so i'm waiting for
parts<00:06:01.490> parts<00:06:01.970> are<00:06:02.090> coming<00:06:02.330> in<00:06:02.420> daily<00:06:02.600> and

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
parts parts are coming in daily and

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.700 
parts parts are coming in daily and
probably<00:06:05.600> gonna<00:06:05.720> be<00:06:05.840> a<00:06:05.870> couple<00:06:06.170> weeks<00:06:06.320> before
