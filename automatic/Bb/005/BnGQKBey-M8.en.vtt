um Minnie and so I didn't think she'd be
too<00:00:34.950> affected<00:00:35.460> by<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.700> presence<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.210> him<00:00:36.480> but

too affected by the presence of him but

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.139 
too affected by the presence of him but
what<00:00:36.930> I'm<00:00:37.079> interested<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:38.219> how<00:00:38.579> he<00:00:38.640> reacts

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
what I'm interested in is how he reacts

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.060 
what I'm interested in is how he reacts
to<00:00:39.329> her<00:00:39.600> I'm<00:00:40.200> looking<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:40.649> what<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> male

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
to her I'm looking for what a male

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.100 
to her I'm looking for what a male
senses<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> female<00:00:44.700> they're<00:00:45.270> whack<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.899> bottom

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
senses a female they're whack the bottom

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.260 
senses a female they're whack the bottom
of<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> tail<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.890> fast<00:00:47.250> I've<00:00:47.550> seen<00:00:47.730> Diego<00:00:48.120> do

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
of the tail so fast I've seen Diego do

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.290 
of the tail so fast I've seen Diego do
it<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.510> gizmo<00:00:49.010> but<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.489> also<00:00:50.640> depend<00:00:51.059> on

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
it to gizmo but this can also depend on

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.080 
it to gizmo but this can also depend on
whether<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.899> female<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:53.039> ovulating<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:56.090> think

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
whether the female is ovulating I think

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.240 
whether the female is ovulating I think
I'm<00:00:57.300> not<00:00:57.420> sure<00:00:57.480> though<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.500> see<00:00:58.739> if

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
I'm not sure though but we just see if

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.039 
I'm not sure though but we just see if
it's<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.609> girl<00:00:59.840> sometimes<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.590> girls<00:01:01.829> can<00:01:03.049> go

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
it's a girl sometimes the girls can go

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.000 
it's a girl sometimes the girls can go
really<00:01:04.199> flat<00:01:04.589> um<00:01:05.720> what<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.750> mean<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.170> I've<00:01:07.530> had

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
really flat um what I mean is I've had

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.370 
really flat um what I mean is I've had
mini<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.400> gizmo<00:01:08.760> out<00:01:08.790> together<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.540> Minnie

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
mini and gizmo out together and Minnie

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.750 
mini and gizmo out together and Minnie

has gone flat on the floor won't move
and<00:01:12.150> that's<00:01:12.810> because<00:01:13.110> gizmos<00:01:13.619> bigger<00:01:13.890> than

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
and that's because gizmos bigger than

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.630 
and that's because gizmos bigger than
her<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.299> sort<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:16.400> gizmo<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.460> kind

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
her and it's just sort of gizmo is kind

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.410 
her and it's just sort of gizmo is kind
of<00:01:17.700> intimidating

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
of intimidating

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.350 
of intimidating
whereas<00:01:19.170> taking<00:01:19.710> Minnie<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.040> similar<00:01:20.850> size<00:01:21.090> so

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
whereas taking Minnie a similar size so

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.160 
whereas taking Minnie a similar size so
it<00:01:21.450> shouldn't<00:01:21.630> be<00:01:21.720> too<00:01:21.930> bad

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
it shouldn't be too bad

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.280 
it shouldn't be too bad
another<00:01:22.860> thing<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.340> happen<00:01:24.020> is<00:01:25.020> they

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
another thing that can happen is they

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.039 
another thing that can happen is they
can<00:01:25.500> hiss<00:01:25.740> each<00:01:25.920> other<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:27.180> they<00:01:27.659> might<00:01:27.869> just

she's just got a bit extra baggage at
the<00:03:17.260> back

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980
