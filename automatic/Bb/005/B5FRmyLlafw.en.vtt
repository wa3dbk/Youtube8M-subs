00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:09.340
When climbing competitions there’s a fixed schedule and a set of rules you have to stick to.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:18.680
Rock climbing is different, as you are free to choose what you want to climb.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:27.580
Already during my competition career I had rock projects in mind that I can now persue.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.400
I’ve had the sportclimb “Zauberfee“ on my mind for a while, as it is one of the hardest routes in Arco. 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:48.740
The route is rated 8c+ and is severely overhanging at a height of about 20 meters. 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.560
The first time I saw the setting with the Hermitage, I was stunned. 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:13.620
An overhanging face, which a vertical part towards the top – pretty cool!

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.960
On my first attempt I had absolutely no chance on the crux move. 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:33.240
I tried to jump for the crimp but couldn’t hold on. I had no clue how to hold the tension.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.480
I’m so psyched to climb “Zauberfee“ as the route is known to be hard for the grade. 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.500
It’s only been done by a hand full of men

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.880
...but no woman so far.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:07.520
The route consists of 40 hard moves with a difficult crux in the middle. All in all it is pretty pumpy. 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:17.500
You climb mostly on small crimps and edges that cost a lot of skin.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.100
The transformation from competition to rock climbing didn’t come easy for me.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.240
I was used to having a structured schedule

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.100
and when climbing out in nature that’s simply impossible or makes no sense.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.280
With Arco I connect the relaxed Italian lifestyle.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:02.560
It’s a small town where you always meet someone you know. 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.400
The coffee bars, the atmosphere; I like it a lot.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:24.200
I fell in love with the route immediately, despite the fact that there were three moves I couldn’t do. 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.380
Nevertheless I knew that this is a project I want to stick to. 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.480
I can’t find anything!

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.120
I’ll give it another go.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.660
Maybe I find something even better.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.480
I finally did the move!

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.060
That foothold makes the difference.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.460
Now I knew that I could do the route as a whole. 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:20.320
As the Hermitage is illuminated over night, I was even able to do attempts in the evening.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.940
When I finally did the route, I clipped the anchor being as happy as a kid on Christmas. 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.780
The feeling was just as intense as winning World Championships.
