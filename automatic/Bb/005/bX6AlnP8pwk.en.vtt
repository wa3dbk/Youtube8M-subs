one-time juggernaut type deal it gives

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.460 
one-time juggernaut type deal it gives

enough damage it gets permanently

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.000 
enough damage it gets permanently

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
pick up I don't know how long it lasts

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.520 
pick up I don't know how long it lasts
less<00:02:52.250> like<00:02:52.459> two<00:02:52.639> or<00:02:52.760> three<00:02:52.940> minutes<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.359> think

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
less like two or three minutes I think

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.509 
less like two or three minutes I think
probably<00:02:54.530> should<00:02:54.799> probably<00:02:55.010> like<00:02:55.190> a<00:02:55.250> minute

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
probably should probably like a minute

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.509 
probably should probably like a minute
and<00:02:55.609> a<00:02:55.639> half<00:02:55.790> actually

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
and a half actually

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.800 
and a half actually
and<00:02:59.709> unfortunately<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:01.519> teammates<00:03:02.090> aren't

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
and unfortunately the teammates aren't

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.500 
and unfortunately the teammates aren't
too<00:03:03.019> bright<00:03:03.319> at<00:03:03.620> grabbing<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.549> when<00:03:05.480> a

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
too bright at grabbing it when a

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.890 
too bright at grabbing it when a
impossible<00:03:06.470> but<00:03:07.299> it'll<00:03:08.299> catch<00:03:08.480> on<00:03:08.659> eventually

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
impossible but it'll catch on eventually

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.379 
impossible but it'll catch on eventually
I<00:03:09.290> mean<00:03:09.470> I<00:03:09.560> do<00:03:09.620> drop<00:03:10.099> a<00:03:10.129> lot<00:03:10.400> of<00:03:10.549> these<00:03:10.639> things

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
I mean I do drop a lot of these things

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:16.979 
I mean I do drop a lot of these things
in<00:03:11.540> games<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:12.170> we<00:03:12.920> catch<00:03:13.189> on<00:03:13.459> eventually<00:03:14.349> and

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
in games so we catch on eventually and

have recon Pro which recon at its base
what<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.519> does<00:03:25.730> is<00:03:26.209> its<00:03:26.690> paint<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:28.549> enemy<00:03:28.970> on

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
what it does is its paint the enemy on

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
the map and what I mean by painting them

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.699 
the map and what I mean by painting them
on<00:03:43.729> the<00:03:43.819> map<00:03:44.000> is<00:03:44.239> it<00:03:44.449> drops<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:44.930> little<00:03:45.019> arrow<00:03:45.409> on

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
on the map is it drops a little arrow on

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.009 
on the map is it drops a little arrow on
their<00:03:45.889> head<00:03:46.129> or<00:03:47.120> on<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.359> mini-map<00:03:47.690> you<00:03:47.900> see

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
their head or on the mini-map you see

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.929 
their head or on the mini-map you see
like<00:03:48.229> right<00:03:48.409> there

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:51.939 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.819 

and<00:03:52.939> it's<00:03:53.599> kind<00:03:53.810> of<00:03:53.840> like<00:03:53.959> it<00:03:54.110> functions

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
and it's kind of like it functions

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.509 
and it's kind of like it functions
exactly<00:03:55.189> like<00:03:55.549> a<00:03:55.579> blackbird<00:03:56.170> it<00:03:57.370> paints<00:03:58.370> them

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
exactly like a blackbird it paints them

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.509 
exactly like a blackbird it paints them
for<00:03:58.939> about<00:03:59.439> ten<00:04:00.439> seconds<00:04:00.980> I<00:04:01.069> want<00:04:01.219> to<00:04:01.340> say

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
for about ten seconds I want to say

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.009 
for about ten seconds I want to say
something<00:04:01.939> like<00:04:01.969> that<00:04:02.120> it's<00:04:02.420> not<00:04:02.599> too<00:04:02.810> long

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
something like that it's not too long

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.309 
something like that it's not too long
but<00:04:03.349> long<00:04:03.680> enough<00:04:04.269> for<00:04:05.269> a<00:04:05.329> game<00:04:05.510> like<00:04:05.540> this<00:04:05.719> but

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
but long enough for a game like this but

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.319 
but long enough for a game like this but
you<00:04:06.530> know<00:04:06.560> not<00:04:06.799> absurdly<00:04:07.400> long<00:04:09.400> so<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:11.030> this

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
you know not absurdly long so and this

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.960 
you know not absurdly long so and this
is<00:04:11.510> universal<00:04:12.109> it's<00:04:12.319> not<00:04:12.560> just<00:04:12.829> myself<00:04:13.459> who

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
is universal it's not just myself who

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:14.920 
is universal it's not just myself who
gets<00:04:14.150> this<00:04:14.329> benefit

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
gets this benefit

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.729 
gets this benefit
it<00:04:15.019> is<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.439> entire<00:04:15.799> team<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:17.389> it<00:04:18.049> is<00:04:18.199> as<00:04:18.500> far

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
it is the entire team and it is as far
