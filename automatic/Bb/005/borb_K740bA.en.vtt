it<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> successor<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:06.090> tell<00:01:07.080> survivor<00:01:07.650> now<00:01:08.369> I

I'm gonna get the first one later on for

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.500 
I'm gonna get the first one later on for
the<00:01:41.310> 3ds<00:01:41.670> all<00:01:42.150> right<00:01:43.910> one<00:01:44.910> thing<00:01:45.120> I<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.450> to

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
the 3ds all right one thing I do have to

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.150 
the 3ds all right one thing I do have to
say<00:01:45.600> about<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.930> games<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.290> even<00:01:47.040> though

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
say about the games that even though

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.180 
say about the games that even though
it's<00:01:47.310> very<00:01:47.490> text<00:01:47.910> heavy<00:01:47.970> i<00:01:48.210> think<00:01:48.720> what<00:01:49.650> keeps

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
it's very text heavy i think what keeps

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.830 
it's very text heavy i think what keeps
me<00:01:50.460> going<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.120> fact<00:01:51.330> that<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.630> really

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
me going is the fact that it's really

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.780 
me going is the fact that it's really
interactive<00:01:52.620> and<00:01:52.770> your<00:01:52.860> choices<00:01:53.040> do<00:01:53.460> matter

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
interactive and your choices do matter

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.850 
interactive and your choices do matter
so<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:54.600> let's<00:01:54.780> say<00:01:54.900> you're<00:01:55.110> late<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.440> an

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
so like let's say you're late to an

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.520 
so like let's say you're late to an
event<00:01:56.280> yeah<00:01:57.090> you're<00:01:57.330> up<00:01:57.570> you're<00:01:58.320> late<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
event yeah you're up you're late the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.160 
event yeah you're up you're late the
person<00:01:59.010> died<00:01:59.190> there's<00:01:59.490> no<00:02:00.080> workarounds<00:02:01.080> or

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
person died there's no workarounds or

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.780 
person died there's no workarounds or
anything<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.710> know<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.860> like<00:02:02.400> that<00:02:02.610> it's

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
anything you know I like that it's

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.250 
anything you know I like that it's
dynamic<00:02:04.370> also<00:02:05.370> I<00:02:05.400> think<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.240> I'm<00:02:07.080> not

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
dynamic also I think that a I'm not

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.169 
dynamic also I think that a I'm not
exactly<00:02:07.470> sure<00:02:07.650> how<00:02:08.069> then<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.729> may<00:02:08.819> will<00:02:08.970> go

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
exactly sure how then it may will go

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.839 
exactly sure how then it may will go
because<00:02:09.800> there<00:02:10.800> were<00:02:10.890> multiple<00:02:11.280> endings<00:02:11.670> in

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
because there were multiple endings in

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.420 
because there were multiple endings in
double<00:02:12.090> survivor<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:13.129> haven't<00:02:14.129> actually

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
double survivor I haven't actually

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.309 
double survivor I haven't actually

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
ending episodes that would be nice

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.870 
ending episodes that would be nice
anyways<00:02:39.530> but<00:02:40.530> there<00:02:40.680> was<00:02:40.890> one<00:02:40.920> complaint<00:02:41.520> I

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
anyways but there was one complaint I

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.240 
anyways but there was one complaint I
have<00:02:42.240> about<00:02:42.570> having<00:02:43.080> dual<00:02:43.500> survivor<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:44.040> get

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
have about having dual survivor to get

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.460 
have about having dual survivor to get
an<00:02:44.340> anime<00:02:44.700> there's<00:02:45.180> no<00:02:45.420> devil<00:02:45.840> survivor

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
an anime there's no devil survivor

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.520 
an anime there's no devil survivor
animating<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.430> think<00:02:48.210> double<00:02:48.660> survivor<00:02:49.170> is

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
animating I think double survivor is

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.830 
animating I think double survivor is
actually<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.190> lot<00:02:50.370> more<00:02:50.430> well<00:02:51.000> structured<00:02:51.630> in

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
actually a lot more well structured in

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.680 
actually a lot more well structured in
terms<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.470> survival<00:02:53.210> because<00:02:54.210> you<00:02:54.330> don't<00:02:54.480> get

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
terms of survival because you don't get

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.640 
terms of survival because you don't get

I do expect a lot from this series for
one<00:03:31.020> thing<00:03:31.050> I<00:03:32.300> expect<00:03:33.300> fanimation<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.260> be<00:03:34.410> just

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
one thing I expect fanimation to be just

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.220 
one thing I expect fanimation to be just
as<00:03:34.950> good<00:03:35.130> as<00:03:35.370> I'm<00:03:35.490> persona<00:03:35.760> 4<00:03:36.150> at<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.900> and

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
as good as I'm persona 4 at the and

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.140 
as good as I'm persona 4 at the and
hopefully<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.250> art<00:03:38.400> style<00:03:38.640> is<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.790> bit<00:03:38.910> better

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
hopefully the art style is a bit better

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.660 
hopefully the art style is a bit better
because<00:03:39.330> D<00:03:39.900> perfectly<00:03:40.350> honest<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.860> think<00:03:40.980> that

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
because D perfectly honest I think that

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.160 
because D perfectly honest I think that

looked<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.770> little<00:03:43.920> bit<00:03:44.130> weird<00:03:44.370> like<00:03:44.880> everyone

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
looked a little bit weird like everyone

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.560 
looked a little bit weird like everyone
seemed<00:03:45.570> inconsistent<00:03:46.020> leaf<00:03:46.830> at<00:03:47.280> in<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.300> face

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570
