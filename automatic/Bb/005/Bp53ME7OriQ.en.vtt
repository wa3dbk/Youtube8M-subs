00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
up and it's nice and nice and oily I

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.260 
up and it's nice and nice and oily I
guess<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:03.830> really<00:03:04.070> getting<00:03:04.250> going<00:03:04.730> go<00:03:05.240> ahead

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
guess and really getting going go ahead

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:25.420 
guess and really getting going go ahead
and<00:03:05.540> add<00:03:05.660> in<00:03:05.900> your<00:03:06.080> potato<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:07.220> stir<00:03:07.910> it<00:03:08.030> up<00:03:24.430> at

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
and add in your potato and stir it up at

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.979 
and add in your potato and stir it up at
this<00:03:25.550> point<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:25.970> can<00:03:26.120> probably<00:03:26.330> reduce<00:03:26.630> the

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
this point you can probably reduce the

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.020 
this point you can probably reduce the
heat<00:03:27.200> down<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.770> somewhere<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.370> kind<00:03:28.640> of<00:03:28.730> a<00:03:28.790> high

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
heat down to somewhere to kind of a high

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.680 
heat down to somewhere to kind of a high
medium<00:03:29.330> range<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:32.060> stir<00:03:32.870> stir<00:03:33.590> occasionally

you're<00:03:35.690> going<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:35.900> keep<00:03:36.410> it<00:03:36.590> on<00:03:36.739> this<00:03:36.920> kind<00:03:37.190> of

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
you're going to keep it on this kind of

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.729 
you're going to keep it on this kind of
a<00:03:37.370> boiling<00:03:37.640> path<00:03:38.120> for<00:03:38.510> about<00:03:39.020> four<00:03:39.440> or<00:03:39.560> five

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
a boiling path for about four or five

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.470 
a boiling path for about four or five
minutes<00:03:40.040> before<00:03:40.459> you<00:03:40.670> go<00:03:40.880> ahead<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.209> add<00:03:41.300> in

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
minutes before you go ahead and add in

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.960 
minutes before you go ahead and add in
your<00:03:41.570> next<00:03:41.780> ingredient<00:03:42.760> next<00:03:43.760> add<00:03:43.940> your

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
your next ingredient next add your

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:51.890 
your next ingredient next add your
carrots

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.410 

give<00:03:52.900> this<00:03:53.020> another<00:03:53.580> three<00:03:54.580> to<00:03:54.730> five<00:03:54.970> minutes

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
give this another three to five minutes

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.820 
give this another three to five minutes
or<00:03:55.660> so<00:03:57.600> now<00:03:58.600> is<00:03:58.720> also<00:03:59.050> a<00:03:59.080> good<00:03:59.320> time<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.740> go

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
or so now is also a good time to go

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:07.050 
or so now is also a good time to go

right at this point you can go ahead and

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:17.850
