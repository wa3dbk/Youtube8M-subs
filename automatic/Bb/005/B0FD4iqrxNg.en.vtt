00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
for students to use that it as examples

very academic and then I stopped getting

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.410 
very academic and then I stopped getting
jobs<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:19.979> also<00:01:20.369> found<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.939> students<00:01:21.270> were

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
jobs but I also found that students were

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.719 
jobs but I also found that students were
using<00:01:21.750> movies<00:01:22.140> as<00:01:22.470> historical<00:01:23.070> references<00:01:23.520> so

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
using movies as historical references so

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.550 
using movies as historical references so
instead<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.090> citing<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.509> textbook<00:01:24.900> or<00:01:25.170> actual

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
instead of citing a textbook or actual

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.960 
instead of citing a textbook or actual
history<00:01:26.009> when<00:01:26.250> talking<00:01:26.640> about<00:01:26.820> Abraham

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
history when talking about Abraham

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.999 
history when talking about Abraham
Lincoln<00:01:27.210> for<00:01:27.540> example<00:01:27.869> they<00:01:28.110> cited<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.740> movie

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
