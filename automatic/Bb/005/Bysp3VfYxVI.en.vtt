way at the bottom and then I have like a
paint<00:01:29.670> stirrer<00:01:30.000> here<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.360> kind<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.720> split<00:01:31.020> it

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
paint stirrer here I kind of split it

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.630 
paint stirrer here I kind of split it
down<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.290> middle<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.829> it's<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.549> little

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
down the middle so it's just a little

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.890 
down the middle so it's just a little
bit<00:01:32.790> narrower<00:01:34.820> this<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.000> go<00:01:36.090> ahead<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.540> scoop

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
bit narrower this is go ahead and scoop

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.149 
bit narrower this is go ahead and scoop
some<00:01:37.079> out<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.560> want<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> fill<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.100> thing

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
some out and you want to fill this thing

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.130 
some out and you want to fill this thing
completely<00:01:39.320> put<00:01:40.320> some<00:01:40.500> grease<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.740> there<00:01:42.140> put

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
completely put some grease in there put

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.740 
completely put some grease in there put
some<00:01:43.170> grease<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.619> there<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:45.829> then<00:01:46.829> as<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.070> go

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
some grease in there and then as you go

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.280 
some grease in there and then as you go
you<00:01:48.750> want<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:53.149> tamping<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.210> down<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
you want to be tamping it down so the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.730 
you want to be tamping it down so the
grease<00:01:55.470> goes<00:01:55.740> down<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.310> want<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.549> try<00:01:56.729> to

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
grease goes down you want to try to

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.069 
grease goes down you want to try to
minimize<00:01:58.740> or<00:01:59.369> get<00:01:59.670> rid<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.880> any<00:02:00.299> air<00:02:00.540> pockets

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
minimize or get rid of any air pockets

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.620 
minimize or get rid of any air pockets
in<00:02:01.259> there<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:03.000> way<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:05.090> grease<00:02:06.090> gun<00:02:06.329> works

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
in there the way this grease gun works

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.190 
in there the way this grease gun works
is<00:02:07.020> more<00:02:08.009> from<00:02:08.369> vacuum<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:08.970> actually<00:02:09.239> vacuums

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
is more from vacuum it actually vacuums

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.949 
is more from vacuum it actually vacuums
it<00:02:10.410> out<00:02:10.590> from<00:02:11.069> here<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.730> sprays<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.660> out<00:02:12.780> as

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
it out from here and sprays it out as

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.650 
it out from here and sprays it out as
opposed<00:02:13.260> to

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
opposed to

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.710 
opposed to
pushing<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.200> up<00:02:15.570> so<00:02:16.570> if<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:16.840> have<00:02:18.360> air<00:02:19.360> in

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
pushing it up so if you have air in

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:42.510 
pushing it up so if you have air in
there<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:21.130> will<00:02:21.930> lose<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:24.120> vacuum<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:41.520> want

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
there it will lose the vacuum you want

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:53.690 
there it will lose the vacuum you want
to<00:02:42.580> fill<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.820> all<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.060> way<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:44.170> top<00:02:44.350> here

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.270

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
there's going to be grease already up in

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.250 
there's going to be grease already up in

screw this down but not tight leave it
just<00:03:53.020> a<00:03:53.290> little<00:03:53.950> bit<00:03:54.100> loose

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
just a little bit loose

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.540 
just a little bit loose
now<00:03:56.140> take<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.470> screwdriver<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:57.340> you're

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
now take the screwdriver and you're

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.920 
now take the screwdriver and you're
going<00:03:57.670> to<00:03:57.730> push<00:03:57.970> this<00:03:58.209> up<00:03:58.450> from<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:58.750> bottom

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
going to push this up from the bottom

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:08.340 
going to push this up from the bottom
and<00:04:04.890> try<00:04:05.890> to<00:04:05.950> hopefully<00:04:06.640> get<00:04:07.170> some<00:04:08.170> of<00:04:08.260> the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
and try to hopefully get some of the

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.740 
and try to hopefully get some of the
area<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:08.770> then<00:04:08.950> when<00:04:09.040> this<00:04:09.220> when<00:04:09.750> grease

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
area and then when this when grease

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.930 
area and then when this when grease
starts<00:04:11.080> coming<00:04:11.380> out<00:04:11.530> from<00:04:11.770> that<00:04:11.830> little<00:04:12.250> slot

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
starts coming out from that little slot

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.390 
starts coming out from that little slot
there<00:04:13.350> then<00:04:14.350> you're<00:04:14.739> done<00:04:14.920> go<00:04:15.070> ahead<00:04:15.160> and

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
there then you're done go ahead and

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.550 
there then you're done go ahead and
tighten<00:04:15.820> this<00:04:15.940> down<00:04:16.919> like<00:04:17.919> that

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
tighten this down like that

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.650 
tighten this down like that
so<00:04:20.560> now<00:04:20.739> we<00:04:21.430> still<00:04:21.669> there's<00:04:22.240> probably<00:04:22.510> still

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
so now we still there's probably still

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.360 
so now we still there's probably still
air<00:04:22.810> in<00:04:23.050> there<00:04:23.200> so<00:04:23.230> what<00:04:23.470> we<00:04:23.590> want<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.860> do<00:04:23.950> is<00:04:24.190> to

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
air in there so what we want to do is to

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.710 
air in there so what we want to do is to
go<00:04:24.460> ahead<00:04:24.850> start<00:04:25.510> pumping<00:04:26.020> this<00:04:26.250> push<00:04:27.250> it<00:04:27.430> in

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
go ahead start pumping this push it in

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.650 
go ahead start pumping this push it in
let<00:04:28.720> it<00:04:28.840> come<00:04:28.990> out<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:29.760> start<00:04:30.760> pumping<00:04:31.030> this

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:43.320 

try<00:04:34.660> to<00:04:34.720> get<00:04:34.870> it<00:04:34.960> primed<00:04:35.290> I<00:04:41.850> have<00:04:42.850> to<00:04:42.910> push<00:04:43.090> up<00:04:43.120> a

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
try to get it primed I have to push up a

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:53.370 
try to get it primed I have to push up a
little<00:04:43.540> bit<00:04:43.630> in<00:04:43.720> here<00:04:52.080> starting<00:04:53.080> is<00:04:53.169> a<00:04:53.200> little

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
little bit in here starting is a little

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.370 
little bit in here starting is a little
bit<00:04:53.470> agrees<00:04:53.680> coming<00:04:53.950> out<00:04:54.040> the<00:04:54.160> tip<00:04:54.550> there<00:04:55.350> and

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.159 

there<00:04:59.380> now<00:04:59.740> it's<00:04:59.919> working<00:05:00.070> and<00:05:00.600> so<00:05:01.600> that<00:05:01.930> is

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
there now it's working and so that is

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.180 
there now it's working and so that is
how<00:05:02.200> you<00:05:02.850> set<00:05:03.850> one<00:05:04.030> of<00:05:04.090> these<00:05:04.180> guys<00:05:04.419> up<00:05:04.690> and<00:05:05.190> so

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
how you set one of these guys up and so

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.570 
how you set one of these guys up and so
then<00:05:06.370> as<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:07.979> need<00:05:08.979> grease<00:05:11.250> it's<00:05:12.250> like<00:05:12.370> there's

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
then as I need grease it's like there's

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.740 
then as I need grease it's like there's
probably<00:05:12.700> some<00:05:13.060> still<00:05:13.270> a<00:05:13.300> little<00:05:13.389> bit<00:05:13.540> of<00:05:13.600> air

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
probably some still a little bit of air

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.210 
probably some still a little bit of air
in<00:05:13.930> the<00:05:14.050> system<00:05:14.440> it's<00:05:14.680> just<00:05:14.830> going<00:05:14.950> to<00:05:15.040> take<00:05:15.190> a

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
in the system it's just going to take a

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:32.970 
in the system it's just going to take a
little<00:05:15.340> bit<00:05:15.460> to<00:05:15.550> get<00:05:15.639> it<00:05:15.790> worked<00:05:15.970> out<00:05:16.150> here

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.580

getting that some of the all year out of

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.970 
getting that some of the all year out of
it<00:05:38.180> what<00:05:38.660> you<00:05:38.690> can<00:05:38.750> do<00:05:38.930> is<00:05:39.139> also<00:05:39.440> hold<00:05:39.650> upside
