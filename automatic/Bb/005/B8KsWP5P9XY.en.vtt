00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
you maybe play on let's say sensitivity

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.900

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
because you control freaks actually

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.080 
because you control freaks actually
allow<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.920> make<00:00:56.100> subtle<00:00:56.489> movements<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.030> I

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
allow you to make subtle movements but I

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.880 
allow you to make subtle movements but I
don't<00:00:57.420> really<00:00:57.570> need<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.870> because<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.320> play<00:00:58.469> on

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
don't really need that because I play on

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.639 
don't really need that because I play on
a<00:00:58.920> pretty<00:00:59.280> low<00:00:59.550> sensitivity<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> don't<00:01:01.260> use

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
a pretty low sensitivity so I don't use

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.860 
a pretty low sensitivity so I don't use

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.139 
matter even though I might be editing a
video<00:01:55.409> at<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.799> point<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> thing<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.640> you

video at that point but the thing is you
can't<00:01:57.479> really<00:01:57.840> blame<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.320> layer<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.680> course

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920

playing video games ever since I was
like<00:02:04.079> three<00:02:04.439> I've<00:02:05.070> been<00:02:05.250> playing<00:02:05.460> shooters

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
like three I've been playing shooters

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.490 
like three I've been playing shooters
everything's<00:02:06.329> almost<00:02:06.479> like<00:02:06.659> five<00:02:06.960> or<00:02:07.170> six<00:02:07.290> my

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
everything's almost like five or six my

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.979 
everything's almost like five or six my
first<00:02:07.770> shooter<00:02:08.160> was<00:02:08.789> Delta<00:02:09.239> Force<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.629> don't

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
first shooter was Delta Force I don't

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:10.790 
first shooter was Delta Force I don't
know<00:02:10.170> how<00:02:10.379> many

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
know how many

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.860 
know how many
so<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.979> remember<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.550> franchise<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.420> don't

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
so you remember that franchise I don't

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.240 
so you remember that franchise I don't
think<00:02:12.960> that<00:02:13.140> they<00:02:13.350> still<00:02:13.620> make<00:02:13.830> games<00:02:14.100> they

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
think that they still make games they

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.410 
think that they still make games they
might<00:02:14.490> actually<00:02:14.700> still<00:02:15.030> may<00:02:15.120> get<00:02:15.240> mean<00:02:15.360> you

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
might actually still may get mean you

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.640 
might actually still may get mean you
know<00:02:15.540> what<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.690> might<00:02:15.990> actually<00:02:16.170> look<00:02:16.470> into

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
know what I might actually look into

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.920 
know what I might actually look into
that<00:02:16.950> after<00:02:17.700> i<00:02:17.730> finish<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.210> commentary<00:02:18.780> but

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
that after i finish this commentary but

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.870 
that after i finish this commentary but
that<00:02:19.080> was<00:02:19.170> my<00:02:19.290> first<00:02:19.500> shooter<00:02:19.950> actually<00:02:20.310> but

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
that was my first shooter actually but

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.280 
that was my first shooter actually but
the<00:02:20.940> thing<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.480> can't<00:02:21.750> really<00:02:21.990> blame<00:02:22.140> them

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
the thing is you can't really blame them

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.990 
the thing is you can't really blame them
they're<00:02:22.650> from<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.950> different<00:02:23.310> generation<00:02:23.340> they

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
they're from a different generation they

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.240 
they're from a different generation they
did<00:02:24.180> not<00:02:24.330> grow<00:02:24.630> up<00:02:24.660> playing<00:02:25.020> video<00:02:25.260> games<00:02:25.650> so

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
did not grow up playing video games so

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.340 
did not grow up playing video games so
they<00:02:26.460> won't<00:02:26.670> be<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.030> one<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.420> understand<00:02:28.050> why

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
they won't be the one to understand why

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.750 
they won't be the one to understand why
you<00:02:28.410> play<00:02:28.770> video<00:02:28.950> games<00:02:29.100> while<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.550> play

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
you play video games while you play

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.730 
you play video games while you play
video<00:02:29.910> games<00:02:30.060> as<00:02:30.390> much<00:02:30.600> as<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.870> do<00:02:31.080> it's<00:02:31.620> the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
video games as much as you do it's the

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.560 
video games as much as you do it's the
thing<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.220> i<00:02:32.250> play<00:02:32.550> video<00:02:32.850> games<00:02:33.060> i<00:02:33.390> want

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
thing is that i play video games i want

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.540 
thing is that i play video games i want
to<00:02:33.630> say<00:02:33.750> like<00:02:33.930> three<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.470> four<00:02:34.710> hours<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.070> day<00:02:35.160> I

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
to say like three to four hours a day I

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.130

don't go to school for those of you

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.540 
don't go to school for those of you

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
wondering that's why I have that much

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.940 
wondering that's why I have that much
spare<00:02:38.850> time<00:02:38.880> that's<00:02:39.330> why<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.510> also<00:02:39.800> upload<00:02:40.800> as

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
spare time that's why I also upload as

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.530 
spare time that's why I also upload as
many<00:02:40.980> videos<00:02:41.370> as<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:41.820> I<00:02:41.910> don't<00:02:42.240> go<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.390> school

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
many videos as I do I don't go to school

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.270 
many videos as I do I don't go to school
i'll<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.870> going<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.110> college<00:02:43.410> again<00:02:43.680> next<00:02:44.130> year

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
i'll be going to college again next year

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.070 
i'll be going to college again next year
so<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.850> is<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.120> but<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.390> can<00:02:45.720> pretty<00:02:45.990> much

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
so that is that but you can pretty much

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.990 
so that is that but you can pretty much
you<00:02:46.680> can't<00:02:46.980> really<00:02:47.130> blame<00:02:47.490> them<00:02:47.640> for<00:02:47.850> not

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
you can't really blame them for not

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.880 
you can't really blame them for not
understanding<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.780> we<00:02:49.170> play<00:02:49.410> video<00:02:49.710> games

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
understanding that we play video games
