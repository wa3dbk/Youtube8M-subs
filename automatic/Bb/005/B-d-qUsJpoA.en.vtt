 because I had to give up first I do not 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.599
 I am the camerlengo but I simply 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.909
 I want to make a humble analysis 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.009
 analysis because the catholic church and 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:18.750
 their representatives in this country have been 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:22.349
 charged with whipping our 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.900
 revolution talking about ethical ethics of 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.449
 corruption and it turns out that's what 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.929
 we presume the Pope Benedict 16 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.720
 is resigning because in a short time 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.350

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.630
 ambrosiano de milán a bank denounced 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.090
 is that it is the Vatican bank or a 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.980
 bank denounced for laundering the money of

 drug trafficking and the mafias 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.780
 what happened to juan pabló first so that 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.170
 let's go back a little bit good he wanted the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.300
 papa no juan pabló first wanted to assume 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.879
 and end with that because that 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.620
 strangely this bank has shares 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.350
 in a company that is responsible for 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.390

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.440
 Catholic church member and use the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.890
 condom god of mine these actions that 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.890
 put him 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.670
 of the union between the angel 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.100
 I'm really feeling in 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.720
 class when one spoke but for 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.729
 finalize who was president of the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.580
 Ambrosian bench when Juan Pablo 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.039

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.210

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.100
 Ambrosian that is happening 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.920
 that the Catholic Church called him 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.220
 makes the world to salvation I eat 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.620
 Catholic listen to me well and as a member 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.510
 of the church I believe that there is 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.520
 do it to those who are ruling today 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.810
 our church and they have not understood that 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.970
 the need of the people are other 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.770
 you have to make a profession 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.140
 of faith we are going to arrive an exam of 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.970
 conscience instead of a conclave and of 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.700
 talk about the black dad and the apocalypse 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.250
 make a message, do a test of 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.450
 conscience and not favor and do not respect the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.450
 Bolivarian revolution
