and<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:22.030> can<00:01:22.210> do<00:01:22.330> that<00:01:22.480> without<00:01:22.630> with<00:01:23.020> a

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
and you can do that without with a

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.400 
and you can do that without with a
normal<00:01:23.440> guitar<00:01:23.620> but<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:25.780> it's<00:01:26.080> a<00:01:26.170> little<00:01:26.320> bit

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
normal guitar but but it's a little bit

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.720 
normal guitar but but it's a little bit
harder<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:26.800> have<00:01:27.010> to<00:01:27.130> lose<00:01:27.280> it<00:01:27.400> you<00:01:27.550> have<00:01:27.640> to

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
harder you have to lose it you have to

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.930 
harder you have to lose it you have to
use<00:01:27.880> more<00:01:28.650> voice<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.560> with<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:32.890> scalping<00:01:33.490> you

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
use more voice so with the scalping you

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.910 
use more voice so with the scalping you
just<00:01:34.360> need<00:01:34.510> to<00:01:34.750> play<00:01:35.380> gentler<00:01:35.980> in<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:36.760> way<00:01:37.920> also

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920
