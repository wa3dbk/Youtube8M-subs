00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
for the amount of cash you get per

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.760 
for the amount of cash you get per
second<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:50.909> right<00:01:51.060> now<00:01:51.090> I'm<00:01:51.329> getting<00:01:51.770> 207

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
second so right now I'm getting 207

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.539 
second so right now I'm getting 207
dollar<00:01:53.520> more<00:01:54.000> GP<00:01:54.420> cuz<00:01:55.290> if<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.560> want<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.130> per

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
dollar more GP cuz if you want a per

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.399 
dollar more GP cuz if you want a per
second<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.659> thing<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> can

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
second and the thing is that I can

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.469 
second and the thing is that I can
upgrade<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.219> different<00:01:59.610> letters<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.329> get

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
upgrade the different letters to get

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.990 
upgrade the different letters to get
more<00:02:00.689> cash<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.350> for<00:02:01.530> example<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:02.100> agreed<00:02:02.460> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
more cash so for example I agreed the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.440 
more cash so for example I agreed the
little<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.450> by<00:02:04.079> paying<00:02:04.500> 500<00:02:05.040> dollar<00:02:05.610> then<00:02:06.240> now

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
little a by paying 500 dollar then now

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.010 
little a by paying 500 dollar then now
its<00:02:06.680> value<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.860> 200<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.879> now<00:02:08.970> I'm<00:02:09.119> galing<00:02:09.479> trend

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
its value is 200 so now I'm galing trend

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.460 
its value is 200 so now I'm galing trend
right<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:10.370> 57<00:02:11.370> dollar<00:02:11.629> per<00:02:12.629> second

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
right in 57 dollar per second

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.800 
right in 57 dollar per second
and<00:02:13.560> then<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.220> can<00:02:14.430> update<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.940> once<00:02:15.300> again<00:02:15.480> to

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
and then I can update it once again to

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.660 
and then I can update it once again to
get<00:02:15.930> more<00:02:16.110> cash<00:02:16.440> there<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.070> also<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.520> little

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
get more cash there is also the little

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.660 
get more cash there is also the little
bee<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.900> letter<00:02:19.110> B<00:02:19.320> is<00:02:19.470> inside<00:02:20.160> right

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
bee but the letter B is inside right

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.360 
bee but the letter B is inside right
here<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.180> know<00:02:21.480> if<00:02:21.570> you<00:02:21.630> can<00:02:21.810> see<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.340> but<00:02:23.340> it's

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
here I know if you can see it but it's

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.560 
here I know if you can see it but it's
inside<00:02:24.090> another<00:02:25.310> value<00:02:26.310> for<00:02:26.520> example<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.450> by

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
inside another value for example so by

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.020 
inside another value for example so by
up<00:02:27.690> drilling<00:02:27.960> be<00:02:28.260> then<00:02:28.650> upgrading<00:02:29.280> see<00:02:29.700> the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
up drilling be then upgrading see the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.000 
up drilling be then upgrading see the
bay<00:02:30.210> will<00:02:30.360> have<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> big<00:02:30.870> influence<00:02:31.170> compared

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
bay will have a big influence compared

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.370 
bay will have a big influence compared
to<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.220> little<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.300> simply<00:02:33.690> left<00:02:34.080> over

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
to the little a that is simply left over

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.530 
to the little a that is simply left over
and<00:02:34.590> doesn't<00:02:35.430> change<00:02:35.670> anything<00:02:36.210> and

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
and doesn't change anything and

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.810 
and doesn't change anything and
basically<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.770> goal<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.130> this<00:02:38.310> game<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.790> to

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
basically the goal of this game is to

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.840 
basically the goal of this game is to
get<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.420> best<00:02:39.660> combination<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:41.130> get<00:02:41.670> 1

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
get the best combination to get 1

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.570 
get the best combination to get 1
million<00:02:42.120> dollar<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.870> fastest<00:02:43.320> way<00:02:43.580> for

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
million dollar the fastest way for

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.340 
million dollar the fastest way for
example<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.000> great<00:02:45.390> deed<00:02:45.660> which<00:02:46.020> is<00:02:46.200> an

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
example a great deed which is an

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.430 
example a great deed which is an
exponential<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.760> really<00:02:47.970> gets<00:02:48.180> faster<00:02:49.020> but

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
exponential so it really gets faster but

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.260 
exponential so it really gets faster but
it<00:02:49.470> costs<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.980> lot<00:02:50.190> at<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.490> same<00:02:50.730> time<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.150> at

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
it costs a lot at the same time and at

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.100 
it costs a lot at the same time and at
the<00:02:51.300> beginning<00:02:51.660> it's<00:02:52.080> really<00:02:52.380> bad<00:02:52.590> sit<00:02:53.220> some

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
the beginning it's really bad sit some

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.110 
the beginning it's really bad sit some
multiplication<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:56.160> it's<00:02:56.310> really<00:02:56.520> good<00:02:56.820> once

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
multiplication so it's really good once

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.810 
multiplication so it's really good once
you<00:02:57.240> have<00:02:57.330> upgraded<00:02:57.780> your<00:02:58.110> letter<00:02:58.530> B<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.130> the

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
you have upgraded your letter B and the

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.199 
you have upgraded your letter B and the
later<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.300> is<00:03:00.870> simply<00:03:01.620> left<00:03:02.220> over<00:03:02.490> it's<00:03:02.850> really

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
later a is simply left over it's really

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.820 
later a is simply left over it's really
cheap<00:03:03.450> but<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.900> doesn't<00:03:04.290> really<00:03:04.470> make<00:03:04.770> any

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
cheap but it doesn't really make any

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.220 
cheap but it doesn't really make any
difference<00:03:05.570> so<00:03:06.570> yeah<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.780> keep<00:03:06.959> upgrading

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
difference so yeah you keep upgrading

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.790 
difference so yeah you keep upgrading
your<00:03:07.590> stuff<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:09.180> try<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.510> get<00:03:09.870> 1<00:03:10.500> million

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
your stuff and you try to get 1 million

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.100 
your stuff and you try to get 1 million
dollar<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.400> fastest<00:03:11.880> way<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.660> right<00:03:12.870> there<00:03:12.900> I

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
dollar the fastest way so right there I

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.590 
dollar the fastest way so right there I
managed<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.620> do<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.340> really<00:03:14.670> really<00:03:15.000> terrible

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
managed to do a really really terrible

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.810 
managed to do a really really terrible
time<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:18.170> yeah<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.500> can<00:03:19.620> also<00:03:19.860> submit<00:03:20.400> your

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
time so yeah you can also submit your

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.680 
time so yeah you can also submit your
score<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.269> go<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.739> new<00:03:23.489> grounds<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.150> score

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
score and go to the new grounds I score

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.759 
score and go to the new grounds I score
so<00:03:25.170> right<00:03:25.350> there<00:03:25.530> there<00:03:25.739> is<00:03:25.890> my<00:03:26.040> time<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:27.769> 29

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
so right there there is my time to 29

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.690 
so right there there is my time to 29
seconds<00:03:29.390> it's<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.600> really<00:03:30.870> bad<00:03:31.019> time<00:03:31.700> and

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
seconds it's the really bad time and

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.310 
seconds it's the really bad time and
yeah<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:33.720> can<00:03:33.810> simply<00:03:34.140> retry<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.150> at<00:03:36.150> first

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
yeah you can simply retry and at first

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.080 
yeah you can simply retry and at first
my<00:03:37.320> goal<00:03:37.590> was<00:03:37.739> simply<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.220> make<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.400> random<00:03:38.880> game

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
my goal was simply to make a random game

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.550 
my goal was simply to make a random game
that<00:03:39.420> wasn't<00:03:39.810> really<00:03:40.019> supposed<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.410> be

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
that wasn't really supposed to be

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.039 
that wasn't really supposed to be
released<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:42.330> try<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.200> find<00:03:43.590> out<00:03:44.540> what<00:03:45.540> time

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
released and I try to find out what time

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.229 
released and I try to find out what time
should<00:03:46.410> be<00:03:46.470> considered<00:03:47.250> good<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.700> what<00:03:47.970> time

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
should be considered good and what time

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.940 
should be considered good and what time
should<00:03:48.420> be<00:03:48.480> considered<00:03:49.140> bad<00:03:49.290> because<00:03:49.650> at<00:03:49.799> the

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
should be considered bad because at the

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.039 
should be considered bad because at the
end<00:03:49.980> I'm<00:03:50.280> saying<00:03:51.120> like<00:03:51.330> if<00:03:51.570> you<00:03:51.660> have<00:03:51.780> done

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
end I'm saying like if you have done

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.860 
end I'm saying like if you have done
below<00:03:52.860> 22<00:03:53.519> seconds<00:03:53.970> then<00:03:54.209> you're<00:03:54.360> good<00:03:54.630> and

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
below 22 seconds then you're good and

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.509 
below 22 seconds then you're good and
things<00:03:55.200> like<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.040> first<00:03:56.220> time<00:03:56.400> I've

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
things like that so the first time I've

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.940 
things like that so the first time I've
tried<00:03:56.549> it<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.269> did<00:03:57.660> random<00:03:58.140> things<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:58.769> got

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
tried it I did random things and I got

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.430 
tried it I did random things and I got
about<00:03:59.130> 30<00:03:59.519> seconds<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.720> try<00:04:01.049> to<00:04:01.080> find<00:04:01.380> out

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
about 30 seconds and I try to find out

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.380 
about 30 seconds and I try to find out
what<00:04:01.650> would<00:04:01.830> be<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.130> best<00:04:02.430> time<00:04:02.910> possible

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
what would be the best time possible

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.320 
what would be the best time possible
I've<00:04:04.170> spent<00:04:04.440> like<00:04:05.150> 15<00:04:06.150> minutes<00:04:06.500> in<00:04:07.500> order<00:04:07.650> to

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
I've spent like 15 minutes in order to

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.240 
I've spent like 15 minutes in order to
actually<00:04:09.330> try<00:04:09.900> few<00:04:10.170> things<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:10.650> have<00:04:10.860> managed

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
actually try few things I have managed

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.060 
actually try few things I have managed
to<00:04:11.280> get<00:04:11.549> 22<00:04:12.180> seconds<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:13.230> I<00:04:13.290> really<00:04:13.680> tried

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
to get 22 seconds and I really tried

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.349 
to get 22 seconds and I really tried
hard<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.580> get<00:04:14.910> that<00:04:16.340> and<00:04:17.340> then<00:04:17.700> after<00:04:18.209> a<00:04:18.239> while

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
hard to get that and then after a while

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.150 
hard to get that and then after a while
um<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:19.760> start<00:04:20.760> playing<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.269> again<00:04:21.450> and<00:04:21.959> I<00:04:22.590> found

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
um I start playing it again and I found

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.290 
um I start playing it again and I found
a<00:04:23.340> new<00:04:23.520> pattern<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:24.330> I<00:04:24.419> managed<00:04:24.750> to<00:04:24.780> get<00:04:26.180> 21.5

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
a new pattern and I managed to get 21.5

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.749 
a new pattern and I managed to get 21.5
seconds<00:04:27.780> which<00:04:27.960> is<00:04:27.990> way<00:04:28.590> better<00:04:28.889> than<00:04:29.550> the

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
seconds which is way better than the

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.719 
seconds which is way better than the
last<00:04:29.789> time<00:04:30.180> now<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.800> at<00:04:32.069> that<00:04:32.250> point<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:32.580> was

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
last time now and at that point I was

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.790 
last time now and at that point I was
sure<00:04:32.970> that<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.150> was<00:04:33.289> having<00:04:34.289> the<00:04:34.620> best

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
sure that I was having the best

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.399 
sure that I was having the best
combination<00:04:35.580> ever<00:04:35.610> and<00:04:36.150> that<00:04:36.180> this<00:04:36.479> will<00:04:37.229> be

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:37.409 
combination ever and that this will be

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.249 
combination ever and that this will be
unbeatable<00:04:38.039> but<00:04:38.430> after<00:04:39.150> like<00:04:39.449> another<00:04:39.930> hour

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
unbeatable but after like another hour

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:41.990 
unbeatable but after like another hour
and<00:04:40.590> managed<00:04:40.889> to<00:04:40.919> find<00:04:41.250> a<00:04:41.280> new<00:04:41.430> pattern<00:04:41.639> and

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
and managed to find a new pattern and

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.219 
and managed to find a new pattern and
getting<00:04:42.650> 21<00:04:43.650> seconds<00:04:44.599> record<00:04:45.599> which<00:04:46.050> is

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
getting 21 seconds record which is

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.430 
getting 21 seconds record which is
really<00:04:46.500> really<00:04:46.770> fast<00:04:47.220> um<00:04:47.780> try<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:48.840> yourself

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
really really fast um try it yourself

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.240 
really really fast um try it yourself
and<00:04:49.710> then<00:04:50.400> after<00:04:50.819> that<00:04:50.970> I've<00:04:51.389> lowered<00:04:52.250> another

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
and then after that I've lowered another

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.860 
and then after that I've lowered another
time<00:04:53.639> my<00:04:53.819> time<00:04:54.150> to<00:04:54.979> 20<00:04:55.979> point<00:04:56.419> 20<00:04:57.419> seconds

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
time my time to 20 point 20 seconds

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.680 
time my time to 20 point 20 seconds
point<00:04:58.139> six<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:59.250> then<00:04:59.639> I<00:04:59.909> was<00:05:00.120> sure<00:05:00.389> for<00:05:00.659> sure

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
point six and then I was sure for sure

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.189 
point six and then I was sure for sure
that<00:05:01.080> it<00:05:01.110> was<00:05:01.379> the<00:05:01.500> best<00:05:01.770> one<00:05:02.069> and<00:05:02.280> then<00:05:02.460> I<00:05:03.199> and

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
that it was the best one and then I and

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.839 
that it was the best one and then I and
then<00:05:04.289> I<00:05:04.530> tried<00:05:04.889> again<00:05:05.159> and<00:05:05.400> find<00:05:05.639> a<00:05:05.729> new

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
then I tried again and find a new

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.980 
then I tried again and find a new
pattern<00:05:06.090> and<00:05:06.650> 20.4<00:05:07.650> is<00:05:07.949> my<00:05:08.430> current<00:05:09.330> personnel

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
pattern and 20.4 is my current personnel

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.680 
pattern and 20.4 is my current personnel
record<00:05:10.440> I<00:05:10.710> spent<00:05:11.400> a<00:05:11.550> lot<00:05:11.789> of<00:05:11.819> time<00:05:11.909> it's<00:05:12.389> really

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
record I spent a lot of time it's really

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.189 
record I spent a lot of time it's really
a<00:05:12.840> simple<00:05:13.199> game<00:05:13.949> at<00:05:14.310> first<00:05:14.879> but<00:05:15.569> if<00:05:15.719> you<00:05:15.840> try<00:05:16.169> to

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.290 
a simple game at first but if you try to
get<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:16.949> best<00:05:17.129> cord<00:05:17.460> and<00:05:17.669> its<00:05:17.789> really<00:05:18.030> get

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
the game essentially fun just clicking

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.480 
the game essentially fun just clicking
randomly<00:05:33.120> so<00:05:33.810> what<00:05:33.990> I<00:05:34.020> want<00:05:34.680> to<00:05:34.740> do<00:05:34.919> is<00:05:35.099> that<00:05:35.400> it

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
randomly so what I want to do is that it

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.420 
randomly so what I want to do is that it
will<00:05:35.580> give<00:05:35.789> a<00:05:35.819> shout<00:05:36.210> out<00:05:36.240> to<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:36.779> top<00:05:37.430> ten

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
will give a shout out to the top ten

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.809 
will give a shout out to the top ten
people<00:05:38.729> that<00:05:39.419> will<00:05:39.599> be<00:05:39.750> in<00:05:39.810> the<00:05:39.960> ice<00:05:40.229> core

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:40.819 
people that will be in the ice core

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.689 
people that will be in the ice core
tomorrow<00:05:41.819> at<00:05:42.449> 1pm<00:05:43.289> East<00:05:43.979> Coast<00:05:44.279> it<00:05:44.430> doesn't

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
the ice core at that time will be

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.450 
the ice core at that time will be
featured<00:05:50.969> and<00:05:51.349> mentioned<00:05:52.349> in<00:05:52.529> my<00:05:52.740> next<00:05:53.069> video

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
me I've been Smosh so much time doing it

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.129 
me I've been Smosh so much time doing it
I<00:06:28.500> get<00:06:28.979> like<00:06:29.190> an<00:06:30.029> average<00:06:30.479> without<00:06:30.870> even

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 
I get like an average without even

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:35.209 
I get like an average without even
paying<00:06:31.440> attention<00:06:31.590> and<00:06:32.190> easily<00:06:32.940> do<00:06:33.529> 22<00:06:34.529> or<00:06:34.800> 21

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:35.219 
paying attention and easily do 22 or 21

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:38.209 
paying attention and easily do 22 or 21
seconds<00:06:36.029> easily<00:06:36.659> so<00:06:37.349> yeah<00:06:37.469> it's<00:06:37.649> really<00:06:37.860> a

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:38.219 
seconds easily so yeah it's really a

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:40.579 
seconds easily so yeah it's really a
strategy<00:06:39.060> game<00:06:39.240> don't<00:06:39.690> simply<00:06:39.990> do<00:06:40.169> random

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:40.589 
strategy game don't simply do random

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:40.950 
strategy game don't simply do random
things

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
things

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.659 
things
won't<00:06:41.169> really<00:06:41.319> go<00:06:41.530> far<00:06:41.800> you<00:06:42.280> really<00:06:42.490> need<00:06:42.610> to

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:42.669 
won't really go far you really need to

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:44.930 
won't really go far you really need to
pay<00:06:42.880> attention<00:06:42.910> to<00:06:43.479> the<00:06:43.600> formula<00:06:44.080> because

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
pay attention to the formula because

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.309 
pay attention to the formula because
we'll<00:06:45.940> give<00:06:46.150> you<00:06:46.270> a<00:06:46.300> little<00:06:46.479> tip<00:06:46.840> right<00:06:47.080> there

we'll give you a little tip right there

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:50.580 
we'll give you a little tip right there
the<00:06:47.830> a<00:06:48.130> value<00:06:49.090> doesn't<00:06:49.569> really<00:06:49.870> matter<00:06:50.139> at<00:06:50.410> the

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
the a value doesn't really matter at the

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.189 
the a value doesn't really matter at the
M<00:06:50.740> even<00:06:51.580> if<00:06:51.699> it's<00:06:51.910> fully<00:06:52.210> upgrade<00:06:52.720> but<00:06:52.960> at<00:06:53.080> the

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 
M even if it's fully upgrade but at the

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.499 
M even if it's fully upgrade but at the
beginning<00:06:53.380> it's<00:06:53.860> very<00:06:54.220> very<00:06:54.580> good<00:06:54.910> makes<00:06:55.360> a

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:55.509 
beginning it's very very good makes a

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:58.950 
beginning it's very very good makes a
big<00:06:55.780> difference<00:06:56.430> the<00:06:57.430> D<00:06:57.699> is<00:06:57.970> really<00:06:58.630> terrible

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
big difference the D is really terrible

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.189 
big difference the D is really terrible
for<00:06:59.199> example<00:06:59.500> 600<00:07:00.090> upgraded<00:07:01.090> I<00:07:01.210> get<00:07:01.479> eight

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:02.199 
for example 600 upgraded I get eight

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:05.760 
for example 600 upgraded I get eight
more<00:07:03.039> dollar<00:07:03.819> per<00:07:04.210> second<00:07:04.660> which<00:07:04.930> is<00:07:04.960> terrible

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770 
more dollar per second which is terrible

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.100 
more dollar per second which is terrible
and<00:07:05.919> cost<00:07:06.220> a<00:07:06.400> lot<00:07:06.669> but<00:07:06.940> at<00:07:07.300> the<00:07:07.569> end<00:07:07.599> it<00:07:08.050> really

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110 
and cost a lot but at the end it really

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.650 
and cost a lot but at the end it really
really<00:07:08.889> makes<00:07:09.220> a<00:07:09.400> big<00:07:09.430> difference<00:07:10.090> it's<00:07:10.240> it

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:10.660 
really makes a big difference it's it

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.140 
really makes a big difference it's it
doubles<00:07:11.229> the<00:07:11.500> amount<00:07:11.770> of<00:07:11.979> cash<00:07:12.190> you<00:07:12.400> make<00:07:12.580> per

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.150 
doubles the amount of cash you make per

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.909 
doubles the amount of cash you make per
second<00:07:13.599> so<00:07:13.750> it's<00:07:13.870> really<00:07:14.080> good<00:07:14.320> but<00:07:14.500> only<00:07:14.860> at

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:14.919 
second so it's really good but only at

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:16.980 
second so it's really good but only at
the<00:07:15.039> end<00:07:15.070> it<00:07:15.460> is<00:07:15.820> only<00:07:16.060> good<00:07:16.330> at<00:07:16.479> the<00:07:16.539> beginning

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
the end it is only good at the beginning

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.529 
the end it is only good at the beginning
b<00:07:17.530> and<00:07:17.680> c<00:07:17.979> if<00:07:18.070> you<00:07:18.130> want<00:07:18.370> to<00:07:18.550> upgrade<00:07:18.789> see<00:07:19.389> you

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:19.539 
b and c if you want to upgrade see you

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:22.320 
b and c if you want to upgrade see you
need<00:07:19.720> to<00:07:19.930> upgrade<00:07:20.080> be<00:07:20.590> first<00:07:21.070> there's<00:07:22.030> it's<00:07:22.270> a

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.330 
need to upgrade be first there's it's a

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.240 
need to upgrade be first there's it's a
multiplication<00:07:23.050> and<00:07:23.410> if<00:07:23.470> you<00:07:23.590> multiply

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.250 
multiplication and if you multiply

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.719 
multiplication and if you multiply
nothing<00:07:25.090> then<00:07:25.360> you<00:07:25.509> get<00:07:25.750> nothing<00:07:25.960> actually<00:07:26.740> so

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:27.729 
nothing then you get nothing actually so

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:29.040 
nothing then you get nothing actually so
yeah<00:07:27.849> that's<00:07:27.970> pretty<00:07:28.180> much<00:07:28.570> it<00:07:28.690> about<00:07:28.930> this

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.050 
yeah that's pretty much it about this

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.249 
yeah that's pretty much it about this
