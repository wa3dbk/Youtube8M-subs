up for auction on eBay I'll go through

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.430 
up for auction on eBay I'll go through
some<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.099> functions<00:00:09.050> this<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.170> what<00:00:10.320> the

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
some of the functions this is what the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:21.610 
some of the functions this is what the
base<00:00:10.590> function<00:00:11.099> on<00:00:13.460> sorry<00:00:14.460> we<00:00:14.820> turn<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.330> up

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:21.620 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.280 

one<00:00:22.460> thing<00:00:22.640> that<00:00:22.820> makes<00:00:23.000> this<00:00:23.240> base<00:00:23.630> function

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 
one thing that makes this base function

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.780 
one thing that makes this base function
not<00:00:24.740> exactly<00:00:25.160> perfect

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.790 
not exactly perfect

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.630 
not exactly perfect
is<00:00:25.900> one<00:00:26.900> of<00:00:26.930> the<00:00:27.050> bass<00:00:27.260> boost<00:00:27.620> buttons<00:00:28.100> you<00:00:28.610> can

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
is one of the bass boost buttons you can

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.990 
is one of the bass boost buttons you can
see<00:00:28.910> right<00:00:29.090> here<00:00:29.120> kind<00:00:30.110> of<00:00:30.200> sits<00:00:30.500> weird<00:00:31.000> it

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
see right here kind of sits weird it

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.830 
see right here kind of sits weird it
will<00:00:32.599> still<00:00:32.990> work<00:00:33.610> but<00:00:34.610> it<00:00:35.000> you<00:00:35.570> probably

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
will still work but it you probably

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.530 
will still work but it you probably
can't<00:00:36.050> see<00:00:36.110> it<00:00:36.430> barely<00:00:37.430> noticeable<00:00:37.970> but<00:00:38.390> it

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
can't see it barely noticeable but it

00:00:38.540 --> 00:01:02.390 
can't see it barely noticeable but it
doesn't<00:00:39.140> sit<00:00:40.000> exact<00:00:41.000> with<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.360> rest<00:00:41.570> of<00:00:41.809> them

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.180 

there's<00:01:02.940> what<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.180> base<00:01:03.360> function<00:01:04.100> turn<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
there's what the base function turn the

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.490 
there's what the base function turn the
base<00:01:05.339> function<00:01:05.760> off

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.050 

I'll<00:01:13.190> go<00:01:13.310> through<00:01:13.550> all<00:01:14.140> functions<00:01:15.910> all<00:01:16.910> the

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
I'll go through all functions all the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:38.650 
I'll go through all functions all the
keys<00:01:17.300> all<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.170> keys<00:01:18.380> do<00:01:18.650> work

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:52.750 

okay

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:17.199 

you

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.790 

this<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:19.530> timbre<00:02:19.980> button

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
this is the timbre button

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.760 
this is the timbre button
makes<00:02:22.460> it<00:02:22.640> louder<00:02:22.850> this<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.570> your<00:02:23.720> tremolo<00:02:26.770> you

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
makes it louder this is your tremolo you

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.030 
makes it louder this is your tremolo you
can<00:02:27.920> slow<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:28.250> up<00:02:29.950> make<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:30.980> fast

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
can slow it up make it fast

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.850 
can slow it up make it fast
then<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:33.939> works<00:02:34.120> with<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.360> vibrato<00:02:34.719> this<00:02:35.680> is

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
then that works with the vibrato this is

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.550 
then that works with the vibrato this is
the<00:02:35.980> vibrato<00:02:36.340> on<00:02:36.790> fast<00:02:37.500> vibrato<00:02:38.500> on<00:02:39.010> slow<00:02:40.560> no

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
the vibrato on fast vibrato on slow no

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:51.569 
the vibrato on fast vibrato on slow no
vibrato<00:02:42.040> at<00:02:42.310> all<00:02:49.470> all<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:50.709> all<00:02:50.859> really<00:02:51.280> good

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
vibrato at all all in all really good

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.160 
vibrato at all all in all really good
shape<00:02:51.849> for<00:02:52.120> as<00:02:52.239> old<00:02:52.390> as<00:02:52.569> it<00:02:52.629> is<00:02:54.720> only<00:02:55.720> slight
