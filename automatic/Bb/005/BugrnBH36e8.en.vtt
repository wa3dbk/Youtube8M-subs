like that I hardly ever eat a whole bowl
of<00:00:54.960> cereal<00:00:55.500> because<00:00:55.800> what<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:57.210> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
of cereal because what is that it's a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.330 
of cereal because what is that it's a
whole<00:00:57.570> bowl<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.840> carbs<00:00:58.440> when<00:00:59.039> do<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.309> ever

need a whole bowl of carbs never ok and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.899

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
at the labels and and I noticed that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.910 
at the labels and and I noticed that
they<00:01:38.729> looked<00:01:38.970> ok<00:01:39.390> actually<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.990> was<00:01:40.470> looking<00:01:40.650> at

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
they looked ok actually I was looking at

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.039 
they looked ok actually I was looking at
this<00:01:41.130> one<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.970> didn't<00:01:42.329> look<00:01:42.450> at<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.780> one

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
this one and I didn't look at this one

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.240 
this one and I didn't look at this one
and<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.470> would<00:01:43.619> think<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.890> they<00:01:44.100> would<00:01:44.130> be

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
and you would think that they would be

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.569 
and you would think that they would be
similar<00:01:44.640> right<00:01:45.500> well<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:47.189> Smart<00:01:47.520> Start

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
similar right well the Smart Start

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.069 
similar right well the Smart Start
healthy<00:01:48.270> heart<00:01:48.540> has<00:01:50.299> seven<00:01:51.299> grams<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.810> protein

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
healthy heart has seven grams of protein

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.800 
healthy heart has seven grams of protein
per<00:01:52.439> serving<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.280> by<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.939> way<00:01:54.180> all<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
per serving and by the way all of the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.610 
per serving and by the way all of the
cost<00:01:55.049> cereals<00:01:55.829> have<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.490> good<00:01:56.850> amount<00:01:57.060> approach

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
cost cereals have a good amount approach

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.100 
cost cereals have a good amount approach
and<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:58.220> that's<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.790> only<00:01:59.210> reason<00:01:59.360> i<00:01:59.690> buy<00:01:59.900> them

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
and so that's the only reason i buy them

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.130 
and so that's the only reason i buy them
is<00:02:00.290> because<00:02:00.470> they<00:02:00.650> do<00:02:00.860> have<00:02:01.250> protein<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:02.420> so

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
is because they do have protein and so

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.140 
is because they do have protein and so
the<00:02:03.230> kashi<00:02:03.470> cereal<00:02:03.620> has<00:02:04.280> nine<00:02:04.610> grams<00:02:04.910> of

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
the kashi cereal has nine grams of

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.490 
the kashi cereal has nine grams of
protein<00:02:05.330> per<00:02:05.570> serving<00:02:06.490> this<00:02:07.490> has<00:02:08.210> seven<00:02:08.990> it

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
protein per serving this has seven it

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.190 
protein per serving this has seven it
really<00:02:09.770> has<00:02:10.070> a<00:02:10.100> little<00:02:10.460> bit<00:02:10.700> less<00:02:11.060> because<00:02:11.510> the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
really has a little bit less because the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.130 
really has a little bit less because the
serving<00:02:12.590> size<00:02:12.860> here<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.550> little<00:02:13.820> larger<00:02:14.390> so

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
serving size here is a little larger so

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.340 
serving size here is a little larger so
five<00:02:15.530> or<00:02:15.740> six<00:02:16.210> compared<00:02:17.210> to<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.720> same<00:02:17.900> serving

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
five or six compared to the same serving

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.700 
five or six compared to the same serving
sizes<00:02:18.620> in<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.130> Kashi<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:20.210> a<00:02:20.660> little<00:02:21.230> bit<00:02:21.410> less

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
sizes in the Kashi so a little bit less

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.980 
sizes in the Kashi so a little bit less
thirty<00:02:22.190> forty<00:02:22.550> percent<00:02:22.850> less<00:02:23.090> protein<00:02:23.450> here

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
thirty forty percent less protein here

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.740 
thirty forty percent less protein here
but<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.260> does<00:02:24.470> have<00:02:24.740> some<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:25.520> of<00:02:26.210> course<00:02:26.510> I

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
but it does have some and of course I

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.970 
but it does have some and of course I
noticed<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.470> they've<00:02:28.460> got<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.970> healthy<00:02:29.600> heart

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
noticed that they've got a healthy heart

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.440 
noticed that they've got a healthy heart
formulation<00:02:30.980> which<00:02:31.160> means<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.610> has<00:02:31.640> oat<00:02:32.030> bran

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
formulation which means it has oat bran

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.940 
formulation which means it has oat bran

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
you're not going to buy it at the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.560 
you're not going to buy it at the
grocery<00:02:45.350> store<00:02:45.730> now<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:46.880> does<00:02:47.060> have<00:02:47.270> quite<00:02:47.450> a

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
grocery store now it does have quite a

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.480 
grocery store now it does have quite a
bit<00:02:47.660> of<00:02:47.780> sugar<00:02:48.250> 17<00:02:49.250> grams<00:02:49.520> of<00:02:49.820> sugar<00:02:50.210> versus<00:02:51.490> 13

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
bit of sugar 17 grams of sugar versus 13

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.090 
bit of sugar 17 grams of sugar versus 13
in<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.730> kashi<00:02:52.940> actually<00:02:53.600> i<00:02:53.630> guess<00:02:53.930> thats<00:02:54.230> yeah

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
in the kashi actually i guess thats yeah

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.620 
in the kashi actually i guess thats yeah
that<00:02:55.460> would<00:02:55.670> be<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:55.820> little<00:02:56.030> bit<00:02:56.240> more<00:02:56.450> the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
that would be a little bit more the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.780 
that would be a little bit more the
serving<00:02:56.960> sizes<00:02:57.230> more<00:02:57.710> though<00:02:57.950> too<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:58.640> maybe

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
serving sizes more though too so maybe

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.990 
serving sizes more though too so maybe
about<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.330> same<00:03:00.430> sugar<00:03:01.430> is<00:03:01.460> the<00:03:01.610> third

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
about the same sugar is the third

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.510 
about the same sugar is the third
ingredient<00:03:02.180> on<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.780> label<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.440> so<00:03:04.280> i<00:03:04.310> thought

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
ingredient on the label and so i thought

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.150 
ingredient on the label and so i thought
this<00:03:04.670> was<00:03:04.880> a<00:03:04.910> pretty<00:03:05.420> decent<00:03:06.020> cereal<00:03:06.560> like<00:03:07.010> I

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
this was a pretty decent cereal like I

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.790 
this was a pretty decent cereal like I
said<00:03:07.220> still<00:03:07.970> not<00:03:08.570> for<00:03:08.959> eating<00:03:09.110> a<00:03:09.380> whole<00:03:09.560> bowl

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
said still not for eating a whole bowl

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.960 
said still not for eating a whole bowl
of<00:03:09.830> it<00:03:10.220> with<00:03:10.370> milk<00:03:10.730> but<00:03:11.540> for<00:03:12.610> like<00:03:13.610> I<00:03:13.790> said

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
of it with milk but for like I said

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.670 
of it with milk but for like I said
sprinkling<00:03:14.450> on<00:03:14.570> yogurt<00:03:14.989> or<00:03:15.200> something<00:03:15.380> like

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
sprinkling on yogurt or something like

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.250 
sprinkling on yogurt or something like
that<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:16.190> so<00:03:16.730> then<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.209> was<00:03:17.690> looking<00:03:18.020> at<00:03:18.140> the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
that and so then I was looking at the

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.680 
that and so then I was looking at the
label<00:03:18.590> after<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:18.920> got<00:03:19.130> home<00:03:19.430> on<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:20.330> smart

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
label after I got home on the smart

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.979 
label after I got home on the smart
start<00:03:21.440> with<00:03:21.850> antioxidants<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.060> so<00:03:23.690> I<00:03:23.720> thought

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
start with antioxidants and so I thought

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.870 
start with antioxidants and so I thought
oh<00:03:24.170> this<00:03:24.230> sounds<00:03:24.650> really<00:03:25.040> great<00:03:25.400> it's<00:03:25.640> got

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
oh this sounds really great it's got

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.780 
oh this sounds really great it's got
antioxidants<00:03:26.630> AC<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.950> he<00:03:28.040> basically<00:03:28.489> that

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
antioxidants AC and he basically that

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.300 
antioxidants AC and he basically that
just<00:03:28.970> means<00:03:29.150> vitamins<00:03:29.690> a<00:03:29.930> c<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.260> e<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:30.709> so<00:03:31.250> i

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
just means vitamins a c and e and so i

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.940 
just means vitamins a c and e and so i
look<00:03:31.550> at<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:31.790> label<00:03:32.239> only<00:03:33.020> three<00:03:33.380> grams<00:03:33.709> of

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
look at the label only three grams of

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.390 
look at the label only three grams of
protein<00:03:34.250> on<00:03:34.640> this<00:03:34.910> one<00:03:35.209> but<00:03:35.690> basically<00:03:36.400> hardly

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
protein on this one but basically hardly

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.810 
protein on this one but basically hardly
any<00:03:38.230> it<00:03:39.230> does<00:03:39.500> have<00:03:39.739> a<00:03:39.770> little<00:03:39.980> bit<00:03:40.220> less<00:03:40.459> fat

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
any it does have a little bit less fat

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.120 
any it does have a little bit less fat
and<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.940> sugar<00:03:44.420> is<00:03:44.690> about<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.140> same<00:03:45.320> 14<00:03:45.890> grams

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
and the sugar is about the same 14 grams

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.210 
and the sugar is about the same 14 grams
of<00:03:46.340> sugar<00:03:46.550> and<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:47.390> this<00:03:48.110> product<00:03:48.500> has<00:03:48.860> hardly

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
of sugar and so this product has hardly

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.690 
of sugar and so this product has hardly
any<00:03:49.450> protein<00:03:50.450> per<00:03:50.959> serving<00:03:50.989> and<00:03:51.650> what<00:03:52.519> I<00:03:52.550> would

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
any protein per serving and what I would

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.610 
any protein per serving and what I would
do<00:03:53.000> with<00:03:53.150> this<00:03:53.180> now<00:03:53.750> that<00:03:53.959> I<00:03:53.989> bought<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:54.470> i'm

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
do with this now that I bought it i'm

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.229 
do with this now that I bought it i'm
probably<00:03:54.830> not<00:03:54.950> going<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.250> take<00:03:55.459> it<00:03:55.489> back<00:03:55.760> is

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
probably not going to take it back is

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.960 
probably not going to take it back is
I'll<00:03:57.080> take<00:03:57.380> a<00:03:57.410> large<00:03:57.709> tupperware<00:03:58.130> container

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
I'll take a large tupperware container

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.520 
I'll take a large tupperware container
and<00:03:59.930> I'll<00:04:00.350> probably<00:04:00.620> mix

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
and I'll probably mix

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.270 
and I'll probably mix
this<00:04:01.709> in<00:04:02.400> with<00:04:03.270> one<00:04:03.569> of<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.810> cauchy<00:04:04.280> types

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
this in with one of the cauchy types

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.449 
this in with one of the cauchy types
this<00:04:06.030> is<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.360> oatmeal<00:04:06.780> crunch<00:04:07.470> Kashi<00:04:07.890> see<00:04:08.310> the

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
this is the oatmeal crunch Kashi see the

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.030 
this is the oatmeal crunch Kashi see the
little<00:04:08.610> oatmeal<00:04:08.880> clusters<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:09.900> then<00:04:10.890> they

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
little oatmeal clusters and then they

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.080 
little oatmeal clusters and then they
have<00:04:11.250> another<00:04:11.700> one<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.569> other<00:04:12.750> costs<00:04:13.140> she<00:04:13.380> has

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
have another one the other costs she has

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.180 
like that in it and that other kashi
cereal<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.690> really<00:04:25.020> don't<00:04:25.169> like<00:04:25.290> by<00:04:25.710> itself

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
cereal I really don't like by itself

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.090 
cereal I really don't like by itself
it's<00:04:26.820> not<00:04:27.090> very<00:04:27.360> sweet<00:04:27.900> it's<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.770> little<00:04:28.919> bit

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
it's not very sweet it's a little bit

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.300 
it's not very sweet it's a little bit
bland<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:31.080> flavor<00:04:31.380> is<00:04:31.530> not<00:04:31.830> quite<00:04:32.130> as

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
bland and the flavor is not quite as

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.110 
bland and the flavor is not quite as
good<00:04:32.520> but<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:33.630> like<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.320> label<00:04:34.919> on<00:04:35.430> it<00:04:35.490> I<00:04:35.910> like

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
good but I like the label on it I like

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.880 
good but I like the label on it I like
the<00:04:36.270> amount<00:04:36.600> of<00:04:36.660> protein<00:04:36.870> in<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.350> amount<00:04:37.590> the

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
the amount of protein in the amount the

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.220 
the amount of protein in the amount the
amount<00:04:37.919> of<00:04:38.190> fiber<00:04:38.430> it<00:04:38.700> has<00:04:38.910> and<00:04:39.270> it's<00:04:39.930> a<00:04:40.020> little

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
amount of fiber it has and it's a little

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.770 
amount of fiber it has and it's a little
bit<00:04:40.320> lower<00:04:40.500> sugar<00:04:40.950> than<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.820> oatmeal<00:04:42.240> one<00:04:42.510> and

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
bit lower sugar than the oatmeal one and

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.980 
bit lower sugar than the oatmeal one and
so<00:04:43.410> all<00:04:43.440> mix<00:04:43.919> those<00:04:44.419> sometimes<00:04:45.419> half<00:04:45.750> in<00:04:45.960> half

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
so all mix those sometimes half in half

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.550 
so all mix those sometimes half in half
and<00:04:46.560> so<00:04:47.070> I'll<00:04:47.250> probably<00:04:47.460> mix<00:04:47.880> this<00:04:48.210> one<00:04:48.540> too<00:04:49.140> in

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
and so I'll probably mix this one too in

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.659 
and so I'll probably mix this one too in
with<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:50.100> that<00:04:50.460> other<00:04:50.669> kashi<00:04:51.060> cereal<00:04:51.240> and

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
with that that other kashi cereal and

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.260 
with that that other kashi cereal and
it'll<00:04:53.990> you<00:04:54.990> know<00:04:55.110> we'll<00:04:55.590> eat<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:55.979> eventually

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
it'll you know we'll eat it eventually

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.690 
it'll you know we'll eat it eventually
but<00:04:57.270> in<00:04:57.810> general<00:04:57.870> just<00:04:58.680> wanted<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.460> tell<00:04:59.669> you

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
but in general just wanted to tell you

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.000 
but in general just wanted to tell you
that<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.570> know<00:05:00.660> as<00:05:00.780> far<00:05:00.840> as<00:05:01.169> breakfast<00:05:01.710> go

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
that you know as far as breakfast go

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.780 
that you know as far as breakfast go
you're<00:05:02.940> waking<00:05:03.450> up<00:05:03.660> and<00:05:03.930> you've<00:05:04.860> been<00:05:05.100> fasting

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
you're waking up and you've been fasting

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.700 
you're waking up and you've been fasting
that's<00:05:06.180> why<00:05:06.540> it's<00:05:06.720> called<00:05:06.750> breakfast<00:05:07.410> break

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
that's why it's called breakfast break

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.060 
that's why it's called breakfast break
fast<00:05:08.100> you've<00:05:09.000> been<00:05:09.210> fasting<00:05:09.780> for<00:05:09.919> 12<00:05:10.919> hours

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
fast you've been fasting for 12 hours

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.200 
fast you've been fasting for 12 hours
probably<00:05:11.610> 10<00:05:12.090> to<00:05:12.210> 12<00:05:12.479> hours<00:05:12.660> and<00:05:13.910> you<00:05:14.910> need

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
probably 10 to 12 hours and you need

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.450 
probably 10 to 12 hours and you need
something<00:05:16.050> to<00:05:16.200> eat<00:05:16.380> that<00:05:16.410> has<00:05:16.770> some<00:05:16.979> protein

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
something to eat that has some protein

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.150 
something to eat that has some protein
in<00:05:17.490> it<00:05:17.700> you<00:05:18.270> can't<00:05:18.539> just<00:05:18.810> start<00:05:19.200> your<00:05:19.470> day<00:05:19.770> with

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
in it you can't just start your day with

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
in it you can't just start your day with
carbs<00:05:21.120> now<00:05:21.690> guess<00:05:21.990> all<00:05:22.320> of<00:05:22.710> these<00:05:22.950> are<00:05:23.340> carbs

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
carbs now guess all of these are carbs

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.670 
carbs now guess all of these are carbs
with<00:05:24.419> with<00:05:24.930> a<00:05:24.960> fiber<00:05:25.850> actually<00:05:27.050> the<00:05:28.050> cost<00:05:28.500> she

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
with with a fiber actually the cost she

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.070 
with with a fiber actually the cost she
has<00:05:28.830> a<00:05:28.860> little<00:05:29.190> bit<00:05:29.310> more<00:05:29.520> fiber<00:05:29.850> than<00:05:30.270> the

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
has a little bit more fiber than the

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.850 
has a little bit more fiber than the
Smart<00:05:31.410> Start<00:05:31.910> and<00:05:32.910> so<00:05:33.539> fiber<00:05:34.080> is<00:05:34.350> good<00:05:34.620> because

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
Smart Start and so fiber is good because

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.420 
Smart Start and so fiber is good because
it<00:05:35.010> slows<00:05:35.370> down<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:36.840> digestion<00:05:37.380> of<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.919> carbs

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
it slows down the digestion of the carbs

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.880 
it slows down the digestion of the carbs
and<00:05:38.700> so<00:05:39.419> that<00:05:39.660> the<00:05:39.780> sugar<00:05:40.020> gets<00:05:40.410> into<00:05:40.770> your

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
and so that the sugar gets into your

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.670 
and so that the sugar gets into your
system<00:05:40.950> more<00:05:41.729> slowly<00:05:42.150> but<00:05:43.050> still<00:05:43.380> you're

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
system more slowly but still you're

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.430 
system more slowly but still you're
getting<00:05:43.979> hardly<00:05:44.610> any<00:05:45.270> protein<00:05:45.930> with<00:05:46.140> a<00:05:46.169> bowl

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
getting hardly any protein with a bowl

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.460 
getting hardly any protein with a bowl
of<00:05:46.470> cereal<00:05:47.120> just<00:05:48.120> a<00:05:48.240> little<00:05:48.539> bit<00:05:48.690> with<00:05:48.870> these<00:05:49.140> I

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
of cereal just a little bit with these I

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.670 
of cereal just a little bit with these I
suggest<00:05:50.400> that<00:05:50.640> you<00:05:50.880> start<00:05:51.330> your<00:05:51.510> day<00:05:51.780> with<00:05:52.080> at

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
suggest that you start your day with at

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.900 
suggest that you start your day with at
least<00:05:53.330> 20<00:05:54.330> grams<00:05:54.539> of<00:05:54.780> protein<00:05:54.990> and<00:05:55.440> so<00:05:56.340> how<00:05:56.760> are

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
least 20 grams of protein and so how are

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.850 
least 20 grams of protein and so how are
you<00:05:57.030> going<00:05:57.210> to<00:05:57.300> do<00:05:57.450> that<00:05:57.660> well<00:05:58.229> I<00:05:58.410> do<00:05:58.470> it<00:05:58.740> with

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
you going to do that well I do it with

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.310 
you going to do that well I do it with
the<00:05:58.979> pro

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
the pro

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
nauseous I just stay out of the kitchen

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.280 
nauseous I just stay out of the kitchen
when<00:06:27.940> they're<00:06:28.090> cooking<00:06:28.570> it<00:06:28.720> because<00:06:29.050> I<00:06:29.230> just

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.290 
when they're cooking it because I just

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.740
