aggressive<00:00:30.029> poker<00:00:30.240> they're<00:00:30.990> generally<00:00:31.890> among

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
aggressive poker they're generally among

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.069 
aggressive poker they're generally among
the<00:00:32.579> better<00:00:32.759> players<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> table<00:00:33.870> aren't

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
the better players on the table aren't

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.430 
the better players on the table aren't
they<00:00:34.200> certainly<00:00:35.100> not<00:00:35.969> weak<00:00:36.300> players<00:00:36.719> yes<00:00:37.200> I

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
they certainly not weak players yes I

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.130 
they certainly not weak players yes I
would<00:00:37.590> say<00:00:37.770> they<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:39.000> be<00:00:39.030> easier<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.960> play

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
would say they can be easier to play

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.750 
would say they can be easier to play
against<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.649> say<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> loose<00:00:41.219> aggressive

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
against and say a loose aggressive

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.729 
against and say a loose aggressive
opponent<00:00:42.239> just<00:00:42.540> because<00:00:42.899> they're<00:00:43.350> going<00:00:43.680> to

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
opponent just because they're going to

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.590 
opponent just because they're going to
put<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.070> more<00:00:44.250> difficult<00:00:44.879> spots<00:00:45.149> purely

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
put you in more difficult spots purely

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.299 
put you in more difficult spots purely
because<00:00:45.690> they're<00:00:45.870> playing<00:00:46.079> more<00:00:46.379> hands<00:00:46.680> but

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
because they're playing more hands but

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.160 
because they're playing more hands but
certainly<00:00:47.610> tight<00:00:47.879> aggressive<00:00:48.390> players<00:00:48.629> are

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
certainly tight aggressive players are

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.020 
certainly tight aggressive players are
going<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.739> be<00:00:49.829> winners<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.399> general<00:00:50.850> they're

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
going to be winners in general they're

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.220 
going to be winners in general they're
going<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.300> some<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.600> biggest<00:00:51.780> winners

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
going to be some of the biggest winners

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.410 
going to be some of the biggest winners
at<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.739> table<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.399> they're<00:00:53.730> often<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.300> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
at the table and they're often going to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.720 
at the table and they're often going to
prey<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.230> weaker<00:00:55.680> players<00:00:56.010> at<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> table

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
prey on the weaker players at the table

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.549 
prey on the weaker players at the table
as<00:00:56.820> well<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.510> if<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.719> spot<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.320> tight

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
as well so if you spot a tight

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.520 
as well so if you spot a tight
aggressive<00:00:59.039> player<00:00:59.219> also<00:00:59.570> often<00:01:00.570> though<00:01:01.350> it

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
aggressive player also often though it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.609 
aggressive player also often though it
also<00:01:01.770> often<00:01:02.550> called<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.969> tag<00:01:03.239> player<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.439> can

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
also often called the tag player you can

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.289 
also often called the tag player you can
generally<00:01:05.010> avoid<00:01:05.369> them<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> little<00:01:06.119> bit

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
generally avoid them a little bit

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.580 
generally avoid them a little bit
because<00:01:06.479> they<00:01:06.720> are<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.439> playing

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
because they are not going to be playing

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.679 
because they are not going to be playing
that<00:01:07.830> many<00:01:08.040> hands<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.640> how<00:01:08.820> do<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:09.090> beat<00:01:09.330> them<00:01:09.540> I

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
that many hands so how do we beat them I

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.929 
that many hands so how do we beat them I
mean<00:01:09.960> for<00:01:10.500> starters<00:01:10.740> there<00:01:11.220> surely<00:01:11.460> quite

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
mean for starters there surely quite

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.179 
mean for starters there surely quite
readable<00:01:12.240> aren't<00:01:12.659> they<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.350> same<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
readable aren't they in the same the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.109 
readable aren't they in the same the
same<00:01:14.340> weight<00:01:14.460> some<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.640> these<00:01:14.729> other<00:01:14.880> player

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
same weight some of these other player

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.700 
same weight some of these other player
types<00:01:15.420> are<00:01:15.630> because<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.290> they're

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
types are because if if they're

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.109 
types are because if if they're
generally<00:01:17.159> quite<00:01:17.400> tight<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:18.000> they

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
generally quite tight and then they

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.210 
generally quite tight and then they
suddenly<00:01:18.420> take<00:01:18.900> off<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.740> assume

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
suddenly take off you have to assume

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.149 
suddenly take off you have to assume
they<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:20.790> their<00:01:21.030> hand<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.619> almost<00:01:22.799> like

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
they like their hand so it's almost like

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.070 
they like their hand so it's almost like
just<00:01:23.189> being<00:01:23.580> tight<00:01:23.970> isn't<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.570> like<00:01:24.689> as

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
just being tight isn't it it's like as

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.300 
just being tight isn't it it's like as
soon<00:01:25.229> as<00:01:25.320> they<00:01:25.409> get<00:01:25.560> aggressive<00:01:25.770> they're<00:01:26.159> like

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
soon as they get aggressive they're like

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.010 
soon as they get aggressive they're like
they're<00:01:26.670> signposting<00:01:27.270> their<00:01:27.420> head<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.840> is

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
they're signposting their head that is

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.300 
they're signposting their head that is
true<00:01:28.229> but<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.500> course<00:01:28.680> not<00:01:28.890> all<00:01:28.920> tight

opponents on their toes and that's
what's<00:01:40.799> going<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.950> make<00:01:41.009> them<00:01:41.220> difficult<00:01:41.430> to

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
what's going to make them difficult to

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.840 
what's going to make them difficult to
play<00:01:42.030> against<00:01:42.420> yes<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.950> fold

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
play against yes you can just fold

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.700

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
but if you're a good tag player then I

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.969 
but if you're a good tag player then I

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
Hanlon involving tight aggression

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.560 
Hanlon involving tight aggression

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
here so of course a lot of what goes

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.110 
here so of course a lot of what goes
into<00:02:10.050> his<00:02:10.110> hands<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:11.220> can't<00:02:11.520> see<00:02:11.850> from

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
into his hands you you can't see from

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.840 
into his hands you you can't see from
just<00:02:12.360> one<00:02:12.630> hand<00:02:12.930> example<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:14.040> get<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.460> tight

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
just one hand example to get a tight

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.580 
just one hand example to get a tight
aggressive<00:02:15.390> image<00:02:15.720> it's<00:02:16.170> something<00:02:16.500> which

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
aggressive image it's something which

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.640 
aggressive image it's something which
comes<00:02:16.830> with<00:02:17.070> time<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:18.080> your<00:02:19.080> opponents<00:02:19.590> are

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
comes with time so your opponents are

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.650 
comes with time so your opponents are
going<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.890> have<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.190> take<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.910> look<00:02:21.270> at<00:02:21.480> how

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
going to have to take a look at how

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.840 
going to have to take a look at how
you're<00:02:21.930> playing<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.590> label<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.340> with<00:02:23.610> that

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
you're playing and label you with that

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.820 
you're playing and label you with that
image<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.720> can't<00:02:24.990> just<00:02:25.080> be<00:02:25.200> something<00:02:25.470> which

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
image it can't just be something which

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.580 
image it can't just be something which
apply<00:02:26.760> straightaway<00:02:27.450> within<00:02:27.840> one<00:02:28.050> given<00:02:28.380> hand

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
apply straightaway within one given hand

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.190 
apply straightaway within one given hand
so<00:02:29.460> I<00:02:29.730> wouldn't<00:02:29.940> taste<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.300> tight<00:02:30.540> aggressive

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
so I wouldn't taste is tight aggressive

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.690 
so I wouldn't taste is tight aggressive
by<00:02:31.320> player<00:02:31.590> six<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.130> says<00:02:32.250> it's<00:02:32.460> right

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
by player six so it says it's right

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.480 
by player six so it says it's right
awful<00:02:33.360> yeah<00:02:33.840> it's<00:02:34.200> pretty<00:02:34.410> passive<00:02:35.010> isn't<00:02:35.310> it

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
awful yeah it's pretty passive isn't it

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.970 
awful yeah it's pretty passive isn't it
just<00:02:35.790> limiting<00:02:36.420> in<00:02:36.570> with<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> really<00:02:37.560> good<00:02:37.710> hand

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
just limiting in with a really good hand

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.340 
just limiting in with a really good hand
like<00:02:38.220> king<00:02:38.460> queen<00:02:38.700> suited<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:39.810> think<00:02:40.230> he's

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
like king queen suited I think he's

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.140 
like king queen suited I think he's
going<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.500> be<00:02:40.590> player<00:02:41.459> free<00:02:41.790> with<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.030> Ace

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
going to be player free with the Ace

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.560 
going to be player free with the Ace
King<00:02:42.450> suited<00:02:43.310> now<00:02:44.310> if<00:02:44.459> player<00:02:44.760> two<00:02:45.090> took<00:02:45.360> off

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
King suited now if player two took off

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.210 
King suited now if player two took off
here<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:46.020> wouldn't<00:02:46.260> be<00:02:46.350> tighter<00:02:46.590> aggressive

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
here that wouldn't be tighter aggressive

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.650 
here that wouldn't be tighter aggressive
would<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.490> because<00:02:47.850> they've<00:02:48.060> got<00:02:48.240> an<00:02:48.330> awful

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
would it because they've got an awful

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.900 
would it because they've got an awful
hand<00:02:48.870> or<00:02:49.050> would<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.680> would<00:02:50.400> make<00:02:50.550> this<00:02:50.670> play

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
hand or would it I would make this play

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.880 
hand or would it I would make this play
with<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.330> King<00:02:51.600> four<00:02:51.870> suited<00:02:52.380> on<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.590> button

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
with the King four suited on the button

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.680 
with the King four suited on the button
most<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.430> time<00:02:53.670> we're<00:02:54.330> looking<00:02:54.450> to

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
most of the time we're looking to

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.810 
most of the time we're looking to
isolate<00:02:55.170> player<00:02:55.410> six<00:02:55.770> used<00:02:56.070> perhaps<00:02:56.250> labeled

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
isolate player six used perhaps labeled

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.610 
isolate player six used perhaps labeled
himself<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.330> really<00:02:57.660> weak<00:02:57.870> player<00:02:58.200> just<00:02:58.500> by

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
himself is a really weak player just by

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.620 
himself is a really weak player just by
limping<00:02:58.860> in<00:02:59.130> first<00:02:59.550> this<00:02:59.790> counters<00:03:00.330> tight

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
limping in first this counters tight

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.480 
limping in first this counters tight
aggressive<00:03:01.230> from<00:03:01.350> player<00:03:01.590> 2<00:03:01.740> or<00:03:01.950> do<00:03:02.100> you<00:03:02.190> file

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
aggressive from player 2 or do you file

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.280 
aggressive from player 2 or do you file
this<00:03:02.700> on<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.030> loose<00:03:03.300> aggressive<00:03:03.870> because<00:03:04.140> of

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
this on the loose aggressive because of

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.750 
this on the loose aggressive because of
the<00:03:04.380> hands<00:03:04.770> that<00:03:04.980> they<00:03:05.100> have<00:03:05.280> that's<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.610> good

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the hands that they have that's a good

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.130 
the hands that they have that's a good
point<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.209> certainly<00:03:06.600> a<00:03:06.690> very<00:03:06.900> loose

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
point and it's certainly a very loose

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.750 
point and it's certainly a very loose
aggressive<00:03:07.650> player<00:03:07.860> you<00:03:08.040> would<00:03:08.160> never<00:03:08.400> see<00:03:08.730> a

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
aggressive player you would never see a

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
bet he really should here and I'm going

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.190 
bet he really should here and I'm going
to<00:03:28.140> summarize<00:03:28.470> that<00:03:28.620> player<00:03:29.040> 3<00:03:29.510> he's<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.780> tight

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
to summarize that player 3 he's a tight

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.890 
to summarize that player 3 he's a tight
aggressive<00:03:31.800> player<00:03:32.180> but<00:03:33.180> he's<00:03:33.390> not<00:03:33.420> because

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
aggressive player but he's not because

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.020 
aggressive player but he's not because
he's<00:03:34.080> just<00:03:34.440> called<00:03:34.680> there<00:03:34.920> yeah<00:03:35.730> it's

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
he's just called there yeah it's

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.460 
he's just called there yeah it's
definitely<00:03:36.209> not<00:03:36.450> tight<00:03:36.780> aggressive<00:03:37.260> play

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
definitely not tight aggressive play

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.410 
definitely not tight aggressive play
here<00:03:37.769> it's<00:03:37.920> tight<00:03:38.220> passive<00:03:38.700> play<00:03:38.880> if<00:03:38.970> anything

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
here it's tight passive play if anything

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.190 
here it's tight passive play if anything
an<00:03:39.660> Ace<00:03:40.350> King<00:03:40.680> suited<00:03:40.739> such<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.870> brilliant<00:03:42.870> hand

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
an Ace King suited such a brilliant hand

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.770 
an Ace King suited such a brilliant hand
but<00:03:43.920> he<00:03:44.160> really<00:03:44.700> needs<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:44.970> put<00:03:45.150> in<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.330> free<00:03:45.570> bet

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
but he really needs to put in a free bet

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.900 
but he really needs to put in a free bet
there<00:03:45.959> he's<00:03:46.200> only<00:03:46.380> playing<00:03:46.650> 120<00:03:47.430> big<00:03:47.580> blinds

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
there he's only playing 120 big blinds

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.180 
there he's only playing 120 big blinds
effective<00:03:48.420> versus<00:03:48.780> player<00:03:49.019> 2<00:03:49.320> so<00:03:49.890> he<00:03:49.980> should

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
effective versus player 2 so he should

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.220 
effective versus player 2 so he should
be<00:03:50.310> happy<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.549> get<00:03:50.700> all<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:51.000> money<00:03:51.150> in<00:03:51.420> instead

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
be happy to get all the money in instead

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.259 
be happy to get all the money in instead
he's<00:03:52.380> just<00:03:52.410> cold<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.370> looks<00:03:53.549> like<00:03:53.700> we're<00:03:53.850> gonna

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
he's just cold it looks like we're gonna

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.810 
he's just cold it looks like we're gonna
see<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:54.510> freeway<00:03:54.959> flop<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:55.530> yes<00:03:56.220> player<00:03:56.519> 3<00:03:56.790> is

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
see a freeway flop and yes player 3 is

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.090 
see a freeway flop and yes player 3 is
dominating<00:03:57.570> both<00:03:57.690> his<00:03:57.989> opponents<00:03:58.470> but<00:03:58.920> this

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
dominating both his opponents but this

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.860 
dominating both his opponents but this
is<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.400> worst<00:03:59.640> possible<00:03:59.970> line<00:04:00.450> he<00:04:00.600> could<00:04:00.750> have

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
is the worst possible line he could have

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.440 
is the worst possible line he could have
taken<00:04:01.019> preflop<00:04:01.830> he<00:04:02.459> had<00:04:02.760> two<00:04:02.970> free<00:04:03.180> bet<00:04:03.330> in

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
taken preflop he had two free bet in

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.080 
taken preflop he had two free bet in
that<00:04:03.570> situation<00:04:04.200> it's<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.250> great<00:04:05.549> fought<00:04:05.880> for

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
that situation it's a great fought for

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.360 
that situation it's a great fought for
player<00:04:06.269> six<00:04:06.690> here<00:04:06.959> with<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.230> flush<00:04:07.470> draw

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.170 

play<00:04:12.370> a<00:04:12.400> free<00:04:12.640> checks<00:04:14.520> of<00:04:15.520> course<00:04:15.760> as<00:04:15.850> you<00:04:15.970> say

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
play a free checks of course as you say

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.090 
play a free checks of course as you say
we're<00:04:16.420> seeing<00:04:16.750> this<00:04:16.870> in<00:04:17.079> a<00:04:17.170> vacuum<00:04:17.620> this<00:04:17.829> hand

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
we're seeing this in a vacuum this hand

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.460 
we're seeing this in a vacuum this hand
we<00:04:18.250> can<00:04:18.459> assume<00:04:18.850> perhaps<00:04:19.359> that<00:04:19.630> player<00:04:19.930> 2<00:04:20.260> is

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
we can assume perhaps that player 2 is

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.890 
we can assume perhaps that player 2 is
usually<00:04:21.100> very<00:04:21.519> very<00:04:21.609> tight<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:22.420> suddenly

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
usually very very tight and suddenly

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.660 
usually very very tight and suddenly
he's<00:04:23.080> now<00:04:23.260> being<00:04:23.670> extraordinarily

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
he's now being extraordinarily

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.080 
he's now being extraordinarily
aggressive<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.720> he's<00:04:25.810> taken<00:04:26.230> off<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:28.000> in

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
aggressive and he's taken off and in

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.790 
aggressive and he's taken off and in
fact<00:04:28.240> if<00:04:28.360> is<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.840> case<00:04:29.050> this<00:04:29.350> is<00:04:29.530> not<00:04:29.560> a

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
fact if is the case this is not a

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.760 
fact if is the case this is not a
terrible<00:04:30.550> spot<00:04:30.850> to<00:04:31.030> do<00:04:31.180> it<00:04:31.210> in<00:04:31.450> because<00:04:32.230> he<00:04:32.650> has

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
terrible spot to do it in because he has

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.130 
terrible spot to do it in because he has
a<00:04:32.800> good<00:04:33.160> shot<00:04:33.190> it's<00:04:33.730> unlikely<00:04:34.240> but<00:04:34.570> either<00:04:34.990> of

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
a good shot it's unlikely but either of

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.770 
a good shot it's unlikely but either of
these<00:04:35.320> players<00:04:35.590> has<00:04:35.830> a<00:04:35.860> 2<00:04:36.130> 5<00:04:36.460> or<00:04:36.490> 6<00:04:37.000> so<00:04:37.480> he<00:04:37.570> could

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
these players has a 2 5 or 6 so he could

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.570 
these players has a 2 5 or 6 so he could
well<00:04:37.990> take<00:04:38.230> it<00:04:38.260> down<00:04:38.620> with<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:38.920> qinghai<00:04:39.130> here

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
well take it down with the qinghai here

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.700 
well take it down with the qinghai here
so<00:04:39.730> he's<00:04:39.850> gone<00:04:40.030> for<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.360> bet<00:04:40.630> he's<00:04:41.170> gonna<00:04:41.440> get

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
so he's gone for the bet he's gonna get

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.950 
so he's gone for the bet he's gonna get
a<00:04:41.740> lot<00:04:41.950> of<00:04:41.980> action<00:04:42.340> from<00:04:42.370> player<00:04:42.730> 6<00:04:43.090> and<00:04:43.330> here's

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
a lot of action from player 6 and here's

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
a lot of action from player 6 and here's
me<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:46.020> disc<00:04:47.020> benefit<00:04:47.590> so<00:04:47.740> it's<00:04:47.890> not

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
me the the disc benefit so it's not

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.470 
me the the disc benefit so it's not
really<00:04:48.250> a<00:04:48.280> word<00:04:48.430> but<00:04:48.640> I'm<00:04:48.700> gonna<00:04:48.790> use<00:04:49.060> it<00:04:49.270> a

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
really a word but I'm gonna use it a

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.560 
really a word but I'm gonna use it a
player<00:04:50.020> free<00:04:50.320> playing<00:04:50.680> so<00:04:50.890> weak<00:04:51.580> put<00:04:52.000> preflop

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
player free playing so weak put preflop

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.930 
player free playing so weak put preflop
now<00:04:53.440> me<00:04:53.620> didn't<00:04:54.010> put<00:04:54.160> in<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.430> free<00:04:54.610> bet<00:04:54.790> he's

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
now me didn't put in the free bet he's

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.060 
now me didn't put in the free bet he's
just<00:04:54.970> had<00:04:55.270> to<00:04:55.360> check<00:04:55.600> fold<00:04:55.930> up<00:04:56.170> flop<00:04:56.440> if<00:04:56.770> he'd

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
just had to check fold up flop if he'd

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.070 
just had to check fold up flop if he'd
free<00:04:57.370> bet<00:04:57.610> he<00:04:57.880> might<00:04:58.090> get<00:04:58.570> rid<00:04:58.780> of<00:04:58.810> both

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
free bet he might get rid of both

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
playing a hand in position they've done

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.530 
playing a hand in position they've done
it<00:06:02.440> very<00:06:02.860> very<00:06:03.310> aggressively<00:06:04.030> haven't<00:06:04.450> they

it very very aggressively haven't they
and<00:06:04.780> that<00:06:04.960> is<00:06:05.169> a<00:06:05.200> tight<00:06:05.740> aggressive<00:06:06.370> player

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
and that is a tight aggressive player

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.640 
and that is a tight aggressive player
for<00:06:06.850> you<00:06:06.970> they<00:06:07.450> don't<00:06:07.750> once<00:06:07.990> they<00:06:08.169> revolve<00:06:08.410> the

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
for you they don't once they revolve the

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.980 
for you they don't once they revolve the
hand<00:06:08.830> they<00:06:09.010> don't<00:06:09.190> play<00:06:09.490> it<00:06:09.669> backwards<00:06:10.600> so

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
hand they don't play it backwards so

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.780 
hand they don't play it backwards so
that<00:06:11.169> that<00:06:11.470> was<00:06:11.680> incredibly<00:06:11.800> aggressive<00:06:12.400> play

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
that that was incredibly aggressive play

that that was incredibly aggressive play
and<00:06:13.120> I<00:06:13.180> think<00:06:13.390> what's<00:06:13.570> really<00:06:13.630> important<00:06:14.500> when

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
and I think what's really important when

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.430 
and I think what's really important when
you're<00:06:15.330> planning<00:06:16.330> to<00:06:16.450> play<00:06:16.630> a<00:06:16.660> certain<00:06:16.930> style
