think<00:01:37.470> maybe<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.130> need<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.310> figure<00:01:38.549> out<00:01:38.670> where

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
think maybe we need to figure out where

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.310 
think maybe we need to figure out where
he<00:01:39.000> got<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> modded<00:01:39.509> out<00:01:39.630> I'm<00:01:39.750> very<00:01:39.960> concerned

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320
