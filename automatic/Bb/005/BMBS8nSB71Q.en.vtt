00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.600
 lately I have been crazy about 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:10.389
 power supply and literally collect all 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:14.480
 what I find on the internet is it happened 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:17.360
 before assembling my my blocks or rather 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.020
 laboratory supply after sale there and 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.570
 so on and collected over this period 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.400
 probably 20 cm of laboratory blocks 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.100
 power supply 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.230
 I am currently working on improving the first 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.230
 options which was published on 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.450
 site vape scheme. 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.910
 build and create powerful linear 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.739
 laboratory unit , power unit 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.180
 drain up to 37 r and now knock somewhere 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.860
 2 hours ago 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:52.329
 on the internet I found a small scheme well she 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.880
 not that small but pretty here 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.800
 interesting in my opinion and by the way I 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.840
 the most important thing you can not say 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.390
 congratulate I finally appeared 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.699
 laser printers and in one thing about him i 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.610
 I think I will make a review bought completely 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.220
 new condition ie from store and 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.420
 From now on, all the scheme will be such 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:18.070
 order further on this scheme to be honest 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.990
 peeking a long time but on the site of the radio code 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.760
 I got this scheme 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.820
 bipolar laboratory source 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.680
 power supply with output voltage up to 40 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.860
 volt a and the possibility of limiting 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.240
 output current from 0 to there three four 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.960
 ampere as a power transistor 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.900
 kt819 and b m involved and in fact that 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.270
 same analog compound at the transistor 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.939
 general standard almost scheme but with 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.890
 some features 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:53.330
 The author of the article offer a small 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.689
 refinement is an addition to the scheme of another 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.210
 transistor and it is created as if 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:03.090
 current stabilization indicator like this 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.539
 scheme looks and loops 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.940
 To be honest, this scheme is for me somewhere two 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.430
 years ago, I caught my eye well to 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.269
 I didn't have the time needed 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.830
 components 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:19.050
 although here everything is essentially possible to find it 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:25.590
 thin cat and 31 02 07 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:28.950
 and actually cats 816 819 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.650
 a couple of zener diodes and that's all 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.720
 four variable resistors with 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.130
 the advent of the laser printer, all things 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:43.410
 Of course, the tag became better and here 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:46.799
 literally created a circuit board by 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.920
 spring currency printing on photo paper 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:53.519
 typed by the way the pattern twice that is 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:57.120
 in two layers and in the end got me right 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:01.079
 result and now I have loot 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.900
 looks like this just barely big 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:07.470
 By the way, by the way, Iâ€™ll explain this method 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.959
 There is how to print to no 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.299
 there are no passes 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.549
 slopes no line breaks 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.280
 formed here everything to do so looks 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.950
 on the plain with photoresist of course 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.470
 hard to compare but excellent board 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.329
 go out you can track almost zero 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:30.230
 one millimeter 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:35.819
 do without problems so well actually 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:38.880
 the fee was made in about half an hour 20 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:42.209
 minutes passed it got better barely 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.730
 managed to tear off ready that is he stuck 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.829
 tight and forced 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.989
 sandpaper since from Saturn 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:52.319
 no matter how strange the solvent was 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.470
 tunar so well actually done as well 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.510
 silkscreen see up 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.329
 component layout rarely do 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.299
 did not for the simple reason that there was not 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:06.269
 printer so well, actually looks like this 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.730
 the board itself has several components 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.750
 not yet sealed ie in particular 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:16.959
 one zener diode on 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:19.510
 happen 4034 variable as a bred 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.660
 fee for domestic components if 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:28.900
 honestly under Soviet but then Soviet 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:32.920
 did not find bc 546 and 557 out of 47 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:36.360
 and 557 rather yes well, in fact, a complete analog 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:40.140
 our points to a low-power well and have 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.400
 you need to scoop down in general about 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:46.330
 PCB about correctness 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.820
 Build all absolutely clear that is 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.750
 the board has been checked repeatedly 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:55.750
 and according to the scheme and the floor 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.840
 literally in general this will not occur 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:02.440
 problems and what is the essence of the assembly 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.290
 This scheme is the point that despite 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:10.210
 what exactly these two schemes are 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:12.910
 Now you see on the monitor as if 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.360
 is a complete analog analog friend 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:19.030
 to a friend but the author who translated yes 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.160
 how would this scheme count on 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.130
 bipolar power 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.200
 this part is fully consistent with this 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.510
 scheme except as already said 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.620
 the mode here is the stabilizer indication 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.620
 current stabilization 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.570
 bourgeois 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.610
 the scheme involved exactly those 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.590
 transistors which at the moment have 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.669
 me except weekend 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:45.610
 transistor 230 55 peeking in as already 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:49.450
 said on this circuit a long time ago but again 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:52.270
 same on the site or on the radius of the course and another 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.490
 some radio code resources i 'm sorry 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.830
 some more resources scheme 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.240
 discussed not the best side then 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.919
 there is 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:03.010
 There were several people there who 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:05.979
 collected and adjustment was not accurate then 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.790
 have 10 volts minimum play there 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:12.540
 problem with adjusting the current and so on 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:15.100
 that is, he decided to assemble the scheme 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.449
 exclusively for tests 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.490
 because I personally have a lot 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.279
 people ask questions about exactly 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.080
 specifically this scheme 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:25.999
 I recommend this scheme and so on and 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.029
 since I have not done that before 

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:31.400
 I can't give sensible advice 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:33.589
 the person who checks everything in practice 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.770
 have a look specifically at the circuit 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:38.930
 check let's say you don't have multisim 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.419
 good version since a good option 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.219
 since everything ultimately must 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:46.069
 turn into iron should work 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:49.370
 therefore there is nothing better to practice 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:51.889
 for this reason I decided to create 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.529
 this circuit this video cycles ie 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:55.960
 video review to a greater extent is 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:07:00.319
 as if to 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:03.289
 a little sort of review done 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:06.020
 so far work and finally i can all 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:09.649
 This business publish form of articles if 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:12.589
 people once for example find this scheme 

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:15.259
 decided to decide to collect necessarily thought 

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:17.990
 came across my article with full 

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:19.550
 description of the scheme and my impressions 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:23.689
 to the whole 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:25.819
 from the circuit so wait for the video clip with 

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:28.370
 the final test of this particular circuit 

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:30.620
 because it is very popular in 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.289
 as a simple option 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.689
 pretty good and powerful with everyone 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:37.339
 amenities 

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:39.379
 laboratory power supply and on this 

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:42.529
 friends all not to miss
