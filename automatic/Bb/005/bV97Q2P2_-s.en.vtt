hi<00:00:01.350> I'm<00:00:01.589> Kathy<00:00:02.129> I<00:00:02.340> got<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.179> question<00:00:03.389> this<00:00:03.840> week

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
hi I'm Kathy I got a question this week

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.920 
hi I'm Kathy I got a question this week
from<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:04.770> parent<00:00:05.430> asked<00:00:06.420> me<00:00:06.690> about<00:00:06.839> the

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
from a parent asked me about the

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.560 
from a parent asked me about the
difference<00:00:07.200> between<00:00:07.820> Asperger<00:00:08.820> syndrome<00:00:08.849> and

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
difference between Asperger syndrome and

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.930 
difference between Asperger syndrome and
high<00:00:09.870> functioning<00:00:10.260> autism<00:00:10.769> she<00:00:11.670> had<00:00:11.910> a

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
high functioning autism she had a

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.900 
high functioning autism she had a
pediatrician<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:13.080> had<00:00:13.259> told<00:00:13.500> her<00:00:13.910> actually

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
pediatrician that had told her actually

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.580 
pediatrician that had told her actually
they<00:00:15.059> were<00:00:15.120> one<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.599> same<00:00:15.690> thing<00:00:16.260> and

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
they were one in the same thing and

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.099 
they were one in the same thing and
that's<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.190> very<00:00:17.220> common<00:00:17.910> but<00:00:18.090> sort<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:18.990> an

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
that's a very common but sort of an

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.679 
that's a very common but sort of an
unfortunate<00:00:19.830> misunderstanding<00:00:20.330> among<00:00:21.330> those

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
unfortunate misunderstanding among those

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.929 
unfortunate misunderstanding among those
two<00:00:21.930> terms<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:22.949> very<00:00:23.250> easy<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.609> see<00:00:23.910> how

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
two terms and it's very easy to see how

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.359 
two terms and it's very easy to see how
we<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.539> be<00:00:24.660> confused<00:00:25.230> by<00:00:25.350> Asperger's<00:00:26.160> and

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
we can be confused by Asperger's and

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.460 
we can be confused by Asperger's and
high<00:00:26.820> functioning<00:00:27.269> autism<00:00:27.660> especially<00:00:28.380> if

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
high functioning autism especially if

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.500 
high functioning autism especially if
you<00:00:28.560> don't<00:00:28.710> meet<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.070> individual<00:00:29.640> until<00:00:30.330> they

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
you don't meet the individual until they

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.500 
you don't meet the individual until they
are<00:00:30.539> say<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.260> young<00:00:32.009> adult<00:00:32.399> or<00:00:32.700> an<00:00:32.759> adult<00:00:33.090> or

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
are say a young adult or an adult or

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.630 
are say a young adult or an adult or
some<00:00:33.930> are<00:00:34.079> past<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.530> middle<00:00:34.800> school<00:00:35.070> because

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
some are past the middle school because

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.299 
some are past the middle school because
if<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.910> are<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.239> meet<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> child<00:00:37.559> with

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
if you are to meet a child with

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.020 
if you are to meet a child with
Aspergers<00:00:38.910> they<00:00:39.870> present<00:00:40.410> very<00:00:40.800> similar<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:42.000> a

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
Aspergers they present very similar to a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.479 
Aspergers they present very similar to a
child<00:00:42.450> high-functioning<00:00:42.899> autism<00:00:43.649> once<00:00:44.280> they

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
child high-functioning autism once they

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.369 
child high-functioning autism once they
reach<00:00:44.760> say<00:00:45.149> middle<00:00:45.360> school<00:00:45.480> high<00:00:45.899> school<00:00:45.930> or

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
reach say middle school high school or

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.040 
reach say middle school high school or
adulthood<00:00:47.090> language<00:00:48.090> usually<00:00:48.270> has<00:00:48.570> developed

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
adulthood language usually has developed

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.600 
adulthood language usually has developed
by<00:00:49.230> then<00:00:49.469> they're<00:00:49.710> functioning<00:00:50.190> pretty<00:00:50.399> good

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
by then they're functioning pretty good

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.340 
by then they're functioning pretty good
in<00:00:50.730> school<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:51.989> difficult

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
in school and so it's really difficult

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.110 
in school and so it's really difficult
and<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.070> easy<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.370> think<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.910> them<00:00:54.090> as

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
and so it's easy to think of them as

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.850 
and so it's easy to think of them as
being<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.629> same<00:00:54.870> thing<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.680> they're

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
being the same thing but they're

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.670 
being the same thing but they're
actually<00:00:56.250> very<00:00:56.280> very<00:00:56.879> different<00:00:57.680> disorders

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
actually very very different disorders

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.130 
actually very very different disorders
in<00:00:59.070> order<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.699> separate<00:01:00.210> Asperger's<00:01:00.960> from

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
in order to separate Asperger's from

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.080 
in order to separate Asperger's from
high<00:01:01.289> functioning<00:01:01.770> autism<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.460> have<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.879> back

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
high functioning autism you have to back

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.030 
high functioning autism you have to back
up<00:01:03.359> you've<00:01:03.629> got<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.870> talk<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.470> parent<00:01:04.979> or

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
up you've got to talk to the parent or

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.100 
up you've got to talk to the parent or
the<00:01:05.100> primary<00:01:05.670> caregiver<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the primary caregiver and get the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.469 
the primary caregiver and get the
history<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.920> child<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.670> when<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.299> go

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
history of that child and when you go

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.539 
history of that child and when you go
back<00:01:09.720> far<00:01:10.080> enough<00:01:10.140> particularly<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
back far enough particularly to the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.580 
back far enough particularly to the
development<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.210> language<00:01:12.450> that's<00:01:13.320> what

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
development of language that's what

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.570 
development of language that's what
you're<00:01:13.710> going<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> see<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.189> difference

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you're going to see the difference

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.219 
you're going to see the difference
between<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.689> person<00:01:16.140> with
