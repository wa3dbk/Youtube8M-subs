00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
baseband to the one from the ipad and

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.000 
baseband to the one from the ipad and
itunes<00:00:39.570> doesn't<00:00:39.840> even<00:00:40.079> know<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.739> have

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
itunes doesn't even know that you have

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.650 
itunes doesn't even know that you have
it<00:00:41.160> or<00:00:41.370> apple<00:00:41.670> doesn't<00:00:41.820> know<00:00:41.969> they<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.480> so

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
it or apple doesn't know they have it so

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.180 
it or apple doesn't know they have it so
you<00:00:42.719> cannot<00:00:43.140> restore<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.829> an<00:00:43.920> official

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
you cannot restore to an official

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.180 
you cannot restore to an official
firmware<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:45.180> itunes<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.649> will<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:47.039> to

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
firmware in itunes so you will have to

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.389 
firmware in itunes so you will have to
wait<00:00:47.370> until<00:00:47.579> maybe<00:00:48.329> iOS<00:00:48.899> 4.3<00:00:49.440> comes<00:00:49.860> out<00:00:50.039> with

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
wait until maybe iOS 4.3 comes out with

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.029 
wait until maybe iOS 4.3 comes out with
a<00:00:50.670> higher<00:00:51.059> baseband<00:00:51.690> than<00:00:51.930> six<00:00:52.230> point<00:00:52.530> 15

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
a higher baseband than six point 15

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.119 
a higher baseband than six point 15
point<00:00:53.820> 00<00:00:54.320> so<00:00:55.320> basically<00:00:55.710> you're<00:00:55.860> getting

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
point 00 so basically you're getting

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.310 
point 00 so basically you're getting
your<00:00:56.370> basement<00:00:56.850> updated<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.449> an<00:00:57.570> ipad<00:00:57.989> one

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
which is six point fifteen point 0 0

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.799 
which is six point fifteen point 0 0
which<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.230> crackable<00:01:01.800> unlike<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.609> one<00:01:02.850> and

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
which is crackable unlike this one and

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.450 
which is crackable unlike this one and
