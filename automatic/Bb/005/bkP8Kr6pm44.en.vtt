tuff is one that sticks out in my mind

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.270 
tuff is one that sticks out in my mind
as<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.980> great<00:01:02.490> event

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.789 

this<00:01:06.640> state<00:01:07.060> has<00:01:07.450> some<00:01:08.200> really<00:01:08.350> brutal

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
this state has some really brutal

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.550 
this state has some really brutal
terrain<00:01:08.979> and<00:01:09.400> getting<00:01:10.150> from<00:01:10.450> one<00:01:11.200> end<00:01:11.409> to<00:01:11.470> the

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
terrain and getting from one end to the

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.830 
terrain and getting from one end to the
other<00:01:11.650> like<00:01:12.070> we're<00:01:12.280> doing<00:01:12.670> is<00:01:13.119> tough

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.840 

I<00:01:16.869> think<00:01:17.740> adventurous<00:01:18.340> it's<00:01:18.579> like<00:01:18.820> a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
I think adventurous it's like a

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.840 
I think adventurous it's like a
multi-sport<00:01:19.720> race<00:01:20.470> where<00:01:20.829> you<00:01:20.860> pair<00:01:21.490> oh<00:01:21.549> you

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
multi-sport race where you pair oh you

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.499 
multi-sport race where you pair oh you
buy<00:01:22.329> you<00:01:23.020> navigate<00:01:23.740> through<00:01:24.509> topographic

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
buy you navigate through topographic

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.260 
buy you navigate through topographic
maps<00:01:25.810> but<00:01:26.560> also<00:01:26.799> it's<00:01:27.220> like<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.700> race<00:01:27.939> of

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
maps but also it's like the race of

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.570 
maps but also it's like the race of
minds<00:01:28.869> cue

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.340 

every<00:01:36.510> now<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.840> then<00:01:36.960> there'll<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.230> a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
every now and then there'll be a

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.470 
every now and then there'll be a
detailed<00:01:37.920> orienteering<00:01:38.760> section<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.330> race

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
detailed orienteering section in a race

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.260 
detailed orienteering section in a race

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
and very intricate land formations as

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.510 
and very intricate land formations as
you<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.540> see<00:01:42.780> behind<00:01:42.930> me<00:01:43.230> crazy<00:01:43.590> mud<00:01:44.070> cliffs

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
you can see behind me crazy mud cliffs

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.600 
you can see behind me crazy mud cliffs
tiny<00:01:45.060> stream<00:01:45.510> valleys<00:01:46.140> caves<00:01:46.860> all<00:01:47.250> sorts<00:01:47.550> of

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
tiny stream valleys caves all sorts of

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.540 
tiny stream valleys caves all sorts of
features<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.690> we<00:01:49.080> were<00:01:49.230> using<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.370> as

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
features that we were using and not as

00:01:50.550 --> 00:02:01.289 
features that we were using and not as
detailed<00:01:50.970> map<00:01:51.180> defined

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.469 

I<00:02:01.329> think<00:02:02.079> what's<00:02:02.350> hard<00:02:02.590> is<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.759> relentless<00:02:04.060> of

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
I think what's hard is the relentless of

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.899 
I think what's hard is the relentless of
the<00:02:04.600> race<00:02:04.780> it's<00:02:05.109> just<00:02:05.320> constantly<00:02:06.039> relentless

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
the race it's just constantly relentless

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.150 
the race it's just constantly relentless
and<00:02:07.600> I'm<00:02:07.750> okay<00:02:08.110> with<00:02:08.319> there's<00:02:08.709> another<00:02:08.890> hill

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
and I'm okay with there's another hill

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.210 
and I'm okay with there's another hill
there's<00:02:09.729> this<00:02:09.970> there's<00:02:10.360> that<00:02:10.690> but<00:02:11.319> what's

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
there's this there's that but what's

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.750 
there's this there's that but what's
getting<00:02:12.610> hard<00:02:12.879> is<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.989> no<00:02:14.170> rest<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.550> just

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
getting hard is the no rest and you just

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.550 
getting hard is the no rest and you just
keep<00:02:16.000> pushing<00:02:16.239> I<00:02:16.569> thought<00:02:16.959> you<00:02:17.080> know<00:02:17.200> what<00:02:17.349> my
