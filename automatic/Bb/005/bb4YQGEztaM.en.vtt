00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 Luna's Fansub Please do not reissue. 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.100
 Worn notebook, the backpack thrown away, 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.200
 dirty converses. 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:41.070
 Faded scribbles on the desk of a young child who dreamed. 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.580
 To watch the clock ... 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.090
 Useless jokes. 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.800
 The days like a hot summer, 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.630
 will I be able to smile? 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.640
 As much as the time that has gone like a photo ... 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.180
 I changed. 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.220
 I can not go back to those moments ... 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.920
 but I want to find that feeling. 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.820
 I'm looking at myself, 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.130
 learning little by little things and adjusting. 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.770
 I ask my friend ... 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.000
 and he tells me that everything is part of life. 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.550
 The clock is just getting faster ... 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.150
 and I can not laugh at those jokes anymore. 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.220
 I'm getting colder ... 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.560
 Will I be able to smile again? 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.160
 As much as the time that has gone like a photo ... 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.140
 I changed. 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.660
 I can not go back to those moments ... 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.420
 but I want to find that feeling. 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.540
 I grew up and became great ... 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.140
 but my heart is still a teenager. 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.590
 Even if other things are available to me ... 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.660
 After having overcome, I will smile ...!
