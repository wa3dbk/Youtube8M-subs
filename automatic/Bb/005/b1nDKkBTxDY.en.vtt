into this position gets levendusky onto
the<00:01:49.320> full<00:01:49.560> chemistry<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.070> we<00:01:50.130> need<00:01:50.340> him<00:01:50.460> to

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
the full chemistry that we need him to

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.060 
the full chemistry that we need him to
be<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.030> he's<00:01:52.020> an<00:01:52.229> excellent<00:01:52.680> excellent

i'm<00:02:03.840> not<00:02:03.960> sure<00:02:04.110> if<00:02:04.229> you're<00:02:04.320> really<00:02:04.560> supposed

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
i'm not sure if you're really supposed

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.770 
i'm not sure if you're really supposed
to<00:02:04.890> put<00:02:05.070> him<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.460> defensive<00:02:05.909> mid<00:02:06.090> role<00:02:06.329> but<00:02:06.600> i

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
to put him in a defensive mid role but i

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.330 
to put him in a defensive mid role but i
play<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.409> there<00:02:07.590> because<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:08.009> get<00:02:08.160> full

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
play in there because I get full

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.249 
play in there because I get full
chemistry<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.420> think<00:02:09.690> he's<00:02:09.840> an<00:02:09.989> absolute

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
chemistry and I think he's an absolute

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.660 
chemistry and I think he's an absolute

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.610 
was a sense fact when he was a mutt lot
better<00:02:39.420> he's<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.660> much<00:02:39.840> more<00:02:40.050> fundamental

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620

back position I got Sergio Ramos

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.920 
back position I got Sergio Ramos
obviously<00:02:53.400> an<00:02:53.519> amazing<00:02:53.910> center<00:02:54.209> back<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.600> i

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
obviously an amazing center back and i

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.539 
obviously an amazing center back and i
put<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.290> goal<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:55.769> guy<00:02:56.010> now<00:02:56.250> you're<00:02:56.459> probably

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
put in goal this guy now you're probably

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.800 
put in goal this guy now you're probably
wondering<00:02:56.730> why<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.209> heck<00:02:57.420> didn't<00:02:57.630> you<00:02:57.690> get

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
wondering why the heck didn't you get

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.840 
wondering why the heck didn't you get
Casillas<00:02:58.319> but<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:58.920> don't<00:02:59.160> like<00:02:59.280> Casillas<00:02:59.700> I

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
Casillas but I don't like Casillas I

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
don't think he's very good so instead I

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.080 
don't think he's very good so instead I
