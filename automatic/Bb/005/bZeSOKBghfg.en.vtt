00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 This time it goes to england and that 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.510
 car i think is a right one 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:13.469
 challenge an audi r18 if i have 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.049
 that correctly saw zero idea of 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.050
 Cars is a constant always they have 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.160
 usually four wheels 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.340
 if there is more you should worry 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.340
 do 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.640
 brands hatch and thank God good 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.030
 I want weather in case of rain the thing here 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.480
 For example, do not drive and holla that 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.480
 looks nice 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:45.010
 This breaks down before you hit the gas 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.280
 is still worn 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.280
 Euro 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 aggressive 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.300
 inconspicuous you drive with the thing then 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.320
 in a class or really just that 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.320
 Tal is available 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.500
 try it 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.870
 is bought for the sake of God 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:26.690
 it's a racing car a spaceship what 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.530
 that supposed this nowhere rocket 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.690
 james bond you would actually 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.940
 the people behind a trail of oil in 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.710
 send the trench 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.110
 stupidly the feeling that is also 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.370
 soon no one left behind me too sorry 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.750
 a few silver where is that what is 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.750
 that for a horny camera 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.880
 and of course looks great one 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.880
 helmet camera with the helmet on it 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.250
 oh that's alas that's the front here 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.509
 is god's sake that's the look out 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.840
 just the cockpit 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.840
 camera perspective have been before 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.760
 but that is surprisingly good on the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.960
 Street of choice 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.770
 I'm a bit heavier 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.360
 presented 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.360
 yes and there goes from 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.910
 and the weather does not strike around please 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.000
 That looks like a storm 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.280
 you look again from the outside 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.920
 more luck probably not in 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.580
 the rule I can better from the 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.870
 cockpit perspective ride as would the 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.950
 People are also very far apart 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.720
 but this fits better too i have 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:21.000
 a better feeling for where the dare 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:24.240
 of course, but just for the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.840
 staff in itself nice survey man 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.840
 and the pretty 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.750
 if you do not care for that too 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.750
 pay is 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.140
 I take the curves got to her myself 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.150
 shitty but behind me is still each 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.569
 Crowd people do it even worse 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.090
 make or even dream because I like that 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.110
 In the dangerous phase the day lays down 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.490
 the caliber cut straight 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.490
 sound like that 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.690
 more 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.180
 semi-gentle switch between gas 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:09.830
 and brake but here it is not enough 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.830
 just past the gate 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.019
 but the whole cake seems to be 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.400
 then have not really big 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.840
 to be able to benefit from it 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.340
 have a fast vehicles because they 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.680
 we can not live that out well 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.790
 here on the town of Krems 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.790
 but I can load it too 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.449
 probably the whole thing would stay with you 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.610
 the ideal line bit easier though 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.669
 I do not want to show it with intention 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.669
 to let 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.090
 daily directly from 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.090
 or combination 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.680
 he does not sound very good either 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.150
 my tires seem that down there 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.360
 the indication for the tires so of 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:19.260
 chaos we seem to be in quite a bit 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.260
 bad condition 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.909
 sure that sees on the car itself but 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:27.800
 the race is over 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:31.159
 well that could have been worse 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.020
 with such a thing it would have been clear 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.479
 can run better but it would have too 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.860
 Worse, see what happens in the 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:40.129
 next round I think is pending times 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.960
 again a normal car look 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:45.580
 maybe something modish 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.580
 That's fine for me until then
