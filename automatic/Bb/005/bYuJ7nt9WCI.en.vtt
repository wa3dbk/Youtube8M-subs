00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:08.410
 Hello everyone, Dmitry today 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.410
 let's conduct such a small review in one 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:15.400
 we will consider whether 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:18.730
 weight rollers variator askew we will 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.460
 measure rollers 6 grapes gram size 15 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.710
 for 12 that is, they claimed 6 half 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.560
 gram will check whether 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.689
 this is reality and there is no such 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.339
 the deviation between the drawing of rollers 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.320
 will we also this is all about playing on 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.630
 such from portable pocket or 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.570
 jewelry somehow they are called such from 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.800
 Scales are very convenient, I tell them 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.160
 powertrain settings 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.910
 if you watch there at all the video under 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.730
 transmissions on setting up the transmission all 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.950
 competent masters here I use such 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.220
 weight that is to say you never tarot 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.200
 mixes normally do not tune in with us 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.120
 given the existence of such forests you can 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.850
 exactly guess from the role not even guess and 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.430
 already pick up the weight of the rollers and so 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.159
 way to customize your transmission more 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.990
 qualitatively and remove even remove the extra 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.869
 vibration that is if the movie is some 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.939
 a little less then he may be 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.729
 slightly lighter than others or heavier 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.819
 the rest you can fit either one 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.069
 under the remaining 5 or 5 under the one 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:23.649
 which is easier this way to remove 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:27.759
 extra vibration from the calendula and so 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:30.310
 way to slightly increase the momentum 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.649
 engine slightly quite a bit 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.399
 just like the vibration is always a little bit 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:45.399
 extinguishes these momentum and so print out and 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:47.799
 our rollers including our scales scales 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.079
 supplied in a box there's 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.200
 such a collective instruction which is not 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:55.569
 read because all let's say everything 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.960
 control and sa purely intuitively 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.440
 two or three times 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.420
 get even first I would say start 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.750
 to want to say such scales with us 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.569
 is on sale today like this 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.110
 what can you contact us orders 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.930
 together with the rollers and we are all to you 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.330
 send so turn on the scales 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.250
 when we train if it lights up completely 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.380
 full screen i.e. it tests if there is no 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.860
 whether a blank screen or all indicators 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.420
 working and functioning now we 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.850
 let's turn it over so that it can be seen Ivan 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.320
 we all bring it a little closer 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:39.940
 you could see better like that 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.940
 way we start because our videos and 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:49.989
 went to the first video on the field that 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:51.440
 declared weight is 6 and a half grams so 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.640
 666 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.640
 let's try again 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.580
 665 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.360
 second clip 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:23.940
 663 434 3 video 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.480
 663 let's try again 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:47.990
 sixty four digits run a little 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.390
 in the midst of the figure because the mouth is not rollers 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.850
 scales are accurate to one hundredth 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.410
 grams meaning it is 10 times more accurate than 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.910
 scales are the same scales that have 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.040
 accuracy to one tenth of a gram 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.570
 so even the slightest breeze of wind 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.580
 here for example here and so videos immediately 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.900
 they begin to rolls and the figure was immediately 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:12.670
 starts running 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.670
 tab 665 we have established this was 666 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.300
 665 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:41.560
 665 dumplings of what then you 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:46.729
 voices from the background 665 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:49.330
 after all 6 let it be so 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:52.699
 It turned out from 6 rollers of the declared weight 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:56.720
 six and a half grams so somewhere on 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:05:01.970
 here 6 won us one video 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:06.910
 it turns out 666 3 rollers 665 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:10.370
 and two rollers 664 but in principle 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:15.380
 46 100 grams they are such something 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:17.780
 blatant and can put out all together and 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.680
 nothing needs to be customized by weight 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.120
 here is one tenth deviation from 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.090
 declared weight but basically nothing 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.440
 scary since one tenth in all 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.340
 videos that is, I myself was 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.700
 above the first for example more than one dozen 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.590
 in one clip the rest would be 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.100
 normal weight is needed bureau their 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.210
 customized for perfect work 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.940
 transmissions roller would need them 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.780
 weight by weight all the rest so 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:52.400
 so here in principle rollers can be 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:57.880
 and with a range of more weight if not 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:01.930
 pain less quality and less expensive 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:04.970
 so pay attention to this 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.840
 there is no brokenness between the rollers well 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:10.010
 on this probably today everything
