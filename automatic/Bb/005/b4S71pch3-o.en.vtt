00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
endings generally when we're doing

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.960 
endings generally when we're doing
stop-motion<00:00:16.380> stuff<00:00:16.890> here<00:00:17.160> we're<00:00:17.400> trying<00:00:17.610> to

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
stop-motion stuff here we're trying to

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.880 
stop-motion stuff here we're trying to
make<00:00:18.270> things<00:00:18.630> seem<00:00:18.930> like<00:00:18.990> they<00:00:19.259> take<00:00:19.470> place<00:00:19.710> in

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
make things seem like they take place in

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.760 
make things seem like they take place in
a<00:00:19.980> big<00:00:20.220> expansive<00:00:20.880> world<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.930> we're<00:00:22.619> always

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
a big expansive world but we're always

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.010 
a big expansive world but we're always
working<00:00:23.039> on<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> same<00:00:23.609> three<00:00:24.119> by<00:00:24.270> five<00:00:24.480> table

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
working on the same three by five table

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.980 
working on the same three by five table
and<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:26.939> approach<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.300> we<00:00:27.510> took<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:27.840> this

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
and the approach that we took on this

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.740 
and the approach that we took on this
short<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.279> alternate<00:00:29.699> endings<00:00:29.970> was<00:00:30.359> to

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
short and the alternate endings was to

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.020 
short and the alternate endings was to
make<00:00:31.439> these<00:00:31.650> different<00:00:32.070> sections<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:32.910> you

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
make these different sections so as you

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.150 
make these different sections so as you
can<00:00:33.150> see<00:00:33.210> here<00:00:33.540> we've<00:00:33.690> got<00:00:33.769> 15<00:00:34.769> different

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
can see here we've got 15 different

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.700 
can see here we've got 15 different
sections<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.790> backdrop<00:00:36.269> each<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.230> on<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.410> 10

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
sections of backdrop each one is on a 10

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.740 
sections of backdrop each one is on a 10
by<00:00:37.829> 10<00:00:37.860> base<00:00:38.250> plate<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.450> we've<00:00:39.570> got<00:00:39.690> some

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
by 10 base plate and so we've got some

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.380 
by 10 base plate and so we've got some
that<00:00:40.110> are<00:00:40.170> flat<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.100> some<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.180> have

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
that are flat like this some that have

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.299 
that are flat like this some that have
Hills<00:00:42.989> some<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.770> kind<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.010> Rocky

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
Hills some that have kind of Rocky

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.049 
Hills some that have kind of Rocky
Mountain<00:00:44.969> any<00:00:45.120> areas<00:00:45.660> we've<00:00:46.350> got<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:47.059> crater

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
Mountain any areas we've got this crater

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.940 
Mountain any areas we've got this crater
kind<00:00:48.540> of<00:00:48.629> centerpiece<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.649> when<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:49.829> were

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
kind of centerpiece so when we were

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.069 
kind of centerpiece so when we were
designing<00:00:50.070> each<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> sections<00:00:51.270> what<00:00:51.989> we

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
designing each of the sections what we

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.990 
designing each of the sections what we
would<00:00:52.200> do<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.620> start<00:00:52.950> with<00:00:53.129> kind<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.489> mosaic

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
would do was start with kind of a mosaic

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.490 
would do was start with kind of a mosaic
for<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> ground<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:55.020> tried<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.320> make<00:00:55.469> it

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
for the ground and we tried to make it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.979 
for the ground and we tried to make it
very<00:00:55.860> alien<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.579> weird-looking<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.570> then

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
very alien and weird-looking and then

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.479 
very alien and weird-looking and then
from<00:00:58.170> there<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.530> kind<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.800> build<00:00:59.039> up<00:00:59.219> either

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
from there it kind of build up either

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.930 
from there it kind of build up either
the<00:00:59.760> hills<00:01:00.000> or<00:01:00.480> whatever<00:01:00.750> sort<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.079> rock<00:01:01.320> face

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
the hills or whatever sort of rock face

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.189 
the hills or whatever sort of rock face
expansions<00:01:02.940> from<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.539> then<00:01:03.840> add<00:01:04.020> like

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
expansions from that and then add like

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.930 
expansions from that and then add like
little<00:01:04.470> details<00:01:04.830> like<00:01:04.979> these<00:01:05.190> vines<00:01:05.550> or

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
little details like these vines or

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.969 
little details like these vines or
little<00:01:06.149> plant<00:01:06.450> things<00:01:06.690> just<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.050> make<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.259> kind

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
little plant things just to make it kind

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.289 
little plant things just to make it kind
of<00:01:08.100> break<00:01:08.310> up<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> monotony<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.030> just

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
of break up the monotony of just

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.240 
of break up the monotony of just
brick-built<00:01:10.170> things<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.830> make<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.130> little

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
brick-built things and make it a little

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.390 
brick-built things and make it a little
weird<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.909> again<00:01:12.630> alien<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.260> then<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
weird and again alien and then in the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.429 
weird and again alien and then in the
background<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.720> tried<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.049> recreate

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
background we have we tried to recreate

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.010 
background we have we tried to recreate
the<00:01:16.830> buildings<00:01:17.280> from<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.760> galaxy<00:01:18.270> squad<00:01:18.510> box

building this here is the bug building

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.520 
building this here is the bug building
we<00:01:26.580> made<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> buildings<00:01:27.240> two-sided<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.350> that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
we made the buildings two-sided so that

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.499 
we made the buildings two-sided so that
in<00:01:28.740> some<00:01:29.460> shots<00:01:29.670> we'll<00:01:29.850> see<00:01:29.970> one<00:01:30.150> side<00:01:30.330> of<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
in some shots we'll see one side of the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.179 
in some shots we'll see one side of the
building<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:30.930> some<00:01:31.080> shafts<00:01:31.530> we'll<00:01:31.650> see<00:01:31.830> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
building and some shafts we'll see the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.609 
building and some shafts we'll see the
other<00:01:32.220> side<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.720> way<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.020> kind<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.380> looks

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
other side and that way it kind of looks

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.020 
other side and that way it kind of looks
like<00:01:34.829> almost<00:01:35.040> two<00:01:35.280> different<00:01:35.579> buildings<00:01:35.909> but

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
like almost two different buildings but

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.580 
like almost two different buildings but
it's<00:01:36.180> really<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.259> you're<00:01:37.380> seeing

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
it's really just one and you're seeing

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.899 
it's really just one and you're seeing
it<00:01:37.710> from<00:01:37.799> different<00:01:37.890> angles<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.729> that's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
it from different angles and that's

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.190 
it from different angles and that's
another<00:01:39.090> way<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.299> make<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.689> seem<00:01:39.840> like<00:01:39.900> we've

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
another way to make it seem like we've

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.630 
another way to make it seem like we've
built<00:01:40.439> more<00:01:40.710> things<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.159> actually<00:01:41.340> have

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
built more things that we actually have

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.609 
built more things that we actually have
and<00:01:42.450> just<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:42.900> the<00:01:42.990> buildings<00:01:43.409> we

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
and just like with the buildings we

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.130 
and just like with the buildings we
tried<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.130> match<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.150> galaxy<00:01:45.570> squad<00:01:45.750> box

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
tried to match the galaxy squad box

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.149 
tried to match the galaxy squad box
alright<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.560> put<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.799> these<00:01:46.950> little

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
alright and put like these little

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.130 
alright and put like these little
crystals<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.119> also<00:01:48.270> used<00:01:48.600> some<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
crystals and we also used some of the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.490 
crystals and we also used some of the
galaxy<00:01:50.009> squad<00:01:50.189> video<00:01:50.729> game<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.409> things<00:01:52.409> from

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
galaxy squad video game and things from

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.740 
galaxy squad video game and things from
the<00:01:52.619> LEGO<00:01:52.799> Club<00:01:53.009> magazine<00:01:53.280> comics<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.540> to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the LEGO Club magazine comics just to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.630 
the LEGO Club magazine comics just to
kind<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:54.990> make<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.290> all<00:01:55.380> seem<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.920> all<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
kind of make it all seem like all the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.460 
kind of make it all seem like all the
galaxy<00:01:56.970> squad<00:01:57.149> stuff<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.630> consistent<00:01:58.200> and

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
galaxy squad stuff is consistent and

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.340 
galaxy squad stuff is consistent and
matches<00:01:59.159> we<00:01:59.610> would<00:01:59.790> take<00:01:59.970> each<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.420> these<00:02:00.600> 15

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
matches we would take each of these 15

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.830 
matches we would take each of these 15
pieces<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.310> rearrange<00:02:03.030> them<00:02:03.240> into<00:02:03.390> different

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
pieces and rearrange them into different

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.929 
pieces and rearrange them into different
almost<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.710> puzzles<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.610> made<00:02:05.790> it

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
almost like puzzles and that made it

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.670 
almost like puzzles and that made it
seem<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.180> there<00:02:06.509> were<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.630> lot<00:02:06.750> more<00:02:06.780> areas

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
seem like there were a lot more areas

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.699 
seem like there were a lot more areas
than<00:02:08.009> there<00:02:08.640> actually<00:02:08.970> were<00:02:09.440> once<00:02:10.440> we<00:02:10.590> would

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
than there actually were once we would

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.890 
than there actually were once we would
put<00:02:11.009> all<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.220> pieces<00:02:11.519> into<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.209> certain

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
put all the pieces into a certain

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.900 
put all the pieces into a certain
arrangement<00:02:13.140> we

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
arrangement we

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.550 
arrangement we
then<00:02:14.090> have<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.390> fill<00:02:14.600> in<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.870> seams<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.440> you

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
then have to fill in the seams and you

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.250 
then have to fill in the seams and you
can<00:02:15.740> see<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:16.010> there's<00:02:16.190> these<00:02:16.340> kind<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:17.260> two

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
can see that there's these kind of two

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260 
can see that there's these kind of two
stud<00:02:18.560> wide<00:02:18.830> seams<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.490> between<00:02:19.790> each<00:02:19.940> plate

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
stud wide seams in between each plate

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.910 
stud wide seams in between each plate
and<00:02:20.570> so<00:02:20.690> we<00:02:20.810> fill<00:02:21.140> them<00:02:21.260> in<00:02:21.350> with<00:02:21.500> these<00:02:21.650> kind

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
and so we fill them in with these kind

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.430 
and so we fill them in with these kind
of<00:02:21.980> pieces<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.400> kind<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:22.850> hide<00:02:23.150> hide<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.230> seams

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
of pieces to kind of hide hide the seams

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.880 
of pieces to kind of hide hide the seams
between<00:02:24.620> them<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.190> make<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.520> look<00:02:25.640> like<00:02:25.700> the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
between them and make it look like the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.220 
between them and make it look like the
landscape<00:02:27.890> was<00:02:28.040> one<00:02:28.310> solid<00:02:28.610> built<00:02:29.150> area<00:02:29.450> we'd

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
landscape was one solid built area we'd

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.870 
landscape was one solid built area we'd
have<00:02:30.320> one<00:02:30.470> arrangement<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.070> was<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.400> wide

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
have one arrangement that was a wide

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.550 
have one arrangement that was a wide
landscape<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:32.780> was<00:02:32.990> sort<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.290> main

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
landscape and that was sort of the main

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.140 
landscape and that was sort of the main
area<00:02:34.010> where<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.220> lot<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.580> action<00:02:34.880> took

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
area where a lot of the action took

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.740 
area where a lot of the action took
place

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
place

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.800 
place
we<00:02:36.140> had<00:02:36.290> one<00:02:36.560> area<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.340> was<00:02:37.640> what<00:02:38.480> we<00:02:38.570> called

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
we had one area that was what we called

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.720 
we had one area that was what we called
the<00:02:38.870> twist<00:02:39.170> ending<00:02:39.290> alcove<00:02:39.890> at<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.550> end<00:02:40.670> of

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
the twist ending alcove at the end of

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.090 
the twist ending alcove at the end of
each<00:02:40.820> max<00:02:41.090> ending<00:02:41.540> there<00:02:42.140> was<00:02:42.470> kind<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:42.980> a

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
each max ending there was kind of a

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.040 
each max ending there was kind of a
weird<00:02:43.310> spooky<00:02:43.850> twist<00:02:44.300> ending<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:44.900> that's

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
weird spooky twist ending and that's

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.690 
weird spooky twist ending and that's
where<00:02:45.230> those<00:02:45.320> all<00:02:45.560> took<00:02:45.710> place<00:02:45.890> there<00:02:46.580> was<00:02:46.640> the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
where those all took place there was the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.360 
where those all took place there was the
crashed<00:02:47.060> ship<00:02:47.210> area<00:02:47.810> where<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.590> galaxy<00:02:49.190> squad

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
crashed ship area where the galaxy squad

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.610 
crashed ship area where the galaxy squad
soldiers<00:02:49.850> are<00:02:50.030> taking<00:02:50.390> refuge<00:02:50.630> from<00:02:51.110> the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
soldiers are taking refuge from the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.890 
soldiers are taking refuge from the
incoming<00:02:52.070> bug<00:02:52.250> attacks<00:02:52.610> there<00:02:53.300> was<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.600> bug

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
incoming bug attacks there was the bug

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.180 
incoming bug attacks there was the bug
death<00:02:54.170> area<00:02:54.530> which<00:02:54.740> I<00:02:54.860> think<00:02:55.070> is

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
death area which I think is

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.910 
death area which I think is
self-explanatory<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:57.590> there<00:02:57.710> was<00:02:57.800> the

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
self-explanatory and there was the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.770 
self-explanatory and there was the
valley<00:02:58.130> entrance<00:02:58.640> which<00:02:58.940> is<00:02:59.120> where<00:02:59.390> the

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
valley entrance which is where the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.380 
valley entrance which is where the
robots<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.830> ships<00:03:01.070> come<00:03:01.460> to<00:03:01.640> Max's<00:03:02.030> rescue

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
robots and ships come to Max's rescue

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.510 
robots and ships come to Max's rescue
when<00:03:02.600> he<00:03:02.720> first<00:03:02.960> lands<00:03:03.230> on<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.530> planet<00:03:03.710> so

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
when he first lands on the planet so

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.190 
when he first lands on the planet so
that<00:03:04.640> was<00:03:04.730> our<00:03:04.880> modular<00:03:05.600> approach<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:06.080> the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
that was our modular approach to the

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.350 
that was our modular approach to the
galaxy<00:03:06.560> squad<00:03:06.740> landscape<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.580> if<00:03:07.820> you<00:03:08.000> end<00:03:08.240> up

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
galaxy squad landscape and if you end up

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.000 
galaxy squad landscape and if you end up
taking<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:09.080> similar<00:03:09.380> approach<00:03:09.560> with<00:03:09.770> one<00:03:09.920> of

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
taking a similar approach with one of

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.530 
taking a similar approach with one of
your<00:03:10.100> films<00:03:10.310> be<00:03:10.760> sure<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.000> send<00:03:11.180> us<00:03:11.240> a<00:03:11.360> link

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
your films be sure to send us a link

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.500 
your films be sure to send us a link
we'd<00:03:11.720> love<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.900> check<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:12.170> out<00:03:12.440> and<00:03:13.420> that<00:03:14.420> is

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
we'd love to check it out and that is

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.480 
we'd love to check it out and that is
all<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.690> have<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.870> say<00:03:14.960> about<00:03:15.230> this<00:03:15.500> we'll<00:03:16.070> see

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
all I have to say about this we'll see

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:26.030 
all I have to say about this we'll see
you<00:03:16.580> later<00:03:16.610> for<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.090> next<00:03:17.180> project
