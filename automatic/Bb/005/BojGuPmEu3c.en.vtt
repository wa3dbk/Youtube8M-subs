part<00:01:25.420> of<00:01:25.480> having<00:01:25.600> that<00:01:25.720> aluminum<00:01:26.170> chassis<00:01:26.350> is

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
part of having that aluminum chassis is

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.460 
part of having that aluminum chassis is
one<00:01:27.760> of<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:27.910> reason<00:01:28.210> that<00:01:28.330> it<00:01:28.420> requires<00:01:28.720> those

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
one of the reason that it requires those

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.770 
one of the reason that it requires those
extra<00:01:29.830> braces<00:01:30.220> in<00:01:30.370> the<00:01:30.460> back<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:31.330> eliminates

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
extra braces in the back that eliminates

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.930 
extra braces in the back that eliminates
some<00:01:32.170> of<00:01:32.230> the<00:01:32.470> potential<00:01:32.830> to<00:01:33.190> pay<00:01:33.370> trunk<00:01:33.700> room

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
some of the potential to pay trunk room

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.150 
some of the potential to pay trunk room
but<00:01:34.630> it's<00:01:34.750> also<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.200> reason<00:01:35.230> that<00:01:35.620> the<00:01:35.710> car<00:01:35.920> is

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
but it's also the reason that the car is

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.960 
but it's also the reason that the car is
so<00:01:36.460> light<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:36.910> and<00:01:37.390> really<00:01:38.140> just<00:01:38.890> uh<00:01:39.160> just<00:01:39.490> a
