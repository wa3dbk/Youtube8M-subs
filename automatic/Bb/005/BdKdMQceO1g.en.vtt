Touhou if they decided not to go to 0

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.109 
Touhou if they decided not to go to 0
monsters<00:01:12.920> I<00:01:13.009> think<00:01:13.220> I'd<00:01:13.310> be<00:01:13.430> fine<00:01:13.610> with<00:01:13.640> that<00:01:13.790> I

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
monsters I think I'd be fine with that I

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.760 
monsters I think I'd be fine with that I
was<00:01:14.689> very<00:01:14.750> pleased<00:01:15.170> with<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.439> mutant

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
was very pleased with the mutant

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.249 
was very pleased with the mutant
monsters<00:01:16.130> I<00:01:16.220> thought<00:01:16.400> it<00:01:16.490> was<00:01:16.579> very<00:01:16.640> cool

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
monsters I thought it was very cool

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.450 
monsters I thought it was very cool
design-wise<00:01:18.259> I<00:01:18.770> thought<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:19.939> way<00:01:20.090> they<00:01:21.460> acted

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
design-wise I thought the way they acted

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.029 
design-wise I thought the way they acted
like<00:01:22.670> animals<00:01:23.380> they<00:01:24.380> were<00:01:24.499> very<00:01:24.649> similar<00:01:24.920> to

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
like animals they were very similar to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.620 
like animals they were very similar to
Godzilla<00:01:25.369> like<00:01:25.640> they<00:01:25.759> weren't<00:01:25.909> necessarily

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
Godzilla like they weren't necessarily

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.630 
Godzilla like they weren't necessarily
trying<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.469> destroy<00:01:27.829> cities<00:01:28.130> they<00:01:28.429> were<00:01:28.490> just

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
trying to destroy cities they were just

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.359 
trying to destroy cities they were just
trying<00:01:28.999> to<00:01:29.090> get<00:01:29.420> to<00:01:29.450> each<00:01:29.689> other<00:01:29.899> trying<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:31.069> do

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
trying to get to each other trying to do

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.129 
trying to get to each other trying to do
it<00:01:31.520> they<00:01:31.640> naturally<00:01:32.149> do<00:01:32.299> which<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.509> reproduce

00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:33.139 
it they naturally do which is reproduce

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:37.029 
it they naturally do which is reproduce
so<00:01:34.210> and<00:01:35.210> I<00:01:35.329> don't<00:01:35.509> mind<00:01:35.689> that<00:01:36.170> approach<00:01:36.710> that

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
so and I don't mind that approach that

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:38.559 
so and I don't mind that approach that
that's<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:37.579> realistic<00:01:37.939> approach<00:01:38.179> which<00:01:38.539> is

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
that's a realistic approach which is

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:41.739 
that's a realistic approach which is
with<00:01:38.840> Gareth<00:01:39.139> went<00:01:39.350> for<00:01:39.560> I<00:01:39.999> like<00:01:40.999> them<00:01:41.270> I<00:01:41.479> like

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
with Gareth went for I like them I like

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:44.590 
with Gareth went for I like them I like
the<00:01:42.079> mute<00:01:42.259> Oh<00:01:42.409> however<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:44.030> chances<00:01:44.569> of

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
the mute Oh however the chances of

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.539 
the mute Oh however the chances of
getting<00:01:44.960> a<00:01:45.020> Touhou<00:01:45.350> monster<00:01:45.770> probably<00:01:46.310> a<00:01:46.340> lot

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
getting a Touhou monster probably a lot

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.660 
getting a Touhou monster probably a lot
better<00:01:46.729> now<00:01:46.999> than<00:01:47.209> they<00:01:47.329> were<00:01:47.359> before<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:48.670> if

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
better now than they were before and if

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.330 
better now than they were before and if
they<00:01:49.939> go<00:01:50.240> that<00:01:50.479> route<00:01:50.689> and<00:01:50.749> it<00:01:51.200> seems<00:01:51.499> to<00:01:51.619> me<00:01:52.039> it

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
they go that route and it seems to me it

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.160 
they go that route and it seems to me it
seems<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:52.909> me<00:01:52.999> that<00:01:53.030> Malta<00:01:53.630> is<00:01:53.659> probably<00:01:54.049> gonna

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
seems to me that Malta is probably gonna

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.230 
seems to me that Malta is probably gonna
be<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.380> one<00:01:54.590> if<00:01:54.799> we<00:01:55.459> get<00:01:55.609> a<00:01:55.639> total<00:01:56.030> monster

big eater abhiyan hangers whatever what
I<00:02:43.300> think<00:02:43.630> is<00:02:43.720> going<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:43.930> happen<00:02:43.990> is<00:02:44.620> these

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
I think is going to happen is these

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.010 
I think is going to happen is these
monsters<00:02:45.730> are<00:02:45.850> mute<00:02:46.060> oh<00:02:46.240> they're<00:02:46.690> going<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.930> be

monsters are mute oh they're going to be

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.430 
monsters are mute oh they're going to be
mute<00:02:47.230> oh<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.680> think<00:02:48.990> humankind<00:02:49.990> is<00:02:50.170> going<00:02:50.350> to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
mute oh I think humankind is going to

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.560 
mute oh I think humankind is going to
start<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.710> realize<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.700> what<00:02:52.210> they<00:02:52.360> got

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
start to realize that that what they got

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.330 
start to realize that that what they got
in<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.750> first<00:02:52.930> movie<00:02:53.320> was<00:02:53.800> just<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.160> tip<00:02:54.310> of

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
in the first movie was just the tip of

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.490 
in the first movie was just the tip of
the<00:02:54.460> iceberg<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.660> they're<00:02:55.840> mute<00:02:56.080> all

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
the iceberg and that they're mute all

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.810 
the iceberg and that they're mute all
over<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.800> world<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.400> think<00:02:57.670> they've

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
over the world and I think they've

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.150 
over the world and I think they've
established<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.600> FEMA<00:02:58.930> ready<00:02:59.230> if<00:02:59.560> you

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
established that FEMA ready if you

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.680 
established that FEMA ready if you
remember<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.820> little<00:03:01.000> movement<00:03:01.570> they

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
remember the little movement they

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.220 
remember the little movement they
started<00:03:02.170> back<00:03:02.520> last<00:03:03.520> December<00:03:04.150> with<00:03:04.930> the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
started back last December with the

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.770 
started back last December with the
mutant<00:03:05.770> research<00:03:05.920> net<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:06.910> right<00:03:07.390> around<00:03:07.510> the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
mutant research net and right around the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.650 
mutant research net and right around the
first<00:03:07.990> trailer<00:03:08.260> um<00:03:09.120> there<00:03:10.120> were<00:03:10.210> sinkholes

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
first trailer um there were sinkholes

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.150 
first trailer um there were sinkholes
like<00:03:10.810> all<00:03:10.960> over<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.230> world<00:03:11.380> which<00:03:11.890> wasn't

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
like all over the world which wasn't

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.300 
like all over the world which wasn't
really<00:03:12.310> shown<00:03:13.090> in<00:03:13.240> this<00:03:13.330> movie<00:03:13.710> but<00:03:14.710> they<00:03:14.920> seem

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
really shown in this movie but they seem

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.760 
really shown in this movie but they seem
to<00:03:15.760> give<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.270> an<00:03:16.390> idea<00:03:16.480> that<00:03:16.960> the<00:03:17.080> mute<00:03:17.290> o<00:03:17.470> our

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
to give you an idea that the mute o our

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.760 
to give you an idea that the mute o our
worldwide<00:03:18.310> thing<00:03:18.940> i<00:03:19.180> think<00:03:20.080> that's<00:03:20.470> that's

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
worldwide thing i think that's that's

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.230 
worldwide thing i think that's that's
what<00:03:21.040> they<00:03:21.160> set<00:03:21.400> up<00:03:21.490> in<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.670> first<00:03:21.850> movie<00:03:22.210> in

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
what they set up in the first movie in

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.560 
what they set up in the first movie in
some<00:03:22.510> ways<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:23.020> i<00:03:23.710> think<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.700> universe<00:03:25.060> for

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
some ways and i think the universe for

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.770 
some ways and i think the universe for
this<00:03:25.690> movie's<00:03:26.080> already<00:03:26.350> been<00:03:26.500> established<00:03:26.620> i

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
this movie's already been established i

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.450 
this movie's already been established i
also<00:03:28.780> feel<00:03:29.170> that<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.470> second<00:03:29.980> movie<00:03:30.250> is

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
also feel that the second movie is

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.190 
also feel that the second movie is
really<00:03:30.790> going<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.240> kick<00:03:31.630> it<00:03:31.780> into<00:03:31.900> high<00:03:32.020> gear

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
really going to kick it into high gear

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.860 
really going to kick it into high gear
if<00:03:32.770> they<00:03:33.460> if<00:03:33.790> they<00:03:33.970> make<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.180> second<00:03:34.540> movie<00:03:34.750> they

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
if they if they make a second movie they

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.080 
if they if they make a second movie they
still<00:03:35.140> have<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.380> do<00:03:35.530> well<00:03:35.770> in<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.670> box<00:03:36.880> office

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
still have to do well in the box office

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.480 
still have to do well in the box office

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.100 
you get them they're going to fall under
the<00:03:49.870> Muto<00:03:50.350> tag<00:03:50.980> I<00:03:51.450> think<00:03:52.450> what<00:03:52.600> happens<00:03:52.960> is

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
the Muto tag I think what happens is

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.680 
the Muto tag I think what happens is
once<00:03:53.800> humanity<00:03:54.550> realizes<00:03:55.150> there's<00:03:55.360> so<00:03:55.540> many

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
once humanity realizes there's so many

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.480 
once humanity realizes there's so many
of<00:03:55.870> them<00:03:55.960> they<00:03:56.710> each<00:03:56.980> get<00:03:57.250> their<00:03:57.460> own

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
of them they each get their own

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.280 
of them they each get their own
designation<00:03:58.300> they<00:03:58.510> each<00:03:58.660> get<00:03:58.810> their<00:03:58.990> own<00:03:59.020> name

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
designation they each get their own name

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.730 
designation they each get their own name
so<00:03:59.560> then<00:03:59.860> you'll<00:04:00.820> find<00:04:01.150> them<00:04:01.900> naming<00:04:02.620> these

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
so then you'll find them naming these

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.850 
so then you'll find them naming these
monsters<00:04:03.480> based<00:04:04.480> on<00:04:04.750> their<00:04:05.350> similar

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
monsters based on their similar

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.370 
monsters based on their similar
attributes<00:04:06.070> to<00:04:06.670> an<00:04:06.790> animal<00:04:07.150> for<00:04:07.840> example<00:04:08.230> if

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
attributes to an animal for example if

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.900 
attributes to an animal for example if
they<00:04:08.650> would<00:04:08.800> put<00:04:09.010> more<00:04:09.190> Thorin<00:04:09.490> you<00:04:09.520> know<00:04:09.760> that

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
they would put more Thorin you know that

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.480 
they would put more Thorin you know that
moth<00:04:10.120> or<00:04:10.330> their<00:04:11.110> version<00:04:11.530> would<00:04:11.680> probably

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
moth or their version would probably

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.310 
moth or their version would probably
keep<00:04:12.820> some<00:04:13.150> of<00:04:13.240> the<00:04:13.300> features<00:04:13.480> look<00:04:14.050> a<00:04:14.170> little

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
keep some of the features look a little

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.550 
keep some of the features look a little
different<00:04:14.830> but<00:04:15.820> if<00:04:16.120> she<00:04:16.690> is<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:16.870> have<00:04:17.109> features

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
different but if she is to have features

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.520 
different but if she is to have features
of<00:04:17.799> a<00:04:17.859> butterfly<00:04:18.280> or<00:04:18.310> moth<00:04:19.049> that's<00:04:20.049> how<00:04:20.290> she'll

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
of a butterfly or moth that's how she'll

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.670 
of a butterfly or moth that's how she'll
get<00:04:20.650> her<00:04:20.739> name<00:04:20.950> you<00:04:21.609> know<00:04:21.760> and<00:04:22.110> same<00:04:23.110> thing<00:04:23.140> for

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
get her name you know and same thing for

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.070 
get her name you know and same thing for
other<00:04:24.250> monsters<00:04:24.910> somebody<00:04:25.510> actually<00:04:25.750> was

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
other monsters somebody actually was

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.020 
other monsters somebody actually was
very<00:04:26.380> hip<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.710> tell<00:04:26.890> me<00:04:27.010> this<00:04:27.130> in<00:04:27.310> a<00:04:27.670> comment

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
very hip to tell me this in a comment

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.900 
very hip to tell me this in a comment
once<00:04:28.360> that<00:04:29.350> I<00:04:29.380> guess<00:04:29.830> ghidorah<00:04:30.220> is<00:04:30.370> Japanese

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
once that I guess ghidorah is Japanese

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.400 
once that I guess ghidorah is Japanese
for<00:04:30.940> like<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.360> Tiamat<00:04:31.870> or<00:04:32.050> something<00:04:32.350> along

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
for like a Tiamat or something along

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.740 
for like a Tiamat or something along
those<00:04:32.620> lines<00:04:32.740> so<00:04:33.640> that<00:04:34.000> could<00:04:34.390> be<00:04:34.420> another

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
those lines so that could be another

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.350 
those lines so that could be another
name<00:04:35.020> that<00:04:35.380> is<00:04:35.920> given<00:04:36.340> because<00:04:36.520> ghidorah<00:04:37.060> if

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
name that is given because ghidorah if

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.080 
name that is given because ghidorah if
he<00:04:37.540> was<00:04:37.690> in<00:04:37.810> a<00:04:37.870> movie<00:04:38.020> would<00:04:38.260> have<00:04:38.290> three<00:04:38.680> heads

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
he was in a movie would have three heads

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.750 
he was in a movie would have three heads
so<00:04:40.620> that's<00:04:41.620> why<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:41.890> think<00:04:42.130> they<00:04:42.400> would<00:04:42.550> go<00:04:42.729> I

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
so that's why I think they would go I

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.800 
so that's why I think they would go I
think<00:04:43.060> that's

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
think that's

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.420 
think that's
you<00:04:43.930> know<00:04:44.020> probably<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:44.770> best<00:04:44.980> way<00:04:45.160> to<00:04:45.220> do<00:04:45.400> it

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
you know probably the best way to do it

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.690 
you know probably the best way to do it
if<00:04:45.700> you<00:04:46.330> want<00:04:46.540> to<00:04:46.630> try<00:04:46.870> and<00:04:47.050> make<00:04:47.560> it<00:04:47.620> real<00:04:48.010> but

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
if you want to try and make it real but

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.159 
if you want to try and make it real but
also<00:04:48.910> the<00:04:49.150> penny<00:04:49.330> old<00:04:49.510> kind<00:04:49.630> of<00:04:49.720> monsters<00:04:50.050> they

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
also the penny old kind of monsters they

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.159 
also the penny old kind of monsters they
choose<00:04:50.440> now<00:04:51.400> for<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.669> most<00:04:51.880> part<00:04:52.090> if<00:04:52.600> they

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
choose now for the most part if they

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.570 
choose now for the most part if they
don't<00:04:53.380> go<00:04:53.470> that<00:04:53.620> route<00:04:53.800> I'm<00:04:54.010> perfectly<00:04:54.520> fine

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
don't go that route I'm perfectly fine

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.320 
don't go that route I'm perfectly fine
with<00:04:54.760> that<00:04:54.910> I<00:04:55.300> do<00:04:55.810> have<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:57.550> awakening<00:04:58.120> book

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
with that I do have the awakening book

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.180 
with that I do have the awakening book
there<00:04:58.540> are<00:04:58.570> some<00:04:58.750> pretty<00:04:58.960> cool<00:04:59.169> musim<00:04:59.680> mutant

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
there are some pretty cool musim mutant

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.580 
there are some pretty cool musim mutant
monsters<00:05:00.520> in<00:05:00.669> there<00:05:00.850> I<00:05:01.230> haven't<00:05:02.230> gotten<00:05:02.380> the

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
monsters in there I haven't gotten the

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.100 
monsters in there I haven't gotten the
art<00:05:02.740> of<00:05:02.770> destruction<00:05:03.310> book<00:05:03.490> yet<00:05:03.730> but<00:05:04.570> from

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
art of destruction book yet but from

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.330 
art of destruction book yet but from
what<00:05:05.200> I've<00:05:05.350> seen<00:05:05.380> because<00:05:05.830> I've<00:05:05.980> seen<00:05:06.010> images

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
what I've seen because I've seen images

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.460 
what I've seen because I've seen images
on<00:05:06.700> the<00:05:06.790> nation<00:05:07.150> they've<00:05:07.690> got<00:05:07.960> some<00:05:08.169> they<00:05:08.320> had

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
on the nation they've got some they had

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.890 
on the nation they've got some they had
some<00:05:08.650> really<00:05:08.860> nice<00:05:09.130> designs<00:05:09.580> they<00:05:10.330> have<00:05:10.540> a<00:05:10.570> lot

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
some really nice designs they have a lot

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.260 
some really nice designs they have a lot
of<00:05:10.930> content<00:05:11.470> to<00:05:11.770> build<00:05:12.010> on<00:05:12.220> so<00:05:12.880> I<00:05:12.910> don't<00:05:13.090> think

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
of content to build on so I don't think

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.850 
of content to build on so I don't think
we<00:05:13.450> should<00:05:13.510> worry<00:05:13.930> whether<00:05:14.230> or<00:05:14.380> not<00:05:14.470> we<00:05:14.620> get

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
we should worry whether or not we get

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.320 
we should worry whether or not we get
touhou<00:05:15.340> monsters<00:05:15.730> because<00:05:15.910> if<00:05:16.000> we<00:05:16.090> don't<00:05:16.180> get

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
touhou monsters because if we don't get

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.090 
touhou monsters because if we don't get
to<00:05:16.479> hoe<00:05:16.630> monsters<00:05:17.050> I<00:05:17.260> don't<00:05:17.770> think<00:05:17.950> we're

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
to hoe monsters I don't think we're

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.650 
to hoe monsters I don't think we're
going<00:05:18.190> to<00:05:18.280> be<00:05:18.400> displeased<00:05:18.880> overall<00:05:19.330> with<00:05:19.540> the

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
going to be displeased overall with the

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.440 
going to be displeased overall with the
outcome<00:05:19.810> I<00:05:20.200> think<00:05:20.950> what<00:05:21.340> they<00:05:21.580> I<00:05:21.820> think<00:05:22.270> what

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
outcome I think what they I think what

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.320 
outcome I think what they I think what
they've<00:05:22.600> established<00:05:22.810> and<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:24.330> university

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
they've established and the university

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.379 
they've established and the university
created<00:05:25.630> is<00:05:26.139> I<00:05:26.620> think<00:05:26.740> they're<00:05:27.550> in<00:05:27.729> a<00:05:28.150> good

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
created is I think they're in a good

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.190 
created is I think they're in a good
spot<00:05:30.090> the<00:05:31.090> important<00:05:31.570> thing<00:05:31.600> that<00:05:31.810> I<00:05:32.080> think

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
spot the important thing that I think

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.030 
spot the important thing that I think
the<00:05:32.440> sequel<00:05:32.830> is<00:05:33.040> to<00:05:33.430> definitely<00:05:34.440> size<00:05:35.440> up<00:05:35.770> the

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
the sequel is to definitely size up the

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.150 
the sequel is to definitely size up the
monster<00:05:36.729> action<00:05:37.060> a<00:05:37.120> little<00:05:37.360> bit<00:05:38.130> tell<00:05:39.130> a

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
monster action a little bit tell a

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.820 
monster action a little bit tell a

better story another the story was bad i

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.190 
better story another the story was bad i
just<00:05:42.190> think<00:05:42.400> again<00:05:43.060> i'm<00:05:43.180> not<00:05:43.210> i<00:05:43.630> wasn't<00:05:44.139> a<00:05:44.169> fan

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
just think again i'm not i wasn't a fan

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.950 
just think again i'm not i wasn't a fan
of<00:05:44.410> how<00:05:44.620> Aaron<00:05:45.010> did<00:05:45.250> it<00:05:45.370> in<00:05:45.460> this<00:05:45.580> movie<00:05:45.960> but

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
of how Aaron did it in this movie but

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.200 
of how Aaron did it in this movie but
there's<00:05:47.290> definitely<00:05:47.860> room<00:05:48.310> to<00:05:48.340> improve<00:05:48.640> but<00:05:49.180> I

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
there's definitely room to improve but I

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.909 
there's definitely room to improve but I
thought<00:05:49.479> I<00:05:49.539> think<00:05:49.900> the<00:05:49.990> foundation<00:05:50.560> is<00:05:50.650> there

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
thought I think the foundation is there

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.159 
thought I think the foundation is there
I<00:05:51.100> think<00:05:51.400> the<00:05:51.460> foundation<00:05:51.970> is<00:05:52.090> there<00:05:52.360> it's<00:05:52.930> not

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
I think the foundation is there it's not

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:54.779 
I think the foundation is there it's not
a<00:05:53.200> perfect<00:05:53.440> movie<00:05:53.740> I've<00:05:53.950> said<00:05:54.130> it<00:05:54.220> 100<00:05:54.370> times

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
a perfect movie I've said it 100 times

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.140 
a perfect movie I've said it 100 times
but<00:05:55.690> it's<00:05:55.990> it<00:05:56.500> I<00:05:56.710> think<00:05:56.770> it<00:05:57.250> build<00:05:57.610> a<00:05:57.789> solid

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
but it's it I think it build a solid

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.170 
but it's it I think it build a solid
foundation<00:05:58.390> and<00:05:59.260> for<00:05:59.380> that<00:05:59.500> reason<00:05:59.970> they<00:06:00.970> have

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
foundation and for that reason they have

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.120 
foundation and for that reason they have
a<00:06:01.210> lot<00:06:01.630> of<00:06:01.660> opportunities<00:06:02.470> they<00:06:02.650> have<00:06:02.680> a<00:06:02.800> lot

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
a lot of opportunities they have a lot

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.180 
a lot of opportunities they have a lot
of<00:06:03.210> opportunities<00:06:04.210> to<00:06:05.080> build<00:06:05.440> on<00:06:05.950> what

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
of opportunities to build on what

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.880 
of opportunities to build on what
they've<00:06:06.370> established<00:06:06.520> and<00:06:07.270> I<00:06:08.080> think<00:06:08.470> that

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
they've established and I think that

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.560 
they've established and I think that
they<00:06:09.130> can<00:06:09.190> hit<00:06:09.700> a<00:06:09.760> home<00:06:09.910> run<00:06:09.940> in<00:06:10.210> the<00:06:10.270> second

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
they can hit a home run in the second

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.790 
they can hit a home run in the second
movie<00:06:10.780> I<00:06:10.810> really<00:06:11.050> do<00:06:11.169> I<00:06:11.200> think<00:06:11.380> they<00:06:11.650> have<00:06:11.680> the

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
movie I really do I think they have the

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.430 
movie I really do I think they have the
potential<00:06:12.250> if<00:06:12.760> they<00:06:13.360> make<00:06:13.539> a<00:06:13.570> second<00:06:13.990> movie<00:06:14.260> to

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
potential if they make a second movie to

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.590 
potential if they make a second movie to
hit<00:06:14.560> a<00:06:14.590> home<00:06:14.800> run<00:06:14.830> so<00:06:15.700> as<00:06:16.000> whether<00:06:16.360> or<00:06:16.479> not

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
hit a home run so as whether or not

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.000 
hit a home run so as whether or not
that's<00:06:16.900> going<00:06:17.110> to<00:06:17.169> happen<00:06:17.320> and<00:06:17.710> when<00:06:17.860> it's

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
that's going to happen and when it's

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.200 
that's going to happen and when it's
going<00:06:18.100> to<00:06:18.160> happen<00:06:18.250> that's<00:06:18.639> another<00:06:18.850> big<00:06:19.030> issue

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
going to happen that's another big issue

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.170 
going to happen that's another big issue
