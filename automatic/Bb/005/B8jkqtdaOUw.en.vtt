00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
and the original dead space you were

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.910 
and the original dead space you were
able<00:00:58.940> to<00:00:59.180> add<00:00:59.299> nodes<00:00:59.600> to<00:01:00.350> your<00:01:00.469> weapons<00:01:00.799> to

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
improve them and upgrade them you would

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.320 
improve them and upgrade them you would
follow<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:03.469> upgrade<00:01:03.739> trees<00:01:03.979> to<00:01:04.339> make<00:01:04.670> that

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
follow the upgrade trees to make that

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.529 
follow the upgrade trees to make that
say<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:06.259> reload<00:01:06.770> much<00:01:07.220> faster<00:01:07.700> or<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.299> gun

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:08.539 
say the reload much faster or the gun

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.810 
say the reload much faster or the gun
much<00:01:09.049> stronger<00:01:09.350> in<00:01:09.680> Dead<00:01:10.220> Space<00:01:10.250> 2<00:01:10.460> we

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
much stronger in Dead Space 2 we

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.999 
much stronger in Dead Space 2 we
actually<00:01:11.149> even<00:01:11.479> went<00:01:11.690> as<00:01:11.810> far<00:01:11.840> as<00:01:12.110> starting<00:01:12.920> a

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
actually even went as far as starting a

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.100 
actually even went as far as starting a
game<00:01:13.190> with<00:01:13.429> him<00:01:13.479> building<00:01:14.479> his<00:01:14.630> first<00:01:14.659> weapon

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
game with him building his first weapon

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.620

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
out of a flashlight and a surgical tool

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.630 
out of a flashlight and a surgical tool
we<00:01:18.319> looked<00:01:18.530> at<00:01:18.590> what<00:01:18.740> we<00:01:18.830> did<00:01:19.009> in<00:01:19.159> Dead<00:01:19.280> Space<00:01:19.310> 1

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
we looked at what we did in Dead Space 1

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.029 
we looked at what we did in Dead Space 1
and<00:01:19.819> 2<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:20.300> the<00:01:21.080> bench<00:01:21.259> is<00:01:21.380> awesome<00:01:21.710> as<00:01:21.800> it<00:01:21.860> was

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
and 2 and the bench is awesome as it was

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.309 
and 2 and the bench is awesome as it was
we<00:01:22.310> found<00:01:22.580> ways<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:22.880> naturally<00:01:23.780> progress<00:01:23.929> to

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:24.319 
we found ways to naturally progress to

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.290 
we found ways to naturally progress to
this<00:01:24.470> new<00:01:24.830> version<00:01:25.009> in<00:01:25.250> Dead<00:01:25.369> Space<00:01:25.399> 3<00:01:25.580> we've

this new version in Dead Space 3 we've
completely<00:01:26.690> rebuilt<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.170> bench<00:01:27.350> from<00:01:27.500> the

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
completely rebuilt the bench from the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.380 
completely rebuilt the bench from the
ground<00:01:27.770> up<00:01:27.920> not<00:01:28.490> only<00:01:28.700> can<00:01:28.970> you<00:01:29.030> upgrade<00:01:29.210> your

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
ground up not only can you upgrade your

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.120 
ground up not only can you upgrade your
existing<00:01:29.600> weapons<00:01:29.990> you<00:01:30.619> can<00:01:30.740> actually<00:01:30.860> build

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
existing weapons you can actually build

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.880 
existing weapons you can actually build
your<00:01:31.310> weapons<00:01:31.580> from<00:01:31.729> scratch<00:01:32.530> pick<00:01:33.530> a<00:01:33.560> frame

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
your weapons from scratch pick a frame

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.639 
your weapons from scratch pick a frame
say<00:01:34.190> we<00:01:34.310> want<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.700> heavy<00:01:34.880> frame<00:01:35.149> and<00:01:35.450> then<00:01:36.350> we

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
say we want the heavy frame and then we

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.889 
say we want the heavy frame and then we
decide<00:01:36.979> when<00:01:37.220> we<00:01:37.340> want<00:01:37.520> as<00:01:37.789> an<00:01:37.970> engine<00:01:38.330> let's

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
decide when we want as an engine let's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.870 
decide when we want as an engine let's
say<00:01:39.110> we<00:01:39.289> want<00:01:39.530> a<00:01:39.679> Tesla<00:01:40.100> core<00:01:40.310> engine<00:01:40.670> which

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
say we want a Tesla core engine which

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.880 
say we want a Tesla core engine which
creates<00:01:41.240> like<00:01:41.390> electricity<00:01:41.810> that<00:01:42.530> comes<00:01:42.679> out

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
creates like electricity that comes out

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.670 
creates like electricity that comes out
of<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.039> gun<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:44.000> we<00:01:44.149> decide<00:01:44.509> that<00:01:44.539> okay<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:45.200> on

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
of the gun and we decide that okay so on

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.069 
of the gun and we decide that okay so on
that<00:01:45.979> gun<00:01:46.250> primary<00:01:47.180> adapter<00:01:47.689> which<00:01:47.810> is<00:01:47.960> the

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
that gun primary adapter which is the

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.660 
that gun primary adapter which is the
tip<00:01:48.289> of<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.530> gun<00:01:48.649> we<00:01:48.920> can<00:01:49.039> decide<00:01:49.310> what<00:01:49.520> kind

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
tip of the gun we can decide what kind

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.380 
tip of the gun we can decide what kind
of<00:01:49.850> electricity<00:01:50.299> tip<00:01:51.170> we<00:01:51.409> have<00:01:51.590> or<00:01:51.920> use<00:01:52.390> we've

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
of electricity tip we have or use we've

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.149 
of electricity tip we have or use we've
got<00:01:53.509> all<00:01:53.630> these<00:01:53.810> different<00:01:54.049> ones<00:01:54.350> let's<00:01:54.950> say

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
got all these different ones let's say

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.380 
got all these different ones let's say
we<00:01:55.189> want<00:01:55.729> this<00:01:56.420> one<00:01:56.659> and<00:01:56.990> then<00:01:58.030> for<00:01:59.030> the

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
we want this one and then for the

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.609 
we want this one and then for the
secondary<00:01:59.990> engine<00:02:00.789> we<00:02:01.789> can<00:02:01.969> decide<00:02:02.299> to<00:02:02.619> make

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
secondary engine we can decide to make

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.540 
secondary engine we can decide to make
the<00:02:03.799> bottom<00:02:04.130> one<00:02:04.340> say<00:02:05.530> make<00:02:06.530> fire<00:02:06.799> how's<00:02:07.100> that

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
the bottom one say make fire how's that

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.390 
the bottom one say make fire how's that
there<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.600> go<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.960> like<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.530> gun<00:02:10.890> let's<00:02:11.160> build
