00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:15.200
 first time in asking how fast you're too 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:16.640
 foot from country to country or if I was running 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.710
 of course from robbie williams 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.560
 especially before sprinting not the advice 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.599
 but take place with your body 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.240
 so I can pretty fast 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.929
 if max i think i have one too 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.490
 out of the real construction pushed 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:37.100
 because what are not just sides like what 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:39.020
 or meter with photo and no bread so 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.330
 probably no reporting time but 30 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.980
 meter flying 103 seconds 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.800
 that means you run but some 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.650
 taken in the meantime 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.900
 and it was good 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.040
 I hope so my legs can be very 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.740
 quickly put each other 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.460
 However , I have the handicap that 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.160
 my legs relative percent told me 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.360
 that sprint over 100 meters no chance 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.520
 I can speed up that fast 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.490
 I could someday but then so 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.620
 the second row is 33 meters 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.650
 that is the problematic question 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.660
 the work in progress 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.240
 but let me say quickly 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.710
 to run after when 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.180
 has done something I am with what 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.200
 to say so at the federal police 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.119
 active 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.590
 Unmatched how are you at all 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.539
 get to the track cycling 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.460
 I am now knows so times like rad 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.020
 I was driving on vacation in Belgium 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.299
 there came the tour de france and 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.590
 then I wanted to be like the big ones of that time 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:41.439
 heroes for me on leaps and I want 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.719
 like to visit my hometown while cycling 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.759
 logged in and the entrance signs 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:49.000
 I have depended on everyone relatively quickly 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.439
 At that time the elite were there you can 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.420
 yes said he wants to be on the train in 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.959
 sprint that can not be sure what he is 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.340
 should 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.420
 we did that halfway 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.770
 year later at the German 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.360
 third came in 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.549
 the national team and has since 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.420
 I like that , yes, where never saw it 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.369
 I definitely fuck a bit 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.869
 talent but yes that genetics so 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.130
 One says also to endurance driver can 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.729
 you have to be done in sprint 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.410
 born 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.099
 These are the questions that are with me 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.720
 are pronounced and that is what I have from 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.380
 I had this game with me here for 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.890
 discovered me 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.400
 Fast could be here in the muscle color 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.400
 meißen 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.310
 how would those moments that we in the 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.840
 last video pronounced 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.909
 who have now taken with it or 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.700
 perhaps summarized again as 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:36.400
 will be the overall nutrition plan 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.230
 have created then you have a good 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.090
 feeling at the supplement I have one 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.489
 good feeling in any case there you have to 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.079
 really say it's just me 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.870
 Relatively much weight could reduce 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.879
 relatively short time so are almost five 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.859
 kilo by now you have to, of course 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.420
 you still need the competition season 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.980
 to come along anyway is as the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.909
 I also motivated the women 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.970
 made was on the 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.950
 become regenerative between 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.060
 the sprint people and what you also in the 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.980
 last year has seen 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.870
 that I do not have the clock now 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.790
 susceptibility to cramping 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.620
 Musculature we have it with requirements as 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.930
 local with notice that I quite a lot 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.340
 better and it is like the car if 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.569
 better than test more 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.000
 You can also do some 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:21.560
 producing are already right of weighing 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.170
 and if thanks go to over and over again 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.560
 the best arrangements for joint arrangements 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.480
 concept for the city 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.190
 from it for the develop and always 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.530
 optimize again and update ourselves 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.209
 Wedding that is not so fast 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.920
 the axis observations have made 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:41.840
 and it's important that everything is still too 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:46.019
 adjust requests go and solarium 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.400
 sometimes profit very irregularly 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.750
 sometimes I'm a bit ahead 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.340
 of course not dry from the sun 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.739
 The cyclists also seem nice again 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.050
 Sun names from 50 to 60 kilometers 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.890
 compensatory punishment drilling the 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.090
 muscle again norbert and the whole 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.130
 poisoning substances that would have just 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.380
 of course also came through the training 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.680
 are excreted then or system 50 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.690
 and I stand for it 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.760
 Of course, also relatively fast 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.440
 the legs very brown or on the 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.120
 poor and in the face sometimes that me 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.950
 then it is not in the solarium malerin 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.530
 only straubinger if we then 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.970
 sometimes not like spoken though 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:27.080
 I have no disk at the moment 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.379
 a question where do you get your pants 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.629
 the question is how I do not want that 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:33.770
 just because I always try to eat 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.419
 shopping makes me generally do 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.150
 no fun i'm pretty fast 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.960
 seldom have been buying and when I have that 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.770
 times makes a 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.900
 It's a visual so I'm the first one 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.520
 Round which I can get, too 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.199
 press however sensor that I the 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.419
 mostly three four lives larger 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.919
 must then on the waist and on what 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.569
 must be taken down then from below 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.340
 the leg length what to take away and 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:58.090
 then that is also fitting and lasts 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.469
 four weeks and then it's over again 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.669
 culture I already have mine 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:03.740
 trunk dressmaker 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.240
 he brought me the pants then past because 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.620
 you reinforce it again coach and 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.449
 so on and lemgo krz for so long 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.150
 worn that nothing notice that I 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:13.520
 really then forced again 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.650
 So if you want to do that, you have to do it 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.569
 We go shopping together then roses 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.169
 would have the comments below 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:20.419
 write 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.240
 and the more comments collected the more 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.699
 the chances are better that we will him 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.389
 persuaded by manage the tourist 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.300
 bronze 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:33.129
 this is a minute 45 standard platform 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.129
 city ​​longest live 1000 meters
