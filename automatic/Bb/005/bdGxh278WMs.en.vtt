but I can't talk in that other voice for

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.570 
but I can't talk in that other voice for
the<00:00:24.990> entire<00:00:25.230> video<00:00:25.470> no<00:00:26.160> one<00:00:26.279> would<00:00:26.430> ever

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
fiber helmets that right now we have on

of fell into this carbon fiber of March

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.190 
of fell into this carbon fiber of March
Madness<00:00:35.640> by<00:00:36.000> accident<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:36.899> thought<00:00:37.110> it

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
Madness by accident but we thought it

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.479 
Madness by accident but we thought it
would<00:00:37.290> make<00:00:37.350> sense<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.920> put<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.309> video

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
would make sense to put this video

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.250 
would make sense to put this video
together<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.420> kind<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.750> compare<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.079> contrast

looking for right now but no you're not
might<00:00:45.450> not<00:00:45.600> know<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> differences<00:00:46.469> are

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
might not know what the differences are

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.130 
might not know what the differences are
but<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.670> big<00:00:48.059> key<00:00:48.239> factor<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.750> all<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.050> these

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140

people<00:01:02.010> say<00:01:02.129> well<00:01:02.309> why<00:01:02.579> carbon<00:01:02.850> fiber<00:01:03.180> two

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
people say well why carbon fiber two

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.170 
people say well why carbon fiber two
reasons<00:01:04.110> one<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.650> insanely<00:01:05.339> strong<00:01:05.850> and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
reasons one it's insanely strong and

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.660 
reasons one it's insanely strong and
that<00:01:06.540> strength<00:01:06.930> really<00:01:07.590> ups<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.040> protective

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
that strength really ups the protective

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.940 
that strength really ups the protective
value<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> helmet<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.170> other<00:01:10.380> key<00:01:10.740> factor

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
value of the helmet the other key factor

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.890 
value of the helmet the other key factor
though<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.460> when<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.210> reinforce<00:01:12.750> a

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
though is when you really reinforce a

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.899 
though is when you really reinforce a
helmet<00:01:13.290> if<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.710> use<00:01:13.890> normal<00:01:14.280> materials<00:01:14.790> to

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
helmet if you use normal materials to

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.370 
helmet if you use normal materials to
get<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> strength<00:01:15.570> level<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.080> carbon

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
get to the strength level of a carbon

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.840 
get to the strength level of a carbon
fiber<00:01:16.560> helmet<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.310> have<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.549> increase<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
fiber helmet you have to increase the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.090 
fiber helmet you have to increase the
weight<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.720> beauty<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.080> carbon<00:01:19.470> fiber<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.920> not

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
weight the beauty of carbon fiber is not

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.460 
weight the beauty of carbon fiber is not
only<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.759> lighter<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.960> helmet<00:01:22.200> for<00:01:22.409> a

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
only is it lighter but this helmet for a

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.380 
only is it lighter but this helmet for a
strong<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.490> ends<00:01:24.060> up<00:01:24.150> lighter

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
strong it is as it is ends up lighter

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.030 
strong it is as it is ends up lighter
than<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> normal<00:01:24.990> shell<00:01:25.200> helmet<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.590> begin<00:01:25.860> with

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
than a normal shell helmet to begin with

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.649 
than a normal shell helmet to begin with
so<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.430> end<00:01:26.580> up<00:01:26.640> with<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> brilliantly<00:01:27.390> light

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
so you end up with a brilliantly light

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.050 
so you end up with a brilliantly light
helmet<00:01:28.020> that's<00:01:28.320> extremely<00:01:28.860> protective<00:01:29.340> so

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
helmet that's extremely protective so

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.370 
helmet that's extremely protective so
what<00:01:30.240> you're<00:01:30.390> gonna<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.810> front<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.140> me<00:01:31.229> is

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
what you're gonna see in front of me is

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.560 
what you're gonna see in front of me is
what<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.710> would<00:01:31.829> consider<00:01:32.070> good<00:01:32.579> better<00:01:32.909> best

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
what I would consider good better best

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.289 
what I would consider good better best
you<00:01:34.020> have<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> HJC<00:01:34.710> FS<00:01:35.369> 15<00:01:35.759> carbon<00:01:36.090> fiber

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
you have the HJC FS 15 carbon fiber

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.510 
you have the HJC FS 15 carbon fiber
which<00:01:36.810> really<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.170> it's<00:01:37.380> about<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.770> originally

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
which really is it's about it originally

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.920 
which really is it's about it originally
a<00:01:38.549> four<00:01:38.820> hundred<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.180> fifty<00:01:39.390> dollar<00:01:39.570> helmet
