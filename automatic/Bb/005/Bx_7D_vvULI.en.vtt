00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
example we go to the nearby electronics

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.639 
example we go to the nearby electronics
store<00:00:05.520> and<00:00:05.759> we<00:00:06.420> look<00:00:06.600> at<00:00:06.720> all<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.960> TVs<00:00:07.319> on<00:00:07.529> the

look on the wall and you always migrate

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.530 
look on the wall and you always migrate
to<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.480> one<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:13.530> looks<00:00:13.799> what<00:00:14.130> more<00:00:14.940> colorful

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540

to the one that looks what more colorful
more<00:00:15.839> bright<00:00:16.430> more<00:00:17.430> contrasting<00:00:18.270> you're

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
more bright more contrasting you're

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.240 
more bright more contrasting you're
always<00:00:18.690> looking<00:00:19.140> for<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.380> one<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.710> has<00:00:19.770> more

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
always looking for the one that has more

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.080 
always looking for the one that has more
pop<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:21.619> the<00:00:22.619> thing<00:00:22.949> about<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:24.060> that

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
pop and the thing about that is is that

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.269 
pop and the thing about that is is that
of<00:00:24.420> course<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.720> looks<00:00:25.019> more<00:00:25.289> attractive<00:00:25.410> and

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
of course that looks more attractive and

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.550 
of course that looks more attractive and
they've<00:00:26.550> actually<00:00:26.699> taken<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.420> strategy<00:00:28.289> and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
they've actually taken that strategy and

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.740 
they've actually taken that strategy and
put<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.279> into<00:00:29.580> your<00:00:29.670> camera<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.390> when<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.630> go

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
put it into your camera so when you go

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.749 
put it into your camera so when you go
to<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.019> camera<00:00:31.380> store<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.949> you're<00:00:32.369> taking

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
to the camera store and you're taking

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.920 
to the camera store and you're taking
pictures

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
pictures

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.950 
pictures
maybe<00:00:34.590> comparing<00:00:35.130> an<00:00:35.250> icon<00:00:35.700> or<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> Canon<00:00:36.719> or<00:00:36.930> a

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
maybe comparing an icon or a Canon or a

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.139 
maybe comparing an icon or a Canon or a
pen<00:00:37.200> text<00:00:37.559> or<00:00:37.649> whatever<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.760> look<00:00:38.940> at<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
pen text or whatever and you look at the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.720 
pen text or whatever and you look at the
difference<00:00:39.540> you're<00:00:39.870> gonna<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:41.040> statistics

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
difference you're gonna the statistics

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.250 
difference you're gonna the statistics
would<00:00:41.850> show<00:00:42.149> pick<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.840> has<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
would show pick the one that has the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.430 
would show pick the one that has the
more<00:00:43.440> color<00:00:44.510> saturation<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.719> more<00:00:45.989> pop<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
more color saturation the more pop the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.920 
more color saturation the more pop the
more<00:00:46.590> contrast<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.370> more<00:00:47.489> impact<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.329> that's

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
more contrast the more impact and that's

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.600 
more contrast the more impact and that's
not<00:00:49.170> necessarily<00:00:49.860> good<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.219> I'll<00:00:50.309> tell<00:00:50.520> you

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
not necessarily good and I'll tell you

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.850 
not necessarily good and I'll tell you
why<00:00:50.789> because<00:00:51.030> when<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.050> are<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.230> professional

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
why because when you are a professional

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.979 
why because when you are a professional
photographer<00:00:53.120> you<00:00:54.120> don't<00:00:54.390> want<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.780> lot<00:00:54.960> of

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
photographer you don't want a lot of

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.569 
photographer you don't want a lot of
contrast<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.800> don't<00:00:55.980> want<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.340> lot<00:00:56.550> of

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
contrast you don't want a lot of

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.110 
contrast you don't want a lot of
saturation<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:58.230> example<00:00:58.590> here<00:00:58.879> I've<00:00:59.879> got

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
saturation for example here I've got

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.439 
saturation for example here I've got
this<00:01:00.600> image<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> right<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.879> don't<00:01:03.300> know

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
this image on the right and I don't know

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.820 
this image on the right and I don't know
how<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.690> looks<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.229> screen<00:01:04.530> but

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
how it looks like on the screen but

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.190 
how it looks like on the screen but
online<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:06.180> looks<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.840> one<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
online it just looks the one on the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.990 
online it just looks the one on the
right<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> lot<00:01:07.890> more<00:01:08.070> colorful<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.850> lot

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
right is a lot more colorful and a lot

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.120 
right is a lot more colorful and a lot
more<00:01:09.180> contrast<00:01:09.600> II<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.890> were<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:10.979> look

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
more contrast II now if you were to look

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.250 
more contrast II now if you were to look
at<00:01:11.250> these<00:01:11.400> up<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.880> wall<00:01:12.150> if<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.110> was<00:01:13.229> a

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
at these up on the wall if it was a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.810 
at these up on the wall if it was a
television<00:01:13.680> store<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.159> something<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.640> that

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
television store or something like that

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.820 
television store or something like that
you'd<00:01:15.030> probably<00:01:15.299> pick<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> right

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
you'd probably pick the one on the right

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.890 
you'd probably pick the one on the right
you'd<00:01:17.250> go<00:01:17.400> wow<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.880> one's<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.360> got<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> lot

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
you'd go wow that one's just got a lot

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.050 
you'd go wow that one's just got a lot
more<00:01:18.930> pop<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.770> got<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> lot<00:01:20.130> more<00:01:20.159> punch<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
more pop it's got a lot more punch and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.149 
more pop it's got a lot more punch and
so<00:01:21.689> therefore<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.560> think<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.009> that's

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
so therefore you think that that's

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.219 
so therefore you think that that's
actually<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.909> nicer<00:01:24.360> looking<00:01:24.689> camera<00:01:25.110> it'll

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
actually the nicer looking camera it'll

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.429 
actually the nicer looking camera it'll
give<00:01:25.500> more<00:01:25.920> colorful<00:01:26.729> images<00:01:27.350> but<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
give more colorful images but the

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.050 
give more colorful images but the
problem<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.220> when<00:01:29.340> you're<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> professional

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
problem is is when you're a professional

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.679 
problem is is when you're a professional
photographer<00:01:31.040> contrast<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.340> saturation<00:01:32.880> are

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
photographer contrast and saturation are

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.230 
photographer contrast and saturation are
the<00:01:33.930> enemy<00:01:34.320> they<00:01:34.890> actually<00:01:35.369> go<00:01:35.549> against<00:01:36.060> you

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the enemy they actually go against you

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.510 
the enemy they actually go against you
if<00:01:36.869> you're<00:01:37.170> say<00:01:37.470> for<00:01:37.680> example<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.189> wedding

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
if you're say for example a wedding

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.039 
if you're say for example a wedding
photographer<00:01:38.670> or<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.450> portrait<00:01:39.930> photographer

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
photographer or a portrait photographer

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.289 
photographer or a portrait photographer
because<00:01:40.860> what<00:01:41.009> happens<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.729> when<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.030> are

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
because what happens is is when you are

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.170 
because what happens is is when you are
meant<00:01:42.630> these<00:01:42.810> settings<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.500> get<00:01:44.100> colors<00:01:45.000> that

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
meant these settings you get colors that

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.630 
meant these settings you get colors that
a<00:01:45.210> little<00:01:45.509> bit<00:01:45.960> more<00:01:46.140> cartoonish<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.460> lot

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
a little bit more cartoonish and a lot

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.880 
a little bit more cartoonish and a lot
less<00:01:47.850> accurate<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.930> other<00:01:49.079> problem<00:01:49.619> with

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
less accurate the other problem with

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.670 
less accurate the other problem with
having<00:01:50.399> high<00:01:50.700> contrast<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.470> see

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
having high contrast is you can see

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.530 
having high contrast is you can see
right<00:01:52.860> here<00:01:52.920> I'm<00:01:53.430> starting<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.939> blow<00:01:54.119> out<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
right here I'm starting to blow out the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.139 
right here I'm starting to blow out the
forehead<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:56.250> know<00:01:56.369> kind<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.850> making

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
forehead and you know kind of making

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.780 
forehead and you know kind of making
them<00:01:57.299> really<00:01:57.479> white<00:01:57.810> and

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
them really white and

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.930 
them really white and
when<00:01:59.360> you<00:01:59.510> do<00:01:59.720> that<00:02:00.010> you<00:02:01.010> start<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.490> get<00:02:01.610> blown

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
when you do that you start to get blown

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.600 
when you do that you start to get blown
out<00:02:02.120> images<00:02:02.510> and<00:02:03.020> that's<00:02:03.530> not<00:02:03.800> repairable

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
out images and that's not repairable

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.320 
out images and that's not repairable
here's<00:02:05.150> a<00:02:05.240> key<00:02:05.540> rule<00:02:05.780> in<00:02:06.140> editing<00:02:06.530> your<00:02:06.710> images

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
here's a key rule in editing your images

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.110 
here's a key rule in editing your images
you<00:02:08.330> can<00:02:08.450> always<00:02:08.750> increase<00:02:09.760> contrast<00:02:10.760> you<00:02:11.090> can

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
you can always increase contrast you can

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.000 
you can always increase contrast you can
always<00:02:11.510> increase<00:02:11.900> saturation<00:02:12.200> but<00:02:12.920> you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
always increase saturation but you

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.430 
always increase saturation but you
cannot<00:02:13.400> go<00:02:13.670> backwards<00:02:14.270> once<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:14.840> have<00:02:15.020> it<00:02:15.230> too

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
cannot go backwards once you have it too

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.980 
cannot go backwards once you have it too
much<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:16.070> so<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:17.030> actual<00:02:17.420> trick<00:02:17.780> would<00:02:17.960> be

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
much and so the actual trick would be

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.740 
much and so the actual trick would be
start<00:02:18.740> off<00:02:18.950> with<00:02:19.370> low<00:02:19.790> contrast<00:02:20.390> low

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
start off with low contrast low

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.620 
start off with low contrast low
saturation<00:02:21.380> then<00:02:22.340> if<00:02:22.490> you<00:02:22.610> need<00:02:22.910> a<00:02:22.940> shot<00:02:23.390> that

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
saturation then if you need a shot that

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.600 
saturation then if you need a shot that
has<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:23.840> little<00:02:24.260> bit<00:02:24.380> more<00:02:24.440> image<00:02:25.070> or<00:02:25.250> more

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
has a little bit more image or more

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.520 
has a little bit more image or more
punch<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.510> can<00:02:26.660> go<00:02:26.780> ahead<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:26.990> do<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.200> later

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
punch you can go ahead and do that later

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.900 
punch you can go ahead and do that later
in<00:02:27.680> your<00:02:27.890> image<00:02:28.100> editing<00:02:28.250> software<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:30.910> let

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
in your image editing software and let

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.210 
in your image editing software and let
me<00:02:32.150> show<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.450> what<00:02:32.690> happens<00:02:33.170> when<00:02:33.470> I<00:02:33.650> increase

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
me show you what happens when I increase

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.040 
me show you what happens when I increase
the<00:02:34.430> color<00:02:34.730> saturation<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:35.720> we'll<00:02:35.870> go<00:02:35.990> to

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
the color saturation so we'll go to

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.640 
the color saturation so we'll go to
adjust<00:02:36.560> now<00:02:37.520> watch<00:02:37.760> this<00:02:38.320> see<00:02:39.320> right<00:02:39.470> here

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
adjust now watch this see right here

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.560 
adjust now watch this see right here
what's<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.040> saturation<00:02:40.580> I'd<00:02:41.030> like<00:02:41.300> you<00:02:41.450> to

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
what's the saturation I'd like you to

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.140 
what's the saturation I'd like you to
look<00:02:41.690> at<00:02:41.840> these<00:02:42.020> two<00:02:42.320> squares<00:02:42.710> right<00:02:43.100> here<00:02:43.490> the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
look at these two squares right here the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.940 
look at these two squares right here the
kind<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.510> pinkish<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.140> reddish<00:02:45.500> when<00:02:45.920> I

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
kind of pinkish and the reddish when I

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.770 
kind of pinkish and the reddish when I
increase<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.670> saturation<00:02:46.880> watch<00:02:47.540> what

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
increase the saturation watch what

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.590 
increase the saturation watch what
happens<00:02:48.110> between<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.620> two<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:50.150> see<00:02:50.330> how<00:02:50.450> they

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
happens between the two you see how they

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.780 
happens between the two you see how they
become<00:02:50.840> almost<00:02:51.230> identical<00:02:51.860> now<00:02:52.490> you<00:02:52.550> really

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
become almost identical now you really

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.130 
become almost identical now you really
can't<00:02:53.090> tell<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:53.330> difference<00:02:53.750> between<00:02:53.840> these

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
can't tell the difference between these

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.590 
can't tell the difference between these
two<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.490> reason<00:02:55.820> that<00:02:55.850> that's<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.360> problem

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
two and the reason that that's a problem

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.580 
two and the reason that that's a problem
you<00:02:57.170> have<00:02:57.470> a<00:02:57.920> smaller<00:02:58.670> number<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.209> colors<00:02:59.870> in

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
you have a smaller number of colors in

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.030 
you have a smaller number of colors in
fact<00:03:00.980> your<00:03:01.640> Reds<00:03:01.970> have<00:03:02.540> all<00:03:02.720> become<00:03:03.140> the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
fact your Reds have all become the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.460 
fact your Reds have all become the
similar<00:03:04.430> red<00:03:04.640> so<00:03:05.060> if<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:05.480> have<00:03:05.780> like<00:03:06.140> say<00:03:06.410> for

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
similar red so if you have like say for

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.340 
similar red so if you have like say for
example<00:03:07.450> somebody's<00:03:08.450> standing<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:08.959> find<00:03:09.170> in

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
example somebody's standing and find in

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.170 
example somebody's standing and find in
front<00:03:09.590> of<00:03:09.739> a<00:03:09.800> firetruck<00:03:10.310> but<00:03:10.550> their<00:03:10.700> shirt<00:03:11.000> is

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
front of a firetruck but their shirt is

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.330 
front of a firetruck but their shirt is
a<00:03:11.209> little<00:03:11.480> bit<00:03:11.600> of<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.840> faded<00:03:12.350> red<00:03:12.530> the

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
a little bit of a faded red the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.180 
a little bit of a faded red the
firetruck<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.150> shirt<00:03:14.360> will<00:03:14.600> become

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
firetruck and the shirt will become

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.070 
firetruck and the shirt will become
screaming<00:03:16.190> red<00:03:16.400> if<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:17.090> increase<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.930> color

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
screaming red if you increase the color

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.990 
screaming red if you increase the color
saturation<00:03:18.380> what<00:03:18.920> I'm<00:03:19.040> saying<00:03:19.310> is<00:03:19.580> is<00:03:19.820> it's

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
saturation what I'm saying is is it's

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.949 
saturation what I'm saying is is it's
like<00:03:20.290> coloring<00:03:21.290> with<00:03:21.440> 64<00:03:22.160> crayons<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:23.269> if<00:03:23.840> you

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
like coloring with 64 crayons and if you

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.050 
like coloring with 64 crayons and if you
increase<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.530> saturation<00:03:25.070> you<00:03:25.310> go<00:03:25.519> down<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:25.850> 8

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
increase the saturation you go down to 8

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.740 
increase the saturation you go down to 8
crayons<00:03:26.510> so<00:03:27.320> your<00:03:28.070> blues<00:03:28.940> will<00:03:29.390> all<00:03:29.570> become

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
crayons so your blues will all become

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.449 
crayons so your blues will all become
the<00:03:30.050> similar<00:03:30.410> blue<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.920> Reds<00:03:31.130> will<00:03:31.310> all

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
the similar blue the Reds will all

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.340 
the similar blue the Reds will all
become<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:31.880> similar<00:03:32.209> red<00:03:32.390> and<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:33.050> problem

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
become the similar red and the problem

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.530 
become the similar red and the problem
with<00:03:33.500> that<00:03:33.530> is<00:03:34.040> that<00:03:34.280> will<00:03:34.670> make<00:03:34.700> your<00:03:35.000> images

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
with that is that will make your images

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.690 
with that is that will make your images
a<00:03:35.720> lot<00:03:36.050> less<00:03:36.350> realistic<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:37.250> lot<00:03:37.459> less

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
a lot less realistic and a lot less

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.240 
a lot less realistic and a lot less
natural-looking<00:03:38.420> so<00:03:38.959> you've<00:03:39.800> got<00:03:39.980> two

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
natural-looking so you've got two

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.440 
natural-looking so you've got two
opposing<00:03:40.730> forces

as I go straight to the picture style in
Canon<00:04:07.590> or<00:04:07.920> I<00:04:08.219> forgot<00:04:08.790> what<00:04:08.969> it's<00:04:09.120> called<00:04:09.180> in

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
Canon or I forgot what it's called in

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.800 
Canon or I forgot what it's called in
Nikon<00:04:09.930> but<00:04:10.170> they<00:04:10.859> all<00:04:11.010> have<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:11.459> type<00:04:11.760> of

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
Nikon but they all have this type of

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.809 
Nikon but they all have this type of
window<00:04:12.810> where<00:04:13.379> you<00:04:13.500> can<00:04:13.680> change<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.069> contrast

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
window where you can change the contrast

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.150 
window where you can change the contrast
the<00:04:15.180> sharpness<00:04:15.719> and<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.930> saturation<00:04:16.739> and

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
the sharpness and the saturation and

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.249 
the sharpness and the saturation and
this<00:04:17.489> is<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:17.699> canon<00:04:18.180> example<00:04:18.630> right<00:04:18.780> here<00:04:18.810> and

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259 
this is a canon example right here and

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.990 
this is a canon example right here and
you'll<00:04:19.620> see<00:04:19.799> that<00:04:19.949> these<00:04:20.130> numbers<00:04:20.370> here<00:04:20.940> are

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
you'll see that these numbers here are

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.409 
you'll see that these numbers here are
two<00:04:21.419> zero<00:04:21.840> zero<00:04:21.930> zero<00:04:23.000> two<00:04:24.000> being<00:04:24.360> the

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
two zero zero zero two being the

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.200 
two zero zero zero two being the
sharpness<00:04:25.229> what<00:04:25.889> I<00:04:25.919> like<00:04:26.220> to<00:04:26.370> do<00:04:26.550> because

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
sharpness what I like to do because

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.629 
sharpness what I like to do because
again<00:04:27.389> we<00:04:27.960> can<00:04:28.139> always<00:04:28.470> increase<00:04:29.009> anything

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
again we can always increase anything

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.520 
again we can always increase anything
later<00:04:29.850> that's<00:04:30.389> just<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.870> rule<00:04:31.050> I'm<00:04:31.199> trying<00:04:31.440> to

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
later that's just the rule I'm trying to

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.260 
later that's just the rule I'm trying to
say<00:04:31.710> if<00:04:32.220> you<00:04:32.340> can't<00:04:32.580> decrease

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
say if you can't decrease

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.540 
say if you can't decrease
I<00:04:33.300> would<00:04:33.840> rather<00:04:34.020> these<00:04:34.350> all<00:04:34.620> be<00:04:34.889> zero<00:04:35.220> zero

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
I would rather these all be zero zero

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.029 
I would rather these all be zero zero
zero<00:04:35.610> zero<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:37.020> reason<00:04:37.349> that<00:04:37.470> is<00:04:37.680> is<00:04:37.710> because

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
zero zero the reason that is is because

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.629 
zero zero the reason that is is because
when<00:04:38.910> I'm<00:04:39.120> shooting<00:04:39.690> I'll<00:04:40.500> be<00:04:40.710> able<00:04:40.979> to<00:04:41.160> go<00:04:41.340> and

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
when I'm shooting I'll be able to go and

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.969 
when I'm shooting I'll be able to go and
have<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.180> most<00:04:42.360> consistent<00:04:42.990> results<00:04:43.020> with

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
have the most consistent results with

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.550 
have the most consistent results with
the<00:04:44.099> softest<00:04:44.849> most<00:04:45.120> accurate<00:04:45.630> colors<00:04:46.169> for<00:04:46.470> the

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
the softest most accurate colors for the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.830 
the softest most accurate colors for the
most<00:04:46.740> professional<00:04:47.160> look<00:04:47.639> so<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.660> first
