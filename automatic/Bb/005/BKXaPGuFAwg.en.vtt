typed it in wrong and that's just I know
I<00:00:26.760> just<00:00:27.000> spawned<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.300> little<00:00:27.510> way<00:00:28.050> never<00:00:28.680> mind<00:00:28.949> I

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
I just spawned a little way never mind I

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.440 
I just spawned a little way never mind I
take<00:00:29.279> back<00:00:29.460> what<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> said<00:00:32.030> I'm<00:00:33.030> pretty<00:00:33.210> sure

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
take back what I said I'm pretty sure

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.209 
take back what I said I'm pretty sure
the<00:00:33.630> first<00:00:33.750> time<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.050> spawn<00:00:34.469> was<00:00:34.680> somewhere

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
the first time I spawn was somewhere

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.170 
the first time I spawn was somewhere
around<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:37.280> surface<00:00:38.280> dungeon<00:00:38.760> should<00:00:39.000> be

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
around here surface dungeon should be

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.150 
around here surface dungeon should be
relatively<00:00:39.930> close<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.469> spawn<00:00:40.770> which<00:00:41.040> is

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
relatively close to the spawn which is

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.600 
relatively close to the spawn which is
right<00:00:41.370> there<00:00:44.270> I'll<00:00:45.270> explore<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.610> mountain

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
right there I'll explore the mountain

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.229 
right there I'll explore the mountain
explore<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.239> uh<00:00:48.270> show<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.289> what's<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:53.239> how

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
explore but uh show you what's in it how

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.939 
explore but uh show you what's in it how
I'm<00:00:54.840> not<00:00:54.989> sure<00:00:55.140> how<00:00:55.230> deep<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.890> think

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
I'm not sure how deep it is I think

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.700 
I'm not sure how deep it is I think
think<00:00:56.730> we're<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:59.960> guess<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.140> more<00:01:01.320> layer<00:01:01.590> it

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
think we're I guess one more layer it

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.530 
think we're I guess one more layer it
looks<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:04.880> anyways<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.060> has<00:01:06.119> some<00:01:06.390> pretty

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
looks like anyways this has some pretty

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.690 
looks like anyways this has some pretty
good<00:01:06.920> I'd<00:01:07.920> say<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.220> has<00:01:08.369> some<00:01:08.520> decent

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
good I'd say it has some decent

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.890 
good I'd say it has some decent
formations<00:01:09.330> but<00:01:11.270> 100<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.540> over<00:01:12.810> here<00:01:12.960> then

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
formations but 100 it's over here then

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.140 
formations but 100 it's over here then
how<00:01:15.900> freakin<00:01:16.590> may<00:01:17.100> okay<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.430> guess<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.909> one

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
how freakin may okay I guess it is one

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.050 
how freakin may okay I guess it is one
more<00:01:18.330> layer<00:01:18.570> other<00:01:18.750> than<00:01:19.110> this

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.150 

here's<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.180> first<00:01:25.390> one<00:01:25.770> got<00:01:26.770> some<00:01:26.950> cocoa

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
here's the first one got some cocoa

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.850 
here's the first one got some cocoa
beans<00:01:27.460> bread<00:01:27.850> strings<00:01:28.420> an<00:01:29.110> iron<00:01:29.410> bucket

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.330 

there's<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.220> zombie<00:01:34.030> spawner<00:01:34.480> and<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:36.130> last

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
there's the zombie spawner and the last

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.160 
there's the zombie spawner and the last
chest<00:01:36.760> so<00:01:36.940> you<00:01:37.000> got<00:01:37.150> some<00:01:37.330> gunpowder<00:01:37.720> another

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
chest so you got some gunpowder another

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.120 
chest so you got some gunpowder another
iron<00:01:38.410> bucket<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:38.950> some<00:01:39.130> iron<00:01:39.400> ingots<00:01:40.680> no<00:01:41.680> I

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
iron bucket and some iron ingots no I

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.190 
iron bucket and some iron ingots no I
believe<00:01:43.000> where<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.420> hell's<00:01:43.570> it<00:01:43.690> okay<00:01:43.990> over

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
believe where the hell's it okay over

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.490 
believe where the hell's it okay over
here

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
here

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.900 
here
so<00:01:44.710> I<00:01:44.770> think<00:01:44.860> I<00:01:45.160> gotta<00:01:45.340> go<00:01:45.520> over<00:01:45.610> in<00:01:45.790> this

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
so I think I gotta go over in this

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.130 
so I think I gotta go over in this
direction<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.920> once<00:01:48.910> I<00:01:49.090> get<00:01:49.600> close<00:01:49.990> enough

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
direction and once I get close enough

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.530 
direction and once I get close enough
I'll<00:01:50.440> I'll<00:01:51.100> be<00:01:51.250> able<00:01:51.400> to<00:01:51.490> see<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.030> area<00:01:52.360> but

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
I'll I'll be able to see the area but

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.210 
I'll I'll be able to see the area but
it's<00:01:52.690> basically<00:01:54.300> should<00:01:55.300> lead<00:01:55.540> to<00:01:55.780> NP<00:01:56.680> half

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
it's basically should lead to NP half

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.420 
it's basically should lead to NP half
it's<00:01:57.490> over<00:01:57.790> here<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.590> where's<00:01:59.830> the<00:02:00.040> surface

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
it's over here so where's the surface

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.940 
it's over here so where's the surface
engine<00:02:00.790> I<00:02:00.850> think<00:02:00.880> it's<00:02:01.210> over<00:02:01.330> there

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
engine I think it's over there

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.740 
engine I think it's over there
anyways<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.520> see<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.880> snow<00:02:04.090> biome<00:02:04.300> you<00:02:04.630> come

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
anyways you see the snow biome you come

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.410 
anyways you see the snow biome you come
over<00:02:04.900> in<00:02:05.050> this<00:02:05.170> direction<00:02:05.260> I<00:02:05.950> want<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.670> push<00:02:06.820> f3

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
over in this direction I want to push f3

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.230 
over in this direction I want to push f3
for<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.500> people<00:02:08.830> who<00:02:09.070> want<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.000> see<00:02:10.119> the

also<00:02:36.700> comes<00:02:37.060> up<00:02:37.269> a<00:02:37.390> little<00:02:37.540> bit<00:02:37.690> right<00:02:37.720> there

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
also comes up a little bit right there

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.509 
also comes up a little bit right there
I'm<00:02:38.440> not<00:02:38.650> sure<00:02:38.800> exactly<00:02:39.040> what<00:02:39.340> kind<00:02:39.489> of

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
I'm not sure exactly what kind of

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.540 
I'm not sure exactly what kind of
resources<00:02:39.940> there<00:02:40.239> are<00:02:40.950> what<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.220> small

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
resources there are what it is a small

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.680 
resources there are what it is a small
ravine<00:02:43.019> not<00:02:44.019> that<00:02:44.230> big<00:02:44.440> but<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:46.090> gets<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:46.480> the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
ravine not that big but it gets that the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.030 
ravine not that big but it gets that the
job<00:02:46.900> done<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:49.320> for<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.380> people<00:02:50.680> wanna<00:02:50.860> see

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
job done and for the people wanna see

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.759 
job done and for the people wanna see
the<00:02:51.130> coordinates<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:51.700> gonna<00:02:51.850> be<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:53.590> should

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
the coordinates it's gonna be you should

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.590 
the coordinates it's gonna be you should
see<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.040> this<00:02:54.820> should<00:02:55.030> be<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.180> high<00:02:55.360> enough

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
see that this should be a high enough

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.320 
see that this should be a high enough
quality<00:02:55.989> is<00:02:56.410> this<00:02:56.560> another

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:10.270 

and<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.480> doesn't<00:03:02.750> look<00:03:02.810> like<00:03:03.020> it<00:03:04.900> okay<00:03:09.160> yeah<00:03:10.160> it

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
and it doesn't look like it okay yeah it

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.220 
and it doesn't look like it okay yeah it
don't<00:03:10.400> look<00:03:10.520> like<00:03:10.610> it<00:03:10.940> anyways<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.050> then<00:03:12.140> you

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
don't look like it anyways and then you

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.820 
don't look like it anyways and then you
got<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.470> NPC<00:03:12.920> village<00:03:12.950> over<00:03:13.760> here<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.830> don't

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
got the NPC village over here I don't

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.530 
got the NPC village over here I don't
see<00:03:16.040> what<00:03:16.220> I<00:03:16.550> don't<00:03:16.880> think<00:03:17.090> there<00:03:17.240> is<00:03:17.270> anything

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
see what I don't think there is anything

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.510 
see what I don't think there is anything
else<00:03:17.870> around<00:03:18.020> his<00:03:18.350> what<00:03:18.680> I<00:03:18.710> came<00:03:18.950> across<00:03:19.160> is

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
else around his what I came across is

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.140 
else around his what I came across is
the<00:03:19.640> last<00:03:20.470> major<00:03:21.550> structure<00:03:22.550> I<00:03:22.580> came<00:03:22.940> across

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
the last major structure I came across

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.480 
the last major structure I came across
but<00:03:23.420> aha<00:03:23.810> I'll<00:03:24.230> do<00:03:24.830> a<00:03:24.860> little<00:03:25.040> double<00:03:25.190> check

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
but aha I'll do a little double check

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.210 
but aha I'll do a little double check
around<00:03:25.870> this<00:03:26.870> area<00:03:27.140> probably<00:03:27.560> no<00:03:27.770> another<00:03:27.980> NPC
