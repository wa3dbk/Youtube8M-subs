00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.990
 good friends we are back here in 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.119
 the garage and now let's talk of 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.080
 our today's cake series 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.550
 the camaro hot wheels 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.439
 Look 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.840
 we always see vehicles at scale 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.849
 inspired by normal vehicles and 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.550
 this is just the other way around 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.760
 from scale one to one inspired by a 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.050
 small scale vehicle but it is a 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.660
 successful partnership 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.690
 and to us more specifically the brand 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:46.500
 chevrolet did this 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.660
 let's say I enter into agreement with 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.530
 with hot wheels to produce a management 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.110
 special of this vehicle all 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.590
 staterooms are going to come in this blue color 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.570
 that seems nice to me and I think 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.150
 also that gives him that air of toy 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.250
 the decoration we can see logos 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.220
 authors here also here on the grill 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.600
 we have 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:17.020
 this frame this red paint around 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.070
 from the grill that phase pronounced like 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.950
 a mini tumbaburros down and this is 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.670
 paint here in matt black and in gray 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.030
 also matte above the chest they give that 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.390
 distinct character of hot wheels las los 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.180
 wheels are also of exclusive design 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.710
 20 inches in black I've already 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.140
 said here I do not love rims 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.060
 blacks in this car look good and 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.590
 another detail 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.479
 is this rear spoiler that 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.789
 the painting is not in all the cameras 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.659
 black that comes from the chest goes through 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:58.000
 the roof and it gets here in the part 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:03.330
 back also here we have these 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.640
 stripes as well as inviting flames but 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.399
 in a blue color is also a 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.190
 decal made in blue gives you 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.210
 a little touch there is different the same 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.650
 that this false air intake that 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.020
 confers we got one more character 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.790
 special inside we will find 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.849
 also differences with relation 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.609
 the rest of the cameras continues 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.650
 course the hot wheels topic here in the 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:34.129
 stirrup there is your logo on the 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:38.260
 seats too and for everything else what 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:42.319
 you have is a normal camaro in mexico 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:46.340
 we will only have this version that is to say it is 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.590
 a camaro ss v8 6.2 liter 400 horses 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.519
 of force with an automatic box of 6 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.650
 speeds is the only configuration 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.530
 possible for mexico in usa there is the 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.569
 convertible version also of the camaro 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.879
 hot wheels and I think there's even the 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.430
 v6 version there may also be box 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.579
 manual and in Mexico we only have this 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.560
 configuration the finished of the camaro 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:13.099
 they improved inside in a way 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.540
 overall the design is still inspired 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.389
 in the past but good we already have the 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.099
 new stingray that we will wait and 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.430
 good forgiveness there is destiny king is the 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:24.139
 corvette we have the new camera 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.190
 released in new york 'now makes 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.530
 bit 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.450
 the design of the interior does not change much 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.160
 I've seen it, we'll have to see the finished 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.410
 really when you're in a room 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.140
 they have few opportunities to go up and 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.110
 look carefully at those details 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.320
 determined but improved with relation 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.500
 to the previous vehicle this v8 continues 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.920
 being a powerful and rich engine like 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.790
 to give us that kind of sounds not 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.340
 it's a nice car in terms of 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.310
 acceleration in terms of even curve 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.690
 or the complicated part of the camera already 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.720
 I said here before is the 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:08.640
 visibility be watch let me close the 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:11.160
 door and they will see that I stay 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.370
 very enclosed that inside is the area of 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.959
 the crystals is very small so much here 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.560
 on the windshield 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.900
 like in the back doors that's 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.180
 normal so you have the vision 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.160
 three-quarter- meter rear obstructed by 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.160
 that pillar is traditional in a coupe 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.860
 but that you have very few 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.030
 here we have less than 30 centimeters of 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.400
 height of the glasses of the camaro that 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.800
 it gives him that bad air from outside the 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.600
 car that you like a lot but also 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.600
 makes coexisting with the car be 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.030
 difficult or with this car all the 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.810
 time you have to be looking towards 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.180
 everywhere to see if you can leave if 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.750
 you can enter a street the chest is 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.419
 long your position sitting in the car 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.910
 is distant from the center of the car if 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:06.330
 you get to a turnoff you have to put 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.730
 almost the entire chest and lean much 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.380
 to be seeing where you're going if that 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.860
 It happens in many cars but you spend one 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.840
 most accentuated in a camera 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.659
 and pretends that living with the 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.940
 car is not as simple as it is 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:21.160
 now 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.080
 because what is the point of making a 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.390
 vehicle a special edition like the 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.690
 hot wheels camera that costs 610 thousand 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.970
 weights there are only 100 vehicles for sale 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.770
 and mexico of this edition what is the 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.969
 point to do it if you're not going to do it 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.789
 more powerful 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:41.209
 Well, I'd say it's a little bit like 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:43.309
 for a child to buy a suit of 

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:46.989
 batman or superman or something by the 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:50.389
 style and you want to feel you 

00:05:46.989 --> 00:05:53.559
 different not to the child when dressing a 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:57.409
 batman costume if you have one side of the 

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:59.599
 fantasy that is batman and the other is nothing 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:02.449
 more for others to see and for 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:04.279
 somehow he pulled a smile or the 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.549
 envy of their peers because all 

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:09.489
 somehow we want children is 

00:06:06.549 --> 00:06:12.769
 superheroes I think that's the point 

00:06:09.489 --> 00:06:14.569
 of the decoration of this car is that 

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:18.289
 its owners know that it has an edition 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:20.989
 special who has a different clothing than 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:24.019
 the majority that not everyone has what 

00:06:20.989 --> 00:06:26.839
 that this car has if you 're not going to 

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:31.339
 accelerate faster than a ss camera 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:33.439
 normal you will not have a power of a 

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:37.549
 ctl one that we hope to have here very 

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:39.289
 soon in the garage but you will have if 

00:06:37.549 --> 00:06:43.230
 I repeat, I insist 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:46.850
 different clothes um 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:50.070
 a unique look at a base you're going to 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:52.770
 provoke the same feeling as the 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.660
 child batman dress is going to provoke in 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.210
 his friends to the people on the street when 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.310
 happens they do not know how many people they 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.410
 he turns to see him on the street when he passes 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:04.020
 because everyone thinks this this 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.900
 car is different it will be only 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.810
 aesthetically it will be just one clothes I repeat 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.940
 but it's different because what makes you 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.280
 feel especially depending on the 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:17.310
 looks of others if it is different and 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:20.700
 that's why I think you have an audience 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:24.420
 enough to make it worthwhile 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:26.640
 the edition thank you very much for your 

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:30.080
 attention and of course see you here 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.080
 with the garage in the coming week
