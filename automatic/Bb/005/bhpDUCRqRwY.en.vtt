not<00:01:30.420> really<00:01:30.509> short<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.900> pattern<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:32.130> this

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
not really short the pattern is and this

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.280 
not really short the pattern is and this
was<00:01:32.430> fifty<00:01:32.729> dollars<00:01:33.000> instead<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.390> 70<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.930> sales
