I covered about 260 miles in about seven
hours<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.500> think<00:01:17.220> my<00:01:18.150> average<00:01:18.720> speed<00:01:19.049> was<00:01:19.200> about

hours I think my average speed was about
45<00:01:20.119> I've<00:01:21.119> encountered<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.409> lot<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:23.330> steep<00:01:24.330> hills

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
45 I've encountered a lot of steep hills

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.270 
45 I've encountered a lot of steep hills
and<00:01:24.869> stuff<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.560> none<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.009> them<00:01:26.130> were<00:01:26.250> a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
and stuff and none of them were a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.649 
and stuff and none of them were a
problem<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.939> only<00:01:27.119> problem<00:01:27.540> I've

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
problem the only problem I've

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.640 
problem the only problem I've
encountered<00:01:28.250> was<00:01:29.250> when<00:01:29.700> there<00:01:30.119> wasn't<00:01:30.650> plowed

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
encountered was when there wasn't plowed

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.039 
encountered was when there wasn't plowed
snow<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.520> would<00:01:32.970> literally<00:01:33.299> get<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.630> top<00:01:33.869> of

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
snow I would literally get on top of

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.830 
snow I would literally get on top of
snow<00:01:34.259> because<00:01:34.409> these<00:01:34.820> aren't<00:01:35.820> deep<00:01:36.210> enough<00:01:36.390> or

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
snow because these aren't deep enough or

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.399 
snow because these aren't deep enough or
narrow<00:01:37.710> enough<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.400> cut<00:01:38.640> through<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.210> snow<00:01:39.479> so

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
narrow enough to cut through the snow so

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.469 
narrow enough to cut through the snow so
that's<00:01:40.650> when<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.310> car<00:01:41.549> was<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:42.060> little

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
that's when the car was a little

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.710 
that's when the car was a little
squiggly<00:01:42.810> but<00:01:43.740> otherwise<00:01:44.040> our<00:01:44.520> car<00:01:45.360> behaved

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
squiggly but otherwise our car behaved

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.859 
squiggly but otherwise our car behaved
very<00:01:45.930> well<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.500> hadn't<00:01:47.340> had<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.729> traction<00:01:48.180> off

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
very well I hadn't had the traction off

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.310 
very well I hadn't had the traction off
I've<00:01:49.619> had<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.280> whole<00:01:50.460> time<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.320> you

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
I've had it on the whole time and you

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.670 
I've had it on the whole time and you
know<00:01:52.439> once<00:01:52.740> my<00:01:53.210> passengers<00:01:54.210> came<00:01:54.450> off<00:01:54.659> car<00:01:55.380> you

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
know once my passengers came off car you

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.149 
know once my passengers came off car you
know<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.950> traction<00:01:56.369> came<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.930> more<00:01:57.930> than

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
know the traction came on more than

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.340 
know the traction came on more than
usual<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.399> you<00:02:00.270> know<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.600> was<00:02:00.810> still<00:02:01.020> able<00:02:01.140> to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
usual but you know I was still able to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.440 
usual but you know I was still able to
continue<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:02.100> my<00:02:02.130> way<00:02:02.399> for<00:02:02.610> another<00:02:02.729> 70<00:02:03.210> miles

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
continue in my way for another 70 miles

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.850 
continue in my way for another 70 miles
which<00:02:04.380> was<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.979> total<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.549> about<00:02:05.909> 260<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
which was a total of about 260 in the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.080 
which was a total of about 260 in the
storm<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:09.390> this<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.470> DWS<00:02:11.459> they're<00:02:11.879> great

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
storm so this is it DWS they're great

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.059

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
from there you got to do something

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.809 
from there you got to do something
because<00:02:23.049> this<00:02:24.049> is<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:25.069> know<00:02:25.099> all<00:02:25.430> season
