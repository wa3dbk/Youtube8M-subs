00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
looking at very few over the course of

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.190 
looking at very few over the course of
hundreds<00:04:36.580> of<00:04:36.640> years<00:04:36.820> so<00:04:37.120> it's<00:04:37.480> not<00:04:37.960> they're

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
hundreds of years so it's not they're

off<00:06:37.490> I<00:06:37.700> didn't<00:06:37.880> exactly<00:06:38.090> do<00:06:38.300> a<00:06:38.330> lot<00:06:38.480> of

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.510 
off I didn't exactly do a lot of

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.610 
off I didn't exactly do a lot of
research<00:06:38.840> to<00:06:38.870> make<00:06:39.020> sure<00:06:39.080> that<00:06:39.320> they're<00:06:39.440> true

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
research to make sure that they're true

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.050 
research to make sure that they're true
but<00:06:39.800> i<00:06:39.830> did<00:06:40.070> find<00:06:40.100> them<00:06:40.550> on<00:06:40.790> a<00:06:41.180> website<00:06:41.919> and<00:06:42.919> uh

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
but i did find them on a website and uh

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.379 
but i did find them on a website and uh
yet<00:06:44.060> and<00:06:44.240> so<00:06:44.389> we're<00:06:44.600> not<00:06:44.720> scared<00:06:45.139> of<00:06:45.290> like<00:06:45.530> like

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:46.389

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:49.480 
yet and so we're not scared of like like
raucous<00:06:47.389> fixation<00:06:47.720> 500<00:06:48.710> times<00:06:48.950> as<00:06:49.130> much<00:06:49.220> as<00:06:49.280> we

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.490
