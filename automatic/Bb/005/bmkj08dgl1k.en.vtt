00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.360 
I have white floors with white grout and
that's<00:00:29.410> not<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.650> easiest<00:00:29.710> thing<00:00:30.070> to<00:00:30.100> keep

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:30.370 
that's not the easiest thing to keep

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.490 
that's not the easiest thing to keep
clean<00:00:30.700> especially<00:00:31.270> here<00:00:31.690> in<00:00:31.780> Las<00:00:31.900> Vegas<00:00:31.930> or<00:00:32.440> we

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
clean especially here in Las Vegas or we

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.840 
clean especially here in Las Vegas or we
have<00:00:32.650> so<00:00:32.830> much<00:00:32.950> black<00:00:33.250> stuff<00:00:33.580> from<00:00:33.700> our

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
have so much black stuff from our

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.790 
have so much black stuff from our
streets<00:00:34.210> because<00:00:34.360> the<00:00:34.629> asphalt<00:00:35.110> so<00:00:35.320> soft<00:00:35.620> is

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
streets because the asphalt so soft is

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.979 
streets because the asphalt so soft is
the<00:00:35.830> heat<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:37.180> it's<00:00:37.300> hard<00:00:37.540> to<00:00:37.660> keep<00:00:37.780> it<00:00:37.930> clean

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
the heat so it's hard to keep it clean

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.930 
the heat so it's hard to keep it clean
and<00:00:38.230> I<00:00:38.379> came<00:00:38.620> up<00:00:38.650> with<00:00:38.739> this<00:00:38.949> way<00:00:39.370> that<00:00:39.670> works

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
and I came up with this way that works

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.600 
and I came up with this way that works
these<00:00:40.809> floors<00:00:41.290> are<00:00:41.590> ten<00:00:41.920> years<00:00:41.949> old<00:00:42.370> and<00:00:42.489> this

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
these floors are ten years old and this

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.540 
these floors are ten years old and this
is<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:42.850> original<00:00:42.940> grout<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:44.530> again<00:00:44.920> nice<00:00:45.339> and

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
is the original grout but again nice and

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.259 
is the original grout but again nice and
white<00:00:45.730> because<00:00:46.570> what<00:00:47.530> I<00:00:47.559> learned<00:00:47.949> was<00:00:48.640> as<00:00:48.850> the

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
white because what I learned was as the

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.600 
white because what I learned was as the
grout<00:00:49.600> who<00:00:50.320> would<00:00:50.470> get<00:00:50.739> dirty<00:00:51.040> I<00:00:51.250> started

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
grout who would get dirty I started

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.710 
grout who would get dirty I started
looking<00:00:51.850> at<00:00:51.909> it<00:00:51.970> realized<00:00:52.330> that<00:00:52.479> grouts

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
looking at it realized that grouts

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.170 
looking at it realized that grouts
extremely<00:00:53.290> porous<00:00:53.620> so<00:00:54.339> the<00:00:54.460> dirt<00:00:54.729> would<00:00:54.970> get

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
extremely porous so the dirt would get

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.090 
extremely porous so the dirt would get
down<00:00:55.360> in<00:00:55.600> there<00:00:55.809> and<00:00:56.050> I<00:00:56.559> couldn't<00:00:56.860> do<00:00:56.949> anything

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
down in there and I couldn't do anything

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.430 
down in there and I couldn't do anything
about<00:00:57.280> it<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:57.850> one<00:00:58.600> day<00:00:58.720> to<00:00:58.780> start<00:00:59.080> thinking

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
about it and one day to start thinking

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.229 
about it and one day to start thinking
