there's<00:00:56.159> also<00:00:56.309> some<00:00:56.639> objectives<00:00:57.179> rather<00:00:57.479> than

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
there's also some objectives rather than

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.779 
there's also some objectives rather than
just<00:00:57.929> straight<00:00:58.260> up<00:00:58.289> killing<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.549> as<00:00:59.760> you

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
just straight up killing so as you

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.430 
just straight up killing so as you
progress<00:01:00.179> through<00:01:00.389> the<00:01:00.780> hice<00:01:00.959> you'll<00:01:01.229> find

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
progress through the hice you'll find

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.529 
progress through the hice you'll find
yourself<00:01:01.530> taking<00:01:01.889> on<00:01:02.190> harder<00:01:02.609> tasks<00:01:03.089> and<00:01:03.239> it

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
yourself taking on harder tasks and it

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.000 
yourself taking on harder tasks and it
really<00:01:03.749> shows<00:01:04.049> an<00:01:04.260> improvement<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
really shows an improvement of the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.640 
really shows an improvement of the
game's<00:01:05.220> actual<00:01:05.760> concept<00:01:06.270> now<00:01:06.990> at<00:01:07.200> one<00:01:07.470> point

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
game's actual concept now at one point

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.380 
game's actual concept now at one point
you<00:01:07.800> actually<00:01:08.160> have<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.430> hack<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.910> terminals

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
you actually have to hack the terminals

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.060 
you actually have to hack the terminals
to<00:01:09.570> open<00:01:09.780> up<00:01:09.870> the<00:01:09.990> vault<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.440> this<00:01:10.800> is<00:01:10.950> just

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
to open up the vault and this is just

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.730 
to open up the vault and this is just
basically<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:11.850> example<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.590> objectives<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
basically one example of objectives and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.690 
basically one example of objectives and
there's<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.980> bunch<00:01:14.160> of<00:01:14.280> other<00:01:14.460> little

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
there's a bunch of other little

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.400 
there's a bunch of other little
objectives<00:01:15.210> which<00:01:15.420> again<00:01:15.660> is<00:01:15.720> better<00:01:16.230> than

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
objectives which again is better than

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.650 
objectives which again is better than
regular<00:01:16.710> missions<00:01:17.250> as<00:01:17.430> we're<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.090> only<00:01:18.270> thing

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
regular missions as we're the only thing

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.960 
regular missions as we're the only thing
taking<00:01:19.110> place<00:01:19.350> our<00:01:19.530> deliveries<00:01:20.160> and<00:01:20.430> murders

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
taking place our deliveries and murders

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.510 
taking place our deliveries and murders
really<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.540> basically<00:01:22.440> it<00:01:22.740> actually<00:01:23.280> has<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
really and basically it actually has the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.300 
really and basically it actually has the
sound<00:01:24.120> effects<00:01:24.510> like<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> alarm<00:01:25.530> from<00:01:25.950> actual

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
sound effects like the alarm from actual

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.540 
sound effects like the alarm from actual
heist<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.810> now<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.620> basically<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:29.250> takes

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
heist so now this basically just takes

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.400 
heist so now this basically just takes
the<00:01:29.670> missions<00:01:30.120> to<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> whole<00:01:30.780> new<00:01:30.930> level<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
the missions to a whole new level and

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.050 
the missions to a whole new level and
it's<00:01:31.770> really<00:01:32.100> clever<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.610> see<00:01:32.790> how<00:01:32.910> they

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
it's really clever to see how they

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.850 
it's really clever to see how they
change<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.510> general<00:01:33.900> mechanics<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.530> how<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
change the general mechanics of how you

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.610 
change the general mechanics of how you
play<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.580> much<00:01:35.930> alright<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.110> towards<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.470> end

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
play so much alright so towards the end

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.620 
play so much alright so towards the end
of<00:01:37.980> the<00:01:38.040> video<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.640> shows<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.270> payout<00:01:39.600> of

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
of the video it shows you the payout of

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.210 
of the video it shows you the payout of
the<00:01:39.840> mission<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.440> I<00:01:40.650> know<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.830> lot<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.040> you're

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
the mission and I know a lot of you're

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.770 
the mission and I know a lot of you're
going<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.460> asking<00:01:41.940> why<00:01:42.390> didn't<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.690> get

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
going to be asking why didn't you get

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.390 
going to be asking why didn't you get
that<00:01:42.960> much<00:01:43.110> money<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> reason<00:01:43.980> for<00:01:44.220> that

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
that much money and the reason for that

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.490 
that much money and the reason for that
is<00:01:44.700> because<00:01:44.730> this<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> modded<00:01:45.990> mission<00:01:46.350> and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
is because this is a modded mission and

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.320 
is because this is a modded mission and
it's<00:01:46.830> not<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.159> actual<00:01:47.430> thing<00:01:47.550> I'm<00:01:48.000> pretty

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
it's not the actual thing I'm pretty

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.880 
it's not the actual thing I'm pretty
sure<00:01:48.510> when<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.840> actual<00:01:49.230> thing<00:01:49.320> comes<00:01:49.710> out

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
sure when the actual thing comes out

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.800 
sure when the actual thing comes out
it's<00:01:50.430> going<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.760> be<00:01:50.909> more<00:01:51.150> challenging<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
it's going to be more challenging and

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.560 
it's going to be more challenging and
you'll<00:01:52.200> get<00:01:52.380> around<00:01:52.880> 60,000<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.060> not<00:01:54.270> more

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
you'll get around 60,000 it's not more

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.810 
you'll get around 60,000 it's not more
and<00:01:54.870> I'm<00:01:55.740> not<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.920> hundred<00:01:56.070> percent<00:01:56.250> sure<00:01:56.550> on

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
and I'm not a hundred percent sure on

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.940 
and I'm not a hundred percent sure on
the<00:01:57.000> prices<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.780> that's<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.290> confirmed<00:01:58.680> I'm

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the prices so that's not confirmed I'm

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.560 
the prices so that's not confirmed I'm
just<00:01:59.370> giving<00:01:59.580> you<00:01:59.670> an<00:01:59.760> estimate<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.270> what<00:02:00.510> I

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
just giving you an estimate of what I

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.600
