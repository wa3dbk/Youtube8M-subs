00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:12.579
 hello that such risk are ready and 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.320
 I hope to tell today we are going to talk about a 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.599
 topic that I'm not very happy about so 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.880
 others will realize I have the shit in 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.429
 Look at the hair and we'll talk about that 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.960
 bad typical haircuts that when 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:25.000
 you go to a hairdresser you meet 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.220
 a lady who is more or less like that and 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.560
 just go feel please, we're going to 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.619
 attend to what one says now that 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.660
 wait but it happens all minutes and already 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.730
 they have the accomplices know that I want 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.800
 this cut well this portal that I have left 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.579
 yes he wants me to go he has me for 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.579
 She answers 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.160
 what you say and so I 'll leave it in your 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.050
 hand if you know how to cut my hair 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.900
 always what happens afterwards already what 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.160
 we have in sight I do not know with the mistress 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.630
 nor the hairdresser always say to 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.220
 just as I always touched, I did not 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.020
 they leave the same as always and here in 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.700
 result there are many cases are by 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.900
 example several friends who went to 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.400
 cut the hair and it was the tone 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.680
 awful concluding I'm going to name 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.210
 now not the name but she thought 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.380
 what you have left is that you see beautiful in 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.600
 change or I thought look what 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.010
 beautiful but it was horrible in fitur al 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.020
 Hairdresser is always a good choice 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.910
 but if you do not know the hairdresser it is 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.290
 another thing you can explain to him of the 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.720
 better way how do you want it to cut you 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.369
 the hair either saying a little cut here 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.869
 the girl that I'm going to the side 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.649
 and a little rba that the tips 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.000
 I will explain everything perfect but yes 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.800
 to see a reason reason or 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.240
 circumstance that the hairdresser does not 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.220
 understand and after saying with these words 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.440
 there do not worry if you're going to stay 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.630
 so beautiful I'm going to cut your little toes 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.950
 As you asked me, you are going to see 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.140
 walvis bay to which one remains as 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.719
 and leave it in their hand some 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.329
 Sometimes men cut their hair better 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.799
 of women as there are also people 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.899
 they do not like to go to the hairdresser and 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.579
 they prefer to save their money and cut themselves 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.289
 hair themselves to what would be something 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.729
 as well because for that the hairdresser 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.840
 with if I can cut it and see if not 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.490
 I have a lot to do if I have 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.500
 to cut here how 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.909
 and the reverend wins in the hair 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.680
 Going back to the subject of hairdressers 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.570
 they think they do the job well 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.890
 or sometimes if they do it right as in 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.259
 this case they did it wrong 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.000
 the hairdressers do it badly they know what 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.290
 they do badly but they do not dare to tell you 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.150
 who do it wrong after having 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.370
 finished cutting your hair happens in 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.410
 a meal with talcum powder with the ears 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.410
 neck between other parts 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.640
 Well the thing is that when you finish 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.770
 cut their hair they look at you 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.700
 hair show you with a mirror and you 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.160
 ask how he liked was if I 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.320
 like to which is a true lie 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.060
 when you leave the seat and look at the 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.670
 hairdresser to pay him he looks at you and says 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.350
 hey but you stayed divine 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.760
 if I get a good one but there is not always 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.810
 to blame the hairdresser to 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.340
 Sometimes the hair is stubborn 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.140
 and this was the clone of the week I hope 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.850
 that you liked me not much because 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.800
 the truth is that my hair I do not like 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.900
