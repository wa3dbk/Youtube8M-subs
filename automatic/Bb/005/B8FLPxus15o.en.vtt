00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
my humble opinion good well let's start

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.590 
my humble opinion good well let's start
with<00:00:58.980> build<00:00:59.309> quality<00:00:59.789> which<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.059> think<00:01:00.270> every

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
with build quality which I think every

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.779 
with build quality which I think every
mechanical<00:01:01.170> keyboard<00:01:01.620> deserves<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.399> you're

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
mechanical keyboard deserves if you're

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.640 
mechanical keyboard deserves if you're
investing<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.300> switches<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.080> are<00:01:04.140> rated<00:01:04.470> for

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
investing in switches that are rated for

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.980 
investing in switches that are rated for
50<00:01:05.040> million<00:01:05.250> P<00:01:05.610> strokes<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.510> would<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> shame

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
50 million P strokes it would be a shame

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.899 
50 million P strokes it would be a shame

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
apart after the first few times that you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.899 
apart after the first few times that you

I'm<00:03:30.380> guessing<00:03:30.920> that<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:31.130> realized<00:03:31.459> it<00:03:31.610> was

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730

there<00:03:31.910> already<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.390> as<00:03:32.750> LED<00:03:33.110> lighting<00:03:33.380> goes<00:03:33.590> I

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
there already and as LED lighting goes I

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.860 
there already and as LED lighting goes I
prefer<00:03:34.340> white<00:03:34.580> as<00:03:34.820> a<00:03:34.850> neutral<00:03:35.330> color<00:03:35.570> because

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
prefer white as a neutral color because

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.360 
prefer white as a neutral color because
it<00:03:35.989> will<00:03:36.110> blend<00:03:36.380> in<00:03:36.560> with<00:03:36.709> a<00:03:36.739> lot<00:03:36.950> of<00:03:36.980> desktop

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:57.319

the repeat rate of the keys when they're

Roseville RGB 80 right now which is
