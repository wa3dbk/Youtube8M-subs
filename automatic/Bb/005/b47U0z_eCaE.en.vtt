00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.460 
put it back together and as you'll see
normally<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.670> don't<00:00:23.820> move<00:00:24.300> quite<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:25.199> fast

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
normally I don't move quite this fast

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.670 
normally I don't move quite this fast
but<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:25.920> sped<00:00:26.340> up<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.519> video<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:27.000> little<00:00:27.300> bit

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
but I sped up the video a little bit

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.710 
but I sped up the video a little bit
there<00:00:28.680> was<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.070> many<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.490> these<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:30.119> kind<00:00:30.660> of

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
there was so many of these it kind of

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.080 
there was so many of these it kind of
takes<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.500> while<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.859> watch<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.460> there's<00:00:32.700> not<00:00:33.030> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
takes a while to watch but there's not a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.979 
takes a while to watch but there's not a
ton<00:00:33.450> going<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.670> these<00:00:35.670> spikes<00:00:36.450> as<00:00:36.809> you

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
ton going on these spikes as you

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.410 
ton going on these spikes as you
probably<00:00:37.380> saw<00:00:37.530> before<00:00:37.950> they're<00:00:38.879> really<00:00:39.059> like

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
probably saw before they're really like

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.720 
probably saw before they're really like
not<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> bolt<00:00:40.530> if<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.070> put<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
not in the bolt if you can put that

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.299 
not in the bolt if you can put that
together<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.570> could<00:00:43.230> assemble<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.950> it's

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
together you could assemble this it's

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.840 
together you could assemble this it's
not<00:00:44.550> too<00:00:44.879> complex<00:00:45.920> so<00:00:46.920> here<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.190> am<00:00:47.309> going

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
not too complex so here I am going

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.799 
not too complex so here I am going
through<00:00:48.800> just<00:00:49.800> one<00:00:49.950> by<00:00:50.399> one<00:00:50.760> adding<00:00:51.629> these

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
through just one by one adding these

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.209 
through just one by one adding these
spikes<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:54.410> this<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.770> kind<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
spikes and this is just kind of the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.549 
spikes and this is just kind of the
initial<00:00:56.730> fit<00:00:57.059> up<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.270> make<00:00:57.629> sure<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.379> is

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
initial fit up to make sure that this is

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.150 
initial fit up to make sure that this is
all<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.010> work<00:00:59.160> out<00:01:00.620> one<00:01:01.620> thing<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.129> i

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
all going to work out one thing that i

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.039 
all going to work out one thing that i
did<00:01:02.309> find<00:01:02.760> out<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.239> step<00:01:05.840> on<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
did find out in this step on the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.990 
did find out in this step on the
backside<00:01:07.680> those<00:01:08.010> screws<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.790> i'm<00:01:08.970> using

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
backside those screws that i'm using

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.630 
backside those screws that i'm using
their<00:01:09.720> they<00:01:10.080> stuck<00:01:10.439> out<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> little<00:01:11.010> too<00:01:11.310> far

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
their they stuck out a little too far

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.350 
their they stuck out a little too far
and<00:01:12.229> i<00:01:13.229> kind<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.770> wanted<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.220> back<00:01:14.460> perfectly

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and i kind of wanted that back perfectly

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.810 
and i kind of wanted that back perfectly
flat<00:01:15.930> well<00:01:16.350> i<00:01:16.380> couldn't<00:01:16.650> get<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.009> quite<00:01:17.520> there

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
flat well i couldn't get it quite there

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.620 
flat well i couldn't get it quite there
but<00:01:17.850> i<00:01:18.060> did<00:01:18.360> go<00:01:18.540> back<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.140> drill<00:01:19.380> press<00:01:19.740> and

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
but i did go back to the drill press and

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.920 
but i did go back to the drill press and
more<00:01:21.630> out<00:01:21.840> those<00:01:22.110> holes<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.920> little<00:01:23.159> bit<00:01:23.310> more

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
more out those holes a little bit more

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.020 
more out those holes a little bit more
they<00:01:24.930> had<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.500> screws<00:01:26.009> had<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> shoulder<00:01:26.640> on

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
they had the screws had a shoulder on

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.179 
they had the screws had a shoulder on
them<00:01:27.210> kind<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.840> tapered<00:01:28.229> shoulder<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.950> so

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
them kind of a tapered shoulder and so

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.969 
them kind of a tapered shoulder and so
they<00:01:30.090> would<00:01:30.329> go<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> little<00:01:30.780> bit<00:01:30.990> further<00:01:31.229> into

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.080 

into<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> metal<00:01:35.310> there<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:35.790> they<00:01:35.880> wouldn't

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
into the metal there so they wouldn't

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.140 
into the metal there so they wouldn't
stick<00:01:36.420> out<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> back<00:01:36.990> too<00:01:37.259> much<00:01:37.470> but

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
stick out on the back too much but

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.460

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
them though seeing how it's all gonna

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:13.099 
them though seeing how it's all gonna
shake<00:03:03.239> out<00:03:03.480> here<00:03:11.540> it's<00:03:12.540> coming<00:03:12.959> together

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
shake out here it's coming together

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:19.759 
shake out here it's coming together
pretty<00:03:13.950> good<00:03:17.600> now<00:03:18.600> our<00:03:18.780> next<00:03:18.810> step<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.709> to

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
pretty good now our next step is to

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.599 
pretty good now our next step is to
actually<00:03:20.190> fit<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:21.030> stomp<00:03:21.480> pad<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.220> board

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
the actual bore just kind of get an idea

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
the actual bore just kind of get an idea
of<00:03:39.480> placement<00:03:41.239> like<00:03:42.239> anything<00:03:42.750> before<00:03:43.139> we

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
of placement like anything before we

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.319 
of placement like anything before we
tape<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:44.040> down<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.549> just<00:03:44.819> kind<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.090> want<00:03:45.150> to

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
tape this down you just kind of want to

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.180 
tape this down you just kind of want to
see<00:03:45.510> what<00:03:45.660> it's<00:03:45.810> going<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:45.989> look<00:03:46.079> like<00:03:46.230> so<00:03:47.100> you

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
see what it's going to look like so you

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.180 
see what it's going to look like so you
can<00:03:47.340> have<00:03:47.489> an<00:03:47.609> idea<00:03:47.959> now<00:03:48.959> on<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.650> snowboard

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
can have an idea now on the snowboard

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.160 
can have an idea now on the snowboard
next<00:03:50.489> to<00:03:50.639> it<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.790> can<00:03:51.180> see<00:03:51.510> there<00:03:51.900> that's

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
next to it you can see there that's

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.849 
next to it you can see there that's
another<00:03:53.010> style<00:03:53.850> or<00:03:54.180> type<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.870> stop<00:03:55.260> head<00:03:55.590> right

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
another style or type of stop head right

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.059 
another style or type of stop head right
to<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.250> right<00:03:56.730> there<00:03:57.139> go<00:03:58.139> pan<00:03:58.440> back<00:03:58.739> here

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
to the right there go pan back here

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.309 
to the right there go pan back here
right<00:03:59.489> there<00:03:59.730> so<00:04:00.090> that's<00:04:00.239> an<00:04:00.450> existing<00:04:01.019> stomp

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
right there so that's an existing stomp

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.140 
right there so that's an existing stomp
pad<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.799> then<00:04:01.889> this<00:04:02.099> one<00:04:02.310> is<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.579> new<00:04:02.849> one

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
pad and then this one is the new one

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.990 
pad and then this one is the new one
that<00:04:03.599> we<00:04:03.780> may<00:04:04.190> see<00:04:05.190> both<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.519> boards<00:04:05.819> together

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
that we may see both the boards together

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.420 
that we may see both the boards together
there<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.840> contrast<00:04:07.410> between<00:04:07.530> them<00:04:07.949> and

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
there and the contrast between them and

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.999 
there and the contrast between them and
then<00:04:09.060> there's<00:04:09.299> a<00:04:09.389> shot<00:04:09.780> that<00:04:10.199> they<00:04:10.560> stop<00:04:10.799> that

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:11.009 
then there's a shot that they stop that

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.980 
then there's a shot that they stop that
we<00:04:11.190> made

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
we made

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.590 
we made
next<00:04:12.990> we're<00:04:13.140> going<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.470> attach<00:04:13.910> that<00:04:14.910> stomp

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
next we're going to attach that stomp

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.840 
next we're going to attach that stomp
pad<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:16.140> snowboard<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.220> what<00:04:17.549> I'm<00:04:17.640> going<00:04:17.670> to

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
pad to snowboard and what I'm going to

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.930 
pad to snowboard and what I'm going to
use<00:04:18.090> here<00:04:18.570> is<00:04:18.750> some<00:04:19.049> double-sided<00:04:19.620> tape<00:04:19.799> by<00:04:20.280> 3m

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
use here is some double-sided tape by 3m

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.740 
use here is some double-sided tape by 3m
it's<00:04:21.690> outdoor<00:04:22.350> mounting<00:04:23.010> tape<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:24.090> reason<00:04:24.630> I

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
it's outdoor mounting tape the reason I

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.690 
it's outdoor mounting tape the reason I
went<00:04:25.020> with<00:04:25.230> it<00:04:25.260> was<00:04:25.740> really<00:04:26.190> because<00:04:26.310> they

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
went with it was really because they

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.250 
went with it was really because they
showed<00:04:27.110> using<00:04:28.110> this<00:04:28.260> tape<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.950> Mount<00:04:30.260> Street

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
showed using this tape to Mount Street

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.320 
showed using this tape to Mount Street
numbers<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.890> houses<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:32.850> could<00:04:33.000> use<00:04:33.180> it

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
numbers to houses and you could use it

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.870 
numbers to houses and you could use it
on<00:04:33.450> brick<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.170> in<00:04:34.260> all<00:04:34.440> sorts<00:04:34.650> of<00:04:34.860> weather<00:04:35.100> and

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
on brick and in all sorts of weather and

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.640 
on brick and in all sorts of weather and
it<00:04:36.000> gives<00:04:36.210> us<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.570> option<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:37.200> it<00:04:37.440> being

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
it gives us the option of it being

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.800 
it gives us the option of it being
flexible<00:04:38.400> which<00:04:39.030> we<00:04:39.240> want<00:04:39.510> because<00:04:39.660> the

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
flexible which we want because the

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.740 
flexible which we want because the
snowboard<00:04:40.230> flexes<00:04:40.860> but<00:04:41.550> also<00:04:41.820> sticky<00:04:42.600> or

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
snowboard flexes but also sticky or

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.630 
snowboard flexes but also sticky or
tacky<00:04:42.780> enough<00:04:43.470> that<00:04:43.830> this<00:04:43.980> would<00:04:44.160> never<00:04:44.400> come

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
tacky enough that this would never come

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.250 
tacky enough that this would never come
off<00:04:44.820> so<00:04:45.360> you'll<00:04:45.510> see<00:04:45.690> we're<00:04:45.900> just<00:04:45.930> kind<00:04:46.230> of

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
off so you'll see we're just kind of

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260 
off so you'll see we're just kind of
picking<00:04:46.650> out<00:04:47.400> different<00:04:47.760> chunks<00:04:48.030> and

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
picking out different chunks and

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.450 
picking out different chunks and
adhering<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:49.080> that<00:04:49.230> stomp<00:04:49.590> pad<00:04:49.890> it's

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
adhering it to that stomp pad it's

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.280 
adhering it to that stomp pad it's
double-sided<00:04:50.910> tape<00:04:51.450> so<00:04:51.690> we're<00:04:51.840> leaving<00:04:52.140> one

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
double-sided tape so we're leaving one

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.980 
double-sided tape so we're leaving one
of<00:04:52.320> those<00:04:52.470> sides<00:04:52.740> on<00:04:53.060> there's<00:04:54.060> that<00:04:54.300> stomp<00:04:54.660> pad
