00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
actually um and then here that we

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.680 
actually um and then here that we
decided<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.340> bunk<00:01:47.550> them<00:01:47.759> instead<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.390> having

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
decided to bunk them instead of having

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.440 
decided to bunk them instead of having
to<00:01:49.020> lofted<00:01:49.500> because<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:50.610> thought<00:01:50.789> that<00:01:51.060> it

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
to lofted because we thought that it

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
could have storage underneath so that

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.100 
could have storage underneath so that
again<00:01:58.739> gives<00:01:59.520> us<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> lot<00:01:59.849> more<00:01:59.880> space<00:02:00.209> so<00:02:00.869> yeah
