you doing this world tour and just being

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.419 
you doing this world tour and just being
around<00:00:10.050> with<00:00:10.380> all<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:10.710> press<00:00:10.980> over<00:00:11.250> here

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
around with all this press over here

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.980 
around with all this press over here
what<00:00:11.940> moment<00:00:12.330> stood<00:00:12.450> out<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.929> most<00:00:13.670> I

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
what moment stood out to you the most I

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.960 
what moment stood out to you the most I
would<00:00:15.990> probably<00:00:16.170> say<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.980> Macau<00:00:17.340> meaning<00:00:17.789> me

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
would probably say in Macau meaning me

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.279 
would probably say in Macau meaning me
for<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.240> first<00:00:18.330> time<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.750> think<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.170> was

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
for the first time I think that was

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.590 
for the first time I think that was
probably<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.970> most<00:00:20.970> important<00:00:21.330> moment<00:00:21.570> of

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
probably the most important moment of

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.120 
probably the most important moment of
this<00:00:21.720> whole<00:00:21.840> trip<00:00:22.080> looking<00:00:22.500> look<00:00:22.830> at<00:00:22.920> him<00:00:23.039> in

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
this whole trip looking look at him in

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.340 
this whole trip looking look at him in
his<00:00:23.250> eye<00:00:23.369> as<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.640> man<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.720> not<00:00:25.080> seeing

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
his eye as a man and and and not seeing

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.290 
his eye as a man and and and not seeing
him<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.560> TV<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.039> seeing<00:00:26.189> him<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.430> person<00:00:26.550> I

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
him on TV and seeing him in person I

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.849 
him on TV and seeing him in person I
think<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.840> was<00:00:27.930> really<00:00:28.050> important<00:00:28.590> for<00:00:28.650> me

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
think that was really important for me

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.130 
think that was really important for me
in<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.880> my<00:00:30.150> mental<00:00:30.480> preparations<00:00:30.900> for<00:00:31.019> this
