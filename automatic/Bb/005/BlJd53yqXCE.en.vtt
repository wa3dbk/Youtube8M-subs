machine right now it's very it's very
much<00:03:06.000> prototype<00:03:09.920> basically<00:03:10.920> when<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.160> do<00:03:11.220> that

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
much prototype basically when I do that

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.350 
much prototype basically when I do that
let<00:03:12.930> me<00:03:12.959> go<00:03:13.110> walk<00:03:13.500> down<00:03:13.739> here<00:03:14.209> hopefully<00:03:15.209> know

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
let me go walk down here hopefully know

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:24.520 
let me go walk down here hopefully know
this<00:03:15.600> shit<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:15.989> fucked<00:03:16.290> up<00:03:18.950> ok<00:03:19.950> Danny<00:03:20.910> replaces

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.720 

they<00:03:25.530> can<00:03:25.650> see<00:03:25.830> this<00:03:26.510> it'll<00:03:27.510> capture<00:03:28.730> little

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
they can see this it'll capture little

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.650 
they can see this it'll capture little
firstly<00:03:30.300> it'll<00:03:31.080> stop<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.590> from<00:03:32.209> it's<00:03:33.209> just<00:03:33.510> a

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
firstly it'll stop it from it's just a

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.199 
firstly it'll stop it from it's just a
memory<00:03:33.840> cell<00:03:34.170> it's<00:03:34.860> hard<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.190> explain<00:03:35.370> just

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
memory cell it's hard to explain just

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.620 
memory cell it's hard to explain just
when<00:03:36.360> I<00:03:36.390> do<00:03:36.510> this<00:03:36.780> I<00:03:36.989> need<00:03:37.020> to<00:03:37.230> go<00:03:37.320> reset<00:03:37.770> this

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
when I do this I need to go reset this

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.750 
when I do this I need to go reset this
so<00:03:39.630> I<00:03:40.050> go<00:03:40.440> over<00:03:40.470> here<00:03:41.360> disconnect<00:03:42.360> reconnect

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
so I go over here disconnect reconnect

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.259 
so I go over here disconnect reconnect
and<00:03:45.019> now<00:03:46.019> I<00:03:46.049> just<00:03:46.140> flicked<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.739> switch<00:03:46.790> and

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.690 

just<00:03:51.269> let<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.659> go<00:03:51.689> at<00:03:52.079> it<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.799> takes<00:03:53.069> a<00:03:53.250> really

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
just let it go at it it takes a really

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.380 
just let it go at it it takes a really
long<00:03:53.879> time<00:03:54.170> so<00:03:55.170> I'm<00:03:55.769> actually<00:03:56.040> going<00:03:56.390> just

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
long time so I'm actually going just

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.050 
long time so I'm actually going just
kind<00:03:57.569> of<00:03:57.599> look<00:03:57.840> down<00:03:58.019> here<00:03:58.319> you<00:03:58.579> can<00:03:59.579> see<00:03:59.760> right

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
kind of look down here you can see right

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.420 
kind of look down here you can see right
up<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.810> inverter<00:04:01.230> with<00:04:01.409> tons<00:04:01.709> of<00:04:01.799> repeaters<00:04:02.129> at

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
up to inverter with tons of repeaters at

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.039 
up to inverter with tons of repeaters at
a<00:04:02.459> huge<00:04:02.879> delay<00:04:03.090> go<00:04:04.019> into<00:04:04.319> this<00:04:04.440> redstone<00:04:05.959> so<00:04:06.959> it

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
a huge delay go into this redstone so it

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.500 
a huge delay go into this redstone so it
looks<00:04:07.110> like<00:04:07.290> this<00:04:07.590> one<00:04:07.769> one<00:04:07.980> first<00:04:09.620> looks<00:04:10.620> like

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
looks like this one one first looks like

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.289 
looks like this one one first looks like
am<00:04:12.510> i<00:04:12.690> right<00:04:12.959> yes<00:04:13.349> it<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:13.980> it'll<00:04:14.849> change

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
am i right yes it is and it'll change

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.000 
am i right yes it is and it'll change
for<00:04:15.569> whatever<00:04:15.840> you<00:04:15.959> do<00:04:16.169> so<00:04:16.590> whenever<00:04:16.769> I<00:04:16.949> turn

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
for whatever you do so whenever I turn

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.409 
for whatever you do so whenever I turn
that<00:04:17.310> on<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.519> let's<00:04:17.850> just<00:04:17.880> automatically

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
that on and let's just automatically

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.039 
that on and let's just automatically
switch<00:04:18.780> just<00:04:19.260> showing<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:20.190> did<00:04:20.459> get<00:04:20.639> that<00:04:20.789> one

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
switch just showing you did get that one

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.400 
switch just showing you did get that one
and<00:04:22.049> so<00:04:22.860> now<00:04:23.070> you<00:04:23.610> turn<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.210> reset<00:04:24.660> it<00:04:24.690> I'm

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
and so now you turn and reset it I'm

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.689 
and so now you turn and reset it I'm
going<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.740> have<00:04:25.830> a<00:04:25.889> reset<00:04:26.220> button<00:04:26.250> for<00:04:26.490> that

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
going to have a reset button for that

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.090 
going to have a reset button for that
but<00:04:26.970> this<00:04:27.479> is<00:04:27.690> my<00:04:27.840> roulette<00:04:28.199> machine<00:04:28.650> I'm

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
but this is my roulette machine I'm

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.890 
but this is my roulette machine I'm
probably<00:04:29.370> gonna<00:04:29.550> do<00:04:29.699> the<00:04:29.850> big<00:04:30.210> step<00:04:30.539> one<00:04:30.750> which

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
probably gonna do the big step one which

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.860 
probably gonna do the big step one which
he<00:04:31.139> saw<00:04:31.530> time<00:04:32.490> I<00:04:32.639> pan<00:04:32.910> I'll<00:04:33.270> probably<00:04:33.570> put<00:04:33.810> the

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
he saw time I pan I'll probably put the

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.140 
he saw time I pan I'll probably put the
annotation<00:04:34.590> somewhere<00:04:34.889> in<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.280> corner<00:04:35.729> top

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
annotation somewhere in the corner top

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.629 
annotation somewhere in the corner top
right<00:04:36.470> you<00:04:37.470> should<00:04:37.680> check<00:04:37.710> it<00:04:37.919> out<00:04:38.160> it's<00:04:38.550> a

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
right you should check it out it's a

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.900 
right you should check it out it's a
definitely<00:04:39.570> different<00:04:39.660> idea<00:04:40.440> for<00:04:40.650> mine<00:04:40.910> she'd

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
definitely different idea for mine she'd

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.570 
definitely different idea for mine she'd
have<00:04:42.060> like<00:04:42.270> 12<00:04:42.930> that's<00:04:43.770> that's<00:04:44.220> how<00:04:44.370> mine

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
have like 12 that's that's how mine

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.090 
have like 12 that's that's how mine
would<00:04:44.699> be<00:04:44.789> set<00:04:45.000> up<00:04:45.120> his<00:04:45.300> is<00:04:45.479> like<00:04:45.510> a<00:04:45.720> track<00:04:46.169> you

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
would be set up his is like a track you

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.800 
would be set up his is like a track you
got<00:04:47.280> my<00:04:47.550> card<00:04:47.789> going<00:04:48.090> around<00:04:48.360> it<00:04:48.570> you<00:04:48.660> got

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
got my card going around it you got

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.320 
got my card going around it you got
trying<00:04:49.169> to<00:04:49.260> stop<00:04:49.500> it<00:04:49.530> on<00:04:49.919> these<00:04:50.820> signs<00:04:51.120> that

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
trying to stop it on these signs that

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.689 
trying to stop it on these signs that
say<00:04:51.510> diamond<00:04:52.020> dirt<00:04:52.349> one<00:04:52.650> not<00:04:52.860> very
