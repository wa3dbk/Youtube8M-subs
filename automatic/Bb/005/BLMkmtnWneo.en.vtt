 Apply the concealer on the whole face then press it to fix it better 

00:00:17.182 --> 00:00:20.521
 Light skin will help highlight more shadows with vivid color 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.859
 Press the powder with the puff or apply with some pinch 

00:00:35.372 --> 00:00:38.296
 Begin to apply the black shadow on the outer corner of the eyes 

00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:40.770
 Esuming to the center of the eyes 

00:00:43.628 --> 00:00:47.606
 Then it blurs to the outside creating a well-smudged eye 

00:00:55.158 --> 00:00:58.135
 Press the shadow but do not blend too much 

00:00:58.154 --> 00:01:00.708
 To preserve the most intense color 

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.665
 Use the white eye shadow over the eyeball 

00:01:07.665 --> 00:01:09.554
 And lightly blend the color with your finger 

00:01:12.956 --> 00:01:15.983
 Apply the gel eyeliner on the upper eyelid 

00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:25.356
 Fill the line from inside the eyes with the same eyeliner 

00:01:28.764 --> 00:01:32.081
 Take the black shadow back 

00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:36.791
 And wipe the eyeliner line at the top 

00:01:40.848 --> 00:01:43.738
 Just as below the bottom line 

00:01:47.026 --> 00:01:51.035
 Take back the red shadow 

00:01:51.035 --> 00:01:54.063
 First remove excess paint 

00:01:54.063 --> 00:01:56.202
 Then apply over black 

00:01:56.202 --> 00:01:59.256
 At the bottom also 

00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:02.085
 Merging with the black shadow 

00:02:04.216 --> 00:02:08.475
 Take the curvex and feel the power through your hands 

00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:11.525
 Curl upper lashes 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.372
 Cut the false eyelashes halfway 

00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:20.839
 And glue at the end of the upper lashes 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:22.843
 To make your eyes look more beautiful 

00:02:27.354 --> 00:02:30.334
 Carefully apply to upper eyelashes 

00:02:32.978 --> 00:02:35.015
 In the lower ones too 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.101
 Take the black shadow back 

00:02:41.168 --> 00:02:44.080
 Apply it to the top of your eyebrow 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.464
 Then pick a clean brush and start shading the sides of the nose 

00:02:56.982 --> 00:03:00.958
 Take the red shadow again 

00:03:01.161 --> 00:03:04.248
 Press the color in the center of the black color 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.792
 Shading according to the shape of the eyebrow 

00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:10.989
 And according to the black color on the sides of the nose 

00:03:15.968 --> 00:03:18.542
 This is the result of eye makeup and eyebrow 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:22.843
 Take back the gel eyeliner 

00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:26.702
 And start drawing a parasol just above the make of the eyebrow 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.930
 The scheme would be not to invade the area of ​​the eye and eyebrow make 

00:03:36.988 --> 00:03:39.728
 Apply the color by the corners and smear towards the center 

00:03:39.728 --> 00:03:41.781
 Because it is a parasol 

00:03:41.781 --> 00:03:45.235
 The color will be applied in 1 division and in the other not until it reaches the end 

00:03:51.992 --> 00:03:55.516
 Fill the rest of the rooms with the color white 

00:03:55.516 --> 00:04:01.889
 Now start adding small details by lighting the hood 

00:04:20.665 --> 00:04:23.804
 Take the black shadow one more time 

00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:27.084
 And start shading the sunshade 

00:04:31.226 --> 00:04:34.492
 Beauty, now is the last time I will wear this black shadow. 

00:04:34.492 --> 00:04:38.407
 Fill the corners of the mouth 

00:04:38.407 --> 00:04:42.275
 Pick up the red make again and the white aqua color 

00:04:42.275 --> 00:04:45.909
 Draw some triangles with red, according to the shape of your mouth 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.542
 Now with white fill in the remaining spaces 

00:04:54.285 --> 00:04:57.451
 Apply the gloss on the sides towards red 

00:04:58.526 --> 00:05:01.445
 Using the clean brush, apply on the red triangles now 

00:05:01.445 --> 00:05:05.078
 If you have a translucent gloss you can apply also on the white color 

00:05:07.623 --> 00:05:10.537
 Last red shade 

00:05:10.818 --> 00:05:14.112
 Add a little on the cheekbones 

00:05:15.361 --> 00:05:18.120
 Then fading to the sides of the face 

00:05:24.766 --> 00:05:26.453
 This is the only parasol 

00:05:26.453 --> 00:05:29.289
 Which I would not recommend for a good beach 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.052
 Anything forget the consequences, the sun awaits us 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.401
 Parasol Kisa says: Sign up for the manipulation or wait until the light manipulates you
