00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.730 
those things too that I useful for the
games<00:02:10.800> which<00:02:11.250> for<00:02:12.209> example<00:02:12.500> driving

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740

the screen size which will supposedly be
used<00:03:01.500> as<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:01.920> galaxy<00:03:02.430> s4<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.480> screen<00:03:03.780> size

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
used as a galaxy s4 is the screen size

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.350 
used as a galaxy s4 is the screen size
of<00:03:04.380> 5<00:03:05.130> inches<00:03:05.910> which<00:03:06.150> is<00:03:06.620> 0.2<00:03:07.620> inches<00:03:08.360> bigger

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
of 5 inches which is 0.2 inches bigger

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.910 
of 5 inches which is 0.2 inches bigger
than<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:11.750> samsung<00:03:12.750> s3<00:03:13.530> um<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:15.590> don't<00:03:16.590> really

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
than the samsung s3 um I don't really

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.860 
than the samsung s3 um I don't really
know<00:03:17.310> why<00:03:17.550> they<00:03:17.790> would<00:03:18.000> do<00:03:18.210> this<00:03:18.420> because<00:03:18.660> I

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
know why they would do this because I

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.520 
know why they would do this because I
mean<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.800> is<00:03:20.070> already<00:03:20.940> big<00:03:21.330> enough<00:03:21.360> for<00:03:21.930> by<00:03:22.140> 8

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
mean it is already big enough for by 8

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.090 
mean it is already big enough for by 8
inches<00:03:22.980> bat<00:03:23.700> well<00:03:23.970> you'll<00:03:24.810> see<00:03:25.080> I<00:03:25.110> mean<00:03:25.410> five

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
inches bat well you'll see I mean five

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.480 
inches bat well you'll see I mean five
inches<00:03:26.460> for<00:03:26.820> me<00:03:27.000> it's<00:03:27.300> already<00:03:27.830> like<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:28.890> table

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
inches for me it's already like a table

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:38.830 
inches for me it's already like a table
so<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.750> would<00:03:31.650> buy<00:03:32.220> them<00:03:35.270> galaxy<00:03:36.270> note<00:03:36.450> instead

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
so I would buy them galaxy note instead

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.800 
so I would buy them galaxy note instead
the<00:03:39.840> galaxy<00:03:40.380> s3<00:03:41.060> was<00:03:42.530> 133<00:03:43.530> grams<00:03:43.740> of

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
the galaxy s3 was 133 grams of

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.270 
the galaxy s3 was 133 grams of
overweight<00:03:45.810> so<00:03:46.590> um<00:03:48.140> Samsung<00:03:49.140> has<00:03:49.350> tried<00:03:49.830> to

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
overweight so um Samsung has tried to

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.730 
overweight so um Samsung has tried to
lower<00:03:50.550> them<00:03:50.910> down<00:03:51.120> for<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.870> galaxy<00:03:52.290> s4

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
lower them down for the galaxy s4

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.530 
lower them down for the galaxy s4
because<00:03:53.580> they<00:03:54.000> considered<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:55.050> to<00:03:55.290> be<00:03:55.440> very

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
because they considered that to be very

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.920 
because they considered that to be very
actually<00:03:57.540> heavy<00:03:58.110> it<00:03:58.800> will<00:03:59.160> have<00:03:59.510> probably<00:04:00.510> 2

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
actually heavy it will have probably 2

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.150 
actually heavy it will have probably 2
gigabytes<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.620> RAM<00:04:02.960> and<00:04:04.910> about<00:04:05.910> I<00:04:06.860> will<00:04:07.860> think

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
gigabytes of RAM and about I will think

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.850 
gigabytes of RAM and about I will think
that<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.730> will<00:04:09.030> come<00:04:09.330> with<00:04:09.570> 64<00:04:10.230> gigabytes<00:04:10.709> of

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
that it will come with 64 gigabytes of

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.640 
that it will come with 64 gigabytes of
memory<00:04:11.330> already<00:04:12.330> installed<00:04:12.840> inside<00:04:13.230> with<00:04:13.470> not

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
memory already installed inside with not

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.070 
memory already installed inside with not
expandable<00:04:14.250> um<00:04:16.040> things<00:04:17.040> um<00:04:18.000> there<00:04:18.720> is<00:04:18.840> also

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
expandable um things um there is also

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:25.750 
expandable um things um there is also
some<00:04:19.980> people<00:04:20.430> who<00:04:20.580> think<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:21.919> it<00:04:22.919> may<00:04:23.479> be<00:04:24.590> in

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
some people who think that it may be in

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.140 
some people who think that it may be in
have<00:04:26.060> a<00:04:26.360> memory<00:04:26.990> of<00:04:27.730> 128<00:04:28.730> gigabytes<00:04:29.740> but<00:04:30.740> I

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
have a memory of 128 gigabytes but I

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.440 
have a memory of 128 gigabytes but I
don't<00:04:32.150> think<00:04:32.390> that<00:04:32.600> will<00:04:33.230> be<00:04:33.290> so<00:04:34.250> it<00:04:35.210> would

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
don't think that will be so it would

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.500 
don't think that will be so it would
obviously<00:04:35.740> caribou<00:04:36.740> tooth<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:37.930> 4G<00:04:38.930> LTE<00:04:39.370> and

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
obviously caribou tooth and 4G LTE and

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.820 
obviously caribou tooth and 4G LTE and
when<00:04:41.510> you<00:04:41.630> see<00:04:41.810> if<00:04:42.020> they<00:04:42.170> can<00:04:42.350> improve<00:04:42.440> the

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
when you see if they can improve the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.190 
when you see if they can improve the
camera<00:04:43.190> because<00:04:43.730> I<00:04:43.880> mean<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.240> gig<00:04:44.540> a<00:04:44.810> mega

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
camera because I mean a gig a mega

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.980 
camera because I mean a gig a mega
pixels<00:04:45.650> is<00:04:45.830> already<00:04:46.520> a<00:04:46.730> really<00:04:47.480> really<00:04:47.690> good

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
pixels is already a really really good

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.280 
pixels is already a really really good
camera<00:04:48.440> but<00:04:49.400> we'll<00:04:49.640> see<00:04:49.910> about<00:04:50.060> that<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:51.050> will

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
camera but we'll see about that it will

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.420 
camera but we'll see about that it will
obviously<00:04:51.560> be<00:04:51.980> is<00:04:52.250> running<00:04:53.200> 4.1<00:04:54.430> Android
