I feel how much sleep I got the night
before<00:01:31.140> etc<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.970> really<00:01:33.360> do<00:01:33.540> feel<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.200> we

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
before etc and I really do feel that we

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.219

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.170 
four last night
so<00:01:38.820> that's<00:01:39.780> not<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.770> usual<00:01:41.310> thing<00:01:41.340> for<00:01:41.880> me<00:01:42.030> I'm

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
so that's not a usual thing for me I'm

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
much a seven hours girl but I really do

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.109 
much a seven hours girl but I really do
feel<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.040> need<00:01:47.220> eight<00:01:47.490> hours<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.820> sleep
