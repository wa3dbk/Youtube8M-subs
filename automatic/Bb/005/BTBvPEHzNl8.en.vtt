00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 the biologist flávio augusto pereira this 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.049
 professor at the university of são paulo 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.590
 studying paranormal phenomena and 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.030
 ufology for more than 40 years for 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.920
 night and good night 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.650
 Look how we can be sure 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.470
 that these phenomena happen because 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.990
 many people can say that they see UFOs more 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.420
 in fact it can be an imagination and even 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.230
 those of a lie like you already told 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:32.160
 here before the fact to start program is 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.070
 science is based on the study of 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.870
 phenomena in peaks after 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.410
 scientist will elaborate an explanation 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.960
 hypothesis a shocking theory or not 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.350
 this will depend on the aspect there is over 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.860
 50 years that the ruffles the disks the young 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.969
 frequent our biosphere and the occasion of 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.760
 peace or that the war is then natural 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.010
 always come up because it messes with the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.440
 collective unconscious is not a joke 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.520
 you admit that there are beings here 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.780
 extraterrestrials 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.439
 the extradimensional ones visiting us who 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.689
 knows if we are being policed ​​and maybe do the 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.030
 scientific experiment now you said 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.650
 the time of peace in times of war 50 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.229
 years ago it was the second world war 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.430
 So I usually say whenever the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.040
 ufology started militarized because 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.540
 when you think you know more, you see 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.520
 movies in the second war and a 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.479
 to bomb England was one of 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.990
 house followed by 345 up to 15 balls 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.680
 light that followed the moods and the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.770
 gunners who were in the cause of these 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.270
 airplanes or with the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.880
 now in barça happened 14 curious 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.750
 both assign the enemy the possession of a 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.810
 secret weapon so my name is a 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.719
 commission and a shorts too then this 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.100
 It's not a joke because pilots of 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.340
 warplane 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.920
 are highly differentiated people there 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.349
 now is the core has appointed a commission 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.330
 now in brazil also had a commission 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.300
 that began in 58 that you 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.460
 even God was president of this 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.830
 committee because this commission was 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.980
 established in 58 here in Brazil because 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.710
 during 57 which was the year of the opening of 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.100
 our space age with the two powers 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:33.300
 bone the Russians the soviets of october 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.900
 November was simultaneously more than 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.930
 20 cases in Brazil two airplanes 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.090
 freighters from a large company 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.400
 were followed by discs 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.410
 almost there was a fire on board 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.130
 one of them the hotel monitor in rio grande 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.290
 southern 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.570
 my case of the explosion of a disc in 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.360
 What are these fragments? 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.020
 here exactly with cnet the shift 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.590
 pure magnesium is something impossible 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.900
 there are now more than 57 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.260
 now this book here also clashes 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.600
 by jacques wagner also talks about a 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.820
 appearance of flying saucers 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.760
 I would have written even 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.459
 explosions as well and that it would be an 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.390
 would be in the bay of the sun one of the islands of 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.280
 Belem do Para 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.190
 his knowledge also in this case so this 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.930
 The case you are referring to is much more 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.570
 recent is 84 88 the Brazilian northeast 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.489
 was object northeast spreading north 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.030
 up to stop was the object of a 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.090
 violent 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.830
 the zoom fuzhou by the young and at least 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.500
 I have news of ten deaths that 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.440
 it's not a confrontation like that 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:53.330
 indirect consequences of a machine 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.650
 of an apparatus whose components 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.700
 technological know-how and never again 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:02.040
 this book here that I'm going to show now 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.570
 shows that they also think the body only 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.209
 Could you explain it here? 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.330
 This is kind of you do not have censorship that 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:13.769
 no none is an envy program is of 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.650
 that if the case the conch this boy who 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.530
 you saw to the right he is he passed away 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.200
 it's only a short time ago 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.310
 and I was not a farmer 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.930
 general if this happened and 57 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.840
 that year in which he blew the record in 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.810
 Batuba he was taken after several 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.150
 days when a red object at night 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.220
 I ran his farm and own a 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.710
 farm his brother other people 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.110
 they also saw one more night he 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.720
 was taken aboard the disc and there 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.070
 sexual relations with an alien who 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.890
 seems a human who probably 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:54.890
 must have been a pre 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:58.040
 because he has relationships now that 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:01.310
 she at the end pointed to the reform of 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:04.790
 detail you find it all 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:09.940
 this is alien pointed to the belly 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.940
 abdomen and did so 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.990
 if this happens the same and everything indicates 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:19.970
 which shows the intelligence of the sabinas 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.160
 not only the fact of building a machine 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.470
 like the one that arrives here nobody knows 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.860
 where can be of others your comments 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.600
 when you gave in two dimensions you know but it's the 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.970
 What is the strangest thing about it is 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.560
 physical similarity because it is 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.030
 She looks like a woman on the land 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.280
 division as it is 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.530
 although this was done here on the basis of 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.490
 reconstitution by a friend painter 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.039
 English 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.720
 in the reconstitution we have now we go 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:47.270
 elaborate a little on top of this gesture 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.940
 her to point at the belly is as if 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.919
 I already received it as if she 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.950
 had even suggesting it could 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.090
 being pregnant we will certainly have 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.260
 surely it may have been really 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.840
 goal 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.810
 this may make it clear that we 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.570
 we can see a race of means 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.100
 Looks like this is animism. 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.240
 that you can say that young people want 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.100
 do here and this is perfectly 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.289
 possible because we are doing 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:16.100
 now in laboratories blends of 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:17.720
 plant genera with more're people 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.970
 full of experience out there 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:24.620
 so it is not extraordinary that our 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:26.810
 dna can be combined with a dna 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.249
 strange this is perfectly possible 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.769
 but you can only speak that now 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:35.399
 because ten years ago would be very 

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:38.789
 difficult to defend a theory in which 

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:41.309
 there was a combination of 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:42.959
 different that's what today is the face of 

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:45.209
 Asshole, shall we not? 

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:47.789
 we will have mutants here on earth can be 

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:51.319
 It can be can say thank you for the 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:51.319
 your presence in an interview here in our
