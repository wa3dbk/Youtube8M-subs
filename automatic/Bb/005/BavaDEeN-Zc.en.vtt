simple as just guiding my follow after
the<00:01:34.350> rock<00:01:34.500> step<00:01:34.830> triple<00:01:35.360> step<00:01:36.440> triple<00:01:37.440> step<00:01:38.010> I

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the rock step triple step triple step I

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.840 
the rock step triple step triple step I
float<00:01:39.330> away<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.990> then<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.650> stay<00:01:41.010> here<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.549> open

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
float away and then I stay here in open

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.820 
float away and then I stay here in open
position<00:01:42.000> until<00:01:42.780> something<00:01:43.080> else<00:01:43.200> happens

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
position until something else happens

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.830 
position until something else happens
so<00:01:44.310> we're<00:01:44.520> doing<00:01:44.610> our<00:01:44.820> basic<00:01:44.970> step<00:01:45.420> now<00:01:45.659> in

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
so we're doing our basic step now in

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.690 
so we're doing our basic step now in
open<00:01:46.140> position<00:01:46.290> facing<00:01:47.070> each<00:01:47.250> other

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
open position facing each other

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.810 
open position facing each other
that's<00:01:47.970> step<00:01:48.150> triple<00:01:48.659> step<00:01:48.869> Rock<00:01:49.530> step<00:01:49.830> true

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
that's step triple step Rock step true

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.160 
that's step triple step Rock step true
square<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:51.689> either<00:01:51.990> wanted<00:01:52.470> to
