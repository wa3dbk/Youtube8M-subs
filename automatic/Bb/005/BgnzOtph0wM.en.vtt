00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.669
 the theme of this week 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.449
 we have divided it into two parts 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.169
 happiness that matter set 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.170

 we will talk about the current general condition 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.800
 of the automotive industry 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.920
 but we will focus on the so-called big three of america 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:42.240
 What are they 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.940

 we urge the paper and to do 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.760
 in the second part 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.770
 It's a lie the next week 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.010
 we will focus on the industry as an engine of growth in the United States 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:57.430
 and of course mexico 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.430
 as well as in the situation the Argentine work 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.360
 the most important news of this week 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.760
 it's bankruptcy to the Swedish company 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.120
 subsidiary villena 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.670
 today Friday 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.500
 20 of 2009 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.000
 and the possible bankruptcy of others more 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.150
 between them 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.930
 the Korean also charge its subsidiaries who 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.930
 and maybe 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.300
 General Motors plans to report 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.100
 more than 47 thousand jobs worldwide 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.479
 twenty one thousand of these in the united states and the 26 thousand remaining in the 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.510
 rest of the world mainly from europe and canada 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.210
 is suspended indefinitely 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.359
 Plant expansion in Thailand the day 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.870
 sump 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.360
 point of going bankrupt 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.770
 be liquidated 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.020
 and mouths awarding skills 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.150
 this quintín company with a concert of the diva 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.660
 so yes 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.030
 and basically 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.960
 decided he needs a corporate member 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.560
 it seems that this time it will disappear 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.700
 it means 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.440
 already signed in this company has indicated that it will not invest more money 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.799
 in capital 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.199
 to this company 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:17.019
 until it is viable 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.300
 and has tied 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.300
 the loans to the United States government 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:25.559
 is the company is in better position than the three 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:28.559
 the lighter those vehicles has increased considerably 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:31.789
 in the last five or six years 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:37.409
 and according to analysts and consumer reports its quality suffers from toyota 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:38.469
 the problem 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.079
 apart from its bad image 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.109
 United States 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:44.709
 that like who the bikes 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.369
 have structural problems 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:50.289
 combined American manufacturers 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:52.229
 They have 15 watermarks 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:53.339
 in United States 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.529
 General Motors has thought 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:57.120
 get rid of three 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.539
 from that age 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:00.799
 and these are encouraged to do 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.349
 and pontiac that will be an operation 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.709
 more and smaller 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.799
 maybe come here 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.900
 and it was borja have the binner dust marks 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:14.999
 the sales of light cars 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:17.999
 of the three companies Andrei bello 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:21.689
 at least 55 percent less this genre 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:23.289
 have passed 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:24.100
 who 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.769
 49 percent less infor 40 percent 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.059
 the decline in sales as well 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:32.469
 that what many analysts expect 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:33.519
 in general 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.819
 the fall in sales 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.579
 is due to lower fleet sales to car rental companies due to 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.139
 the global financial crisis the difficulty of obtaining credits for 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.539
 finance the purchase 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.859
 by private consumers 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.859
 and the lack of new leases 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:52.900
 the chop style pickups 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.629
 they have not done well either because of the decline in industrial construction and 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:58.589
 sculpture 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:01.589
 in total the decline in car sales 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:03.699
 20 7% 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.250
 sales that are at the lowest level 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.129
 since 1981 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.749
 and it's the first time that sales 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:12.579
 on cristina Monday 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.789
 annualized sales nero have been just under 10 million units 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.090
 when analysts expected sales of 17 million 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.849
 in the past year 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.710
 as part of the fiscal stimulus in the united states the american senate 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.300
 vote to include publicity the federal tax 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.490
 for interest paid that the purchase of a vehicle this year 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.590
 more or less a rare person 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.740
 thousand 553 dollars 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.420
 in the purchase of a vehicle 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.460
 of 29 thousand dollars 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.539
 and has informed its distributors 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.570
 that this year only parents will sell 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.340
 fat one million vehicles 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.040
 but the worrying thing is 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.740
 which has eleven floors 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.830
 in United States 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.610
 with the ability to produce 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.610
 2 points 2 million units 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.930
 as part of your viability plan 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.300
 will be the plants in North America 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.300
 and enter the alliance with Italian assembler 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.789
 for the fourth date is to speak to the components of light vehicles 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.259
 will focus aníbal astican 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.639
 yes general motors 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.009
 need at least five billion dollars more 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.009
 to continue operating this first quarter 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.700
 if you can not get help from the federal government you could fall into bankruptcy this 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:32.360
 year 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.389
 due to lack of liquidity 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:35.900
 as conclusions 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.680
 we can say 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.360
 that the general motors company and of course 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.280
 sheridan 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.330
 will weaken 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.419
 and maybe jaeger go bankrupt this year 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.830
 hor 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.180
 it will be strengthened 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.340
 and get their domestic competitors started in the market segment 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.159
 especially 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:59.110
 in the pirate sector 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.210
 when we already visit the trend that the last four months 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:08.070
 will generate higher unemployment auto industry all over the world however 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.629
 brazil russia 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:12.129
 and here in China especially 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:16.249
 the automotive producers that will continue to grow in part 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:19.559
 because they are engines of economic growth in the coming years 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:21.469
 and finally 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:23.030
 the production of cars 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.080
 will be increasingly fragile 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.040
 This can 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.279
 is potentially benefited mexico 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:31.479
 that has a lot of free trade agreements 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:33.270
 in total more than 40 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.979
