the<00:00:23.220> water<00:00:23.460> was<00:00:23.670> completely<00:00:24.300> calm<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.960> was

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
the water was completely calm it was

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.630 
the water was completely calm it was
calm<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.590> second<00:00:25.859> ago<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.070> heard<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.460> right

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
calm the second ago you heard it right

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.670 
calm the second ago you heard it right
look<00:00:26.880> at<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:31.130> and<00:00:32.130> then<00:00:32.969> out<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.120> nowhere

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
look at this and then out of nowhere

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.920 
look at this and then out of nowhere
reverse<00:00:34.680> waves<00:00:35.010> started<00:00:35.460> happening<00:00:35.780> like<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
reverse waves started happening like the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.330 
reverse waves started happening like the
Loch<00:00:37.110> Ness<00:00:37.140> monster<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.890> going<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.100> come<00:00:38.219> out

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
Loch Ness monster is going to come out

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.200 
Loch Ness monster is going to come out
of<00:00:38.399> there<00:00:38.610> or<00:00:38.700> something<00:00:41.420> Yuri<00:00:44.059> right<00:00:45.059> at

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
of there or something Yuri right at

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.240 
of there or something Yuri right at
sunset<00:00:45.450> well<00:00:46.260> yeah<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.950> were<00:00:47.070> riding

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
sunset well yeah and you were riding

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.090 
sunset well yeah and you were riding
your<00:00:47.430> bike<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.730> sunset

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:02.350 

that's<00:00:55.100> just<00:00:55.220> rippling<00:01:01.090> guess<00:01:02.090> it's<00:01:02.270> just

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
that's just rippling guess it's just

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.899 
that's just rippling guess it's just
waves<00:01:02.710> that<00:01:03.710> are<00:01:03.770> going<00:01:04.070> backwards<00:01:04.280> for<00:01:04.729> some

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
waves that are going backwards for some

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.730 
waves that are going backwards for some
reason<00:01:05.210> I<00:01:05.269> guess<00:01:05.420> I'll<00:01:05.540> just<00:01:05.570> accept<00:01:06.110> it<00:01:06.290> the

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
reason I guess I'll just accept it the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.740 
reason I guess I'll just accept it the
wind<00:01:06.950> reverses<00:01:07.490> during<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.210> day<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.540> night

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
wind reverses during the day and night

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.170 
wind reverses during the day and night
for<00:01:09.530> some<00:01:09.800> reason<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:10.490> I<00:01:10.640> mean<00:01:10.820> odd<00:01:11.000> that

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
for some reason and I mean odd that

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.170 
for some reason and I mean odd that
abruptly<00:01:11.780> ah<00:01:12.080> yes<00:01:12.770> when<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.250> Sun<00:01:13.460> sets<00:01:13.759> it's

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
abruptly ah yes when the Sun sets it's

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.900 
abruptly ah yes when the Sun sets it's
because<00:01:14.570> of<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:15.259> geographical<00:01:16.130> location<00:01:16.759> of

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
because of the geographical location of

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.120 
because of the geographical location of
New<00:01:17.090> Orleans<00:01:17.509> I<00:01:17.990> haven't<00:01:18.590> been<00:01:18.800> this

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
New Orleans I haven't been this

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.219 
New Orleans I haven't been this
impressed<00:01:19.400> with<00:01:19.910> you<00:01:20.150> since<00:01:20.390> you<00:01:20.600> explained

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
impressed with you since you explained

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.920 
impressed with you since you explained
that<00:01:22.009> Higgs<00:01:22.280> boson<00:01:22.670> particle<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:23.479> are<00:01:23.659> just

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
that Higgs boson particle you are just

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:49.470 
that Higgs boson particle you are just
amazing<00:01:38.590> we<00:01:39.590> run<00:01:39.890> in<00:01:40.009> circles

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.770 

so<00:01:50.200> we're<00:01:50.410> taking<00:01:50.590> pictures<00:01:51.190> and<00:01:51.400> video

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
so we're taking pictures and video

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.450 
so we're taking pictures and video
simultaneously<00:01:52.780> right<00:01:53.020> now<00:01:53.310> for<00:01:54.310> mean

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
simultaneously right now for mean

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.960 
simultaneously right now for mean
assessment<00:01:54.910> of<00:01:54.970> their<00:01:55.120> problem<00:01:56.670> these<00:01:57.670> birds

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
assessment of their problem these birds

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.000 
assessment of their problem these birds
are<00:01:58.360> so<00:01:58.720> giant<00:01:59.050> I<00:01:59.170> don't<00:01:59.320> have<00:01:59.410> a<00:01:59.440> zoom<00:01:59.680> right

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
are so giant I don't have a zoom right

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.370 
are so giant I don't have a zoom right
now<00:02:00.190> on<00:02:00.880> my<00:02:01.030> iPhone<00:02:01.450> but<00:02:01.600> there's<00:02:01.810> some<00:02:01.960> giant

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
now on my iPhone but there's some giant

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.710 
now on my iPhone but there's some giant

that bird is so China to you can't
really<00:02:13.300> tell<00:02:13.570> on<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:13.900> compared<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:15.040> that

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
really tell on this compared to that

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.670 
really tell on this compared to that
hawk<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> brave<00:02:16.750> pro<00:02:17.230> right<00:02:17.470> there

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
hawk that is a brave pro right there

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:31.140 
hawk that is a brave pro right there
that<00:02:17.950> Hawk<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:19.300> really<00:02:19.750> taking<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:30.150> now

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
that Hawk is really taking it now

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.970 
that Hawk is really taking it now
there's<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.600> second<00:02:32.140> one<00:02:32.170> over<00:02:32.530> here<00:02:32.770> we<00:02:32.860> got

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
there's a second one over here we got

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.440 
there's a second one over here we got
this<00:02:33.220> one<00:02:33.460> that's<00:02:33.640> when<00:02:33.850> I<00:02:33.880> was<00:02:34.060> just<00:02:34.180> going

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
which you know seems like it might not

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.930 
which you know seems like it might not
be<00:04:26.410> that<00:04:26.560> long<00:04:26.890> but<00:04:27.220> when<00:04:27.400> you're<00:04:27.520> biking<00:04:27.670> it

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940
