now<00:03:40.140> most<00:03:40.769> of<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:40.920> stories<00:03:41.130> are<00:03:41.220> very<00:03:41.430> short

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
now most of the stories are very short

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.759 
now most of the stories are very short
and<00:03:41.940> they<00:03:42.180> start<00:03:42.420> off<00:03:42.510> with<00:03:42.660> saying<00:03:42.840> I'm<00:03:43.380> dead

or<00:03:44.190> went<00:03:44.549> crazy<00:03:44.760> now<00:03:45.420> let's<00:03:45.720> find<00:03:45.959> out<00:03:46.230> why<00:03:46.290> and

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
or went crazy now let's find out why and

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.789 
or went crazy now let's find out why and
we<00:03:47.700> eventually<00:03:47.820> get<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.360> that<00:03:48.450> final

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
we eventually get to that final

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.300 
we eventually get to that final
culmination<00:03:49.799> but<00:03:50.040> his<00:03:50.160> short<00:03:50.400> stories<00:03:50.910> are

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
culmination but his short stories are

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.100 
culmination but his short stories are
predominantly<00:03:53.310> particularly<00:03:54.030> short<00:03:54.299> so

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
predominantly particularly short so

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.039 
predominantly particularly short so

sessions<00:04:03.420> now<00:04:04.350> again<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.580> fragility<00:04:05.880> there

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
sessions now again the fragility there

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.449 
sessions now again the fragility there
in<00:04:06.330> your<00:04:06.420> character<00:04:06.840> is<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:07.260> very<00:04:07.620> very<00:04:07.860> hot<00:04:08.040> is

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
in your character is a very very hot is

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.979 
in your character is a very very hot is
very<00:04:08.700> easy<00:04:08.790> for<00:04:08.940> your<00:04:09.150> character<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.510> doc<00:04:09.720> is

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
very easy for your character the doc is

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.479 
very easy for your character the doc is
very<00:04:10.380> easy<00:04:10.530> for<00:04:10.650> your<00:04:10.860> character<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.190> go<00:04:11.340> and

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
very easy for your character to go and

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.520 
very easy for your character to go and
say<00:04:11.640> without<00:04:11.790> ever<00:04:12.120> even<00:04:12.390> being<00:04:12.930> attacked<00:04:13.350> at

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
say without ever even being attacked at

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.770 
say without ever even being attacked at
all<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:13.950> that's<00:04:14.880> essentially<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.690> know

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
all and that's essentially you know

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.930 
all and that's essentially you know
again<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:16.350> removed<00:04:16.590> from<00:04:16.709> plight<00:04:16.979> sanity

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
again and removed from plight sanity

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.500 
again and removed from plight sanity
points<00:04:18.269> all<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.720> way<00:04:18.870> down<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:21.060> it's<00:04:21.329> that

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
points all the way down and it's that

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.659 
points all the way down and it's that
kind<00:04:21.810> of<00:04:21.930> time<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:22.950> at<00:04:23.070> that<00:04:23.099> kind<00:04:23.460> of<00:04:23.520> party

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
kind of time and at that kind of party

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.940 
kind of time and at that kind of party
so<00:04:24.000> those<00:04:24.990> are<00:04:25.169> very<00:04:25.260> important<00:04:25.680> things<00:04:25.830> to

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
so those are very important things to

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.780 
so those are very important things to
think<00:04:25.979> about<00:04:26.220> when<00:04:26.640> you<00:04:26.820> think<00:04:26.849> about

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
think about when you think about

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.640 
think about when you think about
agility<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.360> want<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:28.960> Ratchet<00:04:29.260> it<00:04:29.320> all<00:04:29.500> the

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
agility you want to Ratchet it all the

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.200 
agility you want to Ratchet it all the
way<00:04:29.770> up<00:04:29.950> where<00:04:30.370> you're<00:04:30.550> essentially<00:04:30.970> playing

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
way up where you're essentially playing

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.050 
way up where you're essentially playing
a<00:04:31.510> video<00:04:32.200> game<00:04:32.260> esque<00:04:32.710> tactics<00:04:33.400> and<00:04:33.700> you<00:04:33.910> could

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
a video game esque tactics and you could

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.210 
a video game esque tactics and you could
just<00:04:34.090> crushed<00:04:34.540> rosen<00:04:35.200> just<00:04:35.350> demolish<00:04:35.770> dispose

just crushed rosen just demolish dispose

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.130 
just crushed rosen just demolish dispose
of<00:04:36.250> anyone<00:04:36.730> you<00:04:36.850> can<00:04:37.060> this<00:04:37.570> sort<00:04:37.810> of<00:04:37.840> logic

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
of anyone you can this sort of logic

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.540 
of anyone you can this sort of logic
will<00:04:38.290> apply<00:04:38.500> in<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.710> video<00:04:38.890> game<00:04:38.950> you<00:04:39.430> will

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
will apply in the video game you will

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.480 
will apply in the video game you will
see<00:04:39.730> many<00:04:39.820> video<00:04:40.150> games<00:04:40.180> operate<00:04:40.900> under<00:04:41.200> this

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
see many video games operate under this

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.400 
see many video games operate under this
I<00:04:42.490> can't<00:04:43.300> think<00:04:43.390> of<00:04:43.510> any<00:04:43.690> movies<00:04:44.080> that

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
I can't think of any movies that

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.410 
I can't think of any movies that
characters<00:04:45.220> are<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.490> that<00:04:45.640> level<00:04:45.880> of<00:04:47.250> absolute

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
characters are to that level of absolute

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.220 
characters are to that level of absolute
ridiculousness<00:04:50.100> now<00:04:51.750> it's<00:04:52.750> important<00:04:53.170> to

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
ridiculousness now it's important to

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.320 
ridiculousness now it's important to
consider<00:04:53.950> that<00:04:54.190> when<00:04:54.880> you're<00:04:55.060> when<00:04:55.240> you're

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
consider that when you're when you're

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.820 
consider that when you're when you're
designing<00:04:55.510> what<00:04:56.170> sort<00:04:56.350> of<00:04:56.380> game<00:04:56.500> you<00:04:56.650> want<00:04:56.800> to

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
designing what sort of game you want to

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.790 
designing what sort of game you want to
really<00:04:57.040> find<00:04:57.670> out<00:04:58.000> what<00:04:58.660> you<00:04:58.810> like<00:04:58.840> onion<00:04:59.320> kid

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
a desire to have the characters put in

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.060 
a desire to have the characters put in
the<00:05:16.690> state<00:05:16.870> of<00:05:16.900> mind<00:05:17.140> and<00:05:17.290> oh<00:05:17.410> this<00:05:17.920> is

level that continues to escalate and for

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.150 
level that continues to escalate and for
me<00:05:32.920> that's<00:05:33.100> what<00:05:33.640> systems<00:05:34.120> need<00:05:34.330> to<00:05:34.360> do<00:05:34.600> is

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
me that's what systems need to do is

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.510 
me that's what systems need to do is
combine<00:05:36.540> to<00:05:37.540> produce<00:05:37.960> the<00:05:38.710> best<00:05:38.740> quality<00:05:39.100> of

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
combine to produce the best quality of

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.190 
combine to produce the best quality of
role<00:05:39.670> playing<00:05:39.880> the<00:05:40.030> best<00:05:40.240> immersive

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
role playing the best immersive

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.020 
role playing the best immersive
experience<00:05:41.830> that<00:05:42.130> you<00:05:42.250> can<00:05:42.370> have<00:05:42.550> at<00:05:42.790> your

table<00:05:43.450> that<00:05:44.140> is<00:05:44.700> for<00:05:45.700> my<00:05:45.820> estimation<00:05:46.300> really

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
table that is for my estimation really

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.110 
table that is for my estimation really
the<00:05:46.720> only<00:05:46.870> possible<00:05:47.620> thing<00:05:47.860> that<00:05:48.100> systems<00:05:48.940> can

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
the only possible thing that systems can

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.240 
the only possible thing that systems can
do<00:05:49.210> the<00:05:49.360> only<00:05:49.690> need<00:05:49.960> you<00:05:50.170> have<00:05:50.380> of<00:05:50.590> systems<00:05:51.040> is

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
do the only need you have of systems is

hit points I think when you logistically

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.290
