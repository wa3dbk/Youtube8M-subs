00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:16.699
 Hello everyone today we have a review of the cover 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:20.550
 smooth for samsung galaxy s4 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:24.269
 This case comes in branded packaging 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.000
 the main one has a corresponding 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.340
 hologram 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.669
 on the back of the package is written information about 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.579
 case 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.309
 Namely here it is indicated that the cover 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:43.399
 has an extra glass gorilla 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:47.570
 glass which protects the display from falling 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:52.320
 it says here that the case has 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:58.350
 moisture resistance and also that case 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:07.799
 is impact resistant so open 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:10.320
 packaging and we can see the picture on 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.900
 which is mapped from what is 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.640
 case here we can see 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.869
 metal frame with additional 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.869
 glass gorilla glass 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.329
 the phone itself 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:35.939
 rubber layer and one more extra 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:40.650
 metal frame here we also have 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:44.570
 there is a brochure with frontal covers 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.570
 for other models 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.960
 case itself and 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:15.959
 Instrumentation with which we 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:20.780
 we can open it and so the case itself 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.780
 it looks like this 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:38.400
 absolutely black has clearly 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:41.040
 matte finish now open it 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.190
 and see what else we have there 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.190
 inside 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:19.319
 so 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:23.370
 the phone was installed in the case now I 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:32.189
 demonstrate how the phone works in 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:35.010
 this cover and as you can see the sensor 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:38.609
 works absolutely normal despite 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.919
 the fact that we have installed here 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.060
 additional gorilla safety glass 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.790
 glass 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.900
 and also on my phone is still installed 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:52.199
 film immediately running ahead I can 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:57.810
 say that for those who are on the phone 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:04:00.419
 there is an expensive protective film it can 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:05.609
 quietly take off the extra protective 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:12.030
 glass and leave your film if u 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:15.269
 he is necessary and because 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.180
 I already said the sensor works fine 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:25.699
 now check the bottom buttons 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.699
 the menu works the home button works and 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:37.729
 back button also works keys 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:41.060
 volume is pressed very gently also 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.060
 works great 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:58.780
 charging port headphone port 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:09.909
 You can also demonstrate the work 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.909
 speakers in this case 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.330
 as you see everything is working fine from 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.580
 what can we conclude that this 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.360
 case despite all its protective 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.190
 properties in no way limit 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.250
 functionality of your phone 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:43.320
 that what sets him apart 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:46.250
 similar covers for different models 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.250
 mobile phones 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:12.080
 so once again let me remind you that we cover 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:12.080
 has additional protective glass 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:21.150
 case has a rubber damper 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:26.390
 Falling protection telephone 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:32.250
 has extra lining on 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:40.490
 speaker and microphone and what protects 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:45.510
 its moisture and also the phone also ports 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:47.100
 phones are protected with plugs from 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:55.169
 moisture ingress 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:57.740
 sand and stuff like that 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:59.730
