hey everybody Griff Hanlon here in
today's<00:00:02.730> lesson<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.240> want<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.480> talk<00:00:03.689> about<00:00:03.899> a

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
today's lesson I want to talk about a

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.710 
today's lesson I want to talk about a
lick<00:00:05.100> very<00:00:05.400> similar<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.850> what<00:00:06.029> BB<00:00:06.299> King<00:00:06.509> does

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
lick very similar to what BB King does

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.600 
lick very similar to what BB King does
at<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.049> beginning<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:08.099> thrill<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.519> gone

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
at the beginning of the thrill is gone

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.209 
at the beginning of the thrill is gone
and<00:00:08.940> how<00:00:09.540> this<00:00:09.780> kind<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.110> works<00:00:10.170> with<00:00:10.469> what<00:00:11.190> I

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
and how this kind of works with what I

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.030 
and how this kind of works with what I
called<00:00:11.490> my<00:00:11.700> four<00:00:12.210> notes<00:00:12.420> solo<00:00:12.780> concept<00:00:13.410> so

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
called my four notes solo concept so

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.919 
called my four notes solo concept so
first<00:00:14.250> let<00:00:14.429> me<00:00:14.460> play<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.330> lick<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:15.839> you

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
first let me play you the lick so you

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.210 
first let me play you the lick so you
can<00:00:16.109> hear<00:00:16.289> what<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.470> sounds<00:00:16.830> like<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.130> then

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
can hear what it sounds like and then

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.090 
can hear what it sounds like and then
I'll<00:00:17.310> show<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.550> how<00:00:18.240> how<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.170> see<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.859> as

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
I'll show you how how I see this as

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.800 
I'll show you how how I see this as
being<00:00:20.130> built<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.910> how<00:00:21.150> hopefully<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.630> can

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
being built and how hopefully you can

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.090 
being built and how hopefully you can
take<00:00:21.990> some<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> things<00:00:22.590> you've<00:00:22.769> already

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
take some of the things you've already

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.130 
take some of the things you've already
learned<00:00:23.400> from<00:00:23.580> me<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.910> put<00:00:24.449> them<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.750> use<00:00:24.869> this

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
learned from me and put them to use this

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:40.490 
learned from me and put them to use this
way<00:00:25.340> so<00:00:26.340> here<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.609> goes<00:00:26.640> 1<00:00:26.970> 2<00:00:27.689> 3<00:00:28.560> 4<00:00:39.320> so<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:40.440> not

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
way so here it goes 1 2 3 4 so it's not

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.110 
way so here it goes 1 2 3 4 so it's not
a<00:00:40.559> very<00:00:40.649> complicated<00:00:41.160> lick<00:00:41.640> it's<00:00:41.850> actually

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
a very complicated lick it's actually

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.869 
a very complicated lick it's actually
pretty<00:00:42.329> simple<00:00:42.660> if<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.649> kind<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.219> do<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.610> time

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
pretty simple if I kind of do it in time

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.250 
pretty simple if I kind of do it in time
and<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.239> count<00:00:45.450> along<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.140> goes

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
and I count along with it it goes

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.330 
and I count along with it it goes
something<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.730> two<00:00:47.730> three<00:00:48.660> four<00:00:49.469> one

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
something like this two three four one

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.990 
something like this two three four one
and<00:00:50.640> two<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.510> three<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.379> four<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.399> one<00:00:53.460> and

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
and two and three and four and one and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.479 
and two and three and four and one and
two<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:55.230> three<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:56.250> four<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.750> two

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
two and three and four and one and two

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.619 
two and three and four and one and two
three<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.789> four<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:01.280> okay<00:01:02.449> really<00:01:03.449> pretty

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
three and four and okay really pretty

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.210 
three and four and okay really pretty
straightforward<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.559> let's<00:01:04.739> look<00:01:04.979> at<00:01:05.100> how

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
straightforward but let's look at how

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.719 
straightforward but let's look at how
it's<00:01:05.369> put<00:01:05.549> together<00:01:06.500> if<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.680> remember<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
it's put together if you remember the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.649 
it's put together if you remember the
I'll<00:01:09.390> say<00:01:09.659> four<00:01:09.930> note<00:01:10.110> solo<00:01:10.380> pattern<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:12.420> root

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
I'll say four note solo pattern the root

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.170 
I'll say four note solo pattern the root
note<00:01:12.869> focuses<00:01:13.619> around<00:01:13.740> my<00:01:14.280> third<00:01:14.580> finger<00:01:14.850> in

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
note focuses around my third finger in

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.210 
note focuses around my third finger in
this<00:01:15.689> case<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.229> twelfth<00:01:16.619> fret<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
this case on the twelfth fret of the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.280 
this case on the twelfth fret of the
second<00:01:17.850> string<00:01:17.880> that's<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.540> anchor<00:01:18.810> for<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
second string that's the anchor for the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.810 
second string that's the anchor for the
whole<00:01:19.500> thing<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.920> that's<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.189> root<00:01:20.430> note<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
whole thing and that's the root note and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.300 
whole thing and that's the root note and
then<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.689> go<00:01:21.869> down<00:01:22.080> two<00:01:22.290> frets<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> tenth

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
then I go down two frets to the tenth

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.130 
then I go down two frets to the tenth
and<00:01:23.640> then<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.970> go<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> second<00:01:24.720> string<00:01:24.930> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
and then I go up to the second string to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.170 
and then I go up to the second string to
the<00:01:25.320> tenth<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.650> twelfth<00:01:25.920> fret<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:27.000> there's

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the tenth and twelfth fret so there's

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.310 
the tenth and twelfth fret so there's
the<00:01:27.330> pattern

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.620 

okay<00:01:32.320> so<00:01:32.380> if<00:01:32.650> you<00:01:32.740> can't<00:01:32.979> play<00:01:33.130> that<00:01:33.479> make<00:01:34.479> sure

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
okay so if you can't play that make sure

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.340 
okay so if you can't play that make sure
you<00:01:34.720> get<00:01:34.840> that<00:01:35.049> now

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
you get that now

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.800 
you get that now
but<00:01:37.310> let's<00:01:37.850> say<00:01:38.030> we<00:01:38.180> were<00:01:38.270> going<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:38.479> take<00:01:38.659> that

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
but let's say we were going to take that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.570 
but let's say we were going to take that
same<00:01:39.080> pattern<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:39.740> drop<00:01:40.430> it<00:01:40.640> by<00:01:40.790> an<00:01:41.000> octave<00:01:42.580> so

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
same pattern and drop it by an octave so

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.359 
same pattern and drop it by an octave so
now<00:01:43.790> we<00:01:44.270> put<00:01:44.299> it<00:01:44.630> from<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.200> 12th<00:01:45.590> fret<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.280> if

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
now we put it from the 12th fret and if

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.760 
now we put it from the 12th fret and if
you<00:01:46.460> go<00:01:46.549> down<00:01:46.869> it's<00:01:47.869> two<00:01:48.200> strings<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:48.650> two

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
you go down it's two strings and two

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.350 
you go down it's two strings and two
frets<00:01:49.040> unless<00:01:49.399> you<00:01:49.520> cross<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.880> B<00:01:50.000> string<00:01:50.270> and

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
frets unless you cross the B string and

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.330 
frets unless you cross the B string and
then<00:01:50.509> it's<00:01:50.630> two<00:01:51.049> strings<00:01:51.290> and<00:01:51.439> three<00:01:51.890> frets<00:01:52.130> so

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
then it's two strings and three frets so

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.039 
then it's two strings and three frets so
in<00:01:52.940> this<00:01:53.090> case<00:01:53.270> since<00:01:53.540> we're<00:01:53.690> on<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.869> B<00:01:53.990> string

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
in this case since we're on the B string

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:55.570 
in this case since we're on the B string
we're<00:01:54.710> going<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.890> we're<00:01:55.130> going<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:55.310> have<00:01:55.430> to

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
we're going to we're going to have to

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.520 
we're going to we're going to have to
deal<00:01:55.789> with<00:01:55.820> that<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.659> go<00:01:56.840> three<00:01:57.080> frets<00:01:57.320> so

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
deal with that and and go three frets so

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.090 
deal with that and and go three frets so
if<00:01:58.009> I<00:01:58.100> go<00:01:58.280> down<00:01:58.310> three<00:01:58.940> frets<00:01:59.409> two<00:02:00.409> strings<00:02:00.799> I

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
if I go down three frets two strings I

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.719 
if I go down three frets two strings I
get<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.700> same<00:02:01.909> note<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:03.950> if<00:02:04.070> I<00:02:04.190> put<00:02:04.399> my<00:02:04.549> third

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
get the same note so if I put my third

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.219 
get the same note so if I put my third
finger<00:02:04.970> there<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:07.300> can<00:02:08.300> do<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:08.569> exact<00:02:08.959> same

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
finger there I can do that exact same

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.650 
finger there I can do that exact same
pattern<00:02:09.500> there<00:02:09.890> as<00:02:10.009> well<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:10.489> notice<00:02:11.330> that<00:02:11.360> the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
pattern there as well so notice that the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.250 
pattern there as well so notice that the
first<00:02:11.690> three<00:02:12.350> notes<00:02:13.300> or<00:02:14.300> four<00:02:14.780> notes<00:02:14.959> I<00:02:15.050> guess

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
first three notes or four notes I guess

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.540 
first three notes or four notes I guess
that<00:02:15.530> held<00:02:15.830> note<00:02:17.290> then<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.319> have<00:02:18.530> 10th<00:02:19.250> fret<00:02:19.489> on

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
that held note then I have 10th fret on

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.460 
that held note then I have 10th fret on
the<00:02:19.640> first<00:02:19.850> string<00:02:20.030> twelfth<00:02:20.900> fret<00:02:21.140> on<00:02:21.290> the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
the first string twelfth fret on the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.740 
the first string twelfth fret on the
second<00:02:21.920> 10th<00:02:22.819> on<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.390> second<00:02:24.069> so<00:02:25.069> one<00:02:25.519> two<00:02:26.420> and

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
second 10th on the second so one two and

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.630 
second 10th on the second so one two and
three<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.709> four<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.730> one<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:29.540> two

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
three and four and one and two

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.110 
three and four and one and two
okay<00:02:32.319> so<00:02:33.319> this<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:34.069> all<00:02:34.190> in<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.430> same<00:02:34.580> pattern

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
okay so this is all in that same pattern

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.570 
okay so this is all in that same pattern
but<00:02:35.480> then<00:02:36.110> boom<00:02:36.800> I'm<00:02:36.980> just<00:02:37.160> going<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.370> jump

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
but then boom I'm just going to jump

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.180 
but then boom I'm just going to jump
down<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:38.360> other<00:02:38.540> version<00:02:39.020> start<00:02:39.950> right

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
down to the other version start right

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.420 
down to the other version start right
away<00:02:40.370> with<00:02:40.760> my<00:02:41.350> third<00:02:42.350> finger<00:02:42.800> on<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.220> ninth

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
away with my third finger on the ninth

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.300 
away with my third finger on the ninth
fret<00:02:43.819> of<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.120> third<00:02:44.569> string<00:02:44.600> a<00:02:45.260> little<00:02:46.069> bend

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
fret of the third string a little bend

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.210 
fret of the third string a little bend
and<00:02:46.610> then<00:02:47.480> 7<00:02:47.930> then<00:02:48.550> 9<00:02:49.630> then<00:02:50.630> down<00:02:51.020> to<00:02:51.470> 9<00:02:51.680> on<00:02:52.070> the

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
and then 7 then 9 then down to 9 on the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.880 
and then 7 then 9 then down to 9 on the
4th<00:02:52.459> string<00:02:53.080> 7th<00:02:54.080> fret<00:02:54.140> on<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.560> third<00:02:54.860> string

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
4th string 7th fret on the third string

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.690 
4th string 7th fret on the third string
and<00:02:55.850> a<00:02:56.030> couple<00:02:56.240> of<00:02:56.420> nines<00:02:56.630> on<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.959> 4th<00:02:57.230> string

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
and a couple of nines on the 4th string

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:06.930 
and a couple of nines on the 4th string
so<00:02:58.700> just<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.420> part<00:02:59.860> 1<00:03:00.860> &amp;<00:03:01.160> 2<00:03:01.300> &amp;<00:03:02.300> 3<00:03:02.330> &amp;<00:03:03.319> 4<00:03:03.670> &amp;<00:03:04.670> 1<00:03:04.940> &amp;<00:03:05.720> 2

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
so just that part 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 2

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.240 
so just that part 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
ok<00:03:08.110> so<00:03:09.110> if<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.290> put<00:03:09.500> this<00:03:09.590> whole<00:03:09.769> thing<00:03:10.070> together

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
ok so if I put this whole thing together

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.210 
ok so if I put this whole thing together
you<00:03:10.760> get<00:03:11.239> something<00:03:11.480> like<00:03:11.540> this<00:03:11.870> 1<00:03:12.830> 2<00:03:13.690> 3<00:03:14.690> &amp;<00:03:15.080> 4<00:03:15.650> &amp;

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
you get something like this 1 2 3 &amp; 4 &amp;

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:26.620 
you get something like this 1 2 3 &amp; 4 &amp;
1<00:03:16.640> &amp;<00:03:17.420> 2<00:03:17.830> &amp;<00:03:18.830> 3<00:03:19.030> &amp;<00:03:20.030> 4<00:03:20.810> &amp;<00:03:21.440> 1<00:03:21.800> &amp;<00:03:22.610> 2<00:03:25.030> so<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:26.120> can<00:03:26.300> see<00:03:26.480> all

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 so you can see all

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.000 
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 so you can see all
I've<00:03:26.780> done<00:03:26.930> is<00:03:26.989> I've<00:03:27.230> just<00:03:27.260> taken<00:03:27.500> that<00:03:27.680> same

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
I've done is I've just taken that same

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.990 
I've done is I've just taken that same
pattern<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:30.080> moved<00:03:30.320> it<00:03:30.470> down<00:03:30.500> an<00:03:30.739> octave<00:03:30.830> you

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.880 

could<00:03:35.000> actually<00:03:35.209> even<00:03:35.600> turn<00:03:36.110> them<00:03:36.260> around<00:03:36.350> for

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
could actually even turn them around for

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:46.020 
could actually even turn them around for
example<00:03:36.980> I<00:03:37.280> could<00:03:37.459> go<00:03:37.610> 1<00:03:38.239> 2<00:03:38.959> 3<00:03:39.160> 4<00:03:40.600> 1<00:03:41.600> &amp;<00:03:41.989> 2<00:03:42.019> &amp;<00:03:42.920> 3<00:03:42.950> &amp;<00:03:43.640> 4

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.270 

so<00:03:47.030> I<00:03:47.360> could<00:03:47.600> just<00:03:47.630> play<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.860> first<00:03:49.070> part

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
so I could just play the the first part

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.069 
so I could just play the the first part
in<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.730> second<00:03:50.090> half<00:03:50.329> and<00:03:50.600> I<00:03:50.660> could<00:03:50.810> play<00:03:50.930> the

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
in the second half and I could play the

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.660 
in the second half and I could play the
second<00:03:51.500> half<00:03:51.530> and<00:03:51.829> first<00:03:52.010> half<00:03:52.190> you<00:03:52.340> can<00:03:52.459> you

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
second half and first half you can you

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.650 
second half and first half you can you
can<00:03:52.820> switch<00:03:52.970> them<00:03:53.090> around<00:03:53.269> you<00:03:53.450> can<00:03:53.570> do

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
can switch them around you can do

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.900 
can switch them around you can do
whatever<00:03:53.810> you<00:03:54.049> want<00:03:54.260> so<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:55.040> just<00:03:55.549> wanted<00:03:55.760> to

show you this it's a great lick you can

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.380 
show you this it's a great lick you can
use<00:03:57.860> it<00:03:58.010> all<00:03:58.160> over<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.549> place<00:03:58.640> obviously<00:03:59.060> this

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
use it all over the place obviously this

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.539 
use it all over the place obviously this
is<00:03:59.570> in<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.810> key<00:03:59.930> of<00:03:59.959> B<00:04:00.380> minor<00:04:00.799> since<00:04:01.250> that's<00:04:01.430> a

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
is in the key of B minor since that's a

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.090 
is in the key of B minor since that's a
B<00:04:01.730> but<00:04:02.299> I<00:04:02.360> could<00:04:02.510> play<00:04:02.690> it<00:04:02.810> in<00:04:02.959> G<00:04:03.200> simply<00:04:03.950> by

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
B but I could play it in G simply by

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.190 
B but I could play it in G simply by
moving<00:04:04.670> my<00:04:05.060> fingers<00:04:05.420> down<00:04:05.600> into<00:04:05.900> my<00:04:06.019> third

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
moving my fingers down into my third

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.560 
moving my fingers down into my third
finger<00:04:06.440> on<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.799> G<00:04:07.040> at<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.610> eighth<00:04:07.760> fret<00:04:08.150> and

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
finger on the G at the eighth fret and

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.259 
finger on the G at the eighth fret and
I'd<00:04:08.720> have<00:04:08.930> one<00:04:09.290> and<00:04:09.560> two<00:04:10.070> and<00:04:10.400> three<00:04:10.430> and<00:04:11.180> four

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
I'd have one and two and three and four

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:17.050 
I'd have one and two and three and four
and<00:04:12.079> one<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.650> two<00:04:13.010> and<00:04:13.790> three<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:14.480> four<00:04:15.049> and

and one and two and three and four and

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.219 
and one and two and three and four and
it'll<00:04:18.060> work<00:04:18.180> anyway<00:04:18.570> I<00:04:18.600> could<00:04:18.720> put<00:04:18.810> away<00:04:18.959> up<00:04:19.109> in

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
it'll work anyway I could put away up in
