00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
think it's good on how influences the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.240 
think it's good on how influences the
jungle<00:00:18.510> meta<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.020> give<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.650> little<00:00:19.859> bit<00:00:20.070> of

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
jungle meta and give it a little bit of

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.980 
jungle meta and give it a little bit of
a<00:00:20.340> breakdown<00:00:20.640> first<00:00:21.270> things<00:00:21.480> first<00:00:21.570> let's

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
a breakdown first things first let's

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.890 
a breakdown first things first let's
take<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.320> look<00:00:22.560> at<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.920> item<00:00:23.400> itself<00:00:23.900> firstly

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
take a look at the item itself firstly

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.689 
take a look at the item itself firstly
its<00:00:25.019> item<00:00:25.260> path<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.680> great<00:00:26.099> for<00:00:26.369> junglers

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
its item path is great for junglers

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.279 
its item path is great for junglers
because<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.119> can<00:00:27.269> build<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.570> out<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.779> lots<00:00:28.140> of

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
because you can build it out of lots of

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.919 
because you can build it out of lots of
small<00:00:28.769> pieces<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.580> work<00:00:30.060> your<00:00:30.240> way<00:00:30.300> up<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.660> it

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
small pieces and work your way up to it

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.359 
small pieces and work your way up to it
the<00:00:31.260> reason<00:00:31.470> why<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.890> quite<00:00:32.130> appealing

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
the reason why this is quite appealing

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.190 
the reason why this is quite appealing
for<00:00:32.610> jungle<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:32.969> because<00:00:33.420> they<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.600> access

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
for jungle is because they have access

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.979 
for jungle is because they have access
to<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> limited<00:00:34.829> income<00:00:35.790> often<00:00:36.510> not<00:00:36.660> being<00:00:36.870> able

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
to a limited income often not being able

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.080 
to a limited income often not being able
to<00:00:37.170> save<00:00:37.440> up<00:00:37.649> for<00:00:37.860> those<00:00:37.950> huge<00:00:38.370> items<00:00:38.850> and

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
to save up for those huge items and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.000 
to save up for those huge items and
shelling<00:00:39.480> out<00:00:39.600> massive<00:00:39.989> amounts<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.350> cash<00:00:40.739> at

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
shelling out massive amounts of cash at

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.400 
shelling out massive amounts of cash at
one<00:00:41.219> time<00:00:41.550> sat<00:00:42.270> some<00:00:42.450> cells<00:00:42.690> are<00:00:42.899> great<00:00:43.200> for

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
one time sat some cells are great for

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.750 
one time sat some cells are great for
bruises<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.010> sets<00:00:44.219> them<00:00:44.399> up<00:00:44.460> pretty

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
bruises and it sets them up pretty

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.760 
bruises and it sets them up pretty
nicely<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> mid<00:00:45.870> game<00:00:46.050> with<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> good

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
nicely for the mid game with a good

is really good as well with the ten

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.260 
is really good as well with the ten
percent<00:00:55.829> from<00:00:55.949> runes<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.399> masteries<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.059> if

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
you choose to go worryin charmant then

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.799 
you choose to go worryin charmant then
when<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.399> buy<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.760> black<00:01:00.000> cleaver<00:01:00.329> you'll

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
when you buy that black cleaver you'll

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.410 
when you buy that black cleaver you'll
be<00:01:00.960> at<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.079> CDR<00:01:01.620> cap<00:01:01.890> pretty<00:01:02.430> early<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.359> my

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
be at the CDR cap pretty early on in my

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.179 
be at the CDR cap pretty early on in my
personal<00:01:03.629> opinion<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.260> think<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.680> twenty

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
personal opinion I think this twenty

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.340 
personal opinion I think this twenty
percent<00:01:05.489> CDR<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.030> little<00:01:06.540> bit<00:01:06.689> over<00:01:06.900> tuned

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
percent CDR is a little bit over tuned

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.140 
percent CDR is a little bit over tuned
and<00:01:07.560> if<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.100> was<00:01:08.250> only<00:01:08.310> ten<00:01:08.610> percent<00:01:08.729> then<00:01:09.060> it

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
and if it was only ten percent then it

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.850 
and if it was only ten percent then it
wouldn't<00:01:09.390> even<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.990> bad<00:01:10.290> however

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
wouldn't even be that bad however

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.710 
wouldn't even be that bad however
despite<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.340> example<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.790> gave<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:12.420> buying<00:01:12.659> a

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
despite the example I gave of buying a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.030 
despite the example I gave of buying a
warrant<00:01:13.080> Chum<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.500> actually<00:01:13.650> think<00:01:13.920> that

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
warrant Chum and I actually think that

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.890 
warrant Chum and I actually think that
cinderhulk<00:01:14.700> into<00:01:15.119> black<00:01:15.299> cleaver<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.869> a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
cinderhulk into black cleaver is a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.219 
cinderhulk into black cleaver is a
really<00:01:16.619> really<00:01:17.340> powerful<00:01:17.540> item<00:01:18.540> path<00:01:18.810> not

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
really really powerful item path not

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.719 
really really powerful item path not
only<00:01:19.350> do<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.710> very<00:01:19.830> decent<00:01:20.100> chunk<00:01:20.520> of

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
only do you get a very decent chunk of

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.249 
only do you get a very decent chunk of
health<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.090> attack<00:01:21.659> damage<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.229> also

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
health and attack damage but you also

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.320 
health and attack damage but you also
benefit<00:01:22.979> from<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.310> cinderhulk<00:01:23.759> passive

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
benefit from this cinderhulk passive

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.270 
benefit from this cinderhulk passive
which<00:01:24.720> increases<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.470> amount<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.890> health<00:01:26.130> you

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
which increases the amount of health you

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.789
