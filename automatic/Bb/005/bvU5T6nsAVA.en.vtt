you got mount st. Helen which is
probably<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.589> biggest<00:00:52.710> hell<00:00:52.979> on<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> circuit

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519

Supercross and outdoors obviously you

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.090 
Supercross and outdoors obviously you
have<00:01:06.509> two<00:01:06.689> Moto's<00:01:06.960> there's<00:01:07.409> 30<00:01:07.740> minutes<00:01:08.039> plus

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
have two Moto's there's 30 minutes plus

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.639 
have two Moto's there's 30 minutes plus
two<00:01:08.369> instead<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.789> 15<00:01:09.060> laps<00:01:09.270> less<00:01:09.780> jumps<00:01:10.259> you're

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
two instead of 15 laps less jumps you're

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.609 
two instead of 15 laps less jumps you're
outdoors<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.580> hot<00:01:11.880> sweaty<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> funnest

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
outdoors it's hot sweaty not the funnest

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.380 
outdoors it's hot sweaty not the funnest
at<00:01:13.799> times<00:01:14.039> but<00:01:14.460> whenever<00:01:14.670> you're<00:01:14.939> doing<00:01:15.240> good

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
at times but whenever you're doing good

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.000 
at times but whenever you're doing good
it's<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.380> appreciate<00:01:16.799> it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.530 

I<00:01:21.250> don't<00:01:21.700> think<00:01:21.730> our<00:01:21.880> approach<00:01:22.210> is<00:01:22.390> much

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
I don't think our approach is much

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.090 
I don't think our approach is much
different<00:01:22.990> because<00:01:23.410> I<00:01:23.620> mean<00:01:23.800> we<00:01:23.860> only<00:01:23.950> have

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
different because I mean we only have

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.910 
different because I mean we only have
two<00:01:24.250> weeks<00:01:24.280> to<00:01:24.550> get<00:01:24.640> ready<00:01:24.820> for<00:01:24.880> outdoors<00:01:25.300> so

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
two weeks to get ready for outdoors so

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.020 
two weeks to get ready for outdoors so
obviously<00:01:26.920> you<00:01:27.010> start<00:01:27.220> doing<00:01:27.340> longer<00:01:27.610> Moto's

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
obviously you start doing longer Moto's

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.420 
obviously you start doing longer Moto's
you're<00:01:28.840> different<00:01:29.500> tracks<00:01:29.770> you're<00:01:30.310> not

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
you're different tracks you're not

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.920 
you're different tracks you're not
riding<00:01:30.580> your<00:01:30.790> supercross<00:01:31.240> test<00:01:31.510> track<00:01:31.720> all

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
riding your supercross test track all

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.420 
riding your supercross test track all
the<00:01:32.020> time<00:01:32.080> but<00:01:32.620> other<00:01:32.740> than<00:01:32.950> that<00:01:33.070> it's<00:01:33.370> not

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
the time but other than that it's not

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.530 
the time but other than that it's not
much<00:01:33.670> different<00:01:33.700> you're<00:01:34.090> still<00:01:34.270> you're

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
much different you're still you're

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.330 
much different you're still you're
cycling<00:01:34.930> you're<00:01:35.200> in<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.350> gym<00:01:35.530> you're<00:01:36.190> just

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
cycling you're in the gym you're just

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.310 
cycling you're in the gym you're just
doing<00:01:36.580> the<00:01:36.730> same<00:01:36.760> stuff

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.510 

let's<00:01:43.320> say<00:01:43.410> my<00:01:43.530> goals<00:01:43.770> for<00:01:44.070> outdoors<00:01:44.340> this

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
let's say my goals for outdoors this

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.890 
let's say my goals for outdoors this
summer<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> podium<00:01:45.600> every

summer is just to be on the podium every
race<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.440> think<00:01:46.710> that's<00:01:47.370> something<00:01:47.550> I<00:01:47.760> could

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
race I think that's something I could

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.450 
race I think that's something I could
I'm<00:01:48.540> capable<00:01:49.050> of<00:01:49.260> doing<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.740> think<00:01:49.830> in<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.340> end

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
I'm capable of doing I think in the end

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.860 
I'm capable of doing I think in the end
that'll<00:01:50.790> put<00:01:50.970> me<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.150> a<00:01:51.210> good<00:01:51.300> position<00:01:51.450> for

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
that'll put me in a good position for

00:01:51.870 --> 00:02:06.460 
that'll put me in a good position for
the<00:01:51.930> championship

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.230 

I<00:02:06.530> feel<00:02:07.280> confident<00:02:07.730> you<00:02:07.790> know<00:02:07.820> I'm<00:02:08.000> all<00:02:08.149> we
