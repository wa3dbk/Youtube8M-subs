00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello and a warm welcome here 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.529
 adapt to winter wonderland jumping 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.360
 guide rises news.de in this guide 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.090
 I will show you now like that 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.740
 Wintersday job in passy works and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.230
 As you can see we start on one 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.730
 of these three platforms and to everyone 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.279
 this platform belongs to another 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.320
 State that is the beginning is always 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.180
 different, however, there are from the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.400
 middle such a point where the bg 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.820
 run absolutely identically 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.050
 in which all three roads arrive and with it 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.460
 now you also the other two ways 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.290
 I can see here in the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.300
 notations two left prepared the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.450
 three ways can be categorized in 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.760
 gingerbread snowman and collar and the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.430
 says snowman away you just see that 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.289
 collar away and have the gingerbread gone 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.329
 you link here right and left now 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.309
 yes very important for the Stammpersonal 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.899
 is you have while you the ways 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.879
 a seebach jumps on it you 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.530
 deduct life points while you are on the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.510
 launch platform and on the platform 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.480
 is all in the middle of this ticking the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.250
 ba for you not that means it is ok 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.049
 only important that in these two pope 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.909
 meanwhile relatively fast through the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.439
 thing by jumping since in the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.970
 you have to arrive in the middle 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.770
 decide what you do with wise 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.380
 can you already here a reward 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.990
 pick up a small safe here 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.460
 point up or you say hey me 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.290
 the risk would be greater 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.970
 have a reward and jump with that 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.430
 package itself on 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.409
 yes would have to jump over this 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.880
 exploding gift rows here 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.290
 That's why I have a little bit of that now 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.810
 video the longer it lasts with it 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.960
 See how the whole looks and you 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.610
 you have to do it relatively quickly 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.110
 modern gifts over it tommy has it there 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.090
 just in the video like it did 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.650
 this is the way left around 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.479
 I'll be right through the middle 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.430
 go there are several possibilities 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.350
 several ways you like this 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.070
 you can finish yourself 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.659
 for you a little bit 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.460
 find out which is the best I find 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.930
 this one in the middle was actually 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.549
 relatively good and relaxed 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.170
 Here you have to watch out there 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.850
 sometimes a cold wind you have to 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.560
 just dodge with a dodge roll 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.020
 and then we come here to the next one 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.090
 point the rolling balls of indiana 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.290
 jones partie I like to call here 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.270
 it is just important that you are in the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.220
 right moment left on the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.229
 evades sweets or 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.580
 right and not in the red feathers 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.380
 in it stands the explode and 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.220
 hurl you down either 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.480
 want to or simply wait until 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.400
 change the fields that is 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.630
 usually not a big problem 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.330
 Here again we have the area 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.980
 where the debuff is ticking and where you are 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.990
 a little hurry then it works 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.460
 right about a few gift packages 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.430
 and then you have it through 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.500
 The winter wonderland has done it and has been 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.270
 successfully arrived at the end and there 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.860
 expect a nice chest with you 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.330
 some reward depending on if your risk 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.900
 you have gone or you do not get one 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.670
 bigger reward and yes in principle what 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.900
 we are already here if it is you 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.480
