00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 and we are back with a 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.890
 new video of modern warfare 3 and good 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.440
 I had not played this game for a long time 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.300
 and that it had not been for quite some time 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.580
 did not go up so I had a lot of desire 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.210
 to play it again and upload it to see what 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.250
 so we get this little pill as I say 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.990
 because he does a lot that he did not play 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.539
 I went to it I did not remember 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.109
 store the best hours for her 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.830
 there were two there we are removed from this 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.060
 mechanically friendly 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.460
 it's worth 1 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.609
 not wrong but I think it has happened 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.609
 over here 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.410
 I 'm not wrong because message to 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.359
 turn that over but it costs a lot 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.440
 that rotated but good nothing happens 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:44.570
 because we have managed to get the streak 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.790
 pretty fast so 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.230
 that's fine for we're through 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.600
 of the helicopter could have helped us 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.970
 in me it always gives all the draw the most 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.450
 fast but as we have failed with 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.510
 we all have to make it worth killing 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.989
 even if one seems outside there is more 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.159
 more besides there they would come exactly what 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.210
 I knew 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.810
 I knew that if to see if we do not have 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.350
 nothing, we do not have bullets 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.689
 go right now we're screwed we're 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.190
 pretty screwed up to see if I get pity 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:23.400
 a ground weapon or something 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.400
 I make myself 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.260
 OK 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.970
 we go 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.590
 OK 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.579
 Careful care that comes a little bit 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.579
 and there was this 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.780
 OK 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.479
 did not hit the corner I shit all day 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.350
 I shit on everything was in the damn 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.580
 corner I did not even notice that 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.830
 there was only one because in which there 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.590
 killed he had not seen more shots 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.630
 because 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.340
 entered go because I thought 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.190
 it was only that but we have 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.230
 got the three streaks that the truth 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.000
 that rachita has been very, very good 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.660
 Well, it will be enough to kill 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.560
 as with the helicopters and we get 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.560
 lower that out there 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.730
 it's worth another out come come on let's go let's go 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.760
 fast and it's pretty much started like that 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.319
 we managed to kill enough more than 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.750
 I would be fine after so long 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.110
 without playing is killing very little I think the 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.110
 helicopter 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.550
 they have killed him let's see if out there 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.989
 the bottom comes some if we do not have no 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.400
 we have it we have it 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.379
 It's worth it killed the back of my mother 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.900
 good more than love from ahead because 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.450
 is behind the track here he killed me because 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.670
 I was going to enter some 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.650
 or over there now now now is that 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.030
 It was very red, that's why I was 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.230
 equated jesus malave this come on let's go 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.840
 I'm without bullets and this one to see if 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.560
 I find here some on the floor 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:13.099
 but it gives me if there is one I am 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.180
 at stake a lot that out there and already 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.330
 throw the helicopter before it looks good 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.500
 he threw another one that I do not know if they will have but 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:24.580
 I throw it and leave mine before 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.340
 and we go because I do not think I was already very 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.500
 little bit of the next streak but it 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.130
 will go back 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.760
 you can see care a certain carelessness 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.760
 because all 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.380
 let's see was uncle kept 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.060
 You know that I killed 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.010
 behind 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.560
 very many behind I'll play it 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.080
 I think they come here, yes, here 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.480
 killed my partner some because he has 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.940
 thrown the missile I know with what styled now 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.720
 the helicopter has died shortly 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.800
 is the second one that has lasted very little 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.600
 for this does not take away 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.720
 let's see if we find the answer 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.390
 again there we are I cured my back for 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.819
 if I get one from behind 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.560
 that right now is in the background worth 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.799
 we have to go around here kill the 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.799
 helicopter 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.820
 I believe 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.710
 I also did not have ammunition anymore, but 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.800
 let's go 25 3 the truth that we're going pretty 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.930
 well I do not know how much is left even for the 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.320
 lower part is worth it so we get more 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.320
 short 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:48.230
 there we have one there is no more seems not 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.420
 know if pure and in the background with that bomb 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.490
 I do not know what happens there but when 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.840
 jumped like he has thrown me back 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.370
 that is to say as burned a bit of the 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.370
 street or something but 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.509
 let's throw that in there for maybe up to 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.100
 someone that out there to the 7th boat lifts and 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:08.190
 here it's worth just had arrived 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.229
 also and finished the game 26 4 yo 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.270
 I think that after so much time 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.039
 super good the truth we have not considered 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.050
 take out the entire streak then we have been 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.729
 very close to get us out again 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.620
 the missile project and the truth that has 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.880
 molado very much the moment there of the 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.740
 streak has been super mini our the 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.590
 final to which the talk we have arrived in 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.199
 in terms of casualties and with helicopter to the 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.690
 I do not know what streak we'll have made but 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.800
 the truth that has been super well 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.789
 that nothing said after so much 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.259
 time the era that I liked a 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.060
 If you liked lot to you 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.500
 it also leaves a like if it's been like that 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.220
 crystal in this role a new video 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.220
 you feel goodbye
