 Hello there is Remix Hacker 6 90 here again 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.139
 and today I'll show you one that plays an animated picture 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.879
 converted into a video 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.999
 because this causes some difficulties 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:19.979
 I've already prepared an animated GIF action here 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.810
 in this case magic goes clean 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.810
 so insert the smart room for 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.029
 around 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.029
 that is a dearer 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.970
 yes but then some fine actions 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.970
 I have synonymous and YouTube video 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.900
 um, and of course now it will be the question of how to light it all up as a video 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.520
 above so that, for example, can upload to YouTube 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.430
 that is quite simple if you rest the percent program you are allowed to maker 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.380
 Mike gets over it early 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.790
 at least during 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.890
 and then just the LG Forchheim a police helicopter GF 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.080
 while Windows pulls Windows Movie Maker then it is in there 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.780
 then you pull the picture up 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.670
 Video on the track then you can look at it then it is just a lot 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.470
 too fast 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.140
 and then you just do it, you say 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.280
 the day of remembrance 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.050
 and then the world 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.620
 Heidi slow down the speed three times 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.700
 this is now watching 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.700
 Now he looks much better like the Ruhr 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.370
 Place you can look so good 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.460
 You always have to know when to go too fast 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.460
 that's the way to go 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.700
 now theoretical wants to start again from scratch that the only one 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.570
 Makelele Steinert 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.530
 but that seems he will be here again and so it is exactly 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.680
 in the preview image 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.670
 and then say 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.880
 files 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.710
 Publish movie 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.400
 then the war already 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.759
 then you have a windows to the second US media video files 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.569
 which you can then easily upload to YouTube or for other purposes 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.019
 forwarded and can 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.629
 that's what it was already wish you much fun 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.399
 convert or relax hacker 96
