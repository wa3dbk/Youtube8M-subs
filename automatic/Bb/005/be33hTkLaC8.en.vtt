about<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.580> lipstick<00:01:18.240> first<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.619> a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
about the lipstick first so this is a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.219 
about the lipstick first so this is a
Viva<00:01:19.890> Glam<00:01:20.009> Rihanna<00:01:20.549> lipstick<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.200> a

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
Viva Glam Rihanna lipstick so it is a

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.030 
Viva Glam Rihanna lipstick so it is a
frost<00:01:22.770> formula<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.909> color<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.630> kind<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.740> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
frost formula the color is kind of a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.310 
frost formula the color is kind of a
darker<00:01:26.640> red<00:01:27.030> definitely<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> blue<00:01:27.900> based<00:01:28.140> red

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
darker red definitely a blue based red

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.490 
darker red definitely a blue based red
and<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.759> thing<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.270> Viva<00:01:30.750> Glam<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.140> they<00:01:31.259> try

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
and the thing with Viva Glam is they try

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.620 
and the thing with Viva Glam is they try
and<00:01:31.530> make<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> colors<00:01:32.220> more<00:01:32.850> Universal<00:01:33.509> than

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and make the colors more Universal than

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.050 
and make the colors more Universal than
not<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.650> would<00:01:34.860> work<00:01:35.009> on<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.520> variety<00:01:35.729> of

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
not so this would work on a variety of

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.600 
not so this would work on a variety of
skin<00:01:36.360> tones<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.500> definitely<00:01:37.650> has<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.280> good

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
skin tones and it definitely has a good

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.819 
skin tones and it definitely has a good
amount<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.210> frost<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.590> should

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
amount of frost in it like it should

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.920 
amount of frost in it like it should
because<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.369> frost<00:01:41.610> formula<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.630> lip

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
because it's a frost formula the lip

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.069 
because it's a frost formula the lip
gloss<00:01:43.259> or<00:01:43.829> lip<00:01:44.040> gloss<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:45.600> Viva<00:01:46.020> Glam

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
gloss or lip gloss is the Viva Glam

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.469 
gloss or lip gloss is the Viva Glam
Rihanna<00:01:46.229> lip<00:01:46.710> glass<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.000> lighter

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
Rihanna lip glass and so this is lighter

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.550 
Rihanna lip glass and so this is lighter
but<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.560> still<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.979> same<00:01:50.250> shade<00:01:50.610> as<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
but it's still the same shade as the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.780 
but it's still the same shade as the
lipstick<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.009> lighter<00:01:53.280> but<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.610> has<00:01:53.759> a

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
lipstick so it's lighter but it has a

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.399 
lipstick so it's lighter but it has a
lot<00:01:54.240> more<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.829> glittery<00:01:56.780> aspect<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.170> and

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
lot more of a glittery aspect to it and

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.109 
lot more of a glittery aspect to it and
then<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> great<00:01:58.799> thing<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.040> they<00:01:59.369> are<00:01:59.520> very

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
then the great thing is they are very

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.630 
then the great thing is they are very
similar<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.570> color<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.920> they<00:02:02.219> look<00:02:02.430> good

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
similar in color so they look good

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.130 
similar in color so they look good
together<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.689> what<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.899> looks<00:02:04.079> like

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
together so this is what it looks like

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.889 
together so this is what it looks like
together<00:02:04.590> or<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.729> right<00:02:06.000> now<00:02:06.420> I'm

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
together or I have it on right now I'm

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.809 
together or I have it on right now I'm
finding<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.829> feel<00:02:08.280> less<00:02:08.550> sticky

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
finding that this is feel less sticky

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.300 
finding that this is feel less sticky
than<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.770> usually<00:02:10.770> think<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.190> mac<00:02:11.550> lipglass

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
than I usually think that mac lipglass

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.770 
than I usually think that mac lipglass
but<00:02:12.550> that<00:02:12.760> also<00:02:12.910> could<00:02:13.209> be<00:02:13.330> because<00:02:13.450> I'm<00:02:13.630> not

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
but that also could be because I'm not

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.600 
but that also could be because I'm not
wearing<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.290> right<00:02:14.560> on<00:02:14.739> my<00:02:14.770> lips<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.310> I<00:02:15.400> did

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
wearing it right on my lips and I did

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.729 
wearing it right on my lips and I did
have<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:16.120> lip<00:02:16.300> balm<00:02:16.510> on<00:02:16.540> before<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.200> applied<00:02:17.560> my

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
have a lip balm on before I applied my

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.500 
have a lip balm on before I applied my
lipstick<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.640> my<00:02:18.760> lip<00:02:18.940> glass<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:19.330> maybe

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
lipstick and my lip glass so maybe

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.720 
lipstick and my lip glass so maybe
that's<00:02:19.750> why<00:02:19.989> but<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:20.890> really<00:02:21.250> like<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.610> way
