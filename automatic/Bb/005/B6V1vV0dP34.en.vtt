sitting in so what we have here is a
dragster<00:00:18.529> three-wheeled<00:00:19.529> dragster<00:00:22.250> so<00:00:23.250> I

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
dragster three-wheeled dragster so I

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.630 
dragster three-wheeled dragster so I
don't<00:00:25.350> even<00:00:25.470> know<00:00:25.710> what<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.039> make<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.279> this

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
don't even know what to make of this

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.029 
don't even know what to make of this
this<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.060> probably<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.779> weirdest<00:00:28.410> vehicle

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
this is probably the weirdest vehicle

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.550 
this is probably the weirdest vehicle
mode<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:30.119> see<00:00:30.150> or<00:00:30.810> one<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> weirder

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
mode we see or one of the weirder

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.170 
mode we see or one of the weirder
vehicle<00:00:31.920> modes<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.279> see<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> cybertron

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
vehicle modes we see in the cybertron

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.660 
vehicle modes we see in the cybertron
line<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.020> reason<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:35.160> thing<00:00:35.399> can't

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
line and the reason is this thing can't

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.970 
line and the reason is this thing can't
turn<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.360> made<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.750> go<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.079> straight<00:00:37.140> line

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
turn it's made to go in a straight line

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.150 
turn it's made to go in a straight line
there's<00:00:38.270> no<00:00:39.270> i<00:00:39.629> can't<00:00:40.140> think<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.440> any<00:00:40.559> way<00:00:40.829> for

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
there's no i can't think of any way for

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.250 
there's no i can't think of any way for
this<00:00:41.309> guy<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> actually<00:00:42.329> turn<00:00:42.750> around<00:00:42.809> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
this guy to actually turn around a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.369 
this guy to actually turn around a
corner<00:00:44.180> but<00:00:45.180> considering<00:00:45.690> his<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> crumple<00:00:46.260> go

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
corner but considering his a crumple go

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.529 
corner but considering his a crumple go
so<00:00:46.590> i<00:00:46.620> don't<00:00:46.800> think<00:00:46.890> everything<00:00:47.219> matters<00:00:47.539> so

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
so i don't think everything matters so

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.660 
so i don't think everything matters so
the<00:00:48.780> vehicle<00:00:49.079> mode<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.500> little<00:00:50.039> strange<00:00:50.399> now

and in the sides of the vehicle

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.249 
and in the sides of the vehicle
so<00:01:44.670> unpay<00:01:45.119> them<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.509> fold<00:01:45.810> them<00:01:45.960> out<00:01:46.079> like

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
so unpay them and fold them out like

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.440 
so unpay them and fold them out like
that<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.280> fold<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> feet<00:01:47.939> down<00:01:49.189> next<00:01:50.450> take

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
that and fold the feet down next take

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.620 
that and fold the feet down next take
the<00:01:52.460> entire<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.790> guess<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.149> would<00:01:54.299> call<00:01:54.329> this

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the entire I guess you would call this

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.770 
the entire I guess you would call this
the<00:01:54.869> cockpit<00:01:55.530> section<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.159> fold<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.240> along

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
the cockpit section and fold that along

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.840 
the cockpit section and fold that along
with<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.170> front<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> vehicle<00:01:58.770> onto<00:01:59.759> the

with the front of the vehicle onto the
figures<00:02:00.119> back<00:02:00.409> or<00:02:01.409> what<00:02:01.530> will<00:02:01.710> be<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.950> figures

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
figures back or what will be the figures

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.240 
figures back or what will be the figures
back<00:02:02.430> then<00:02:03.360> rotate<00:02:03.960> these<00:02:04.320> sections<00:02:04.979> with<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
back then rotate these sections with the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.210 
back then rotate these sections with the
wheels<00:02:05.520> rotate<00:02:06.149> them<00:02:06.329> all<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.719> way<00:02:06.840> around<00:02:07.220> to

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
wheels rotate them all the way around to

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.130 
wheels rotate them all the way around to
expose<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.149> arms<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:10.560> reach<00:02:10.619> up<00:02:11.099> by<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.940 
go we've got breakdown in robot mode I
like<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.290> robot<00:02:21.440> mode

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.940 
I think the robot mode looks good I
think<00:02:23.480> it's<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.780> good<00:02:24.020> robot<00:02:24.350> mode<00:02:24.620> it's

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
think it's a good robot mode it's

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.720 
think it's a good robot mode it's
definitely<00:02:26.500> interesting<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.890> looks<00:02:28.069> pretty

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
definitely interesting it looks pretty

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.790 
definitely interesting it looks pretty
tough<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.300> except<00:02:29.870> for<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.050> giant<00:02:30.350> thing

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
tough and except for the giant thing

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.780 
tough and except for the giant thing
coming<00:02:31.220> on<00:02:31.310> his<00:02:31.430> back<00:02:32.200> giant<00:02:33.200> backpack<00:02:33.580> but<00:02:34.580> it

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
coming on his back giant backpack but it

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.430 
coming on his back giant backpack but it
can't<00:02:35.030> act<00:02:35.180> as<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.390> third<00:02:35.660> leg<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.140> keep<00:02:36.260> him
