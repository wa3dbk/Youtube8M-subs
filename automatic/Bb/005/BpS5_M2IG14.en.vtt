00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.950
 room before installing any 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.710
 plasterboard construction should be 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.529
 all wet processes such as 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.720
 plaster screed and others for installation 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.640
 plasterboard designs originally 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.720
 it is necessary to mark the floor with 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.650
 using roulette 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.720
 square and level or laser 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.949
 level 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.760
 marked up as a corner contour 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.250
 partitions 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.590
 so is the doorway mark itself 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.960
 transferred from the floor to the walls and ceiling 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.750
 and after beating off the cord is applied 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.899
 frame contour partition is performed 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.969
 from cv profiles and alas for reliability 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.510
 thickness profiles should be 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.809
 not less than 0.55 millimeter required 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.460
 profile board much good in the rear side 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.920
 taped sound insulation tape and 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.920
 diphthong this allows the construction of extinguishes 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.270
 vibration during operation profile 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.460
 pre-cropped by 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.010
 the required size is fooling around and 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.460
 secured with dowel screw 6 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.460
 at 60 at a distance of 600,800 millimeters 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:18.500
 shawl firewood profiles are applied as 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.500
 guides and fixed to the floor and ceiling 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.710
 profiles plato rights cv 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.009
 used as racks and must 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.320
 have a thickness of at least 0.55 millimeter 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.939
 use of thinner profiles 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.179
 metal can cause cracking 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.640
 deformation of the doorway seams and so 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.369
 then first profile is shortened by 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.850
 10 15 millimeters from the height of the room and 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.049
 exhibited in increments of 600 millimeters 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.819
 adjacent profiles required 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.340
 pre-sized dictum 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.229
 customer and secured to perform 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.869
 directly doorway 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.990
 should be used with profiles and th 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.380
 metal thickness 2 mm profile 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.429
 equipped with a pair of corners and bolts 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.280
 washer and nut assembled profile 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:11.640
 put in the frame is set on the edge 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.069
 doorway and play the fool important 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.530
 remember doorway profiles do not 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.599
 are step profiles for plating 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.010
 drywall 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.049
 similarly mounted follow 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.620
 profile mount is performed using 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:28.440
 dowel screw 6 to 60 after necessary 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.870
 measure the height and width of the doorway 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.389
 cut and set jumper 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.690
 from the profile payment samples in that is 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:38.609
 run the upper slope of the door lintel 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.530
 mounted to the profiles u and with 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:43.819
 three and a half screw screws 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.709
 nine and a half or 11 millimeters 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.359
 other profiles are set in steps of 600 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.359
 millimeters and secured by 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:54.150
 prosekatel and if necessary step 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:56.989
 profiles can be reduced to 400 or 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.989
 300 millimeters 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.330
 sewing is done only with a screwdriver 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.700
 for drywall works 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.410
 screwdriver does not allow screws about that 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.450
 spitting in drywall thanks 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.310
 nozzle and increases speed 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.590
 fastening 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.420
 plasterboard board format follows 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.090
 start from one of the designs 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.230
 rooms with high humidity 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.099
 it is necessary to use slabs 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.440
 aquastop 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.599
 drywall plates are fastened with screws 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.599
 three and a half screws to 25 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.880
 millimeters with a step of 20 25 centimeters 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.860
 before mounting the slab must be put 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.130
 lining on the floor and after installation 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.930
 remove their corner stitch occurs by 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.260
 joining extreme corner profiles 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.750
 through drywall otherwise when 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.680
 non-compliance with partition angle technology 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.650
 will pop 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.220
 and deform under the influence 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.799
 external loads 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.230
 excess drywall doorway 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.190
 are cut with a hacksaw and knife 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.190
 drywall work 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.670
 distribute wires free 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:12.010
 constructional space in 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:14.290
 septum as insulating 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.299
 material is recommended to use 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.970
 rolled insulation or slabs of 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.829
 mineral wool insulation thickness should 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.320
 be no less than the thickness of the septum in 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.330
 space otherwise isolation 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.250
 during operation sags and 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.289
 increases the sound skipped 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.660
 septum insulating layer 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.360
 fit so that there are no gaps 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.400
 between him recommended does not leave 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.470
 clearance and near profiles when 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.479
 substandard styling insulating 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.889
 material goes down sound 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.889
 structural resistance 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.550
 the next step is sewing 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:52.729
 gypsum boards board with 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.520
 the opposite side of the opening all 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.979
 the cut edges are machined with a rasp for 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.749
 drywall 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:02.979
 all the wires you are measured and sizes 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:05.300
 transferred to drywall workpiece 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.009
 hole of the required diameter under 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.099
 wires are hacked 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:12.639
 drywall after a wire 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.870
 reach through the slots 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.270
 pre- sheets are set on 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.849
 drywall lining for compliance 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.099
 technical gap between the partition and 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.860
 floor vertical joints should not 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:26.180
 match vertical seams 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.460
 the opposite side of the septum then 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:35.539
 there are sheets mounted at offset 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:37.669
 racks such seams should not match either 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.129
 with horizontal not with vertical 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.289
 offset doorway offset from 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:44.919
 slope lines must be at least 30 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.919
 centimeters
