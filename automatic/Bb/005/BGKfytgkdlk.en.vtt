00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.930 
it's a brilliant game and it has its
features<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.770> fact<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.250> it's<00:02:08.729> too

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
features but the fact is that it's too

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.449 
features but the fact is that it's too
short<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.509> i<00:02:09.720> can't<00:02:10.140> i<00:02:10.319> have<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.679> really<00:02:11.129> deduct

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
short so i can't i have to really deduct

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.980 
short so i can't i have to really deduct
my<00:02:11.640> score<00:02:12.090> do<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.629> fact

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
my score do the fact

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.380 
my score do the fact
that<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.800> know<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.460> does<00:02:14.760> have<00:02:15.000> some

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
that you know it does have some

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.570 
that you know it does have some
replayability<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:16.470> if<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.830> really<00:02:17.340> want<00:02:17.490> to

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
replayability like if you really want to

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.030 
replayability like if you really want to
relax<00:02:17.820> or<00:02:18.120> something<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.930> just<00:02:19.140> listen<00:02:19.590> to

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
relax or something you just listen to

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.560 
relax or something you just listen to
the<00:02:20.190> music<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.700> paint<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.090> town<00:02:21.300> it's

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
the music and paint the town it's

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.080 
the music and paint the town it's
actually<00:02:21.960> pretty<00:02:22.110> fun<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:23.250> time<00:02:23.520> limit<00:02:23.730> adds

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
actually pretty fun the time limit adds

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.720 
actually pretty fun the time limit adds
a<00:02:24.480> lot<00:02:24.600> of<00:02:24.750> challenge<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.430> as<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.550> can<00:02:26.700> see

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
a lot of challenge and as you can see

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.400 
a lot of challenge and as you can see
i'm<00:02:26.940> just<00:02:27.150> doing<00:02:27.390> free<00:02:27.630> paint<00:02:27.900> here<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.350> I

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
i'm just doing free paint here so I

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.710 
i'm just doing free paint here so I
don't<00:02:28.620> have<00:02:28.740> any<00:02:28.920> time<00:02:29.700> limit<00:02:30.030> but<00:02:30.450> there's<00:02:30.660> a
