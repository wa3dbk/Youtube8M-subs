00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
then it comes into the digna corner this

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.680 
then it comes into the digna corner this
is<00:00:40.680> where<00:00:40.920> we<00:00:41.040> saw<00:00:41.250> Barrichello<00:00:42.180> but<00:00:42.390> mostly

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
is where we saw Barrichello but mostly

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.139 
is where we saw Barrichello but mostly
Montoya<00:00:43.530> get<00:00:43.800> off<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.250> no<00:00:44.550> problem<00:00:44.969> for

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
Montoya get off so no problem for

räikkönen McLaren if he's strong 2/10 of
a<00:00:47.760> second<00:00:48.090> up<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.390> first<00:00:48.660> sector<00:00:48.989> already

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
a second up in that first sector already

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.639 
a second up in that first sector already
so<00:00:50.520> expect<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.180> see<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.539> new<00:00:51.840> fastest<00:00:52.440> time

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
like it's a bottom it is fairly bumpy in

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.600 
like it's a bottom it is fairly bumpy in
places<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.650> once<00:01:13.860> they're<00:01:14.010> up<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.130> speed<00:01:14.340> of
