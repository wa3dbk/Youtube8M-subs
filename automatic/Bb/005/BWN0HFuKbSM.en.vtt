00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.080
 the plates 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.030
 So today we go back to the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.670
 ventilate that alone would not necessarily be 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.710
 something newsworthy, however, sit 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.570
 This time I myself stick to the stick 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.689
 It's about the so-called pinch hitter 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.590
 some say this is the housewives 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.599
 pilot translucent 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.699
 others say this is the education for 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.470
 helpfull what is the whole thing 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.699
 if the pilot is up in the air 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.589
 someday it gets bad or 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.750
 anything happens then you are as 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.280
 Pinscher in the situation the box itself 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.380
 hopefully land safely 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.239
 today is the first hour of flight and me 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.680
 look how it works the baby 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.480
 but leave behind me that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.719
 we stand today in a cessna 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.719
 1 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.690
 so that it is now the correct machine 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.670
 that's a cessna 172 and want it with it 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.239
 today one to one and a half hours 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.860
 peace, let's see if that's with the wind 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.780
 hinhaut really I have great 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.250
 Trust that our pilot is the one now 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.640
 maybe it will be sensible to us 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.470
 to bring air 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.360
 and the airport is at bbi theses 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.280
 hamburg is a lot going on 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.979
 and I also want to go right away 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.140
 but first I let myself 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:27.750
 by flight instructor frederik the machine 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.750
 explain and the basics of aviation 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.380
 Of course, check the propeller 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.560
 if he has any damage, the 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.259
 but it seems to have looked very good 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.450
 and then we also get quite a I 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.030
 get that down on the floor 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.540
 need different gas mixture than above in 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.780
 the air 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.090
 it continues with the flaps with the 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.740
 rows rowing with the strings and 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.740
 then we throw the machine 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.190
 We roll in the direction of the runway 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.340
 the last hare happen and get 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.670
 the release full throttle now it goes into the 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.670
 lüfte 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.450
 I'm baffled somehow everything goes 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.960
 so easy 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.000
 the state, the gas give ableben and now 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.920
 I sit in the plane and steer the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.040
 crate like an old hare 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.110
 Well, that's how you think it is 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.980
 of course a bit like the first one 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.290
 driving lesson 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.010
 you have the feeling everything under control 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.770
 to have 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.020
 But Frederik always has a thumb 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.330
 at the helm 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.090
 we all have best flying weather than that 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.890
 alster appears before us frederik has 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.290
 Something special for me and mine 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.000
 not only thought up first flight lesson 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.130
 a few rounds over hamburg we should 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.260
 but now also in the 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.489
 low-level flight over the hamburger airport 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.489
 nozzles and actually we get the 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.560
 release the runway in front of you and 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.680
 then whiz over half a meter 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.350
 the track touchdown costs 100 euros 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.239
 laughs frederik but then we let the 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.830
 get back behind us and fly 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:41.380
 back to hamburger city it is already 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.780
 a majestic feeling about the 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.940
 most beautiful city in the world to fly and 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.920
 niki also seems to be comfortable 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.830
 which probably less mine 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.480
 Flugkünsten and he at fredericks presence 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.220
 lies 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.489
 It goes back towards airfield 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:01.260
 Uetersen is called over the same and then 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.260
 we are already in the approach 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.100
 a buttery landing we lay down 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.760
 I suspect, however, that my share 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.200
 it 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.200
 was relatively modest 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.030
 so that was the first hour of flight to 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.650
 pinch hitter course that's what they say 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.810
 pretty much friedrich what can i do then 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.759
 after all , actually pancetta is 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.560
 yes there for when the private pilot of 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.000
 on the left, my heart is hanging 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.740
 kaspar real at once no more 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.639
 you can fly on from the right 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.470
 can take over 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.419
 more or less aviator 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.259
 Bring down and today after the first 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.759
 hour 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.930
 there you should not have a heart attack 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.960
 If we get up next time 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.190
 go or what does it look like so 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.990
 This can only happen in the first hours 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.150
 do not even say like the learning curve 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.940
 ever get and we have too 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.530
 today rather the sightseeing program 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.960
 not done now 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.330
 the workouts that we will next 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.919
 come very nice so it has me 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.440
 especially liked the low-level flight over 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.729
 you always have the hamburger airport 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.229
 to be able to do the luck and low flying 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.909
 Of course it's a bit spectacular 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.370
 also it always depends on it 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:40.080
 Then in the morning at the resorts 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.440
 difficult but actually so far 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.150
 paper almost always 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.680
 okay we say thank you all for today 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.680
 the in park and see you soon
