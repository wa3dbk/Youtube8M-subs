similar characteristics coming inside on
the<00:04:00.170> field<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.739> biggest<00:04:00.890> weakness<00:04:01.430> that<00:04:01.519> I

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
the field the biggest weakness that I

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.309 
the field the biggest weakness that I
saw<00:04:01.910> was<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.269> fact<00:04:02.510> that<00:04:02.600> when<00:04:02.780> teams<00:04:03.170> could

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
saw was the fact that when teams could

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.630 
saw was the fact that when teams could
pressure<00:04:03.590> him<00:04:03.830> especially<00:04:04.220> up<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.430> middle

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
pressure him especially up the middle

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.640 
pressure him especially up the middle
and<00:04:04.760> force<00:04:05.090> him<00:04:05.299> to<00:04:05.329> move<00:04:05.570> his<00:04:05.780> feet<00:04:05.989> and<00:04:06.200> reset

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
and force him to move his feet and reset

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.380 
and force him to move his feet and reset
his<00:04:06.829> feet<00:04:07.070> that's<00:04:07.579> when<00:04:07.850> he<00:04:07.970> got<00:04:08.090> into<00:04:08.359> trouble

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
his feet that's when he got into trouble

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.199 
his feet that's when he got into trouble
and<00:04:08.959> I<00:04:09.350> think<00:04:09.590> if<00:04:09.709> he's<00:04:10.190> going<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.519> be<00:04:10.730> great<00:04:11.030> in

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
and I think if he's going to be great in

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.120 
and I think if he's going to be great in
the<00:04:11.329> NFL<00:04:11.720> he's<00:04:12.170> got<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:12.560> learn<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:12.769> deal<00:04:13.100> with

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
the NFL he's got to learn to deal with

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.250 
the NFL he's got to learn to deal with
pressure<00:04:13.519> to<00:04:13.700> pick<00:04:14.000> things<00:04:14.150> up<00:04:14.359> quick<00:04:14.600> and<00:04:14.780> to

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
pressure to pick things up quick and to

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.930 
pressure to pick things up quick and to
understand<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.100> game<00:04:16.250> better<00:04:16.519> than<00:04:16.640> most

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
understand the game better than most

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.099 
understand the game better than most
because<00:04:17.329> he<00:04:17.479> doesn't<00:04:17.750> have<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:17.930> foot

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
because he doesn't have the foot

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.690 
because he doesn't have the foot
quickness<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:18.500> get<00:04:18.769> out<00:04:18.890> of<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:19.010> way<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.370> he
