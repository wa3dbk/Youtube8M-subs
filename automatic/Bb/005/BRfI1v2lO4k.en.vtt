 always indirectly this Sunday at 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.100
 the ats and this is the phase test i gdn 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.630
 if diarra in front of me I just have you 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.720
 ask to introduce a parent 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.699
 so please hello to all these 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.650
 currencies i sui thomas jaffre in the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.279
 real life and my name is ramq a 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.830
 now on video games that's it 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.510
 me if he ventured you remember yacine 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.969
 in real life and my twitter know 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.969
 it's nsydia pulled from the barbecue with troy 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:47.270
 me it's nassim aka zip and that's it 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.410
 boris maniac 19 years old and then that's it 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.199
 here we hold close these few ends 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.300
 risked ten polls but it's gonna 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:01:01.460
 continue on it so nsydia top 4 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.570
 disappointed not disappointed i can tell myself bruce 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.339
 so we'll say that I think it's 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.409
 correct from a rostand pick up 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.600
 here we had no train we did 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.330
 a roster to a week of the same laddh 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.950
 not three four days and then I think 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.689
 we did something good even 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.369
 if we could have done better 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.920
 with a little over 13 but hey 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.360
 will regret and then I really hope that 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.799
 it will be a springboard for the little ones 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.430
 young ventura hits that really 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.369
 very well played 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.930
 so that's none like bourhis said 1 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.400
 the top 4 for apparently that's when 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.220
 even a good performance 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.000
 I also ask you another question 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.079
 your journey of bad tastes is this 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.729
 that you liked some things 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.299
 maybe not others where this kind of 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.799
 things then already there and that actually makes it 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.030
 arrived at 9 o'clock we started to 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.110
 play at 18 hours 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.479
 so we did not know too much about 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.810
 involved because we did not have 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.970
 very good 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.040
 after that it's true 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.510
 we had four nights so we had 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.400
 tried to close we try to frame 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.740
 young people after all when 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.810
 even rather not badly played after it's 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.290
 true always the team work that is 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.120
 important and around and here we have 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.009
 had we had an incident 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.030
 we were hoping for a better so good and and 6 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.560
 Finally, we do not repeat in large 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.430
 teams we played first in the winner 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.560
 millenium bracket 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.640
 we get to put the first hp and then 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.120
 behind we lose 2.1 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.290
 I think it's mostly a mistake 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.060
 that's the fact that we're not a 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.769
 team especially a mistake to sting 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.049
 points that's no training so 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.700
 it's because of that and then after 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.260
 looser we spot another time against 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.519
 millenium with delay maps so 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.230
 I think we will finally make a 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.470
 very good course we managed to get out 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.390
 still led the box and that's what 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.069
 quite simply 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.360
 ok so now also as a face 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.799
 compared to donkey organizations 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.180
 a change of asip 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.250
 What do you think of 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.840
 the organization not well not well 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.340
 maybe errors of the problems 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.090
 what did you see for 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.310
 the moment down to level 2 at the level of 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.989
 the organization I think that already there is 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.000
 bahia a refreshment bar available 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.370
 all that is not bad after inevitably 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.430
 as often the maxi do not follow each other 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.840
 necessarily very quickly com as he has 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.060
 said deauville we arrived at 9 o'clock 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.680
 morning we played only at 18 hours so at this 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.739
 level there is a little beauf here and we 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.970
 played only lalanne bo3 except 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.750
 our last match against the millennium 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.310
 in 2012 hours thereafter there are some 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.980
 matches that should have been to a stream and 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.269
 who were not I think our 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.620
 match against the boks he could have 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.660
 the being where our match against millennium 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.090
 after that where there were others 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.650
 matches at the same time and all that otherwise 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.510
 in the background there is rather a good 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.180
 organization 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.359
 frankly there is not bad 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.930
 I just add and we do the mij and 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.599
 Last year 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.969
 I am a little disappointed even if I like 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.189
 many organizers following the 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:47.049
 renting so here is if you make a 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.920
 anne it's very important to try to 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.950
 to do in accessible places 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.689
 because there was still a little 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.980
 difficult to go finally here it is 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:55.599
 a little bit of a village and that it was 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.670
 a good one at that level a little bit 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.889
 disappointed otherwise the rest it could have been 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.109
 better but it was ok 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:04.989
 yes as formerly swallow rental for the 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.989
 location especially for the halls 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.760
 it's important enough to be able to 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.560
 access this one - listen I'm going 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.150
 maybe ask all the questions that 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.919
 would like me to interest us and all 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.479
 people who have so I will 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:18.160
