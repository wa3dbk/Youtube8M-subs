00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.969
 hello my name is alice my blog 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.759
 egyptians the kitchen talks about me and gods 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.860
 my gipsy culinary experiments why 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:24.070
 I'm a little gypsy in my soul 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.840
 passion and then why lightness 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.710
 corresponds somewhat to my trait 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.470
 badge 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.820
 today I will cook you madeline but duel 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.439
 because I am a little the lady of the 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.470
 madeleine than forty-fourth 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.989
 I made an effort to make them rise 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.809
 finally proud of me proust for 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.280
 I always use my own cooking 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.089
 recipe book and I tell you immediately 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:50.829
 ingredients we will have 150 g of flour 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:54.039
 sifted 125 g of butter 150 g of 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.070
 sugar 2 large eggs 2 tablespoons of 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:02.769
 milk and a teaspoon of yeast flavoring 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:06.550
 pleasure of course we leave 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.440
 we begin to mix the two eggs with lo 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.270
 sugar a little like the egg 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.860
 slammed that his mother was preparing when 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.350
 we came home from school for 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.560
 understand that it was always too much 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:21.570
 wasted then we did we have 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.570
 read 125 g of sugar 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.940
 here we put them 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.780
 we take the fantastic whip 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.780
 power 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.160
 God save a mentor of the whip 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.540
 electric start until we get it 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.690
 a homogeneous compound 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.270
 the classic beaten egg resumed that 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.860
 that makes this product so much in adolescence 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.900
 cellulite 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.320
 to this we must combine the flour 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.830
 sifted 150 grams we said of 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.830
 sifted flour 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.010
 I repeat I always use the recipe book 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:09.980
 because otherwise it gets me a little mixed up 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.980
 add a teaspoon of yeast 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.110
 we mix everything up to create a 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.110
 homogeneous compound 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:27.390
 now we have all risked well 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.849
 we combine these ingredients with butter 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.799
 butter should be allowed to soften 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.409
 however you see it must be crumbly in 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:39.120
 in such a way that one just puts oneself on 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:42.540
 hands and inside now that we have the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.129
 butter we make the famous butter smoked 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.480
 smoke that I find an expression 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:54.230
 very poetic voila we add to this 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.230
 point the milk 2 tablespoons of milk 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.959
 if you can't drink milk 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.959
 you can replace it with almond milk 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:12.359
 2 and add the rome to the vanilla 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.430
 this time I get bored because I like it 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:21.689
 always abound not obvious out of the way 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:23.549
 unfortunately voila we start the whole 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:26.669
 peculiarities of the tiles you need 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:29.549
 give her a thermal shock that is necessary 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:31.680
 leave the impact to rest in 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.739
 refrigerator for at least 30 minutes 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.250
 I usually leave them for a couple of hours 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.139
 such that they have time to 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.440
 shocked enough before 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:46.150
 be baked and create the famous one 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.200
 Gobet 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:55.030
 voila ours is then down and ready 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:58.049
 my refrigerator is waiting for them soon 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.049
 I'll tell you how crazy
