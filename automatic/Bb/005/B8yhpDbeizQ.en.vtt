really think DJ shadow oh this must be

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.310 
really think DJ shadow oh this must be
like<00:00:34.440> an<00:00:34.590> electronic<00:00:35.100> album<00:00:35.250> or<00:00:35.430> something

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
like an electronic album or something

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.229 
like an electronic album or something
yes<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:37.680> at<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> same<00:00:38.129> time<00:00:38.309> not<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:38.940> it's

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
yes but at the same time not really it's

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.049 
yes but at the same time not really it's
way<00:00:39.540> more<00:00:39.570> drum<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.410> bass<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.920> would<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:41.910> to

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
way more drum and bass I would have to

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.569 
way more drum and bass I would have to
say<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.420> it's<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.750> lot<00:00:42.960> more<00:00:42.989> drum<00:00:43.829> oriented

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
say that it's a lot more drum oriented

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.160 
say that it's a lot more drum oriented
like<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.969> said<00:00:45.030> there's<00:00:45.539> some<00:00:45.719> parts<00:00:46.079> of

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
like I said there's some parts of

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.920

electronic<00:00:46.739> music<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:47.129> there<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:47.640> really<00:00:48.570> the

electronic music in there but really the
