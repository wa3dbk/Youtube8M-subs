00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.260
 ah 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.570
 very good and welcome to this new 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.940
 apple mind tutorial video in which 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.830
 I'm going to show you how to install the 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.820
 new beta of ios six as we already know 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.970
 Only the 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.160
 developers but there is a way to 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.780
 get it without being without paying 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.610
 the 99 dollars to be a developer 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.400
 in naples then 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.000
 this is only what I am going to teach 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.930
 is going to be how to install and download xxix 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.070
 and be able to have any any of 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.060
 you on your device to see 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.060
 The requirements are to have 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.290
 the version of ios six beta for 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.560
 following devices that are the 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:05.590
 iphone 4 iphone 3gs iphone 4 iphone 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:07.810
 4s the ipad 2 the ipad 3 and the ipod 4 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.759
 the previous supports and all 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.570
 previous versions that I did not say no 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:16.000
 are available so only 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.380
 you have for these devices the 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.920
 beta of ios six then apart the 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:28.319
 next requirement is to have the the 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.789
 iTunes to the latest version that is 10.6.3 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:34.390
 you have to update it to give us 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:37.840
 no mistake and finally the last one 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.200
 would be to register elude or be the 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.399
 serial number of your device 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:49.989
 as a developer in that is the only 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:52.209
 trick to have the highest six in 

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:54.280
 your device there is also a u 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:55.959
 another way to do it without registering it 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.120
 but first let's see how 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:02.130
 registering it 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.409
 very well this would be the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.740
 the page where we would have to go audi 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.750
 dotcom and here we appeared 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.630
 it would appear that to register the ludyt 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.239
 we will have to pay only 6 99 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.400
 dollars a pretty reasonable price in 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:21.360
 comparison in the record that 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.540
 we need to do to have the the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.910
 Broker registration then only 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.610
 we would have to go or here to be are 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.190
 signa pnd borches what good would it be here 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.709
 of a quick purchase without having to 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.290
 register on this page or with 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.790
 registering the page and buying you 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.709
 recommended in this one but perfectly 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.160
 you can do it with the first option 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.250
 let's see the first option 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.070
 so here they tell us that good 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.260
 firmware is this that not only what 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.260
 would register just only be 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.770
 in this firmware and the udi does not tell us 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.810
 here we are asked to avoid what it is that 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.910
 we were saying before apart from that 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.880
 the other option of coco and cold for 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:09.380
 make a small discount if you have it 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.830
 then we're just going to itunes 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.470
 and good now because I have it covered 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.780
 but you will only have to select 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.870
 the serial number and that seems like you 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.210
 would appear identifier udi is a 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.150
 very long number so you have to 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.460
 aim it well and you do not have to match 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.100
 without any number so go checking 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.270
 enough times according to the 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.640
 moment that we have copied the 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.070
 identifier we will copy it in here in 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.860
 this section and we would give blade and 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.120
 well, we would buy it, it would take us 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.370
 a lot 24 hours 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.540
 it's usually not even half of what 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.680
 not actually take it then 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.320
 when at the moment we already have 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.660
 everything validated the only thing we will have 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.570
 what to do is with the fillmore that we 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.850
 we have downloaded from the six that I am going to 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.650
 leave all the versions that I said 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.440
 previously in the description of 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.660
 video for you to download them 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.510
 earlier that this version weighs 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.680
 much more than the others the ipod touch 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:17.110
 for example I weighed 800 and mega megas 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.269
 so it's pretty heavy for some 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:22.240
 It's going to cost you something 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:26.319
 then the only thing we would have to 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.050
 do would be in a windows the shift key 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:31.210
 and give it to restore or in mac to the key 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.250
 alt and give it to restore select and 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.590
 the firmware downloaded we would give it 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.069
 to open and we are restored and so we 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.990
 update already the version is worth this 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:45.099
 it would be the whole process to do the 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.080
 update without registering now without 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:50.080
 record the only thing that we will have to 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:55.000
 to do is have the version of 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.229
 itunes have the corresponding firmware 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.569
 that I said I would leave the 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.280
 video description and I just do not 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.930
 we would restore it would give 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.550
 give it to find update 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.770
 logically in windows holding the 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.690
 shift and mack holding the alt 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.389
 we would give and select and masters the 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.940
 firmware and we update now the 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.569
 difference that there is then that giving 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.869
 buying eluding 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:21.029
 and giving it to restore is going to be much more 

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:22.409
 sure we will give no mistake giving you 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:24.270
 to look for the update and without 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.069
 register can give us some other 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.729
 error you understand 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:33.089
 so if we care to leave you what 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:35.270
 it would be about six euros five euros and 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:38.750
 peak 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.870
 and buy it because it's very little money and 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.690
 you are going to have yesterday desings much sooner 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.720
 that all the others do not understand so 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.700
 it would only be that buy it 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.980
 identify elude and do this process 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.710
 of updating and I would have the 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.860
 six chayo available for all 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.860
 you 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.590
 well finally I want to say that I have 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.180
