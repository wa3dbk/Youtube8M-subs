00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.000
 not 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.120
 hello my name is roman I am 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.680
 manager of a grooming salon in Paris 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.940
 in the 12th and today I'm going 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.400
 show you how to do a grooming 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.290
 tend to your pet to make a 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.320
 grooming trend to her animal all 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.989
 is possible in this case so reprieve 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.000
 if we will shave the body biencourt 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.070
 leave the legs long enough 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.800
 just rework the dough outline 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.350
 for its phase of beautiful paw well round 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.930
 and come make him a nice little head 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.079
 well a teddy bear head you'll 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.750
 need a clipper with the hoof of 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.379
 your choice here is the length is 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.530
 7 mm a comb and scissors so in 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:53.949
 first we will come to tender 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.960
 animal's neck to the back belly 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.289
 going down slightly on the top 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.289
 pasta 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.420
 So here is once the body of 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.909
 your dog is well mowed I will you 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.670
 show how we outline the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.710
 pasta and pasta finish in a 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.600
 first time we will make the outline of 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.899
 pasta 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:47.189
 here you take the dough like these 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:51.830
 and you try to come draw a 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.830
 nice round all around the dough 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.549
 then we will put the dough and we will finish 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.549
 the round like that 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.620
 So, once we have drawn 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.910
 round at the end of the legs 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.770
 we will tackle the dough entirely 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.880
 so we will come 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.100
 shorten a little bit at the 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.350
 hair cut a little bit all that 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.630
 embarrassment all that goes beyond to come 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.150
 to make a paste a beautiful paste well 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.040
 uniform 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.340
 so that's once you find that 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.210
 your pasta is quite short 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.050
 uniform 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:46.910
 we can go to the head so in a 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:53.690
 first time we will bathe forward the 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:57.050
 hair at the muzzle agree nab 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.830
 with both fingers like these and we 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:04.120
 will come and cut off what is going on 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.120
 do the same thing on the other side 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.980
 so here is once we cut at 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.340
 level of the mustache we will come 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.360
 comb the hair down and so we 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:21.890
 will come to make a circle actually like 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.140
 these starting from the muzzle and 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.190
 going up to the ear for the head 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:33.290
 we will come 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:38.210
 paint the star ahead and come 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:41.960
 cut like these by trying to 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.180
 to make a round to finish at the level of 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.060
 ears we will come combed the ear 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.850
 caught the ear between two fingers 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.680
 like these and cut off the part that 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.700
 exceed by being careful not to 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.590
 cut the ear 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.660
 so here you now know how 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.880
 do a grooming trend to your 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.440
 dog in the next video I you 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.000
 find to explain how 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.000
 depilate your pet
