00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
manufacturing equipment my first patent

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.200 
manufacturing equipment my first patent
is<00:01:03.519> issued<00:01:03.670> in<00:01:04.379> 1965<00:01:05.379> I<00:01:05.680> believe<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.970> it<00:01:07.060> was<00:01:07.180> a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
is issued in 1965 I believe and it was a

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.240 
is issued in 1965 I believe and it was a
wraparound<00:01:07.570> patent<00:01:08.110> it<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.470> front<00:01:08.710> size<00:01:08.920> and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
wraparound patent it the front size and

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.460 
wraparound patent it the front size and
back<00:01:09.460> over<00:01:10.150> the<00:01:10.360> two<00:01:10.600> other<00:01:10.750> patents<00:01:11.170> issues

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
back over the two other patents issues

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.340 
back over the two other patents issues
in<00:01:11.619> that<00:01:11.770> field<00:01:12.040> so<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:13.600> may<00:01:13.780> be<00:01:13.840> one<00:01:14.200> of

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
in that field so that may be one of

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.899 
in that field so that may be one of
three<00:01:14.470> people<00:01:14.920> that<00:01:15.070> could<00:01:15.250> offer<00:01:15.400> a<00:01:15.580> brush

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
three people that could offer a brush

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.850 
three people that could offer a brush
that<00:01:16.090> would<00:01:16.270> do<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.540> front<00:01:16.810> sides<00:01:17.080> rear

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
that would do the front sides rear

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.749 
that would do the front sides rear
since<00:01:18.610> that<00:01:18.760> time<00:01:18.790> I've<00:01:19.299> got<00:01:19.509> probably<00:01:20.759> 15

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
since that time I've got probably 15

tried to make it work and after a long
time<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.490> developing<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.240> and<00:02:23.390> they're

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
time of developing it and they're

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.150 
time of developing it and they're
working<00:02:24.020> on<00:02:24.110> different<00:02:24.290> products<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:24.920> would

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
working on different products that would

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.430 
working on different products that would
not<00:02:25.670> hold<00:02:25.940> dirt<00:02:26.330> than<00:02:26.600> what<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.990> dirt<00:02:27.260> was

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
not hold dirt than what the dirt was

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.440 
not hold dirt than what the dirt was
rinse<00:02:27.650> off<00:02:27.860> we<00:02:28.610> came<00:02:28.820> out<00:02:28.970> with<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.180> grand

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
rinse off we came out with the grand

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.840 
rinse off we came out with the grand
product<00:02:30.200> which<00:02:30.740> has<00:02:30.860> been<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.160> tremendous

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
product which has been a tremendous

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.000 
product which has been a tremendous
success

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.580 

all<00:02:36.519> in<00:02:36.730> all<00:02:36.849> we<00:02:37.090> really<00:02:37.659> work<00:02:37.959> at<00:02:38.170> simplifying

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
all in all we really work at simplifying

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.970 
all in all we really work at simplifying
the<00:02:39.040> equipment<00:02:39.989> we<00:02:40.989> have<00:02:41.019> no<00:02:41.409> bearings<00:02:41.830> that

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
the equipment we have no bearings that

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.920 
the equipment we have no bearings that
you<00:02:42.069> have<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.310> lubricate<00:02:42.580> because<00:02:43.540> we<00:02:43.659> found

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
you have to lubricate because we found

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.530 
you have to lubricate because we found
opening<00:02:44.290> lubricates<00:02:44.709> them<00:02:44.860> anyhow<00:02:45.330> we<00:02:46.330> use<00:02:46.510> a

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
opening lubricates them anyhow we use a

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.449 
opening lubricates them anyhow we use a
plastic<00:02:47.580> bushing<00:02:48.580> that's<00:02:48.790> designed<00:02:49.599> for<00:02:49.780> that

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
plastic bushing that's designed for that

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.070 
plastic bushing that's designed for that
so<00:02:51.459> we've<00:02:51.610> eliminated<00:02:51.849> the<00:02:52.209> greasing<00:02:52.750> was

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
so we've eliminated the greasing was

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.110 
so we've eliminated the greasing was
eliminated<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.680> repair<00:02:54.069> we've<00:02:54.640> eliminated<00:02:54.819> a

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
eliminated the repair we've eliminated a

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.559 
eliminated the repair we've eliminated a
Russian<00:02:55.569> I<00:02:59.819> don't<00:03:00.819> want<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.060> be<00:03:01.120> able<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.390> make

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
Russian I don't want to be able to make

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.550 
Russian I don't want to be able to make
