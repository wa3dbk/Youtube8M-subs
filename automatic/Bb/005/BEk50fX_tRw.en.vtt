the easiest Samba maps that will ever
come<00:00:26.640> out<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.090> your<00:00:27.210> lifetime<00:00:27.740> now<00:00:28.740> all<00:00:28.980> you

have to do is come out into the swamp
area<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.560> would<00:00:31.650> say<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.920> comms<00:00:32.160> room<00:00:32.309> and

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
area I would say the comms room and

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.170 
area I would say the comms room and
follow<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.020> pattern<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.860> know<00:00:35.309> you're<00:00:36.000> looking

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
follow the pattern I know you're looking

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.990 
follow the pattern I know you're looking
at<00:00:36.420> my<00:00:36.570> grades<00:00:36.840> going<00:00:37.200> oh<00:00:37.380> my<00:00:37.710> god<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.340> this

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
at my grades going oh my god is this

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.319 
at my grades going oh my god is this
easy<00:00:39.270> well<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.559> think<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.489> best<00:00:41.790> strategies

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
easy well I think the best strategies

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.030 
easy well I think the best strategies
are<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> easiest<00:00:42.960> ones<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.440> all<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.890> to

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
are the easiest ones and all you have to

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.240 
are the easiest ones and all you have to
do<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.399> keep<00:00:44.730> circling<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.780> swamp<00:00:46.079> now<00:00:46.920> one

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
do is keep circling the swamp now one

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.619 
do is keep circling the swamp now one
thing<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.520> should<00:00:47.550> watch<00:00:47.910> over<00:00:48.239> there<00:00:48.450> is

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
thing you should watch over there is

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.229 
thing you should watch over there is
that<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.930> should<00:00:49.200> jump<00:00:49.649> off<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.820> ramp<00:00:51.030> into

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
that you should jump off the ramp into

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.670 
that you should jump off the ramp into
the<00:00:51.420> swamp<00:00:51.690> because<00:00:51.870> sometimes<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.410> will<00:00:52.530> get

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
the swamp because sometimes you will get

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.130 
the swamp because sometimes you will get
stuck<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.579> don't<00:00:54.449> want<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.629> put<00:00:54.809> yourself

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
stuck and you don't want to put yourself

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.689 
stuck and you don't want to put yourself
into<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.410> tough<00:00:55.620> situation<00:00:55.649> where<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.579> to

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
into a tough situation where you have to

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.260 
into a tough situation where you have to

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
same tactic you can just keep going

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.039 
same tactic you can just keep going
around<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.490> circles<00:01:50.549> after<00:01:51.270> dogs<00:01:51.689> with<00:01:51.960> the

window offer although i would recommend

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.450 
window offer although i would recommend
using<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.600> rig<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:55.140> here<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.950> small

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
using the rig on here as it is a small

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.050 
using the rig on here as it is a small
bit<00:01:56.729> easier<00:01:57.149> no<00:01:57.990> once<00:01:58.290> again<00:01:58.619> i<00:01:58.829> will<00:01:59.700> advise

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
bit easier no once again i will advise
