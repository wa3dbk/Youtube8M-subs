blender in the world you'll need to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.210 
blender in the world you'll need to
break<00:01:27.720> off<00:01:27.900> chunks<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.439> or<00:01:28.590> else<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.950> can't

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
break off chunks of it or else it can't

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.390 
break off chunks of it or else it can't
fit<00:01:29.520> that's<00:01:30.329> what<00:01:30.600> she<00:01:30.840> said<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.890> got<00:01:32.280> my
