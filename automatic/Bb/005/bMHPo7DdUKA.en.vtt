here<00:02:46.430> in<00:02:46.459> this<00:02:46.700> hangar<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.239> then<00:02:47.989> one

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
here in this hangar and then one

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.680 
here in this hangar and then one
airplane<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.400> have<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.730> Super<00:02:50.120> Cub<00:02:50.299> is<00:02:50.359> gone

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
airplane I have a Super Cub is gone

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.140 
airplane I have a Super Cub is gone
right<00:02:50.989> now

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
right now

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.470 
right now
but<00:02:53.889> this<00:02:54.889> plane<00:02:55.159> is<00:02:55.340> flown<00:02:55.840> or<00:02:56.840> run<00:02:57.319> weekly<00:02:58.480> we

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
but this plane is flown or run weekly we

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.179 
but this plane is flown or run weekly we
think<00:02:59.720> continental<00:03:00.260> engines<00:03:00.379> are<00:03:00.709> important

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:01.189 
think continental engines are important

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.660 
think continental engines are important
for<00:03:01.430> them<00:03:01.609> to<00:03:02.200> be<00:03:03.200> run<00:03:03.530> frequently<00:03:04.340> on<00:03:04.639> the

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
for them to be run frequently on the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.470 
for them to be run frequently on the
last<00:03:06.129> annual<00:03:07.129> which<00:03:07.370> was<00:03:07.549> done<00:03:07.760> in<00:03:07.790> November

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
last annual which was done in November

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.809 
last annual which was done in November
all<00:03:09.019> of<00:03:09.349> the<00:03:09.439> compressions<00:03:10.099> in<00:03:10.310> both<00:03:10.519> engines

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
all of the compressions in both engines

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.550 
all of the compressions in both engines
are<00:03:11.500> 76<00:03:12.500> over<00:03:12.980> 80<00:03:13.220> or<00:03:13.519> better<00:03:14.049> so<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:15.230> airplane

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
are 76 over 80 or better so the airplane

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.429 
are 76 over 80 or better so the airplane
is<00:03:15.859> in<00:03:15.889> really<00:03:16.639> good<00:03:16.760> condition<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.480> ready<00:03:18.319> to
