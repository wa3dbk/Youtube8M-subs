well show it on your screen right now is
one<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.520> my<00:01:50.670> favorite<00:01:51.120> clean<00:01:51.480> tones<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
one of my favorite clean tones in the

one of my favorite clean tones in the
PRS<00:01:52.770> 30<00:01:53.070> let's<00:01:53.580> give<00:01:53.730> it<00:01:53.760> a<00:01:53.850> listen

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.640 

you

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.619 

this<00:02:16.250> is<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.400> really<00:02:16.640> great<00:02:16.790> tone<00:02:17.150> first-time

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
this is a really great tone first-time

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.390 
this is a really great tone first-time
overdrive<00:02:18.140> will<00:02:18.590> let<00:02:18.739> you<00:02:18.829> hear<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.099> with<00:02:19.189> both

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
overdrive will let you hear it with both

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.119 
overdrive will let you hear it with both
single<00:02:19.939> coil<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.450> humbucker<00:02:21.140> pickups<00:02:21.680> and

single coil and humbucker pickups and

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.619 
single coil and humbucker pickups and
you'll<00:02:22.340> notice<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.760> master<00:02:23.090> volume<00:02:23.269> is

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
you'll notice the master volume is

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.360 
you'll notice the master volume is
turned<00:02:23.900> all<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.290> way<00:02:24.409> up<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.980> pulls<00:02:25.250> it

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
turned all the way up that pulls it

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.369 
turned all the way up that pulls it
totally<00:02:25.760> out<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.120> circuit<00:02:26.510> sounds<00:02:27.230> just

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
totally out of the circuit sounds just

00:02:27.379 --> 00:03:17.960 
totally out of the circuit sounds just
like<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.620> non<00:02:27.890> master<00:02:28.340> volume<00:02:28.519> amp

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.280 

now<00:03:18.970> we<00:03:19.030> have<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.300> master<00:03:19.510> volume<00:03:19.989> turned

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
now we have the master volume turned

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.930 
now we have the master volume turned
down<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.530> little<00:03:20.770> bit<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.370> brings<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.820> into

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
down a little bit that brings it into

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.820 
down a little bit that brings it into
the<00:03:22.150> circuit<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.690> we'll<00:03:23.260> let<00:03:23.350> you<00:03:23.470> hear<00:03:23.680> how

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
the circuit and we'll let you hear how

00:03:23.830 --> 00:04:17.819 
the circuit and we'll let you hear how
it<00:03:23.950> sounds<00:03:23.980> with<00:03:24.700> some<00:03:24.850> hi<00:03:24.970> gameplay
