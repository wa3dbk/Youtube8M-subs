of the top of your flowerpot and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.499 
of the top of your flowerpot and
multiply<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.070> by<00:01:26.280> three<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.909> find<00:01:27.119> out<00:01:27.299> how

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
multiply it by three to find out how

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.719 
multiply it by three to find out how
much<00:01:27.720> fabric<00:01:27.960> you'll<00:01:28.380> need<00:01:28.590> round<00:01:29.310> up<00:01:29.549> if

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
much fabric you'll need round up if

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.090 
much fabric you'll need round up if

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.460 
necessary mine needs to be about eleven
square<00:01:32.430> inches<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> measured<00:01:33.720> an<00:01:33.869> 11<00:01:34.290> by<00:01:34.439> 11

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
square inches so I measured an 11 by 11

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.770 
square inches so I measured an 11 by 11
inch<00:01:35.070> square<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.490> cut<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.030> out<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> fabric

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
inch square and cut it out of the fabric

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.990 
inch square and cut it out of the fabric
then<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.320> rounded<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.920> corners<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.520> get<00:01:38.700> sort

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
then I rounded the corners to get sort

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.760 
then I rounded the corners to get sort
of<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.180> circle<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.960> doesn't<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.530> be
