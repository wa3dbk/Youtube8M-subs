about that angles you know some you gals
are<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> building<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.470> stuff<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.369> those

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
are in the building this stuff so those

back here now this one's I would say
extremely<00:02:56.519> unstable<00:02:56.910> on<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.570> ball<00:02:57.720> joints

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
extremely unstable on the ball joints

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.979 
extremely unstable on the ball joints
their<00:02:58.319> word<00:02:58.730> rotates<00:02:59.730> but<00:02:59.940> he<00:03:00.510> sits<00:03:00.780> in<00:03:00.900> the

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989

a launcher on this leg so you can
actually<00:03:04.230> shoot<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.920> missile<00:03:05.430> see<00:03:07.220> now

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
actually shoot this missile see now

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.820 
actually shoot this missile see now
these<00:03:08.790> are<00:03:08.970> kind<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.269> like<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> rubbery<00:03:10.080> blue<00:03:10.560> so

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
you can see through now overall this

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.000 
you can see through now overall this
one's<00:03:14.819> pretty<00:03:14.970> neat<00:03:15.410> let<00:03:16.410> me<00:03:16.500> angle<00:03:16.739> this<00:03:16.830> up

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
one's pretty neat let me angle this up

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.280 
one's pretty neat let me angle this up
just<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.430> little<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:18.209> cockpit<00:03:18.660> does<00:03:18.840> go<00:03:18.989> up<00:03:19.110> and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
just a little the cockpit does go up and

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.920 
just a little the cockpit does go up and
down<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:19.620> he<00:03:19.739> can<00:03:19.860> come<00:03:20.070> out<00:03:20.190> these<00:03:20.700> back<00:03:20.970> wings

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
down so he can come out these back wings

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.830 
down so he can come out these back wings
do<00:03:22.230> fold<00:03:22.590> up<00:03:22.769> too<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.160> they<00:03:23.250> go<00:03:23.400> up<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.610> down

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
do fold up too so they go up and down

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.720 
do fold up too so they go up and down
it's<00:03:24.840> very<00:03:25.079> hard<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.470> keep<00:03:25.709> this<00:03:25.890> one<00:03:26.100> stable

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
it's very hard to keep this one stable

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.479 
it's very hard to keep this one stable
it<00:03:27.570> seems<00:03:27.840> like<00:03:28.019> this<00:03:28.230> joint<00:03:28.590> here<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:29.070> this

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
it seems like this joint here and this

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.250 
it seems like this joint here and this
joint<00:03:29.760> here<00:03:30.000> make<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.329> difficult<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.900> do<00:03:31.049> but

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
joint here make it difficult to do but

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.930 
joint here make it difficult to do but
once<00:03:31.739> you<00:03:31.860> get<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.160> balance<00:03:32.370> right<00:03:32.730> then

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
once you get the balance right then

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.949 
once you get the balance right then
it'll<00:03:33.150> stay<00:03:33.360> like<00:03:33.390> that

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
it'll stay like that

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.470 
it'll stay like that
as<00:03:34.290> far<00:03:34.590> as<00:03:34.620> playtime<00:03:35.400> it'd<00:03:36.060> be<00:03:36.180> pretty<00:03:36.360> hard

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
as far as playtime it'd be pretty hard

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.180 
as far as playtime it'd be pretty hard
to<00:03:36.750> keep<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:37.079> going<00:03:37.110> like<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.530> without<00:03:37.829> it

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
to keep it going like that without it

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.640 
to keep it going like that without it
knocking<00:03:38.459> over<00:03:38.850> because<00:03:39.000> one<00:03:39.180> little<00:03:39.350> it<00:03:40.350> and

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
knocking over because one little it and

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.949 
knocking over because one little it and
it<00:03:40.829> falls<00:03:41.070> over<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:42.209> lose<00:03:42.390> a<00:03:42.420> couple<00:03:42.810> pieces

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
it falls over you lose a couple pieces

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.490
