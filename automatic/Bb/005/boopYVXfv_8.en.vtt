00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.340
 disappointing start to the football year 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.689
 2014 is already in 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.939
 explanations so shortly after the 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.980
 game 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.750
 hard to say you have to do that first 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.880
 digest such a weak game that we 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:30.699
 delivered today and that was 1 2 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.929
 just follow it and he stops thinking 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.670
 that justifies the result 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.860
 Of course we have to do everything again 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.989
 watch but we have the sixth 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.950
 lost game here at home and that 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.149
 feels very very bitter just like 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.559
 have said have big plans 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.210
 our game changed a bit 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.649
 had to go on it earlier just to this 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.840
 homecoming a bit to fight 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.760
 and that is not ours today 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.350
 succeeded in making too many mistakes so 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.609
 many stupid mistakes and is all one 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.500
 head thing you play so it is 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.960
 Things where you have to say so the 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.960
 jumped on and you have to stop 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.179
 yes not easy passport picture error now 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.009
 and we definitely have to and 

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:10.390
 We still have to deal with Germany 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.320
 work out your home 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.460
 that in any case, so it was then 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.259
 I mean you find a head thing as 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.909
 we make many mistakes and become scary 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.740
 many still have a lot of mistakes in the end 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.090
 made 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.600
 in the game forward and you can do it 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.640
 afford 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.170
 where did this uncertainty come from? 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.280
 really almost a part 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.189
 a bit cramped very high 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.049
 There is an explanation for the error rate 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.630
 is so difficult to say so immediately 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.390
 after the game but we have none 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.920
 time of the game really such a 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.430
 found where we where we play the game 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.770
 have reasonably built and yes and 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.670
 barely clear chances played out 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.110
 let alone anything out 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.780
 have played and 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.910
 Of course you can not do that 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.050
 frankfurt is now passing the others 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.700
 have also spotted neatly 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.090
 I think now you can start saying 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.620
 the brutal relegation final 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.780
 had already started before the game 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.300
 We were already the situation 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.340
 aware though we were eleventh place 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.929
 everyone can read the table and that 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.120
 were two points to the 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:16.010
 relegation place and so 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.180
 to pool and raise all forces 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.540
 Be aware of what this is about 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.650
 this is a setback but we know 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.180
 what it's about when you can not do it now 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.060
 for the first time through his last two 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.440
 years were similar and if if 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.110
 everyone then sees the caterpillar 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.730
 knows what it's about 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.860
 of course, has but one has to front 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.370
 even more examples to play that must 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.080
 one already sees and is a prerequisite 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.489
 Of course we get points because of that 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.910
 teams are all close together 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.280
 below 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.300
 but we know where we stand and we 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.340
 can be a good 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.040
 we do not have the quality of their 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.340
 easy to achieve goals and need 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.630
 work hard for us and have to work there 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.180
 every single one has to stick to it 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.459
 stay tuned and remember 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.290
 what it means here at vfl bochum against 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.640
 to play the descent that's it 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.890
 really uncomfortable in the next 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.370
 weeks but I think that we the 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.950
 to have the right team there 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.599
 no classes to lift the no 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.640
 ask but it gets uncomfortable and then 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.049
 everyone has to be prepared for fox 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.209
 it almost becomes a bit too 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.220
 Unfortunately, what matters in the 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.730
 next week what has to happen? 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.159
 we have to open 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.330
 we must thomann and in the 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.220
 preparation is currently working on it 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.459
 that the effect is still not 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.549
 we have not yet come over 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.019
 keep fighting and keep fighting 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.090
 absolutely need to go to the 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.769
 right times in the 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.590
 first half the situation the 1 0 too 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.910
 make and we have missed again 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.400
 and at the moment we are seventh in the game 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.400
 key moments and we miss that 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.569
 only too often and as I said the 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.159
 ease that easily make it easy 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.450
 we did not have anything to us 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.569
 work out and there we have to turn 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.569
 stay
