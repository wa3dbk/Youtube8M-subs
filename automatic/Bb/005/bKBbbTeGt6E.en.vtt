00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.310
 such a method is longer compared 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.859
 cattle however the results obtained with 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.080
 This is much higher and not lost from 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.389
 time since based on 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.639
 natural movements of this student 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.060
 they died two three centuries ago 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.529
 masters 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.050
 so in ninjutsu you can't say that 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.490
 this or that method is performed exactly 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.920
 nothing else 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.609
 because it all depends on personal qualities 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.230
 and student abilities 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.480
 rational system 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.149
 economical and efficient approach to 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.210
 performing techniques works per person 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.100
 which uses it as a tool for 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.790
 maximum disclosure of their 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.790
 of opportunities 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.180
 cat demonstrated in the film 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.610
 are a form of a certain spiritual 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.500
 state of mind 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.640
 from which physical movements flow 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.920
 ninja they are also only principles 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.750
 they are programs of physical movements and 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.700
 relate rather tactical 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.730
 interaction with opponents than 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.770
 the technical side of the matter than when 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.290
 each situation beat where 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.000
 turns and so on that is inherent 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.410
 all formal exercise 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.060
 Far Eastern martial arts besides 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:29.900
 the three main to then the chickens hatch 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.070
 there are many other cats 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.800
 unifying groups of receptions 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.090
 similar in meaning and performance to what 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.330
 some but cat 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.080
 and also perform them from a certain 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.170
 positions 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.750
 winter call from a kiten or something 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.360
 further but they do not have certain 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.400
 decoding the conduct of a duel but only 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.350
 facilitate the memorization process and 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.509
 improving the student in his 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.490
 surveys and bringing movements to 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.300
 automatism such a training method 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.340
 allowed only at an early stage 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.740
 learning when in the mind of a student 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.259
 there is a change in thinking patterns in 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.069
 rationality side of efficiency and 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.300
 effectiveness of movements ethics then how 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.400
 scales in music 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.350
 they create a solid foundation for 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.000
 who will later perform any 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.000
 melodies and improvisations 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.110
 the screen shows advanced 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.000
 practice those no one todor or work 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.510
 unarmed vs armed 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.510
 adversary 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.720
 when working against armed 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:24.520
 the opponent is very important 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:28.150
 control weapons and skill quickly and 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:32.100
 naturally go to work 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.100
 directly weapon 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.890
 equipment not working with Anbu
