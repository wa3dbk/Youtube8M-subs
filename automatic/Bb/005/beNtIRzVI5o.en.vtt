00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.410 

this<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.230> probably<00:00:22.470> my<00:00:22.949> favorite<00:00:23.029> live<00:00:24.029> I

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
this is probably my favorite live I

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.859 
this is probably my favorite live I
don't<00:00:25.050> know<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.350> kind<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.590> hard<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.830> say<00:00:26.869> this

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
don't know it's kind of hard to say this

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.839 
don't know it's kind of hard to say this
is<00:00:28.109> generally<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.680> longest<00:00:29.279> level<00:00:29.640> although

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
is generally the longest level although

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.870 
is generally the longest level although
I<00:00:30.000> stretched<00:00:30.449> some<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.810> other<00:00:30.929> levels<00:00:31.349> out

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
I stretched some of the other levels out

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.950 
I stretched some of the other levels out
to<00:00:32.880> where<00:00:33.030> they're<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> little<00:00:33.450> bit<00:00:33.660> longer

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.389 

basically<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.110> key<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.530> already<00:00:37.890> right<00:00:38.129> here

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
basically the key is already right here

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.619 
basically the key is already right here
in<00:00:39.739> that<00:00:40.739> little<00:00:41.070> Kate<00:00:41.700> glass<00:00:42.090> case<00:00:42.390> right

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
in that little Kate glass case right

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.990 
in that little Kate glass case right
there<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.440> kind<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.890> see<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.370> didn't

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
there you can kind of see it I didn't

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.610 
there you can kind of see it I didn't
really<00:00:45.120> stop<00:00:45.420> long<00:00:45.629> enough<00:00:45.660> for<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.140> but

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
car if you didn't notice that I got the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.010 
car if you didn't notice that I got the
first<00:00:53.699> clue<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:55.190> falls<00:00:56.190> off<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.989> side<00:00:57.989> of

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
first clue on it falls off the side of

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.260 
first clue on it falls off the side of
the<00:00:58.199> building<00:00:58.320> pretty<00:00:58.890> quickly<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.460> don't

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
the building pretty quickly so don't

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.189 
the building pretty quickly so don't
lollygag<00:01:00.930> around<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.800> it

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.260 

okay<00:01:04.829> now<00:01:05.009> you<00:01:05.070> can<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> key<00:01:05.969> in<00:01:06.149> there

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
okay now you can see the key in there

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:22.350 
okay now you can see the key in there
pretty<00:01:06.420> clearly

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.830 

that<00:01:23.360> seems<00:01:23.780> like<00:01:24.050> it<00:01:24.260> might<00:01:24.470> work<00:01:25.750> but<00:01:26.750> of

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
that seems like it might work but of

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.990 
that seems like it might work but of
course<00:01:27.050> we<00:01:27.110> have<00:01:27.229> to<00:01:27.290> go<00:01:27.380> all<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:27.880> way<00:01:28.880> around

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000
