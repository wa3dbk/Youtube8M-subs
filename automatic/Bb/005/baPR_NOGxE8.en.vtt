on what we learn in a lot of the
previous<00:01:12.180> tutorials<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.909> first<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:15.119> for

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
previous tutorials so first up for

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.420 
previous tutorials so first up for
opening<00:01:15.930> blender<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.590> our<00:01:16.740> default<00:01:17.100> cube

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
opening blender we have our default cube

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.190 
opening blender we have our default cube
which<00:01:17.790> we're<00:01:18.090> going<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.360> delete<00:01:18.600> today<00:01:18.900> by

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
which we're going to delete today by

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.770 
which we're going to delete today by
hitting<00:01:19.500> X<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.159> then<00:01:20.820> clicking<00:01:21.390> or<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
hitting X and then clicking or a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.410 
hitting X and then clicking or a
selected<00:01:22.229> objects<00:01:22.939> and<00:01:23.939> we're<00:01:24.090> going<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
selected objects and we're going to the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.149 
selected objects and we're going to the
space<00:01:24.750> add<00:01:25.280> mesh<00:01:26.280> plane<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.590> gives<00:01:28.920> us<00:01:29.130> a

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
space add mesh plane so this gives us a

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.580 
space add mesh plane so this gives us a
little<00:01:29.369> bit<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> ground<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.600> put<00:01:31.350> our

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
little bit of a ground to put our

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.450 
little bit of a ground to put our
objects<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.670> hit<00:01:33.600> tab<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.680> hit<00:01:34.920> s<00:01:35.540> then<00:01:36.540> hit<00:01:36.780> 5

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
objects on hit tab and hit s then hit 5

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.350 
objects on hit tab and hit s then hit 5
this<00:01:38.689> using<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.720> s4<00:01:40.439> size<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.159> hitting<00:01:42.030> five

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
this using the s4 size and hitting five

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.179 
this using the s4 size and hitting five
you're<00:01:42.869> making<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.350> five<00:01:43.500> times<00:01:43.740> bigger<00:01:44.040> than

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
you're making it five times bigger than

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.510 
you're making it five times bigger than
it<00:01:44.490> originally<00:01:44.700> was<00:01:45.649> so<00:01:46.649> then<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.490> just

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
it originally was so then we can just

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.960 
it originally was so then we can just
click<00:01:47.970> from<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:50.369> now<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> little

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
click from that so now we have a little

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.399 
click from that so now we have a little
ground<00:01:51.149> here<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:52.649> go<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.860> top<00:01:53.159> view<00:01:54.049> space<00:01:55.049> add

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
ground here and go to top view space add

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.469 
ground here and go to top view space add
mesh<00:01:56.030> UV<00:01:57.030> sphere<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:58.460> if<00:01:59.460> it's<00:01:59.909> not<00:02:00.000> at<00:02:00.270> these

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
mesh UV sphere and if it's not at these

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.929 
mesh UV sphere and if it's not at these
default<00:02:01.020> settings<00:02:01.409> right<00:02:01.619> here<00:02:01.729> you<00:02:02.729> can

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
default settings right here you can

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.120 
default settings right here you can
change<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.360> by<00:02:03.509> clicking<00:02:03.719> these<00:02:04.049> arrows<00:02:04.860> so

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
change it by clicking these arrows so

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.789 
change it by clicking these arrows so
just<00:02:05.340> get<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.909> what<00:02:06.719> i<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.899> here<00:02:07.290> segments

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
just get it to what i have here segments

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.050 
just get it to what i have here segments
are<00:02:07.950> two<00:02:08.239> rings<00:02:09.619> 32<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.860> radius<00:02:11.580> 1

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
are two rings 32 and radius 1

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.809 
are two rings 32 and radius 1
and<00:02:13.180> then<00:02:13.420> hit<00:02:13.599> ok<00:02:14.130> so<00:02:15.130> now<00:02:15.220> we<00:02:15.340> have<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.489> little

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
and then hit ok so now we have a little

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.890 
and then hit ok so now we have a little
sphere<00:02:16.209> here<00:02:16.510> we<00:02:17.470> hit<00:02:17.620> tab<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.660> then<00:02:19.660> we're

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
sphere here we hit tab and then we're

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.550 
sphere here we hit tab and then we're
going<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.319> hit<00:02:20.560> g<00:02:20.950> +<00:02:21.660> Z<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.690> move<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.319> along<00:02:23.410> the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
going to hit g + Z to move it along the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.949 
going to hit g + Z to move it along the
z<00:02:23.860> axis<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:26.040> we<00:02:27.040> are<00:02:27.280> going<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.700> hit<00:02:27.970> one<00:02:28.450> to

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
z axis and we are going to hit one to

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.420 
z axis and we are going to hit one to
move<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.430> one<00:02:30.430> complete<00:02:30.940> object<00:02:31.420> up<00:02:32.310> let's<00:02:33.310> see

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
move it one complete object up let's see

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.670 
move it one complete object up let's see
how<00:02:33.519> it's<00:02:33.640> very<00:02:33.910> early<00:02:34.000> Mustang<00:02:34.390> on<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:35.440> plane

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
how it's very early Mustang on the plane

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.370 
how it's very early Mustang on the plane
there<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:37.480> now<00:02:37.599> we're<00:02:37.780> going<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.959> go<00:02:38.019> into<00:02:38.260> the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
there so now we're going to go into the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.250 
there so now we're going to go into the
top<00:02:38.560> view<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.360> we're<00:02:40.360> going<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.540> move<00:02:40.720> hit<00:02:41.140> the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
top view and we're going to move hit the

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.559 
top view and we're going to move hit the
G<00:02:41.440> key<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:41.769> move<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:42.010> up<00:02:42.160> just<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.940> little<00:02:43.239> bit

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
G key and move it up just a little bit

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.890 
G key and move it up just a little bit
to<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.900> side<00:02:44.170> now<00:02:44.819> that<00:02:45.819> we<00:02:46.150> have<00:02:46.180> this<00:02:46.569> in<00:02:46.810> the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
to the side now that we have this in the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.280 
to the side now that we have this in the
right<00:02:47.140> place<00:02:47.580> we're<00:02:48.580> going<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:49.030> hit<00:02:49.239> shift<00:02:49.959> D

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
right place we're going to hit shift D

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.180 
right place we're going to hit shift D
and<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:52.330> automatically<00:02:53.110> uses<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.739> crop<00:02:53.980> tool

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
and it automatically uses the crop tool

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.820 
and it automatically uses the crop tool
and<00:02:54.519> we're<00:02:54.819> going<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.030> move<00:02:55.239> it<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:56.350> it's<00:02:56.500> just

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
and we're going to move it so it's just

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.789 
and we're going to move it so it's just
touching<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:58.410> edge<00:02:59.410> of<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:01.000> other<00:03:01.330> sphere<00:03:01.840> so

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
touching the edge of the other sphere so

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.070 
touching the edge of the other sphere so
now<00:03:03.459> we<00:03:03.519> have<00:03:03.670> two<00:03:03.790> spheres<00:03:04.420> right<00:03:04.750> next<00:03:04.989> to

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
now we have two spheres right next to

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.410 
now we have two spheres right next to
each<00:03:05.140> other<00:03:05.370> then<00:03:06.370> we're<00:03:06.489> going<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:06.640> hit<00:03:07.090> shift

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
each other then we're going to hit shift

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.850 
each other then we're going to hit shift
D<00:03:07.690> again<00:03:09.090> I'm<00:03:10.090> going<00:03:10.269> to<00:03:10.360> move<00:03:10.480> this<00:03:10.780> one<00:03:11.110> up<00:03:11.319> to

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
D again I'm going to move this one up to

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.500 
D again I'm going to move this one up to
the<00:03:11.980> top<00:03:13.049> so<00:03:14.049> there's<00:03:14.230> sort<00:03:14.349> of<00:03:14.470> like<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.650> stack

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
the top so there's sort of like a stack

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.979 
the top so there's sort of like a stack
so<00:03:16.510> now<00:03:16.660> we<00:03:17.230> should<00:03:17.290> have<00:03:17.700> repeaters<00:03:18.989> just

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
so now we should have repeaters just

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.759 
so now we should have repeaters just
barely<00:03:20.440> touching<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:22.950> plane<00:03:25.260> all<00:03:26.260> right<00:03:26.620> next

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
barely touching the plane all right next

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.979 
barely touching the plane all right next
to<00:03:26.980> each<00:03:27.040> other<00:03:27.930> now<00:03:29.190> we're<00:03:30.190> going<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.579> go<00:03:30.989> to

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
to each other now we're going to go to

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.380 
to each other now we're going to go to
front<00:03:32.260> view<00:03:33.390> hit<00:03:34.390> shifty<00:03:35.730> go<00:03:36.730> all<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:37.030> way<00:03:37.060> up

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
front view hit shifty go all the way up

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.430 
front view hit shifty go all the way up
and<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:39.730> it's<00:03:39.910> just<00:03:40.090> barely<00:03:40.390> touching<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:40.959> top

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
and so it's just barely touching the top

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.150 
and so it's just barely touching the top
of<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:42.510> let's<00:03:43.510> fear<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.709> we're<00:03:44.889> going<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.040> go

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
of the let's fear and we're going to go

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.150 
of the let's fear and we're going to go
back<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.370> top<00:03:45.670> view<00:03:46.319> move<00:03:47.319> this<00:03:47.650> over<00:03:47.859> in<00:03:48.100> the

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
back to top view move this over in the

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.650 
back to top view move this over in the
middle<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:50.410> if<00:03:50.560> we<00:03:50.620> go<00:03:50.829> to<00:03:50.889> view<00:03:51.450> camera<00:03:52.450> or

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
middle so if we go to view camera or

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.180 
middle so if we go to view camera or
numpad<00:03:53.200> zero<00:03:53.489> we<00:03:54.489> should<00:03:54.760> see<00:03:55.410> four<00:03:56.410> Spears

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
numpad zero we should see four Spears

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.539 
numpad zero we should see four Spears
all<00:03:57.970> close<00:03:58.389> to<00:03:58.569> each<00:03:58.660> other<00:03:58.810> and<00:03:59.160> from<00:04:00.160> here

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
I'm going to hit G and I'm going to move

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.849 
I'm going to hit G and I'm going to move
it<00:04:05.139> down<00:04:06.180> sits<00:04:07.180> in<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.630> center<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.139> then<00:04:08.470> left

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
it down sits in the center and then left

it down sits in the center and then left
click<00:04:09.030> so<00:04:10.030> now<00:04:10.150> we<00:04:10.209> got<00:04:10.480> a<00:04:10.510> little<00:04:10.870> stack<00:04:11.230> here

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
click so now we got a little stack here

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.779 
click so now we got a little stack here
so<00:04:14.319> from<00:04:15.280> this<00:04:15.690> I'm<00:04:16.690> going<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:16.989> go<00:04:17.310> hit<00:04:18.310> front

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
so from this I'm going to go hit front

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:24.450 
so from this I'm going to go hit front
or<00:04:19.229> sorry<00:04:20.229> top<00:04:21.780> select<00:04:22.780> all<00:04:23.110> of<00:04:23.169> these<00:04:23.680> holding

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.069 
so all of them are selected and then I

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.770 
so all of them are selected and then I
can<00:04:34.460> move<00:04:34.490> them<00:04:34.789> with<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.030> G<00:04:35.240> key<00:04:35.449> a<00:04:35.479> little

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
can move them with the G key a little

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.830 
can move them with the G key a little
bit<00:04:35.900> more<00:04:36.199> closer<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:36.919> the<00:04:37.009> camera<00:04:37.220> and<00:04:37.840> left

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
bit more closer to the camera and left

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.469 
bit more closer to the camera and left
like<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:39.229> list<00:04:39.380> of<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:39.590> camera<00:04:39.889> right<00:04:40.039> here

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
like and list of the camera right here

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.640 
like and list of the camera right here
so<00:04:41.479> we<00:04:41.599> can<00:04:41.720> see<00:04:41.930> everything<00:04:42.289> a<00:04:42.319> little<00:04:42.560> bit

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
so we can see everything a little bit

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.670 
so we can see everything a little bit
better<00:04:43.090> hit<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.120> G<00:04:44.389> key<00:04:44.569> again<00:04:44.840> move<00:04:45.410> over<00:04:45.440> to

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
better hit the G key again move over to

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.059 
better hit the G key again move over to
the<00:04:45.919> right<00:04:47.289> you<00:04:48.289> can<00:04:48.410> see<00:04:48.440> it<00:04:48.710> a<00:04:48.770> little<00:04:48.860> bit

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 
the right you can see it a little bit

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:56.730 
the right you can see it a little bit
better<00:04:51.069> go<00:04:52.069> to<00:04:52.130> front<00:04:52.520> view<00:04:53.349> hit<00:04:54.349> the<00:04:55.000> Z<00:04:56.000> key

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
better go to front view hit the Z key

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.439 
better go to front view hit the Z key
and<00:04:57.740> hit<00:04:57.949> G<00:04:58.310> we're<00:04:58.639> going<00:04:58.669> up<00:04:58.970> a<00:04:59.000> little<00:04:59.300> better

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
and hit G we're going up a little better

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:00.850 
and hit G we're going up a little better
so<00:04:59.690> they're<00:04:59.840> just<00:04:59.960> touching<00:05:00.410> that<00:05:00.560> plane
