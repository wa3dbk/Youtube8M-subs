effects from traveling from the USA

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.770 
effects from traveling from the USA
because<00:02:48.829> it<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.129> very<00:02:49.370> very<00:02:49.790> soft<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.480> very

thin<00:02:51.560> but<00:02:51.799> maybe<00:02:52.010> that's<00:02:52.280> myth<00:02:52.430> how<00:02:52.609> it's

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
thin but maybe that's myth how it's

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.759 
thin but maybe that's myth how it's
meant<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.000> be<00:02:53.109> is<00:02:54.670> Laffy<00:02:55.670> Taffy<00:02:56.769> cherry
