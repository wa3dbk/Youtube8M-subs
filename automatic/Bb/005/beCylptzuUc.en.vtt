 san marcos 12 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.470
 he began to speak to them in parables 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.599
 a man raised a bikini 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:10.959
 he surrounded them 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:14.099
 random kaboul and built a tower to watch everything 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.470
 dulko leased the vineyard to some farmers and went on a trip 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.220
 at the time of the harvest he sent a deer to the farmers to receive from them 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.619
 a part of the fruit of the pepper 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.509
 but they grabbed him 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.509
 they beat him and they fired him empty-handed 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.749
 he sent another one to this 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:37.730
 they beat him on the head and humiliated him 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.120
 he kept another 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.920
 and he was killed 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.470
 he kept others many others beat them others killed them 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.090
 he still had one year left 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.860
 a beloved son 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.780
 by last 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.110
 he sent it to him 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.600
 thinking 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.790
 will respect my son 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.840
 but the farmers told each other 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.160
 this is the heir 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.130
 we go 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.070
 let's kill lori the inheritance will be our 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.100
 so they grabbed him and killed him and threw him out of the piÃ±ero 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.380
 the ankle of the pepper will remain 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.230
 To return to 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.720
 and kill those farmers and give the vineyard to others 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.570
 you have not read this script 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.430
 the stone that the builders rejected has become stone 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.370
 angular 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.670
 this gentleman is the one who has done it 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.670
 and it is wonderful to our eyes 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.420
 they were looking for a way to arrest him 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.900
 because they knew that he had told the parable against them 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.820
 but also to the crowd 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.290
 so they left him and they left 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.210
 then some of the Pharisees and the Herodians were sent to Jesus 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.210
 to set a trap with his same words 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.840
 and they told him when he arrived 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.230
 teacher 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.640
 we know that you are a straight man 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.070
 do not let yourself be influenced by men because you do not notice their appearance 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.979
 but it teaches is the way of God according to the truth is well to pay 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.820
 taxes to Caesar good 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.910
 we owe or we should pay min but knowing Jesus their hypocrisy them 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.370
 I answer no 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.170
 because it tends a trap min bring me one of the nation to see it 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.439
 they took him to the currency in chile dickinson asked himself this image and this 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:32.319
 inscription of cesar then dl to the caesar what is of the caesar and here I 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.510
 I know what is of God 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.670
 and they were admired of him 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.780
 Many museums say there is no resurrection 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.379
 they approached him and presented him with the following problem 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.499
 our 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:49.989
 today being his name was written that if a man's brother dies and they leave 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.389
 widows and old 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.789
 the man has to marry the widow and bear children to his brother 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:56.819
 However 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.409
 there were seven brothers of the first one married today he died without leaving children the 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.089
 second he married the widow but he also died without leaving children 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:08.839
 the same thing happened to the third 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:09.829
 anyway 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:15.289
 none of the seven left children last the woman also died 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:20.279
 in the ecuador resurrection will be responsible the judge the seven were 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:22.539
 married to her 

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:26.499
 you are not in error precisely because you do not know the 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:29.229
 scriptures nor the power of god 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:32.249
 When the dead are resurrected in Haiti, they will marry 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:34.369
 nor will they be data in marriage 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:37.369
 but they will be like the angels who are in heaven 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:43.379
 as for the dead resurrected have not read in the book of Moses 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.260
 in the passage about the sauce 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.419
 as god told him 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.449
 I am the god of abraham 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:53.929
 the god of isaac and the god of jacob he is not the god of the dead 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.159
 but of alive 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.159
 you are very wrong 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.630
 one of the teachers of the law 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.459
 he approached and discussed his 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.759
 Seeing how well Jesus had answered them he asked 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.309
 the one of all the commandments 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:18.439
 Which is the most important 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:20.299
 the most important 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.559
 a cushion 

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:25.740
 the Lord our God the Lord is one 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.770
 obama to the Lord your god with all your heart 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.650
 with all your soul with all your mind and with all your strength 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.419
 the second is 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.830
 Love your neighbor as yourself 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.339
 there is no more important commandment that you studied 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:48.809
 biendicho teacher you're right to say that god is a god that there is no other 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:50.650
 besides it 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.720
 the bitter with all the heart with everything to the understanding and with all the forces 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.669
 and love your neighbor as yourself 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.240
 It is more important than all those summoned and sacrifices 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.789
 you are not far from the kingdom of God 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.279
 and since then he has not even dared to ask him any more questions 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:14.740
 while teaching in the temple courts Jesus said 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.870
 how is it that the teachers of the law say that the christ is the son of david 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.349
 David himself speaking for the holy spirit sin 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:29.729
 Mut said the Lord has designed percent this year and grow 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.729
 until I put your enemies under your feet 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.039
 David himself calls him Mr. 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:41.349
 then how can your son be the huge crowd 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.830
 combustion cars 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.809
 in his teaching Jesus said 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:49.680
 beware of the teachers of the law 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.540
 They love to walk around with long clothes and to greet him in the squares and to occupy 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.400
 the main seats in the synagogues and the places of honor in the 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.800
 banquets 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.129
 They devour widows' houses and for appearances make long prayers to 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:08.129
 these will be punished very severely 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.559
 Jesus sat in front of the place where the offerings were deposited 

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:17.569
 and watched the people who call their coins in the temple treasury 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.449
 many rich people threw large amounts 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:25.270
 but a poor widow of ccoo and made two municipalities of copper 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.529
 of very little value 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:30.189
 let's destroy his disciples and he told them 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:34.459
 I assure you that this poor diet has thrown into the treasury more than in all 

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:37.459
 the min themes these gave of their wealth 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.850
 but she 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.150
 of your poverty 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.139
 said everything I had 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:43.389
 all your sustenance
