 hello youtube friends how is it so good 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.599
 this time I bring you a tweet 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.250
 called strike and good what we 

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:09.630
 allows to perform this tic is to be able 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.330
 unlock our device with 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.010
 some gesture that we can draw 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.039
 and then show a little bit of what 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.900
 about this tick 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.650
 for example right now I'm going to unlock 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.650
 my device 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.880
 and he's going to ask me to draw what is my 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:30.180
 password and right now I have a kind 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.430
 like type b to be able to unlock it 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.580
 now that it's pretty good I hope that 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.320
 please them well before continuing 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.850
 they showed this style that I'm going to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.410
 show how to download what we have 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.570
 what to do is to be a quickly to Syria 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.920
 we have to load they have to mention 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.210
 that this trick is only compatible 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.840
 with the year 5.0 or higher this wants 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.660
 say it 's for iphone 4 iphone 4s 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.699
 iphone 3gs sorry and ipod touch fourth 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.530
 generation in these years is not 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.180
 compatible with ipad as you realize 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.070
 well we will not go to the search part 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.960
 and we will search by the name of strike 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.399
 then account repo derai hardware 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.500
 that you already have to download it for free 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.149
 or if they like to buy it in the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.370
 Repository of centers has a price of 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.860
 2.99 dollars 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.390
 and well the state is not going to 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.100
 he will perform a rebound 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.650
 device and we are added a 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.010
 tab in what is settings 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.930
 with the name of strike we have to go to 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.270
 those tabs to be able to enable this 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.710
 tweet now that it's pretty good I for 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.390
 that I decided to bring them is a 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.520
 very good alternative what a lot is a 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.439
 what all those types of clicks 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.320
 at least for a change and so good here 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.030
 we will enable it to enable straits and 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.850
 here it tells us if we want to jump in the 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.740
 part of where we introduce our gdp 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.390
 well this means that you 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.409
 you use what is blocking 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.880
 with code we can skip that part by 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.250
 example, I have it activated right now 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.789
 And now he's going to ask me to draw my 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.789
 password 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.180
 and he's going to tell me to enter my code 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.910
 or if they just want it 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.869
 who uses what is the code 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.869
 You can also draw it 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.430
 they rehabilitated and their word that is 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.080
 pretty good I hope you like your 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.849
 I wait for you 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.269
 as I said is something something 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.269
 interesting 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.459
 for example or as I told them if 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.579
 they want to use the blockade with 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.400
 code if they want to change their 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:40.849
 password here you have to draw 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.590
 and follow the steps because I hope that you 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.069

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.690

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.239
