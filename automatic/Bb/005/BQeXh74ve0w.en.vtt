00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.990
 install formula 1 2012 for fish 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:21.110
 good what but what they have to do is 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.110
 the vision of the video that is this 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:29.329
 they give you to download tower for this they must 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.220
 have two programs the torrent and the die 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.290
 montull 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.600
 I will also leave the link in the 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.370
 description of the video for 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.640
 to download those programs that 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.219
 they need to be able to install this game 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.430
 good here we will look like this you guys 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.800
 going to 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.680
 that is to say open with towers you are going to 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.440
 to accept 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.989
 It is expensive 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.350
 this appears to me because I already 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.690
 I have therefore sovereign and you 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.730
 will appear where they want to save it and 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.519
 select the folder and ready already 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.020
 can save the download lasts 15 hours 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.700
 depending on the speed of your 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.700
 internet I liked that 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.650
 so 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.560
 once the download is complete 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.409
 torrent let's go to the folder 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.650
 for a right click open folder 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.300
 container continue 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.300
 and good here it will appear 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.110
 53 rar file 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.770
 what they have to do is right click 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.340
 extract here in part 1 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.759
 I take this because I already have it 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.930
 last about 5 minutes what 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.710
 you will see 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.580
 they take and compress this 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.580
 the image made 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.110
 once decompressed we go to another damon 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.110
 tools 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.770
 because they have a free device for 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.880
 Right click to mount 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.880
 and look for the image 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.810
 and one is mounted the image is not going to 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.810
 appear the following 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.610

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.370
