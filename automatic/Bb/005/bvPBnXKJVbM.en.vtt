 still available on cydia I dressed a 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.969
 new tweak made by pg galdi 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.910
 then we have already seen the boys on 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.130
 our site this is suit it is 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.890
 of an interesting tweak that allows you to 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.340
 manage wifi exactly as it happens on 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.920
 mac 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.629
 if you have or 10 if you have tried one 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.090
 any mac you know that pressing 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.370
 one appears on the wifi icon 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.129
 window in the menu and it is possible to 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.080
 connect to various networks modify 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.910
 connections etcetera 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.370
 this on iphone as we know it is not 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.470
 possible without jailbreak and without 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.620
 this tweak you need to go into 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.409
 wifi settings and interact from here 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.690
 with our networks while precisely thanks 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.729
 in vestivo we could set up an action 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.400
 of activator in this case chosen the 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.920
 double tap on the clock in the bar 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.290
 been and we can manage all from here 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.810
 these settings we can clearly 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.130
 disable the wifi or activate the 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.320
 depending on the case 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.720
 then we have our own wifi networks 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.119
 are displayed including the one a 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.820
 which we are connected that clearly comes 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.049
 displayed in blue as we have seen 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.430
 dressed also this interesting 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.439
 functionality that allows us to 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.439
 display lots of information 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.880
 on the wi fi networks selected in this 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.369
 case we are displaying the type of 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.329
 safety the channel the intensity of the 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.850
 signal 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.329
 mac address other information 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.270
 in short, on this extra network then 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.700
 clearly the tweak by pressing on the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.700
 in the car that now I don't show you why 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.179
 I'll explain it allows you to make 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.219
 see the passwords of the wifi networks to which 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.859
 therefore we have recently connected 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:03.499
 by pressing on that i have access to 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:05.810
 all our network history 

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:07.429
 recent with lots of passwords 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.280
 then in any section of the tweak 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.960
 we can copy the name of a network into 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.960
 this way a function that can come back 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.630
 very useful in some cases and paste it 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.640
 in any other text field for 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.319
 in short, to do what we must do well 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.330
