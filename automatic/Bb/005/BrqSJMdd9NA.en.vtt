00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
pretty thick I think it measures a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.429 
pretty thick I think it measures a
little<00:00:27.240> over<00:00:27.720> 15<00:00:28.109> millimeters<00:00:28.619> thick<00:00:30.320> got<00:00:31.320> the

Breitling<00:00:37.829> logo<00:00:38.840> there<00:00:39.840> we<00:00:40.020> go<00:00:40.200> I'll<00:00:40.350> see<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.710> I

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
Breitling logo there we go I'll see if I

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.360 
Breitling logo there we go I'll see if I
can<00:00:41.010> actually<00:00:41.940> get<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.809> focus<00:00:43.140> there

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.410 

there<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.610> go<00:00:49.520> now<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.550> don't<00:00:50.670> know<00:00:50.940> why<00:00:51.180> that's

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
there we go now I don't know why that's

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.900 
there we go now I don't know why that's
there<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:52.020> could<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.379> maybe<00:00:52.730> to<00:00:53.730> prevent

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
there it could be maybe to prevent

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.400 
there it could be maybe to prevent
forgeries<00:00:54.629> but<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.620> seen<00:00:56.690> fakes<00:00:57.690> with

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
forgeries but I have seen fakes with

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.130 
forgeries but I have seen fakes with
that<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:58.980> there<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.609> guess<00:00:59.850> maybe<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.930> not

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
that on there so I guess maybe it's not

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.530 
that on there so I guess maybe it's not
working<00:01:01.500> out<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.770> well<00:01:04.280> this<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
working out that well this is a

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.770 
working out that well this is a
unidirectional<00:01:06.540> rotating<00:01:07.500> bezel<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.630> like

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
unidirectional rotating bezel and I like

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.149 
unidirectional rotating bezel and I like
it<00:01:09.869> because<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.439> got<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> pretty<00:01:10.979> good

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
it because it's it's got a pretty good

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.789 
it because it's it's got a pretty good
grip<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.880> see<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.420> these<00:01:13.380> little

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
grip and you can see that these little

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.890 
grip and you can see that these little
indicators<00:01:14.490> they're<00:01:14.970> spinning<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.689> this

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
indicators they're spinning but this

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.420 
indicators they're spinning but this
other<00:01:16.110> piece<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.409> they're<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.830> top<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.130> is

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
all the circular patterns that you can

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.929

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
an angle I think this is the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.260
