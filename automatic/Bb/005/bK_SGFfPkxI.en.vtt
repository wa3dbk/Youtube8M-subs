00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.380
 good morning, my name is Ivan DarÃ­o 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.250
 salgado today I will tell you how 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.700
 make the shoes and we start with the 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.910
 designs the supplier gives us the designs 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.550
 what we want us to do then 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.000
 we 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.010
 We are going to use a standard according to 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.010
 design that we are going to require 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.149
 in these folders there is a design 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.790
 different with its respective reference and 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.730
 his pieces to cut the material 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.170
 porous each one in particular can be 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.230
 this reference written with the sweet 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.110
 temptation 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.690
 then we look for all the pieces that 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.780
 correspond to the same number of 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.370
 sizes we are going to select a material 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.760
 let us cut 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.300
 the next shoe 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.130
 it can be this stamp we're going to look 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.580
 how to make the most of 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.400
 material 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.400
 shorten us we know what 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.800
 is a pair for each piece that we cut 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.740
 depending on the design 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.869
 and the shoe 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.010
 This is a design for a shoe 5 and 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.120
 medium for an endless height of the shoe 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.990
 as for offices 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.009
 and it is a very comfortable height 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.490
 and then we have the front part 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.890
 then we proceed to apply a 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.509
 glue to make the folds in the 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.280
 edges let's do a process of 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.799
 bent to hold us 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.179
 while we do the sewing then 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.820
 as we know we have the pieces 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.039
 cut and then we have applied the 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.530
 We are going to proceed to make a 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.509
 reinforcement in the mouths of the shoe for 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.269
 have good resistance and do not miss us 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.450
 bust and this is the crap that the 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.450
 We use to reinforce the shoe 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.790
 that on the edges 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.250
 it's on the back so it's 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.680
 part we should stay is the part 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.230
 front as you are going to see the shoe is a 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.080
 important to do it so that the edges 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.220
 of the shoe that in aesthetic and at the same time and 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.220
 do not mistreat the foot 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.890
 and at this moment we have ready the 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.579
 shoe to assemble it on the mold 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.000
 that we had already said he faces with his 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.000
 1st 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.319
 well then we have this 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.800
 finished then we are going to others 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:04.450
 designs so that we have a clear idea 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.450
 how are we going to get the shoes 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.390
 I say
