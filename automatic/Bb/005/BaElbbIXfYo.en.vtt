00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.310 
Europeans go to the USA and the American
player<00:02:34.709> come<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.190> Europe<00:02:35.459> for<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.940> rivalry<00:02:36.450> so

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
player come to Europe for the rivalry so

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.320 
player come to Europe for the rivalry so
we<00:02:37.650> will<00:02:37.770> get<00:02:37.950> more<00:02:38.160> attendance<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:39.030> each

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
we will get more attendance on each

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.690 
we will get more attendance on each
events<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.020> it's<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.620> think<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:41.459> better

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
events and it's I think it's better

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.550 
events and it's I think it's better
because<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.390> learn<00:02:42.570> a<00:02:42.600> lot<00:02:42.720> if<00:02:42.990> you<00:02:43.080> go<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.290> use

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
because you learn a lot if you go to use

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.920 
because you learn a lot if you go to use
a<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:43.980> you're<00:02:44.130> not<00:02:44.580> if<00:02:44.760> we<00:02:44.850> go<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.150> Europe<00:02:45.450> this

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:15.219 
why Billy bring I know that it doesn't

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.240 
why Billy bring I know that it doesn't
cheat<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.969> is<00:03:16.090> pretty<00:03:16.359> good<00:03:16.599> so<00:03:17.260> also<00:03:17.920> most

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
cheat and it is pretty good so also most

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.979 
cheat and it is pretty good so also most
Americans<00:03:18.730> cheat<00:03:18.939> I<00:03:18.969> guess<00:03:19.299> that's<00:03:19.840> what

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
Americans cheat I guess that's what

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.869 
Americans cheat I guess that's what
you're<00:03:20.139> implying<00:03:20.200> on<00:03:20.709> from<00:03:21.430> what<00:03:21.579> you'll<00:03:21.730> hear

lot of advice you can give like play

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.420 
lot of advice you can give like play
dancing<00:03:53.389> a<00:03:53.480> lot<00:03:53.629> reading<00:03:54.379> coverages<00:03:54.680> with<00:03:55.340> in

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
dancing a lot reading coverages with in

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.869 
dancing a lot reading coverages with in
future<00:03:55.760> matches<00:03:56.439> but<00:03:57.439> I<00:03:57.859> think<00:03:58.430> that<00:03:58.579> only

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
future matches but I think that only

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.780 
future matches but I think that only
helps<00:03:59.269> a<00:03:59.480> little<00:03:59.629> bit<00:04:00.010> most<00:04:01.010> important<00:04:01.459> is<00:04:01.519> if

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
helps a little bit most important is if

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.009 
helps a little bit most important is if
you<00:04:02.030> play<00:04:02.269> against<00:04:02.900> someone<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:03.439> you<00:04:03.530> lose

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
you play against someone and you lose

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.300 
you play against someone and you lose
there<00:04:06.019> are<00:04:06.079> two<00:04:06.169> kinds<00:04:06.439> of<00:04:06.470> times<00:04:06.709> as<00:04:07.099> they

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
there are two kinds of times as they

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.679 
there are two kinds of times as they
want<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.609> have<00:04:07.730> to<00:04:07.819> say<00:04:07.939> okay<00:04:08.329> and<00:04:08.540> lost

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:08.689 
want to have to say okay and lost

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.020 
want to have to say okay and lost

the top tech position for his component

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.689 
the top tech position for his component
