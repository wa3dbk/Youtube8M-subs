find out what it says so I'm going to
basically<00:00:16.590> dump<00:00:16.800> water<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.250> various<00:00:17.699> points

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
basically dump water in various points

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.570 
basically dump water in various points
doesn't<00:00:18.660> really<00:00:18.779> matter<00:00:18.960> where<00:00:19.340> each<00:00:20.340> time<00:00:20.550> I

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
doesn't really matter where each time I

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.370 
doesn't really matter where each time I
do<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.910> I'm<00:00:21.000> going<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.150> uncover<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.779> new<00:00:22.109> letter

almost there
secret<00:00:35.660> that's<00:00:36.660> my<00:00:36.809> secret<00:00:36.989> message<00:00:37.610> so<00:00:38.610> those

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
secret that's my secret message so those

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.139 
secret that's my secret message so those
of<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.629> who<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:40.050> astute<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.760> audience

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
of you who are astute and the audience

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.940 
of you who are astute and the audience
will<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.809> figured<00:00:43.140> out<00:00:43.200> already<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.770> use

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
will have figured out already that I use

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.279 
will have figured out already that I use
still<00:00:44.190> layers<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.520> do<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.989> if<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.110> pack<00:00:46.260> up

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
still layers to do this if you pack up

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.110 
still layers to do this if you pack up
eight<00:00:46.800> snow<00:00:47.190> layers<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.610> looks<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
eight snow layers it looks just like a

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.170 
eight snow layers it looks just like a
snow<00:00:48.329> block<00:00:49.010> but<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.370> different<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.149> that

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
snow block but it's different in that

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.459 
snow block but it's different in that
water<00:00:51.690> will<00:00:53.149> basically<00:00:54.149> snuff<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.960> out<00:00:55.050> it'll

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
water will basically snuff it out it'll

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.680 
water will basically snuff it out it'll
follow<00:00:56.219> right<00:00:56.550> where<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.760> where<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
follow right where that where the the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.660 
follow right where that where the the
snow<00:00:57.899> layer<00:00:58.079> would<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.410> water<00:00:59.340> basically

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
snow layer would be water basically

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.939 
snow layer would be water basically
treats<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.420> were<00:01:00.600> treats<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.410> as<00:01:01.620> if

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
treats as if it were treats it as as if

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.130 
treats as if it were treats it as as if
a<00:01:02.010> rare<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.180> mean<00:01:03.449> that's<00:01:03.510> just<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:03.930> what

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
a rare so I mean that's just like what

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.299 
a rare so I mean that's just like what
it<00:01:04.229> would<00:01:04.379> happen<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:04.830> there<00:01:04.949> was<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> single

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it would happen if there was a single

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.700 
it would happen if there was a single
snow<00:01:05.489> layer<00:01:05.930> and<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.290> that's<00:01:07.439> what<00:01:07.590> you'd

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
snow layer and you that's what you'd

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.469 
snow layer and you that's what you'd
expect<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.520> also<00:01:08.820> works<00:01:09.150> if<00:01:09.330> they're

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
expect but it also works if they're

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.690 
expect but it also works if they're
eight<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.680> hide<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> message<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.490> snow

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
eight so you can hide a message in snow

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.609 
eight so you can hide a message in snow
like<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.990> very<00:01:12.990> easy<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.560> very<00:01:13.860> quick<00:01:14.610> you

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
like this very easy to do very quick you

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.609 
like this very easy to do very quick you
can<00:01:16.619> also<00:01:16.799> if<00:01:17.280> you'd<00:01:17.460> like<00:01:17.689> in<00:01:18.689> hide<00:01:19.170> entire

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
can also if you'd like in hide entire

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.200 
can also if you'd like in hide entire
structures<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.880> something<00:01:21.090> you

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
structures so if you have something you

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.179 
structures so if you have something you
want<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> hide<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.810> then<00:01:22.259> reveal<00:01:22.530> quickly<00:01:23.009> I

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
want to hide and then reveal quickly I

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.649 
want to hide and then reveal quickly I
can<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:23.880> pour<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> little<00:01:24.180> bit<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.450> water<00:01:24.570> here

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
can just pour a little bit of water here

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.390 
can just pour a little bit of water here
and<00:01:26.090> voila<00:01:27.829> entire<00:01:28.829> structure<00:01:29.280> has<00:01:29.369> been

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
and voila entire structure has been

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.510 
and voila entire structure has been
hidden<00:01:29.909> no<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.479> will<00:01:30.600> find<00:01:30.780> my<00:01:30.900> diamonds

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
hidden no one will find my diamonds

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.640 
hidden no one will find my diamonds
which<00:01:32.520> head<00:01:32.820> had<00:01:33.509> been<00:01:33.560> conspicuously<00:01:34.560> placed

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
which head had been conspicuously placed

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.730 
which head had been conspicuously placed
in<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.189> weird<00:01:35.460> shape<00:01:35.750> but<00:01:36.750> yeah<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.650> a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
in this weird shape but yeah just a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.740 
in this weird shape but yeah just a
quick<00:01:37.890> little<00:01:38.100> little<00:01:38.820> trick<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.299> uh<00:01:39.509> it's

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
quick little little trick it's uh it's

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.840 
quick little little trick it's uh it's
nothing<00:01:39.900> groundbreaking<00:01:40.860> or<00:01:41.310> anything<00:01:41.460> but

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
nothing groundbreaking or anything but

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.580 
nothing groundbreaking or anything but
you<00:01:42.060> might<00:01:42.180> find<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.479> useful<00:01:42.570> or<00:01:43.110> cool<00:01:43.409> or

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
you might find it useful or cool or

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.649 
you might find it useful or cool or
interesting<00:01:44.119> so<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.149> thought<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> show<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.570> to

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
interesting so I thought to show it to

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:59.480 
interesting so I thought to show it to
you<00:01:45.750> about<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.380> thanks<00:01:46.560> for<00:01:46.590> watching
