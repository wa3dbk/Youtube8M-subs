understand the significance of this but

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.660 
understand the significance of this but
it<00:00:45.059> starts<00:00:45.329> off<00:00:45.450> at<00:00:45.570> 0<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.379> then<00:00:47.160> when<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.370> kill

it starts off at 0 and then when I kill
a<00:00:47.940> zombie<00:00:47.969> I'm<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.750> just<00:00:48.870> go<00:00:48.989> ahead<00:00:49.050> and

kill one zombie you're going to notice

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.110 
kill one zombie you're going to notice
right<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.960> go<00:00:52.230> back<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.309> goes<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.730> 99

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
right here I go back and it goes to 99

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.209 
right here I go back and it goes to 99
it<00:00:54.539> makes<00:00:54.719> some<00:00:54.899> sounds<00:00:55.289> when<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.500> resets<00:00:55.920> but

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
it makes some sounds when it resets but

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.410 
it makes some sounds when it resets but
I<00:00:56.250> don't<00:00:56.460> know<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> significance<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.300> Ag

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.930 
I don't know the significance of Ag
resetting<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.469> thought<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.070> was<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.699> let<00:00:59.850> you

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
resetting I thought it was to let you

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.130 
resetting I thought it was to let you
know<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.270> perks<00:01:00.510> were<00:01:00.660> actually<00:01:00.989> being

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
know that the perks were actually being

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.380 
know that the perks were actually being
released<00:01:01.530> because<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.670> other<00:01:02.820> perks<00:01:03.120> are<00:01:03.270> not

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
released because the other perks are not

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.090 
released because the other perks are not
on<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> map<00:01:03.870> yet<00:01:04.140> they<00:01:04.320> also<00:01:04.500> fall<00:01:04.830> from<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
on the map yet they also fall from the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.160 
on the map yet they also fall from the
sky<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.240> doesn't<00:01:06.600> seem<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:07.020> they

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
sky and and it doesn't seem like they

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
action starting on around 29 basically

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.500 
action starting on around 29 basically
it's<00:02:38.010> all<00:02:38.130> around<00:02:38.400> 29<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:38.970> guys<00:02:39.150> can<00:02:39.300> see

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
how to start the trains from the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.800 
how to start the trains from the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
beginning of around to the end of around

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.150 
beginning of around to the end of around
I<00:02:42.959> know<00:02:43.230> that's<00:02:43.470> kind<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.709> important<00:02:44.130> for

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
I know that's kind of important for

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.620 
I know that's kind of important for
myself<00:02:44.580> when<00:02:44.760> I'm<00:02:44.850> watching<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.270> gameplays

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
myself when I'm watching the gameplays

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.940 
myself when I'm watching the gameplays
because<00:02:45.959> when<00:02:46.380> you're<00:02:46.470> watching<00:02:46.590> somebody

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
because when you're watching somebody

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.890 
because when you're watching somebody
just<00:02:47.190> hoard<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.550> bunch<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.820> zombies<00:02:48.150> in<00:02:48.780> the

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
just hoard a bunch of zombies in the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.120 
just hoard a bunch of zombies in the
middle<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.230> round<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.590> doesn't<00:02:49.680> really<00:02:49.920> help

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
middle of a round it doesn't really help

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.979 
middle of a round it doesn't really help
you<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.430> need<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.640> see<00:02:50.820> how<00:02:50.910> it's<00:02:51.090> established

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
you you need to see how it's established

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.509 
you you need to see how it's established
so<00:02:52.140> that's<00:02:52.320> what<00:02:52.470> I'm<00:02:52.560> doing<00:02:52.800> right<00:02:52.920> here<00:02:52.980> this

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
so that's what I'm doing right here this

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.280 
so that's what I'm doing right here this
is<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> train<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.300> run<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.750> this<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:55.080> the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
is a train that I run and this is the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.350 
is a train that I run and this is the
strategy<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.370> what<00:02:56.519> I<00:02:56.550> did<00:02:56.760> for<00:02:56.940> round<00:02:57.120> I

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
strategy this is what I did for round I

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.050 
strategy this is what I did for round I
show<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:57.720> not<00:02:57.959> like<00:02:58.200> round<00:02:58.350> 5<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:59.010> around<00:02:59.220> 30<00:02:59.940> I

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
show you not like round 5 to around 30 I

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.699 
show you not like round 5 to around 30 I
know<00:03:00.239> it's<00:03:00.480> repetitive<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.110> stupid<00:03:01.500> if<00:03:01.590> you

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
know it's repetitive and stupid if you

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.040 
know it's repetitive and stupid if you
guys<00:03:01.830> um<00:03:02.330> for<00:03:03.330> those<00:03:03.390> people<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.780> are<00:03:03.840> like

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
guys um for those people that are like

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.780 
guys um for those people that are like
really<00:03:04.290> hardcore<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.160> can<00:03:05.310> run<00:03:05.519> trains

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
really hardcore and can run trains

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.970 
really hardcore and can run trains
anywhere<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.360> can't<00:03:06.840> do<00:03:06.959> that<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.350> need<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.800> find

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
anywhere I can't do that I need to find

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.920 
anywhere I can't do that I need to find
a<00:03:08.070> formulated<00:03:08.640> method<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.630> stick<00:03:09.900> to

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
a formulated method and and I stick to

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.509 
a formulated method and and I stick to
it<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.769> what<00:03:10.920> ended<00:03:11.160> up<00:03:11.250> working<00:03:11.340> for

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
it and this is what ended up working for

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.400 
it and this is what ended up working for
me<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:12.570> you<00:03:12.660> can<00:03:12.900> see<00:03:13.019> right<00:03:13.140> here<00:03:13.200> I'm<00:03:13.380> just

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
me so you can see right here I'm just

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.660 
me so you can see right here I'm just
running<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:13.950> trains<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.370> zombies

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
running the trains and the zombies

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.759 
running the trains and the zombies
coming<00:03:14.820> out<00:03:14.910> so<00:03:15.030> fast<00:03:15.300> by<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.600> round<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.230> I

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
coming out so fast by this round and I

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.470 
coming out so fast by this round and I
am<00:03:17.010> using<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.370> Claymore<00:03:17.670> strategy<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.239> bit

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
am using the Claymore strategy a bit

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.729 
am using the Claymore strategy a bit
right<00:03:18.780> here<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.019> should<00:03:19.200> show<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.380> guys<00:03:19.560> it

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
right here to should show you guys it

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.740 
right here to should show you guys it
you<00:03:20.519> just<00:03:20.640> throw<00:03:20.850> down<00:03:20.880> some<00:03:21.180> claymores<00:03:21.570> and

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
you just throw down some claymores and

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.289 
you just throw down some claymores and
it<00:03:21.810> kills<00:03:22.019> all<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.560> zombies<00:03:22.920> in<00:03:23.670> a<00:03:23.790> row<00:03:23.970> so

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
it kills all the zombies in a row so

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.789 
it kills all the zombies in a row so
definitely<00:03:25.049> recommend<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.500> checking<00:03:25.680> out

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
definitely recommend you checking out

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.050 
definitely recommend you checking out
that<00:03:25.950> video<00:03:26.070> for<00:03:26.370> me<00:03:26.660> too<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:28.290> do<00:03:28.410> that<00:03:28.590> but

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
that video for me too to do that but

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.370 
that video for me too to do that but
this<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.120> pretty<00:03:30.390> much<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.810> strategy<00:03:31.019> and

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
this is pretty much it the strategy and

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.350 
this is pretty much it the strategy and
I<00:03:31.890> recommend<00:03:32.489> running<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.850> circles<00:03:33.150> in<00:03:33.239> this

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
I recommend running the circles in this

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.949 
I recommend running the circles in this
way<00:03:33.570> because<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:34.650> seems<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.070> be<00:03:35.269> easier<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.480> to

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
way because it seems to be easier to to

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.229 
way because it seems to be easier to to
maneuver<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.829> other<00:03:37.950> thing<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.280> is<00:03:38.489> like<00:03:39.030> if

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
maneuver the other thing is is like if

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.580 
maneuver the other thing is is like if
you<00:03:39.360> twitch<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:39.810> little<00:03:40.019> bit<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.290> left<00:03:40.500> and

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
you twitch a little bit to the left and

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.800 
you twitch a little bit to the left and
right<00:03:40.860> like<00:03:41.519> you'll<00:03:42.299> see<00:03:42.480> me<00:03:42.600> kind<00:03:42.690> of

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
right like you'll see me kind of

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.410 
right like you'll see me kind of
twitching<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.170> little<00:03:43.230> bit<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:44.040> um<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.940> enables

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
twitching a little bit it um it enables

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.300 
twitching a little bit it um it enables
the<00:03:45.540> zombies<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:45.959> follow<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.829> little<00:03:47.190> bit

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
the zombies to follow you a little bit

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.740 
the zombies to follow you a little bit
more<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.700> left<00:03:47.850> or<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.180> little<00:03:48.239> bit<00:03:48.510> more<00:03:48.540> to

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
more to the left or a little bit more to

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.550 
more to the left or a little bit more to
the<00:03:48.840> right<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.079> can<00:03:49.170> see<00:03:49.290> right<00:03:49.380> there<00:03:49.530> I

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
the right you can see right there I

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.930 
the right you can see right there I
twitch<00:03:49.769> left<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.160> then<00:03:50.250> right<00:03:50.280> like<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:50.670> Juke

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
twitch left and then right like a Juke

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.610 
twitch left and then right like a Juke
move<00:03:50.970> like<00:03:51.660> if<00:03:51.810> you're<00:03:51.930> playing<00:03:52.140> football<00:03:52.410> or

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
move like if you're playing football or

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.140 
move like if you're playing football or
basketball<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:53.100> quick<00:03:53.400> little<00:03:53.640> Juke<00:03:53.790> left<00:03:54.030> and

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
basketball a quick little Juke left and

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.539 
basketball a quick little Juke left and
right<00:03:54.299> and<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:55.320> resets<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.890> zombies<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:56.430> they

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
right and it resets the zombies so they

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.759 
right and it resets the zombies so they
kind<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:56.820> fall<00:03:57.030> back<00:03:57.209> in<00:03:57.360> line<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:58.620> can

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
kind of fall back in line and you can

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.080 
kind of fall back in line and you can
tighten<00:03:59.040> up<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.130> circles<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.640> make<00:03:59.790> them<00:03:59.910> fall

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
tighten up the circles to make them fall

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.050 
tighten up the circles to make them fall
in<00:04:00.209> line<00:04:00.360> even<00:04:00.570> even<00:04:01.230> closer<00:04:01.410> together<00:04:01.700> I<00:04:02.700> mean

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
in line even even closer together I mean

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.640 
in line even even closer together I mean
it's<00:04:03.209> pretty<00:04:03.420> it's<00:04:03.720> pretty<00:04:03.810> crazy<00:04:04.200> once<00:04:04.560> you

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
it's pretty it's pretty crazy once you

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.170 
it's pretty it's pretty crazy once you
get<00:04:04.769> a<00:04:04.799> hold<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:05.190> you're<00:04:05.340> like<00:04:05.459> okay<00:04:05.760> this

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
get a hold of it you're like okay this

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.819 
get a hold of it you're like okay this
is<00:04:06.360> how<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.540> train<00:04:06.840> like<00:04:07.110> I'm<00:04:07.530> not<00:04:07.709> really

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
is how to train like I'm not really

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.740 
is how to train like I'm not really
great<00:04:08.130> at<00:04:08.220> training<00:04:08.640> but<00:04:08.820> but<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.150> understand

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
great at training but but I understand

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.660 
great at training but but I understand
that<00:04:09.900> part<00:04:10.140> of<00:04:10.200> it<00:04:10.290> at<00:04:10.380> least<00:04:10.519> in<00:04:11.519> this

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
that part of it at least in this

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.340 
that part of it at least in this
formulated<00:04:12.239> way<00:04:12.359> that<00:04:12.540> I've<00:04:12.630> done<00:04:13.049> this<00:04:13.140> so

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
formulated way that I've done this so

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.840 
formulated way that I've done this so
hopefully<00:04:13.709> you<00:04:13.950> guys<00:04:14.070> found<00:04:14.280> this<00:04:14.489> strategy

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
hopefully you guys found this strategy

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.159 
hopefully you guys found this strategy
helpful<00:04:15.120> this<00:04:15.239> is<00:04:15.299> pretty<00:04:15.540> much<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:15.930> though

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
helpful this is pretty much it though
