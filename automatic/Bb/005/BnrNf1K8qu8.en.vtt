00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.960
 branches of the genus which 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.370
 a photo 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.370
 there i also created 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.670
 So 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.490
 not preparing something on the one hand 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.070
 us 4 days pause 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.640
 not like the west they are already starting tomorrow 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.340
 and so after away 3 games you 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.150
 Of course you fly late after all 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.050
 more rest is good yesterday we 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.119
 independently trained there by 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:16.450
 wish who raids and today already 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.650
 began to prepare well according to plan 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.300
 metallurgist it 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.460
 sawing our hockey not the last 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.050
 decade 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.360
 always president on high places and 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:38.320
 so it will be very interesting to the more 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:41.020
 4 5 teams meets we have experience 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.560
 lose in the first round what we already 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.420
 We know how to do it and do not know how to 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.490
 will benefit therefore we will try to choose 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:56.630
 per day is a series of calculations on the road 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:59.250
 Yes, I think now such teams 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.440
 everyone is hard to play and home and on call 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.750
 that’s why we’ll be so important 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.180
 take cartoon highland and there fans 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.610
 more than 3tasto will probably be no less 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:14.490
 than even if not much more than 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:17.209
 then gost but that's certainly a plus that's what 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.890
 beat but still plays another 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.900
 Games bad another championship can 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.740
 tell other games quite at it 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.950
 pay attention 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.830
 should become quite responsible already 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.480
 another mistake another 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.480
 so it draws too 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.040
 detonating leadership did not come 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.250
 I will discuss it but in any case 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.500
 It was at the beginning of the season that in the flesh 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.340
 successfully perform and and of course get there 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:54.690
 the final is a minimum of tasks also the players 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.390
 want or set the task of course 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.000
 in these finals ie play 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.630
 tune in long of course but I don’t 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.630
 want march 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:20.340
 As far as you pay attention, I think in 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:23.700
 the soul inside of course us steppe 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.980
 which of course we are a favorite on I think it is impossible 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.320
 boot because i will repeat with 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.040
 the teams are very good teams 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.310
 great 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:36.030
 and you are bright leader Sergei mozyakin 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.450
 scorer already many when we already 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.250
 alloy the positions scorers so all 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.940
 still we will pay much attention to 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.300
 defense 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.880
 without defense, we are not bad in my experience 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.330
 as already happens without a defense and win 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.870
 so it is nice but many 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.690
 match.com winnings on 1 1 show therefore myself 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.530
 plan to make fewer mistakes because of those 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.360
 the moment that is urine well we are what is 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.210
 another championship that special 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.919
 prepare some kind of our special we are not 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.200
 I will say to especially somehow get ready 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.660
 we are preparing we may even have 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.020
 because all the same end the season and less 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.529
 on the ice, we can be in time there more 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.129
 intense 3 but 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:22.959
 purely psychologically course set up 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.749
 completely different because the cost of the error 

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:28.209
 highly 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:30.699
 may affect the whole normally all 

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:33.309
 the course of matches for the entire series so here 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:35.219
 purely psychological and with one 

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:38.769
 the parties are very hard to play because 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:41.039
 depends every mistake can depends on 

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:41.039
 car 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:46.649
 it was important to prepare it nevertheless 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:49.989
 we scored go 

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:53.019
 I would like it to move on 

00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:56.349
 lasted not founded their so we 

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:56.999
 They wanted to run every match but with 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:00.069
 scraper 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:06.429
 unsuccessfully made lost two games 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:09.639
 it is good to gather it is not a pity it is hockey 

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:10.499
 we played for ourselves they are for the team there and 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:13.569
 atlanteans 

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:15.669
 in any case, they themselves are young and 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:19.329
 because they could solve their own 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:21.610
 task and not bad so this is hockey 

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:26.889
 life means next year they will 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:29.949
 try to jump in the floor well in any 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:34.209
 case the coach is always looking for their best 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:37.449
 mix so we're kind of used to that 

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:40.259
 we can develop a pair of three 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:43.149
 defenses so we are to prepare yes 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:45.099
 probably wanted to become something big 

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:47.979
 thanks of course says fund ural 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:50.439
 because all the same a lot of things for our 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:52.259
 hockey and not only for big hockey in 

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:54.299
 professional for children's sports 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:57.699
 hockey rinks open there 

00:06:54.299 --> 00:07:00.219
 so all the same, I think if it would not 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:02.829
 we had such what could not 

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:05.950
 to be and of course appeal to fans 

00:07:02.829 --> 00:07:08.110
 because without support 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:13.060
 our fans will be very hard and 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:16.000
 on the road and at home there is a call wanted 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.800
 what if we even lost what they us 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.500
 support does not answer because 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.380
 different situations can be but in any 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:26.070
 case, we hear you, your voice is visible 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.070
 male support
