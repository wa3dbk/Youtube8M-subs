debate there the other question you come
down<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.050> because<00:00:55.410> you're

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
down to is just because you're

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.130 
down to is just because you're
strengthening<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.789> repairing<00:00:57.629> connective

tissue<00:00:58.320> faster<00:00:58.770> doesn't<00:00:59.039> mean<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.219> you're

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
tissue faster doesn't mean that you're

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.770 
tissue faster doesn't mean that you're
removing<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.940> inflammation<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.660> you're

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
removing the inflammation if you're

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.180 
removing the inflammation if you're
getting<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> tendinitis<00:01:01.440> or<00:01:01.770> you're<00:01:01.920> getting

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
getting the tendinitis or you're getting

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.560 
getting the tendinitis or you're getting
some<00:01:02.430> inflammation<00:01:02.910> you're<00:01:03.300> probably

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
some inflammation you're probably

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.109 
some inflammation you're probably
building<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.899> scar<00:01:04.170> tissue<00:01:04.439> there<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.119> I

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
building up scar tissue there and I

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.370 
building up scar tissue there and I
would<00:01:06.420> recommend<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.170> you're<00:01:07.290> building

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
would recommend that if you're building

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.810 
would recommend that if you're building
up<00:01:07.619> scar<00:01:07.860> tissue<00:01:08.070> there<00:01:08.310> you're<00:01:08.490> gonna<00:01:08.610> need

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
up scar tissue there you're gonna need

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.520 
up scar tissue there you're gonna need
to<00:01:08.970> do<00:01:09.119> some<00:01:09.299> sort<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.540> art<00:01:09.750> therapy<00:01:10.170> or<00:01:10.290> trying

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
to do some sort of art therapy or trying

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.109 
to do some sort of art therapy or trying
to<00:01:10.560> foam<00:01:10.799> roll<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.400> break<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.820> scar

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
to foam roll that to break that scar

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.899 
to foam roll that to break that scar
tissue<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:13.229> most<00:01:13.380> importantly<00:01:14.010> no<00:01:14.520> drug

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909

or<00:01:15.320> therapy<00:01:16.320> or<00:01:16.650> anything<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> world<00:01:17.430> is

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
or therapy or anything in the world is

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.880 
or therapy or anything in the world is
going<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.880> make<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.479> tendinitis<00:01:18.900> go<00:01:19.290> away<00:01:19.590> if

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
going to make the tendinitis go away if

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.890 
going to make the tendinitis go away if
you're<00:01:20.100> still<00:01:20.430> giving<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.030> stimulus<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.689> is

you're still giving the stimulus that is
causing<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.560> need<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.799> find<00:01:23.100> out<00:01:23.280> what<00:01:23.460> you

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
causing it you need to find out what you

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.240 
causing it you need to find out what you
are<00:01:23.759> doing<00:01:24.270> with<00:01:24.450> your<00:01:24.479> form<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:26.100> your

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
training it's probably some technique

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.340 
training it's probably some technique
you<00:01:28.409> were<00:01:28.530> using<00:01:29.390> that's<00:01:30.390> causing<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.960> or<00:01:31.170> it's

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
you were using that's causing it or it's

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.740 
you were using that's causing it or it's
a<00:01:31.439> muscle<00:01:31.829> imbalance<00:01:32.150> between<00:01:33.150> say<00:01:33.720> the

there's<00:01:35.610> something<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.479> that's

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
there's something going on that's

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.270 
there's something going on that's
causing<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.140> irritation<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:37.950> inflammation

and<00:01:38.790> until<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.659> eliminate<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:41.430> going

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
to continue to reoccur it's some rate no

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.870 
to continue to reoccur it's some rate no
matter<00:01:44.970> what<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.720> do<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.700> once<00:01:47.700> you've

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
matter what you do and once you've

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.460 
matter what you do and once you've
developed<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.509> even<00:01:48.750> after<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.049> remove<00:01:49.439> that

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
developed it even after you remove that

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.620 
developed it even after you remove that
then<00:01:50.220> that's<00:01:50.460> what<00:01:50.640> therapy<00:01:51.090> things<00:01:51.329> start

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
then that's what therapy things start

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.420 
then that's what therapy things start
becoming<00:01:51.869> useful<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.439> remove<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:53.100> until

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
becoming useful to remove it but until

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.100 
becoming useful to remove it but until
then<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:54.000> going<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.299> keep<00:01:54.450> reoccurring<00:01:54.960> no

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
then it's going to keep reoccurring no

decline in strength and then over time

decline in strength and then over time
he<00:02:53.540> knows<00:02:53.720> he<00:02:53.810> started<00:02:54.170> recovering<00:02:54.410> faster

particularly<00:02:55.520> his<00:02:55.670> leg<00:02:55.880> work<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.300> he<00:02:56.630> gets

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
particularly his leg work and he gets

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.020 
particularly his leg work and he gets

squat more often recover faster and his

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.940 
squat more often recover faster and his
lips<00:02:59.239> started<00:02:59.570> going<00:02:59.810> up<00:02:59.989> this<00:03:00.200> even<00:03:00.860> though

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
lips started going up this even though

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.040 
lips started going up this even though
he<00:03:01.100> was<00:03:01.220> still<00:03:01.430> doing<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.760> list<00:03:01.970> cardio<00:03:02.330> so

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
he was still doing the list cardio so

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.840 
he was still doing the list cardio so
and<00:03:03.350> he's<00:03:03.470> actually<00:03:03.650> put<00:03:04.010> out<00:03:04.100> data<00:03:04.489> showing

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
and he's actually put out data showing

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.430 
and he's actually put out data showing
it<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.239> that<00:03:05.450> does<00:03:05.630> seem<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.870> happen<00:03:06.110> so<00:03:06.350> in

it and that does seem to happen so in
the<00:03:06.530> short<00:03:06.800> term<00:03:07.010> adding<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.459> a<00:03:07.520> lot<00:03:07.670> of<00:03:07.700> lists

the short term adding and a lot of lists

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.880 
the short term adding and a lot of lists
