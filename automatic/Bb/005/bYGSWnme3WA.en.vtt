00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.420
 ah 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.270
 acp 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.660
 hidden reporter 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.529
 this game why 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.050
 hello friends welcome to the program 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.660
 james bond 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.100
 this time we are going to do some 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:04.519
 planters pots recyclers ok that 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.090
 we are going to occupy we are going to occupy the role of 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:14.170
 bath or wipes that we use in the 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.170
 newspaper kitchen or magazine paper 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.310
 a rule 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.470
 A pen 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.470
 a liquid glue 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.159
 scooter 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.770
 a brush to stick the glue and the 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.869
 paper 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.869
 a brush to paint 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.860
 acrylic paint of any color 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.810
 and the main thing 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.670
 a button 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.670
 of these juice 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.630
 you can also use plastic 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:02.219
 but I'm going to use this time 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:06.210
 of cardboard we take the carton and 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:10.580
 with the help of the rule we measure 3 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.580
 inch we make a marquita 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.329
 and we make a line 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.750
 the same thing we do around the whole 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.750
 container 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.189
 and now what follows is with the help of 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.189
 cutter 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.069
 let's cut between those lines 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.489
 all around 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.569
 in this case I went ahead and only 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.569
 in lack of a side 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.980
 cut 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.730
 very carefully 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:52.500
 but we passed 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.300
 with a lot of line and so 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.020
 and we will stay 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.020
 A) Yes 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:10.850
 ok the next thing we'll do 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.850
 paper the brush and the glue 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.140
 and what we will do with the paper 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.180
 it will be short 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.180
 bits 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.319
 and so it will be done 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.610
 what is this glue will remove the 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.450
 half 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:39.230
 and the other half I put water on so that 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.230
 be faster 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.700
 and more simple 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:52.750
 and the next thing will be 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.750
 and put the glue 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.920
 around 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.130
 of the carton packaging 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.410
 this is only 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.040
 so that your container 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.040
 Look better 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.030
 if you like it like this 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.859
 you can leave it like that 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.060
 also what you can use 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.060
 It's gift wrap 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:29.330
 and I would avoid everything that is this 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.330
 small pieces of paper 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.500
 and we do it like that 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.120
 and we give him sticking old 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.599
 and we're going to stick this 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.780
 everything that is around 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.420
 more or less you are going to place 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.110
 three hats 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:26.419
 toilet paper kitchen napkins 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.419
 the newspaper or magazine 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.889
 more or less like that you will go hitting 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.979
 and you will be left 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.810
 something like that 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:46.010
 for it 15 soles and so that there is a 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:48.980
 little bit more resistant to cardboard 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.680
 it is not necessary because the cardboard 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:55.460
 it is precisely 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.460
 resistant to liquids 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:02.849
 ok the other way that I was 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:06.040
 saying good you have something like that 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:08.330
 and the other way he was saying 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.060
 is that you can cover it 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:14.770
 of newspaper paper magazine paper some 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:19.700
 cutout or wrapping paper 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:21.440
 lope gas and paper liners contact 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.860
 this later if it gets wet 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.810
 around you do not mistreat the image that 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.120
 you already put 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.480
 and the following 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.650
 will be painting 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.650
 on this occasion 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.650
 and I will use the color pink 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:48.370
 and you can paint them the color that 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.370
 you like your preference 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.990
 or make the recommendation that I gave them 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:54.990
 cover the 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.099
 and before I forget so that 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:08.190
 you can paint well and the forums like that 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:11.569
 this way as I erase it 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:14.340
 try to let it dry 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:16.980
 a whole day 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:22.260
 in the morning to the afternoon leaving all the 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:25.010
 night so that it is very dry and 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.010
 resistant 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.560
 and so you paint everything 

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:36.780
 if you are going to paint it 

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:43.520
 and you will be left 

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:46.020
 and here is 

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.520
 the flowerpot 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:53.970
 recycle 

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.970
 of a juice carton 

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:01.820
 this was all in today's program we 

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:04.490
 we see next week here in the 

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:07.240
 today's program 

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.240
 about
