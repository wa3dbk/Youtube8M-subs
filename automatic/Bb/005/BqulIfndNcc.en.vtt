00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.780 
know now whenever you use baking soda
you<00:02:33.000> need<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.420> use<00:02:33.629> an<00:02:33.870> acid<00:02:34.469> you<00:02:34.859> use<00:02:35.159> an<00:02:35.340> asset

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
you need to use an acid you use an asset

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.179 
you need to use an acid you use an asset
what<00:02:35.969> happens<00:02:36.359> is<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.900> soapy<00:02:37.290> flavor<00:02:37.620> that

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
what happens is the soapy flavor that

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.209 
what happens is the soapy flavor that
comes<00:02:38.489> if<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.000> use<00:02:39.239> only<00:02:39.629> baking<00:02:40.200> soda<00:02:40.469> is

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
comes if you use only baking soda is

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.610 
comes if you use only baking soda is
killed<00:02:41.609> because<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.209> asset<00:02:42.689> so<00:02:43.409> that's

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
killed because of this asset so that's

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.789 
killed because of this asset so that's
why<00:02:43.769> what<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.340> milk<00:02:44.639> it's<00:02:45.299> become<00:02:45.930> beautiful
