00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
just a chocolate but this could be

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.580 
just a chocolate but this could be
devastating<00:01:00.149> because<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.289> one<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.469> those

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
devastating because this is one of those

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.290 
devastating because this is one of those
