I'm<00:02:25.790> here<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.030> more<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.330> realized<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:26.990> it<00:02:27.140> was

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
I'm here the more I realized that it was

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.940 
I'm here the more I realized that it was
the<00:02:27.470> right<00:02:27.620> place<00:02:27.830> for<00:02:27.860> me

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
the right place for me

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.699 
the right place for me
it's<00:02:29.849> where<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.090> meant<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.599> be<00:02:30.780> just<00:02:31.319> because<00:02:31.409> of

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
it's where I meant to be just because of

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.710 
it's where I meant to be just because of
the<00:02:31.769> friends<00:02:32.069> I've<00:02:32.189> met<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.760> I've<00:02:33.450> enjoyed

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
the friends I've met and I've enjoyed

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.089 
the friends I've met and I've enjoyed
the<00:02:33.810> program<00:02:33.959> I've<00:02:34.260> learned<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.590> lot<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:35.010> I

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
the program I've learned a lot and I

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.920 
the program I've learned a lot and I
wouldn't<00:02:35.519> trade<00:02:35.670> these<00:02:35.760> experiences<00:02:36.329> for

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
wouldn't trade these experiences for

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.000 
wouldn't trade these experiences for
another<00:02:37.079> place<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.409> couldn't<00:02:37.590> imagine<00:02:37.799> being

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
another place I couldn't imagine being

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:50.980 
another place I couldn't imagine being
somewhere<00:02:38.400> else<00:02:38.459> honestly

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.050
