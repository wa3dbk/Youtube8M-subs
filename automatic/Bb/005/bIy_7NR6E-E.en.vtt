because their government keeps them in
the<00:03:07.920> dark<00:03:08.100> but<00:03:08.250> actually<00:03:08.610> they<00:03:08.790> do<00:03:08.850> they<00:03:09.269> do

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
the dark but actually they do they do

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.120 
the dark but actually they do they do
have<00:03:09.630> quite<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.230> bit<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.410> information<00:03:10.769> out

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
have quite a bit of information out

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.470 
have quite a bit of information out
there<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.430> mean<00:03:11.610> it's<00:03:11.700> hard<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:11.940> keep<00:03:12.090> called

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
there I mean it's hard to keep called

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.180 
there I mean it's hard to keep called
billion<00:03:12.870> people<00:03:13.110> in<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.380> dark<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.829> was<00:03:14.040> that

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
billion people in the dark I was that

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.720 
billion people in the dark I was that
but<00:03:14.970> um<00:03:15.209> almost<00:03:15.780> like<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.739> couple<00:03:17.190> days<00:03:17.340> or<00:03:17.579> all

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
but um almost like a couple days or all

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.699 
but um almost like a couple days or all
I<00:03:17.760> think<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.239> next<00:03:18.480> day<00:03:18.630> after<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.260> accident

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709
