00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
going into the match and so I thought I

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.450 
going into the match and so I thought I
was<00:01:41.810> going<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:41.990> die<00:01:42.229> a<00:01:42.259> couple<00:01:42.680> times<00:01:42.920> because

of it but fortunately I only died once

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.160 
of it but fortunately I only died once
and<00:01:46.790> it<00:01:46.880> wasn't<00:01:47.180> because<00:01:47.210> of<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.780> controller

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
and it wasn't because of the controller

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.590 
and it wasn't because of the controller
i<00:01:48.290> can't<00:01:48.619> go<00:01:48.740> blame<00:01:48.979> it<00:01:49.100> on<00:01:49.189> that<00:01:49.299> but<00:01:50.299> more
