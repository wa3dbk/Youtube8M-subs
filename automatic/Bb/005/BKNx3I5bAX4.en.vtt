00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
uploaded for a week straight that is

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.110 
uploaded for a week straight that is
something<00:00:14.070> that's<00:00:14.250> not<00:00:14.519> normal<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:14.969> this

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.120 
something that's not normal on this

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
channel so that's why I guess there was

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.370 
channel so that's why I guess there was
a<00:00:17.160> lot<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.400> our<00:00:17.670> IP<00:00:17.940> smart<00:00:18.539> comments<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.350> I
