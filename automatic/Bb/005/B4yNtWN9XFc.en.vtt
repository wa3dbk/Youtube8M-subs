yeah<00:06:18.810> i<00:06:19.379> would<00:06:19.650> definitely<00:06:19.830> recommend

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:20.069 
yeah i would definitely recommend

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:22.579 
yeah i would definitely recommend
getting<00:06:20.490> these<00:06:20.729> i<00:06:21.300> know<00:06:21.479> the<00:06:21.779> the<00:06:22.080> purple<00:06:22.409> kind

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:22.589 
getting these i know the the purple kind

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:24.230 
getting these i know the the purple kind
of<00:06:22.650> gives<00:06:22.770> it<00:06:22.860> a<00:06:22.949> really<00:06:23.250> cool<00:06:23.370> contrast<00:06:23.940> with

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
of gives it a really cool contrast with

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.689 
of gives it a really cool contrast with
the<00:06:24.330> lenses<00:06:24.690> to<00:06:24.719> violet<00:06:25.110> iridium<00:06:25.379> lenses<00:06:25.740> they

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 
the lenses to violet iridium lenses they

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:28.519 
the lenses to violet iridium lenses they
since<00:06:27.060> they<00:06:27.180> are<00:06:27.330> iridium<00:06:27.779> they're<00:06:27.930> very<00:06:28.259> very

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:28.529 
since they are iridium they're very very

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:30.110 
since they are iridium they're very very
mirrored<00:06:29.190> so<00:06:29.400> you're<00:06:29.520> not<00:06:29.699> going<00:06:29.849> to<00:06:29.909> be<00:06:30.000> able

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
mirrored so you're not going to be able

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.999 
mirrored so you're not going to be able
to<00:06:30.270> see<00:06:30.360> your<00:06:30.509> eyes<00:06:30.629> through<00:06:30.960> it<00:06:31.080> when<00:06:31.919> you
