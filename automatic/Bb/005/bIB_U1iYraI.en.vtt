train<00:00:34.790> went<00:00:35.790> by<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.510> i<00:00:37.140> tried<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.710> make<00:00:38.570> a

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
train went by and i tried to make a

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.060 
train went by and i tried to make a
difference<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.500> natural<00:00:41.190> design<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.000> that's

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
difference and natural design and that's

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.110 
difference and natural design and that's
failing<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.520> well<00:00:45.120> i<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.989> found<00:00:46.410> out<00:00:46.649> that

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
failing to well i have found out that

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.360 
failing to well i have found out that
that<00:00:48.120> design<00:00:48.870> works<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.879> only<00:00:51.239> works<00:00:51.510> half

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
that design works but it only works half

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.750 
that design works but it only works half
of<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.550> time<00:00:53.960> yeah<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.379> weird<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.520> goes

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
of the time yeah it's weird so it goes

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.529 
of the time yeah it's weird so it goes
like<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:58.070> that's<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.399> play<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:01.850> this<00:01:02.850> really

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
like this that's it play and this really

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.750 
like this that's it play and this really
shouldn't<00:01:03.930> happen<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.189> game<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:06.229> any

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
shouldn't happen if the game and any

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.149 
shouldn't happen if the game and any
criteria<00:01:08.760> at<00:01:09.000> all<00:01:09.200> this<00:01:10.200> shouldn't<00:01:10.590> happen<00:01:10.740> so

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
criteria at all this shouldn't happen so

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.750 
criteria at all this shouldn't happen so
the<00:01:11.580> beach<00:01:11.760> should<00:01:12.439> either<00:01:13.439> function<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.189> not

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the beach should either function or not

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.700 
the beach should either function or not
function<00:01:15.920> in<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.159> case<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.909> design<00:01:18.710> works

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
function in this case this design works

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.179 
function in this case this design works
sometimes<00:01:20.810> under<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.990> exact<00:01:22.350> same<00:01:22.619> condition

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
sometimes under the exact same condition

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.999 
sometimes under the exact same condition
so<00:01:23.400> no<00:01:23.970> modifications<00:01:24.659> at<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.140> other

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
so no modifications at all and other

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.270 
so no modifications at all and other
times<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.610> doesn't<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:28.020> let's<00:01:28.409> see<00:01:28.710> if<00:01:28.979> we're

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
times it doesn't so let's see if we're

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.640 
times it doesn't so let's see if we're
lucky<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.729> time<00:01:31.009> aunt<00:01:32.009> comes<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.610> train<00:01:36.650> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
lucky this time aunt comes the train and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.100 
lucky this time aunt comes the train and
it<00:01:38.250> failed<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.920> stop<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.579> without<00:01:42.420> changing<00:01:42.960> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
it failed so stop and without changing a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:52.620 
it failed so stop and without changing a
thing<00:01:45.229> play

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.390 

and<00:01:53.630> let's<00:01:54.530> see<00:01:54.800> if<00:01:56.110> this<00:01:57.110> time<00:01:57.410> stings<00:01:57.920> or

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
and let's see if this time stings or

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.290 
and let's see if this time stings or
this<00:01:59.150> time<00:01:59.360> things<00:01:59.780> work<00:02:00.020> differently

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
this time things work differently

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:10.120 
this time things work differently
because<00:02:02.300> I've<00:02:02.930> seen<00:02:02.960> this<00:02:03.500> happen<00:02:08.920> in<00:02:09.920> this

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
because I've seen this happen in this

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.430 
because I've seen this happen in this
range<00:02:10.490> looks<00:02:11.620> very<00:02:12.620> sturdy<00:02:13.030> so<00:02:14.030> I<00:02:14.300> think<00:02:15.170> this

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
range looks very sturdy so I think this

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.580 
range looks very sturdy so I think this
this<00:02:15.980> should<00:02:16.580> work<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.810> does<00:02:18.050> sometimes

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
this should work and it does sometimes

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.150 
this should work and it does sometimes
oh<00:02:20.560> yeah<00:02:21.560> this<00:02:21.950> time<00:02:22.390> look<00:02:24.160> completely

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
oh yeah this time look completely

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:33.479 
oh yeah this time look completely
different<00:02:26.350> so<00:02:27.820> well<00:02:28.820> done<00:02:29.060> guys<00:02:29.270> great<00:02:30.230> game

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.120 

so<00:02:34.989> map<00:02:35.989> 6<00:02:36.350> this<00:02:36.650> time<00:02:36.920> it's<00:02:37.670> done<00:02:37.910> for<00:02:38.209> real

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
so map 6 this time it's done for real

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.000 
so map 6 this time it's done for real
let's<00:02:40.130> go<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.850> next<00:02:40.970> one<00:02:42.250> m7<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:45.010> great

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
let's go to the next one m7 a great

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.410 
let's go to the next one m7 a great
bridge<00:02:46.700> span<00:02:47.300> over<00:02:47.780> here<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.910> by<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:49.940> sound

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
bridge span over here and by the sound

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.900 
bridge span over here and by the sound
there<00:02:50.720> will<00:02:50.870> be<00:02:51.020> a<00:02:51.050> boat<00:02:51.760> coming<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:54.910> we've

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
there will be a boat coming so we've

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.830 
there will be a boat coming so we've
built<00:02:56.239> one<00:02:57.730> not<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.760> lot<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.030> materials<00:02:59.690> either

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
built one not a lot of materials either

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.810 
built one not a lot of materials either
we<00:03:00.830> visit<00:03:01.340> one<00:03:02.980> with<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.100> bridge<00:03:04.430> already<00:03:04.880> so

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
we visit one with the bridge already so

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.580 
we visit one with the bridge already so
with<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:08.090> I'll<00:03:08.780> be<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.049> bridge<00:03:09.290> with

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
with the I'll be the bridge with

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.970 
with the I'll be the bridge with
distance<00:03:10.209> this<00:03:11.209> is<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.450> bridge<00:03:11.690> we<00:03:12.410> don't<00:03:12.709> one

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
distance this is a bridge we don't one

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.690 
distance this is a bridge we don't one
with<00:03:13.190> distance<00:03:14.120> before<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:14.870> let's<00:03:15.530> try<00:03:15.920> the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
with distance before and let's try the

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:32.199 
with distance before and let's try the
same<00:03:17.350> recipe<00:03:18.350> this<00:03:18.680> time<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:31.430> idea<00:03:31.850> is<00:03:32.120> to

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
same recipe this time the idea is to

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.729 
same recipe this time the idea is to
leave<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.170> pistols<00:03:33.709> in<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.160> middle<00:03:35.739> okay

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
leave the pistols in the middle okay

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:55.140 
leave the pistols in the middle okay
like<00:03:37.160> this<00:03:43.420> let's<00:03:44.420> use<00:03:44.720> iron<00:03:45.230> over<00:03:45.920> here<00:03:50.560> okay

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.220 

cross<00:03:56.150> pattern<00:03:56.480> as<00:03:56.989> always

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
cross pattern as always

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:15.690 
cross pattern as always
let's<00:04:00.159> see<00:04:00.400> how<00:04:00.670> much<00:04:00.879> island<00:04:01.360> we<00:04:01.540> have<00:04:14.700> this

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
let's see how much island we have this

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.400 
let's see how much island we have this
one<00:04:15.970> is<00:04:18.870> not<00:04:19.870> on<00:04:19.989> a<00:04:20.079> fire<00:04:20.850> this<00:04:21.850> bridge<00:04:22.120> is

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
one is not on a fire this bridge is

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.320 
one is not on a fire this bridge is
symmetrical<00:04:24.600> meaning<00:04:25.600> that<00:04:26.430> side<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:27.729> this

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
symmetrical meaning that side and this

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.840 
symmetrical meaning that side and this
side<00:04:28.389> are<00:04:29.199> the<00:04:29.500> same<00:04:29.710> distance<00:04:30.160> to<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.400> middle

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
side are the same distance to the middle

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
side are the same distance to the middle
and<00:04:31.000> in<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:32.020> first<00:04:32.530> one<00:04:33.030> in<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.210> first<00:04:34.419> bridge

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
and in the first one in the first bridge

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.409 
and in the first one in the first bridge
that<00:04:35.199> we've<00:04:35.470> built<00:04:35.860> with<00:04:36.070> the<00:04:36.850> Pistons<00:04:37.240> that

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
that we've built with the Pistons that

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.080 
that we've built with the Pistons that
wasn't<00:04:38.139> the<00:04:38.229> case<00:04:38.380> so<00:04:38.830> you<00:04:39.610> can<00:04:39.880> make<00:04:40.030> a

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
wasn't the case so you can make a

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.710 
wasn't the case so you can make a
symmetrical<00:04:40.780> design<00:04:40.930> on<00:04:41.260> this<00:04:41.770> one<00:04:42.419> which<00:04:43.419> is

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
symmetrical design on this one which is

00:04:43.720 --> 00:05:01.020 
symmetrical design on this one which is
easier<00:04:44.410> I<00:04:44.620> think<00:04:45.130> I<00:04:53.100> hope<00:04:54.100> this<00:04:54.340> works<00:05:00.030> support

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
easier I think I hope this works support

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.270 
easier I think I hope this works support
six<00:05:01.389> starts<00:05:02.050> here<00:05:03.840> I'm<00:05:04.840> just<00:05:05.020> trying<00:05:05.680> to<00:05:06.070> make

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
six starts here I'm just trying to make

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:13.440 
six starts here I'm just trying to make
it<00:05:07.320> look<00:05:08.320> the<00:05:08.500> same<00:05:08.530> on<00:05:09.039> both<00:05:09.300> sides<00:05:12.450> also

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
it look the same on both sides also

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.779 
it look the same on both sides also
because<00:05:13.870> it<00:05:14.020> looks<00:05:14.349> better<00:05:14.680> oh<00:05:16.830> I<00:05:17.830> forgot<00:05:18.370> to

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
because it looks better oh I forgot to

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:28.800 
because it looks better oh I forgot to
make<00:05:21.450> this<00:05:22.450> an<00:05:22.660> open<00:05:22.930> joint<00:05:26.669> it's<00:05:27.669> a<00:05:28.060> little

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
make this an open joint it's a little

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.839 
make this an open joint it's a little
bouncy<00:05:29.440> oh<00:05:30.180> that's<00:05:32.430> there's<00:05:33.430> some<00:05:33.639> beans

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
bouncy oh that's there's some beans

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.950 
bouncy oh that's there's some beans
missing<00:05:34.360> there

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.540 

let's<00:05:39.960> see<00:05:40.230> what<00:05:40.440> this<00:05:40.530> enough<00:05:40.890> this<00:05:41.400> is

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
let's see what this enough this is

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:53.120 
let's see what this enough this is
enough<00:05:42.260> so<00:05:43.580> here's<00:05:44.580> the<00:05:44.730> ship<00:05:51.140> okay<00:05:52.140> it<00:05:52.830> seems

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
enough so here's the ship okay it seems

00:05:53.130 --> 00:06:00.470 
enough so here's the ship okay it seems
it<00:05:53.310> will<00:05:53.490> be<00:05:53.670> enough<00:05:57.440> so<00:05:58.820> it<00:05:59.820> could<00:06:00.120> be<00:06:00.270> better

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
it will be enough so it could be better

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:15.440 
it will be enough so it could be better
but<00:06:02.690> it<00:06:03.690> will<00:06:03.930> probably<00:06:04.290> hold<00:06:13.790> at<00:06:14.790> least<00:06:15.090> if

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
but it will probably hold at least if

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:22.700 
but it will probably hold at least if
the<00:06:15.900> oh<00:06:19.460> that<00:06:20.460> middle<00:06:20.790> sections<00:06:21.270> very<00:06:22.110> weak

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
the oh that middle sections very weak

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.290 
the oh that middle sections very weak
now<00:06:23.090> yeah<00:06:24.090> but<00:06:24.420> it<00:06:24.540> it<00:06:24.780> will<00:06:24.960> Oh<00:06:25.940> as<00:06:26.940> you<00:06:27.150> can

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
now yeah but it it will Oh as you can

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.790 
now yeah but it it will Oh as you can
see<00:06:27.510> this<00:06:28.140> one<00:06:28.410> weighs<00:06:28.680> was<00:06:29.100> kind<00:06:29.610> of<00:06:29.790> easy<00:06:30.800> and

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
see this one weighs was kind of easy and

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.820 
see this one weighs was kind of easy and
just<00:06:32.040> build<00:06:32.520> the<00:06:33.150> same<00:06:33.390> thing<00:06:33.660> on<00:06:33.870> both<00:06:33.900> sides

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
just build the same thing on both sides

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.650 
just build the same thing on both sides
and<00:06:36.110> will<00:06:37.110> be<00:06:37.230> fine<00:06:37.410> for<00:06:38.060> okay<00:06:39.060> thank<00:06:39.390> you<00:06:39.450> for
