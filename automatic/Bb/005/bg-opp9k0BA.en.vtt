600 labor points chopped and now it got

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.090 
600 labor points chopped and now it got
a<00:01:26.380> lot<00:01:26.740> smaller<00:01:27.250> ah<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.500> now<00:01:29.650> it's<00:01:29.770> gonna<00:01:29.860> grow

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
a lot smaller ah so now it's gonna grow

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.770 
a lot smaller ah so now it's gonna grow
to<00:01:30.220> full<00:01:30.520> size<00:01:30.580> so<00:01:30.940> when<00:01:31.090> you<00:01:31.180> plant<00:01:31.479> it<00:01:31.660> it

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
to full size so when you plant it it

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.940 
to full size so when you plant it it
actually<00:01:31.930> becomes<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:33.930> normal<00:01:34.930> it's<00:01:35.620> already<00:01:35.920> a

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
actually becomes a normal it's already a

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.240 
actually becomes a normal it's already a
grown<00:01:36.400> tree<00:01:36.820> when<00:01:37.000> you<00:01:37.090> plant<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:38.190> now<00:01:39.190> we

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
grown tree when you plant it and now we

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.910 
grown tree when you plant it and now we
got<00:01:39.580> this<00:01:39.850> bundle<00:01:40.360> right<00:01:40.479> here<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.810> grand<00:01:41.200> but

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
got this bundle right here the grand but

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.430 
got this bundle right here the grand but
just<00:01:42.190> like<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.369> log<00:01:42.580> bundle<00:01:43.119> splits<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.259> wood

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
just like a log bundle splits the wood

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.010 
just like a log bundle splits the wood
into<00:01:44.740> smaller<00:01:45.100> stacks<00:01:45.430> Otto<00:01:45.759> use<00:01:46.240> Shift<00:01:46.810> +

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
into smaller stacks Otto use Shift +

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.020 
into smaller stacks Otto use Shift +
right<00:01:47.590> click<00:01:47.619> gives<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.400> same<00:01:48.670> amount<00:01:48.970> of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
right click gives the same amount of

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.210 
right click gives the same amount of
logs<00:01:49.180> with<00:01:49.390> 70-plus<00:01:49.990> pine<00:01:50.380> trees<00:01:50.680> oh<00:01:50.800> my<00:01:50.979> god

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
maybe I was just not looking in the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.420 
maybe I was just not looking in the
right<00:02:38.320> area<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:38.709> here<00:02:38.829> we<00:02:38.950> have<00:02:39.040> another<00:02:39.280> one

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
right area so here we have another one

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.310 
right area so here we have another one
let's<00:02:39.760> go<00:02:39.850> ahead<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.060> open<00:02:40.480> this<00:02:40.600> up<00:02:40.780> chop<00:02:41.170> it

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
let's go ahead and open this up chop it

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.370 
let's go ahead and open this up chop it
down<00:02:41.350> 600<00:02:42.040> labor<00:02:42.780> we<00:02:43.780> currently<00:02:43.930> have<00:02:44.290> a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
down 600 labor we currently have a

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.600 
down 600 labor we currently have a
thousand<00:02:47.380> and<00:02:47.530> nineteen<00:02:47.920> logs<00:02:48.160> or<00:02:48.400> some

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
thousand and nineteen logs or some

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.500 
thousand and nineteen logs or some
reason<00:02:49.019> so<00:02:50.019> let's<00:02:50.670> see<00:02:51.670> here<00:02:51.910> what<00:02:52.030> our<00:02:52.150> bundle

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
reason so let's see here what our bundle

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.720 
reason so let's see here what our bundle
gives<00:02:52.750> us<00:02:52.989> does<00:02:53.650> not<00:02:53.680> cost<00:02:54.040> any<00:02:54.310> labor<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.790> open

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
gives us does not cost any labor to open

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.880 
gives us does not cost any labor to open
and<00:02:57.730> yet<00:02:58.420> we<00:02:58.600> gained<00:02:58.810> another<00:02:59.110> thousand<00:02:59.739> logs

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
and yet we gained another thousand logs

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.949 
and yet we gained another thousand logs
okay<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:00.640> we<00:03:00.760> actually<00:03:01.030> got<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.209> thousand<00:03:01.780> logs

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
okay so we actually got a thousand logs

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.569 
okay so we actually got a thousand logs
there<00:03:02.200> we<00:03:02.380> weren't<00:03:02.530> just<00:03:02.769> freaking<00:03:03.310> out<00:03:03.430> for

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
no reason it's not glitched and it says

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.900 
no reason it's not glitched and it says
you<00:03:07.510> can<00:03:07.660> chop<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:08.079> ten<00:03:08.380> times<00:03:08.799> so<00:03:09.549> you<00:03:09.610> can<00:03:09.700> see

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
you can chop it ten times so you can see

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.770

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
don't know tell me if I'm wrong did we

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.140 
don't know tell me if I'm wrong did we
do<00:04:05.319> we<00:04:05.440> need<00:04:05.620> log<00:04:05.830> prices<00:04:06.310> to<00:04:06.430> go<00:04:06.549> lower<00:04:06.819> than

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
do we need log prices to go lower than

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.670 
do we need log prices to go lower than
what<00:04:07.239> they<00:04:07.360> currently<00:04:07.540> are<00:04:07.780> our<00:04:08.019> log<00:04:08.260> price<00:04:08.530> is

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
what they currently are our log price is

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.360 
what they currently are our log price is
outrageous

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
outrageous

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.580 
outrageous
can<00:04:09.730> we<00:04:09.819> not<00:04:10.000> afford<00:04:10.420> log<00:04:10.599> prices<00:04:11.049> right<00:04:11.230> now<00:04:11.260> I

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
can we not afford log prices right now I

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.319 
can we not afford log prices right now I
don't<00:04:12.160> know<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.370> haven't<00:04:12.610> played<00:04:12.819> much<00:04:13.060> but<00:04:13.299> I

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
don't know I haven't played much but I

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.330 
don't know I haven't played much but I
really<00:04:13.840> don't<00:04:13.989> think<00:04:14.140> log<00:04:14.440> prices<00:04:14.920> are<00:04:15.130> that

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
really don't think log prices are that

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.579 
really don't think log prices are that
high
