00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.929 
to xbox live when i first plugged my
xbox<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.740> because<00:00:28.920> sometimes<00:00:29.310> i<00:00:29.490> connect<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
xbox in because sometimes i connect to a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.500 
xbox in because sometimes i connect to a
different<00:00:30.300> router<00:00:31.850> and<00:00:32.850> then<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.030> come<00:00:33.180> back<00:00:33.239> to

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
different router and then I come back to

different router and then I come back to
this<00:00:33.660> one<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.890> doesn't<00:00:35.219> allow<00:00:35.370> me<00:00:35.550> to

this one and it doesn't allow me to

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.290 
this one and it doesn't allow me to
connect<00:00:35.910> straight<00:00:36.059> away<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.469> do<00:00:37.620> is

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300

a<00:01:21.439> subnet<00:01:22.439> mask<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:22.950> no<00:01:23.130> gateway<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.850> it's

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
a subnet mask but no gateway and it's

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.609 
a subnet mask but no gateway and it's
set<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.720> automatic<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.360> after<00:01:27.530> messing<00:01:28.530> around

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
set to automatic so after messing around

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.499 
set to automatic so after messing around
for<00:01:28.890> ages<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.520> ages<00:01:29.640> trying<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.180> get<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.420> to

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
for ages and ages trying to get it to

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.060 
for ages and ages trying to get it to
work<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.960> finally<00:01:31.500> figure<00:01:31.770> out<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:34.770> way<00:01:34.920> it

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
work I finally figure out the way it

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.010 
work I finally figure out the way it
works<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.460> me<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.970> sometimes<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.810> doesn't

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
works for me and sometimes it doesn't

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.010 
works for me and sometimes it doesn't
work<00:01:37.049> all<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.100> time<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:39.060> hopefully<00:01:39.509> this

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
work all the time but hopefully this

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.460 
work all the time but hopefully this
will<00:01:40.170> help<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.640> anyway<00:01:41.810> what<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.079> basically

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
will help you anyway what you basically

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.350 
will help you anyway what you basically
going<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.100> be<00:01:44.220> doing<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.759> logging<00:01:44.970> into<00:01:45.210> your
