maybe<00:00:45.960> he's<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.350> too<00:00:46.530> much<00:00:46.680> battery<00:00:47.129> or

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
maybe he's just too much battery or

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.760 
maybe he's just too much battery or
maybe<00:00:48.510> not<00:00:48.750> enough<00:00:49.020> devices<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.739> be

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
maybe not enough devices can be

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
connected at once maybe it's just do

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.729 
connected at once maybe it's just do
shorter<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> distance<00:00:54.260> well<00:00:55.260> if<00:00:55.410> these<00:00:55.590> are

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
shorter the distance well if these are

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.740 
shorter the distance well if these are
your<00:00:55.860> reasons<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.489> hesitate<00:00:56.969> no<00:00:57.210> longer

you can listen so if I press play on the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.370 
you can listen so if I press play on the
p2<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.479> sound<00:01:24.780> will<00:01:24.930> come<00:01:25.049> from<00:01:25.229> here<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
p2 the sound will come from here and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.730 
p2 the sound will come from here and
here<00:01:28.380> doesn't<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.960> moreover<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.320> works<00:01:31.530> in

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
here doesn't it moreover it works in

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:40.140 
here doesn't it moreover it works in
spite<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.310> long<00:01:32.640> distance

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.600 

because<00:01:40.870> if<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.170> distance<00:01:41.530> are<00:01:41.710> short<00:01:41.980> that's

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
because if the distance are short that's

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.150 
because if the distance are short that's
great<00:01:42.910> coverage<00:01:43.360> isn't<00:01:43.660> it<00:01:43.900> if<00:01:44.230> the<00:01:44.950> phone

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
great coverage isn't it if the phone

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.860 
great coverage isn't it if the phone
rings<00:01:45.190> way<00:01:45.640> you're<00:01:45.820> listening<00:01:46.180> to<00:01:46.270> music<00:01:46.630> how

rings way you're listening to music how
do<00:01:46.930> you<00:01:47.050> react<00:01:47.700> maybe<00:01:48.700> you<00:01:49.690> have<00:01:49.810> to<00:01:49.930> turn<00:01:50.140> on

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
do you react maybe you have to turn on

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.260 
do you react maybe you have to turn on
the<00:01:50.380> volume<00:01:50.710> throw<00:01:51.190> off<00:01:51.340> your<00:01:51.400> headphones<00:01:52.000> and

the volume throw off your headphones and
rush<00:01:52.510> to<00:01:52.690> find<00:01:52.930> your<00:01:53.140> phone<00:01:53.290> before<00:01:53.500> you

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
rush to find your phone before you

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.770 
rush to find your phone before you
answer<00:01:54.040> it<00:01:54.190> all<00:01:55.120> right<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.360> bet<00:01:55.570> if<00:01:55.660> you're

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
answer it all right I bet if you're

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.240 
answer it all right I bet if you're
using<00:01:55.930> hands-free<00:01:56.380> Bluetooth<00:01:56.920> it'd<00:01:57.160> be

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
using hands-free Bluetooth it'd be

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.640 
using hands-free Bluetooth it'd be
totally<00:01:57.550> even<00:01:58.000> worse<00:01:58.180> because<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:59.440> have<00:01:59.530> to

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
totally even worse because you have to

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.020 
totally even worse because you have to
actually<00:01:59.740> pick<00:02:00.040> up<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.250> hands-free<00:02:00.670> which

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
actually pick up the hands-free which

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.650 
actually pick up the hands-free which
completely<00:02:01.450> defeats<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.960> purpose<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.820> it's

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
completely defeats the purpose but it's

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.600 
completely defeats the purpose but it's
mp3<00:02:05.320> player<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.770> cell<00:02:05.980> phone<00:02:06.190> repaired

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
mp3 player and the cell phone repaired

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.090 
mp3 player and the cell phone repaired
how<00:02:07.090> will<00:02:07.240> this<00:02:07.360> process<00:02:07.810> change<00:02:08.110> let<00:02:08.740> me<00:02:08.890> show

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
how will this process change let me show

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.199
