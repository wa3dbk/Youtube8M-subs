demonstrating the smart base and some of

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.179 
demonstrating the smart base and some of
the<00:00:06.930> features<00:00:07.230> available<00:00:07.319> within<00:00:07.710> it<00:00:07.890> let's

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
the features available within it let's

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.950 
the features available within it let's
go<00:00:08.280> ahead<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.490> get<00:00:08.550> started<00:00:08.940> let's<00:00:09.719> add<00:00:09.929> a

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
go ahead and get started let's add a

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.959 
go ahead and get started let's add a
smart<00:00:10.530> base<00:00:12.769> this<00:00:13.769> interface<00:00:14.190> pops<00:00:14.490> up<00:00:14.759> and

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
smart base this interface pops up and

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.340 
smart base this interface pops up and
what<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.210> have<00:00:15.360> here<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.719> very<00:00:15.960> similar<00:00:16.230> to

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
what you have here is very similar to

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.040 
what you have here is very similar to
the<00:00:16.470> smart<00:00:16.770> guitar<00:00:17.070> however<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.750> only<00:00:18.869> have

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
the smart guitar however you only have

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.609 
the smart guitar however you only have
four<00:00:19.320> strings<00:00:19.789> and<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:21.449> actually<00:00:21.660> can't<00:00:22.109> play

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
four strings and you actually can't play

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.060 
four strings and you actually can't play
chords<00:00:23.310> by<00:00:23.430> tapping<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> top<00:00:24.150> here<00:00:24.420> you

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
chords by tapping on the top here you

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.490 
chords by tapping on the top here you
can't<00:00:26.070> strum<00:00:26.310> them<00:00:26.430> out<00:00:26.609> if<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.849> want<00:00:27.500> these

can't strum them out if you want these

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.230 
can't strum them out if you want these
strings<00:00:28.890> will<00:00:29.070> correspond<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.029> whatever

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240

will be in any smart instrument that you
use<00:00:45.239> after<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.350> set<00:00:46.590> them<00:00:47.000> so<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.329> they<00:00:48.570> will

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
use after you set them so that they will

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.760 
use after you set them so that they will
all<00:00:48.840> sound<00:00:49.260> good<00:00:49.440> together<00:00:50.420> if<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:52.260> want<00:00:52.530> to
