00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.450
 hello guys but a good tone in the kitchen 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.720
 starting and you will learn how to do 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.880
 today a cauliflower au gratin that is 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.980
 very easy to do a great 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.710
 accompaniment to you as a meat 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.630
 like chicken is very tasty so 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.199
 Let's learn, let's start. 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.779
 boiling the cauliflower just put water 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.210
 in a medium pan put a little 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.390
 salt as if you had prepared the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.579
 water with noodles mix this salt in 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.739
 water and when your water is 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.790
 boiling you can start to play 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.250
 like flower 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.620
 the cauliflower here has already been cut already 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.809
 I cut her from the main piece 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.300
 So how are you watching them? 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.110
 boil and then for about five 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.730
 minutes 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.010
 We are going to start doing our 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.980
 sauce we'll start one of shamell 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.760
 then in a small pot we put 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.449
 the butter and then on that butter when 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.910
 she has melted over medium high heat 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.549
 We 're going to start crumbling the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.770
 wheat is the beginning of my hat is 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.749
 so do shamell including a 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.389
 legal tip for other revenues is that 

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:14.369
 you need to make the hat 

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:16.829
 This butter is going to melt. 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.740
 incorporate the wheat and will become a mass 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:22.469
 and you do not want that mass kimi 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.749
 you'll leave this mixture still light 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:27.479
 and when it has fully 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:32.029
 built and how you are watching you 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.029
 will then start adding the milk 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.910
 here we are putting the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.910
 milk you are using milk 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.640
 skinny you do not need to use milk 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:49.020
 I fully recommend that you 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.850
 use lighter milk because here 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.070
 Are you already using butter? 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.260
 will still add some cheeses then 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.960
 It's interesting you add milk. 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.430
 slimer here in this recipe and this 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.500
 mixture will start to get thicker 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.170
 will start to thicken this milk goes 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.960
 begin to thicken because of wheat and 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.690
 will start to get that consistency 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.700
 you're seeing there and after five 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.520
 minutes you can already take out your cabbage 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.650
 flower is just to dry it and reserve that the 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.650
 people will keep making our eye 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.630
 Now you're going to turn off the fire of your 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.700
 small pan and with the fire off 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.100
 You'll start working the cheeses. 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.860
 here I added the group air france vai 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.690
 add the parmesan now and go 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.610
 stir a little 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.290
 the goalkeeper will give a consistency well 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.209
 cool promoted it will look like 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.209
 a funding of cheese 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.870
 now you can season with a 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.120
 a little salt can also have with a 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.459
 bit of freshly ground pepper 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.370
 and you are also putting a little bit of 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.260
 ground nutmeg also preferably 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.719
 time nutmeg will give a touch as well 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.700
 special and will be very tasty and 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.700
 keep stirring some more 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.299
 and when you are doing you can 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.549
 try from time to time here I 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.530
 I tried and I thought I needed to 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.500
 a little salt and Brazil is a 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.540
 sweet little and gives you a touch up 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.790
 little sweet then I preferred 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.069
 add a little salt yet 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.859
 our mix and you have seen there 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.140
 consistency really looks like a fund is 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.540
 exactly the same consistency that people 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.889
 is 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.349
 Now we will start preparing the 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:48.650
 Our crosses just put a shell. 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:51.290
 in the bottom of your dish is just spreading 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.489
 a little you are doing the base then 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.489
 of your gratin 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.660
 Now you can add the cabbage. 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.480
 flower that you had already dried was already 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.770
 very dry and just add one by one 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.770
 fitting our strides 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.620
 after putting everything is just finished 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.620
 add your sauce over top 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.030
 after covering very well the whole 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.430
 cauliflower you will put in the oven for 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.020
 about five minutes 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.880
 This is the first time you go. 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.000
 put in the oven it will start to 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.000
 bubble 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.600
 and now you're going to take it out of the oven and go 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.910
 prepare to gratin it to gratin 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.310
 I 'm putting a little bread 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.410
 so I passed the processor or 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.470
 you can also put flour 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.950
 screw or just grated parmesan in 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.419

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.020
 groupware to give a special touch 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.690
 so we're going back to the oven now 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.180
 for about two minutes thereafter. 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.940
