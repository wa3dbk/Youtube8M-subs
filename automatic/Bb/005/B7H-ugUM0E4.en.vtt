futuristic city with a bunch of mechs

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.339 
futuristic city with a bunch of mechs
you<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:58.880> around<00:02:59.090> so<00:02:59.239> seems<00:02:59.540> kind<00:03:00.139> of<00:03:00.230> empty

now<00:03:00.709> bear<00:03:01.040> in<00:03:01.069> mind<00:03:01.310> what<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.579> actually<00:03:01.880> seen

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
now bear in mind what the actually seen

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.830 
now bear in mind what the actually seen
here<00:03:02.359> is<00:03:02.510> actually<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.980> trial<00:03:04.489> for<00:03:04.849> the<00:03:05.599> game

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
here is actually the trial for the game

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.550 
here is actually the trial for the game
that<00:03:06.590> came<00:03:06.799> out<00:03:06.859> in<00:03:07.480> 2007<00:03:08.480> this<00:03:09.200> game<00:03:09.440> was

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
that came out in 2007 this game was

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.100 
that came out in 2007 this game was
actually<00:03:10.010> released<00:03:10.280> in<00:03:10.489> 2008

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
actually released in 2008

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.350 
actually released in 2008
so<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:15.290> would<00:03:16.290> assume<00:03:17.030> there's<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.180> lot<00:03:18.330> more

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
so I would assume there's a lot more

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.540 
so I would assume there's a lot more
going<00:03:18.750> on<00:03:19.020> in<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.320> finished<00:03:19.920> product<00:03:20.310> i<00:03:20.370> did

going on in the finished product i did

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.460 
going on in the finished product i did
go<00:03:20.670> watch<00:03:20.850> some<00:03:21.090> videos<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.960> actual<00:03:22.350> game

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
go watch some videos of the actual game

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.160 
go watch some videos of the actual game
the<00:03:23.460> cutscenes<00:03:24.000> seem<00:03:24.330> amazing<00:03:24.570> but<00:03:24.990> the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
the cutscenes seem amazing but the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.780 
the cutscenes seem amazing but the
actual<00:03:25.560> gameplay<00:03:25.770> still<00:03:26.280> seems<00:03:26.520> like<00:03:26.670> the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
actual gameplay still seems like the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.340 
actual gameplay still seems like the
cities<00:03:27.060> are<00:03:27.090> kind<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.680> empty<00:03:29.000> but<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:31.140> game

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
cities are kind of empty but the game

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.070 
cities are kind of empty but the game
still<00:03:31.620> is<00:03:31.800> kind<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.130> fun<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.670> know<00:03:33.300> right

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
the game tutorial is kind of annoying

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.599 
the game tutorial is kind of annoying
because<00:04:19.560> instead<00:04:19.859> of<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:20.100> being<00:04:20.130> in<00:04:20.489> the

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
because instead of it being in the

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.310 
because instead of it being in the
actual<00:04:20.910> game<00:04:21.000> it's<00:04:21.840> in<00:04:22.200> this<00:04:22.500> light<00:04:22.770> polygon

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
actual game it's in this light polygon

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.820 
actual game it's in this light polygon
type<00:04:25.320> stage<00:04:25.680> kind<00:04:26.070> of<00:04:26.220> like<00:04:27.410> Ross<00:04:28.410> planning

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
type stage kind of like Ross planning

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
of explosions I just wish the landscape

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.420 
of explosions I just wish the landscape
was<00:05:36.360> filled<00:05:36.780> in<00:05:36.960> with<00:05:37.140> more<00:05:37.440> stuff<00:05:37.860> aside<00:05:38.220> more

going<00:05:38.760> on<00:05:38.880> it<00:05:39.060> seems<00:05:39.330> it<00:05:40.110> feels<00:05:40.350> like<00:05:40.530> this<00:05:40.650> is

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
going on it seems it feels like this is

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.970 
going on it seems it feels like this is
basically<00:05:41.310> a<00:05:41.840> you<00:05:42.840> know<00:05:42.960> an<00:05:43.110> alpha<00:05:43.560> of<00:05:43.590> the

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:43.980 
basically a you know an alpha of the

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.090 
basically a you know an alpha of the
game<00:05:44.190> before<00:05:44.910> they<00:05:45.300> put<00:05:45.510> everything<00:05:45.600> in<00:05:46.100> but

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
game before they put everything in but

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.250 
game before they put everything in but
it<00:05:47.520> is<00:05:47.970> pretty<00:05:48.180> good<00:05:48.390> as<00:05:48.540> smooth<00:05:48.840> it's<00:05:49.110> not

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
it is pretty good as smooth it's not

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.070 
it is pretty good as smooth it's not
glitchy<00:05:49.560> it's<00:05:49.800> not<00:05:49.980> clunky<00:05:50.750> snow<00:05:51.750> freezing

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.650 
widescreen and then we got pillar box so
I<00:06:06.650> took<00:06:07.650> that<00:06:07.860> out<00:06:08.040> just<00:06:08.190> left<00:06:08.610> it<00:06:08.790> standard

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660

I took that out just left it standard
definition<00:06:10.230> because<00:06:10.470> I<00:06:10.770> can't<00:06:11.760> stand<00:06:11.970> seeing

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
definition because I can't stand seeing

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.030 
definition because I can't stand seeing
those<00:06:12.390> damned<00:06:12.630> borders<00:06:13.020> on<00:06:13.170> my<00:06:13.320> in<00:06:13.650> my<00:06:13.890> videos

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
those damned borders on my in my videos

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.370 
those damned borders on my in my videos
so<00:06:17.180> this<00:06:18.180> point<00:06:18.390> here<00:06:18.540> I<00:06:18.660> think<00:06:18.780> I<00:06:18.990> guess<00:06:19.200> this

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
so this point here I think I guess this

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.290 
so this point here I think I guess this
is<00:06:19.560> um<00:06:19.740> this<00:06:20.010> guy<00:06:20.190> you're<00:06:20.370> fighting<00:06:20.400> is

is um this guy you're fighting is
actually<00:06:21.750> a<00:06:21.780> boss<00:06:22.140> battle<00:06:22.350> it<00:06:22.590> seems<00:06:22.800> like<00:06:22.980> as

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
actually a boss battle it seems like as

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.940 
actually a boss battle it seems like as
he<00:06:23.400> is<00:06:23.580> very<00:06:23.850> difficult<00:06:24.150> to<00:06:24.630> kill<00:06:25.320> these<00:06:25.530> very

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
he is very difficult to kill these very

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.920 
he is very difficult to kill these very
difficult<00:06:26.400> even<00:06:26.700> hitting<00:06:26.940> zigzags<00:06:27.510> all<00:06:27.720> over

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
difficult even hitting zigzags all over

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.620 
difficult even hitting zigzags all over
the<00:06:28.050> place<00:06:28.490> it's<00:06:29.490> hard<00:06:29.790> to<00:06:29.940> kind<00:06:30.090> of<00:06:30.210> lock<00:06:30.390> on

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
the place it's hard to kind of lock on

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.180 
the place it's hard to kind of lock on
because<00:06:30.900> the<00:06:30.990> lock-on<00:06:31.170> system<00:06:31.500> again<00:06:31.920> without

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
because the lock-on system again without

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.930 
because the lock-on system again without
knowing<00:06:32.550> it<00:06:32.700> weird<00:06:33.150> configurations<00:06:33.960> that

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
knowing it weird configurations that

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.970 
knowing it weird configurations that
take<00:06:35.940> some<00:06:36.210> getting<00:06:36.540> used<00:06:36.570> to
