00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.910 

with<00:00:30.640> us<00:00:30.790> we<00:00:30.970> have<00:00:31.000> among<00:00:31.599> the<00:00:31.869> most<00:00:32.080> respected

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
with us we have among the most respected

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.790 
with us we have among the most respected
overclockers<00:00:33.790> in<00:00:34.180> the<00:00:34.420> indie<00:00:34.690> community

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.530 

what<00:00:39.190> we<00:00:39.280> are<00:00:39.399> trying<00:00:39.460> to<00:00:39.850> do<00:00:39.969> is<00:00:40.149> see<00:00:40.300> what<00:00:40.420> we

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
what we are trying to do is see what we

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.470 
what we are trying to do is see what we
can<00:00:40.660> do<00:00:40.750> with<00:00:40.809> AMD<00:00:41.110> FX<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.700> question<00:00:43.030> is<00:00:43.149> just

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
can do with AMD FX the question is just

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.869 
can do with AMD FX the question is just
how<00:00:43.629> far<00:00:44.110> here<00:00:44.590> we<00:00:44.800> go<00:00:44.980> so<00:00:45.460> we're<00:00:45.579> not<00:00:45.610> running

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
how far here we go so we're not running

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.639 
how far here we go so we're not running
any<00:00:46.090> benchmarks<00:00:46.360> we're<00:00:46.750> just<00:00:46.930> shooting<00:00:47.350> for

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
any benchmarks we're just shooting for

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.770 
any benchmarks we're just shooting for
the<00:00:47.680> highest<00:00:47.980> cpu-z<00:00:48.790> so<00:00:49.210> we<00:00:49.329> build<00:00:49.510> up<00:00:49.629> from

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
the highest cpu-z so we build up from

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.740 
the highest cpu-z so we build up from
the<00:00:49.899> bias<00:00:50.079> pretty<00:00:50.800> save<00:00:51.070> easy<00:00:52.030> settings<00:00:52.510> and

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
the bias pretty save easy settings and

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.840 
the bias pretty save easy settings and
then<00:00:52.989> we'll<00:00:53.680> adjust<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.160> frequencies<00:00:54.640> on<00:00:54.760> the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
then we'll adjust the frequencies on the

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.790 
then we'll adjust the frequencies on the
fly<00:00:55.059> just<00:00:55.480> seeing<00:00:55.750> how<00:00:55.870> the<00:00:55.930> frequency<00:00:56.530> scale

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
fly just seeing how the frequency scale

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.549 
fly just seeing how the frequency scale
is<00:00:56.980> going<00:00:57.040> from<00:00:57.430> air<00:00:57.730> water<00:00:58.030> face<00:00:58.570> live<00:00:59.260> stream

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
is going from air water face live stream

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.680 
is going from air water face live stream
so<00:01:00.309> we're<00:01:00.460> just<00:01:00.489> going<00:01:00.820> up<00:01:01.120> little<00:01:01.540> by<00:01:01.659> little

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
so we're just going up little by little

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.320 
so we're just going up little by little
7<00:01:02.290> gigahertz<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.940> far<00:01:04.210> no<00:01:04.839> problem<00:01:06.270> these<00:01:07.270> days

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
7 gigahertz so far no problem these days

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.230 
7 gigahertz so far no problem these days
we've<00:01:07.840> kind<00:01:08.170> of<00:01:08.290> stepped<00:01:08.710> it<00:01:08.860> up<00:01:08.950> a<00:01:09.130> bit<00:01:09.240> when

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
we've kind of stepped it up a bit when

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.940 
we've kind of stepped it up a bit when
we<00:01:10.360> run<00:01:10.509> liquid<00:01:10.840> nitrogen<00:01:11.170> which<00:01:11.470> is<00:01:11.619> kind<00:01:11.890> of

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
we run liquid nitrogen which is kind of

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.859 
we run liquid nitrogen which is kind of
a<00:01:11.979> preliminary<00:01:12.280> test<00:01:12.550> for<00:01:12.940> us<00:01:13.030> that<00:01:13.539> it's<00:01:13.690> bit

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
a preliminary test for us that it's bit

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.270 
a preliminary test for us that it's bit
overclocking<00:01:14.500> for<00:01:14.649> the<00:01:14.710> rest<00:01:14.890> of<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.070> world

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
overclocking for the rest of the world

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.469 
overclocking for the rest of the world
for<00:01:15.520> a<00:01:15.550> long<00:01:15.729> time<00:01:15.940> 78<00:01:16.750> 73<00:01:17.560> getting<00:01:18.460> any<00:01:19.149> closer

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
for a long time 78 73 getting any closer

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:28.750 
for a long time 78 73 getting any closer
to<00:01:19.660> 8p<00:01:19.990> guards<00:01:20.470> 18<00:01:21.220> hurts

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.510 

when<00:01:29.450> we<00:01:29.600> switch<00:01:29.810> over<00:01:29.930> to<00:01:30.080> helium<00:01:30.620> the<00:01:31.040> base

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
when we switch over to helium the base

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.340 
when we switch over to helium the base
temperature<00:01:32.120> has<00:01:32.390> usually<00:01:32.720> been<00:01:32.900> between

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
temperature has usually been between

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.740 
temperature has usually been between
negative<00:01:33.880> 220<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.090> 230<00:01:36.520> 8.33<00:01:37.520> five<00:01:38.120> megahertz

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
negative 220 and 230 8.33 five megahertz

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.070 
negative 220 and 230 8.33 five megahertz
that<00:01:39.650> was<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.890> highest<00:01:40.340> cpu<00:01:40.910> frequency<00:01:41.150> ever

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
that was the highest cpu frequency ever

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.530 
that was the highest cpu frequency ever
and<00:01:42.380> we<00:01:42.800> had<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.190> wire<00:01:43.430> scanner<00:01:43.910> enabled

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
and we had the wire scanner enabled

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.530 
and we had the wire scanner enabled
let's<00:01:44.870> see<00:01:45.050> if<00:01:45.170> we<00:01:45.350> can<00:01:45.500> go<00:01:45.620> higher<00:01:49.390> so<00:01:50.390> this

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
let's see if we can go higher so this

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.730 
let's see if we can go higher so this
would<00:01:50.720> be<00:01:50.750> 8<00:01:51.080> 420<00:01:51.890> we<00:01:52.550> can<00:01:52.670> make<00:01:52.820> it<00:01:53.000> 8<00:01:53.720> for<00:01:54.110> 29

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:05.380 

congratulations<00:01:57.740> everyone<00:01:58.040> an<00:01:58.430> awesome

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.450
