00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.090
 meeting 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.620
 In love, as in show business, it's always 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.759
 good to leave everyone wanting more what it is 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:22.730
 What does this mean? 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:30.830
 He will come yellow and I thought 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:30.830
 Bernadette wants to marry me 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:38.700
 This is one of those jokes that 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.340
 I understand, I did not mean it, I never go. 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:47.670

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.680
 Not water then you're new 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.770
 I'd rather think of myself as weird. 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.739
 we have three times we do not think 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:11.390
 its interval is still very fair when 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:11.390
 It's annoying when that happens, huh? 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.369
 who is in the exothermic release of 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.369
 oxygen 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:32.039
 sparkling vengeance at exactly the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.110

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.819
 put this in the clip room I already 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.619
 I took care of this. Notice this is a 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.259

 in the night watchman's shirt pocket 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.179
 at the same time I put great 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.429
 quantities of these substances on top of 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:56.310
 of suspended ceiling tiles 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.640

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.640

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.399

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.370

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.790
