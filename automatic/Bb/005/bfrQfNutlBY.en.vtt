00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.100 
and you say how many servings are having
each<00:02:06.920> breast<00:02:07.399> is<00:02:07.700> two<00:02:07.939> servings<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.989> i'm

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
each breast is two servings and i'm

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.540 
each breast is two servings and i'm
having<00:02:09.259> two<00:02:09.560> breaths<00:02:09.830> here<00:02:10.069> so<00:02:10.280> we're<00:02:10.429> going

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
having two breaths here so we're going

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.570 
having two breaths here so we're going
to<00:02:10.640> say<00:02:10.819> four<00:02:11.360> servings<00:02:12.080> then<00:02:13.069> it<00:02:13.190> shows<00:02:13.430> you

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
to say four servings then it shows you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.390 
to say four servings then it shows you
that<00:02:13.730> it's<00:02:14.050> 440<00:02:15.050> calories<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.950> if<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.280> look

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
that it's 440 calories and if you look

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.470 
that it's 440 calories and if you look
to<00:02:16.489> the<00:02:16.550> right<00:02:16.760> here<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.180> gives<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.450> a

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
to the right here it gives you a

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.030 
to the right here it gives you a
detailed<00:02:17.959> description<00:02:18.260> of<00:02:18.470> everything<00:02:18.860> else

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
detailed description of everything else

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.559

little<00:03:44.600> bit<00:03:44.720> extra<00:03:44.840> anyway<00:03:45.350> but<00:03:46.510> yeah<00:03:47.510> guys

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
little bit extra anyway but yeah guys

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.360 
little bit extra anyway but yeah guys
that's<00:03:48.019> just<00:03:48.170> a<00:03:48.350> way<00:03:48.470> just<00:03:48.739> so<00:03:48.829> you<00:03:48.920> know<00:03:49.130> how

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
that's just a way just so you know how

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.250 
that's just a way just so you know how
to<00:03:49.430> track<00:03:50.000> what<00:03:50.390> it<00:03:50.510> is<00:03:50.630> you're<00:03:50.810> eating<00:03:51.079> I

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
to track what it is you're eating I

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.840 
to track what it is you're eating I
beginning<00:03:51.769> ask<00:03:51.889> this<00:03:51.980> question<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.430> lot<00:03:52.459> and

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
beginning ask this question a lot and

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.539 
beginning ask this question a lot and
it's<00:03:53.569> how<00:03:54.019> do<00:03:54.470> i<00:03:54.560> track<00:03:54.920> you<00:03:55.100> know<00:03:55.130> if<00:03:55.280> I<00:03:55.340> have

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
it's how do i track you know if I have

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.670 
it's how do i track you know if I have
this<00:03:56.269> many<00:03:56.510> grams<00:03:56.750> of<00:03:56.959> chicken<00:03:57.290> so<00:03:57.500> for

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
this many grams of chicken so for

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.080 
this many grams of chicken so for
example<00:03:57.769> to<00:03:58.310> answer<00:03:58.549> a<00:03:58.579> question<00:03:58.970> i<00:03:59.060> received

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
example to answer a question i received

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.990 
example to answer a question i received
so<00:03:59.780> if<00:03:59.840> you<00:03:59.930> go<00:04:00.049> here<00:04:00.290> just<00:04:00.680> for<00:04:00.739> the

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
so if you go here just for the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.380 
so if you go here just for the
example<00:04:01.360> um<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:03.010> know<00:04:03.130> every<00:04:03.520> 4<00:04:03.790> ounces<00:04:04.150> is

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
example um you know every 4 ounces is

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.260 
example um you know every 4 ounces is
112<00:04:04.960> grams<00:04:05.460> in<00:04:06.460> terms<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.000> chicken

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
112 grams in terms of the chicken

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.940 
112 grams in terms of the chicken
breasts<00:04:07.540> so<00:04:07.660> for<00:04:08.350> every<00:04:08.470> four<00:04:08.620> ounces<00:04:08.830> you're

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
breasts so for every four ounces you're

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.980 
breasts so for every four ounces you're
having<00:04:09.100> 112<00:04:09.580> grams<00:04:09.700> of<00:04:09.940> chicken<00:04:10.270> that<00:04:10.630> doesn't

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
having 112 grams of chicken that doesn't

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.690 
having 112 grams of chicken that doesn't
mean<00:04:11.110> that<00:04:11.290> you're<00:04:11.410> having<00:04:11.560> 112<00:04:12.220> grams<00:04:12.400> of

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
mean that you're having 112 grams of

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.370 
mean that you're having 112 grams of
protein<00:04:12.910> diamonds<00:04:13.810> are<00:04:13.900> having<00:04:14.110> a<00:04:14.140> hundred

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
protein diamonds are having a hundred

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.380 
protein diamonds are having a hundred
twelve<00:04:14.560> grams<00:04:14.920> of<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.340> meat<00:04:15.580> so<00:04:15.970> for<00:04:16.209> every

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
twelve grams of the meat so for every

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.270 
twelve grams of the meat so for every
hundred<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:16.750> twelve<00:04:16.900> grams<00:04:17.230> of<00:04:17.650> chicken

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
hundred and twelve grams of chicken

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.940 
hundred and twelve grams of chicken
you're<00:04:18.489> having<00:04:18.989> let's<00:04:19.989> see<00:04:20.170> what<00:04:20.560> it<00:04:20.650> is<00:04:20.769> for

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
you're having let's see what it is for

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.470 
you're having let's see what it is for
one<00:04:21.070> serving<00:04:23.040> you're<00:04:24.040> having<00:04:24.310> 25<00:04:24.820> grams<00:04:25.270> of

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
one serving you're having 25 grams of

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.770 
one serving you're having 25 grams of
protein<00:04:25.660> see<00:04:26.140> that<00:04:26.320> there<00:04:26.500> so<00:04:27.390> for<00:04:28.390> every<00:04:28.540> four

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
protein see that there so for every four

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.330 
protein see that there so for every four
ounces<00:04:29.050> for<00:04:29.170> every<00:04:29.350> 1<00:04:29.500> 12<00:04:29.770> grams<00:04:30.070> you're

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
ounces for every 1 12 grams you're

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.920 
ounces for every 1 12 grams you're
having<00:04:30.550> 25<00:04:30.820> grams<00:04:31.090> of<00:04:31.180> protein<00:04:31.360> so<00:04:31.870> you

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
having 25 grams of protein so you

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.450 
having 25 grams of protein so you
wouldn't<00:04:32.230> count<00:04:32.350> that's<00:04:32.590> 112<00:04:33.100> grams<00:04:33.220> of

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
wouldn't count that's 112 grams of

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.000 
wouldn't count that's 112 grams of
protein<00:04:33.610> you<00:04:33.880> count<00:04:34.090> as<00:04:34.180> 25<00:04:34.660> grams<00:04:34.990> of<00:04:35.410> protein

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
protein you count as 25 grams of protein

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.210 
protein you count as 25 grams of protein
if<00:04:36.520> that<00:04:36.730> makes<00:04:36.910> sense<00:04:37.060> so<00:04:37.630> anyway<00:04:38.470> guys<00:04:38.620> just

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
if that makes sense so anyway guys just

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.320 
if that makes sense so anyway guys just
want<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.400> give<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:39.550> a<00:04:39.610> few<00:04:39.790> pointers<00:04:39.820> on<00:04:40.180> how

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
want to give you a few pointers on how

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.670 
want to give you a few pointers on how
to<00:04:40.360> track<00:04:40.600> your<00:04:40.720> macros<00:04:41.110> let<00:04:41.320> me<00:04:41.380> know<00:04:41.470> if<00:04:41.530> that
