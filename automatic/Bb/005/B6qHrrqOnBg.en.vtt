In last episodes we works with one or two 
 strobes. Today i shoot with three strobes portrait

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:44.615
First strobe is main light  , about 45 degree from model

00:00:57.803 --> 00:01:03.803
From other side  i use silver reflector  wich lighten shadows on face

00:01:22.036 --> 00:01:26.036
add the strobe for hairlight

00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:10.160
Portrait looks good, and 3 strobe use for background

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.400
With these strobe we can make white background

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.400
With these strobe we can make white background

00:02:40.194 --> 00:02:45.190
Next is color background (use color gel)

00:03:04.297 --> 00:03:10.300
On this  strobe you must put power 
 down, as when using for white background

00:03:18.393 --> 00:03:24.390
And last effect  , put strobe behind model and zoom 
 strobe head in , its make circle effect 

00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:48.030
For "sharp"circle use snoot

00:04:12.004 --> 00:04:16.000

 where are the photos from the video
