00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.250
 melting waterfall 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.350
 and these versions also with this 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.770

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.330
 problem when installing enojÃ© 9 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.549
 and in fact there is the version that 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.710
 used for everything everything that I bring 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.110

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.780
 inconveniences 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.730
 that suffers one we find this version 7 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.640
 we will also see the post 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.830
 may be I recommend that you install them in 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.050
 a clean point point folder ie 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.750
 what 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.070
 of without such for an endorsement of the 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.350
 folder that you take with each other already have 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.690
 installed for it what they will have to 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.460
 be the following they would say to the route 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.200
 where is minecraft point for 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.950
 we press the glass windows + ere 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.900
 and we wrote percent app data by 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.660
 one hundred click on accept or 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.710
 we just press the enter key and 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.190
 how can you see what to be about 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.550
 samples 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.600
 if we have let's say some created world or 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.060
 some map already played 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.560
 we click right and we copy and what 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.700
 have in any other part of 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.010
 our team 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.530
 once we have supported, we give 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.050
 painters again eliminate or simply 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.040
 we express the key delete the keyboard 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.810
 and we give over 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.969
 It's worth noting that you hear so much 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.819
 for the most premium version and not cold 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:52.760
 for doctrine I will give you also in the 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.590
 decision of the video tudela salvio to a 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.349
 previous video or a video that will go up 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.739
 a lot of time 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.189
 of collection not priman craft 1.7 points 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.530
 two 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.689
 any investment they want 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.090
 download without any bus and 100% 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.770
 to work 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.370
 once they have done this 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.740
 install micros with laser both first 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.150
 premium and once you have installed it 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.860
 direct to the folder 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.710
 previously unzipped where 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.720
 find the box and the dust 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.390
 so we will have to double 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.910
 click on the file and as you can see 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.810
 this will disappear until it stands out and what 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.580
 we will have to do is leave 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.830
 selected customer and we click on 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.870
 accept obviously I will not do it because 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.300
 she and they do with the version of os x 10 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.800
 thousand 60 installed in minecraft and it works 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.200
 wonderfully 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.360
 and once we have stuck it we execute 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.300
 the minecraft and once we have executed 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.400
 the minecraft the traits and we enter with 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.560
 the portfolio point more and as you can see 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.670
 within this there will be a loss called 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.680
 we 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.780
 and inside the folder called 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.700
 we will stick what would be young 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.160
 chicken copper that the bookstore so 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.590
 can work 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.950
 once placed inside this folder 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.840
 the mobile will be good and it will be 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.560
 installed our mantra and we can 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.019
 know the different crafter that we 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.200
 go adding other ways that then 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.940
 we place within this the truth that 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.220
 does not cause any kind of problems in the 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.320
 mantra is not created but with the version of 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.870
 Forge I'm leaving you in the 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.400
 file at 1060 because I was doing 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.490
 some tests with the latest version that 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.040
 is the a to 1,095 and with this the ninth item 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.900
 then believe this soul in the key of some 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.400
 mistakes there and it graces the minecraft 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.930
 so give it now 1060 that in the 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.470
 recommended version on the page 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.790
 forte 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.500
 and the version that I am 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.480
 recommending for the English child 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.830
 work wonderfully the truth that 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.480
 I hope the video is to your liking 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.700
 do not forget that I would comment on growing 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.700
 it costs nothing until the next and greetings
