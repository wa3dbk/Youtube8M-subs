couple of weeks the sound and one of the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.240 
couple of weeks the sound and one of the
headphones<00:01:41.370> will<00:01:41.760> go<00:01:41.940> up<00:01:42.090> with<00:01:42.450> go<00:01:42.990> out<00:01:43.170> or<00:01:43.500> it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
headphones will go up with go out or it

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.610 
headphones will go up with go out or it
would<00:01:44.430> get<00:01:44.580> really<00:01:44.610> low<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.510> i<00:01:46.320> would<00:01:46.440> have<00:01:46.590> to

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
would get really low and i would have to

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.800 
would get really low and i would have to
count<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:46.980> finagle<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.760> dial<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.270> get<00:01:48.480> just

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
count on finagle this dial to get just

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.040 
count on finagle this dial to get just
the<00:01:48.960> perfect<00:01:49.200> setting<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.570> that's<00:01:51.570> happening

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
the perfect setting and that's happening

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.670 
the perfect setting and that's happening
every<00:01:52.290> set<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:53.100> i've<00:01:53.250> got<00:01:53.520> i've<00:01:54.450> gotten<00:01:55.409> and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
every set that i've got i've gotten and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.630 
every set that i've got i've gotten and
then<00:01:56.520> I've<00:01:57.180> had<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.900> take<00:01:58.230> discuss<00:01:58.890> this

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
then I've had to take discuss this

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.120 
then I've had to take discuss this
started<00:02:00.480> coming<00:02:00.870> apart<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:01.470> they're<00:02:01.890> good

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
started coming apart but they're good

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.280 
started coming apart but they're good
headphones<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.880> there<00:02:03.240> they<00:02:03.540> were<00:02:03.600> cheap<00:02:03.990> so

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
headphones and there they were cheap so

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.280 
headphones and there they were cheap so
that's<00:02:05.100> probably<00:02:05.490> why<00:02:06.450> I've<00:02:06.570> had<00:02:06.780> trouble

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
that's probably why I've had trouble

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.889 
that's probably why I've had trouble
with<00:02:07.409> them<00:02:07.560> they<00:02:08.399> were<00:02:08.459> just<00:02:08.729> twelve<00:02:09.390> dollars

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
with them they were just twelve dollars

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.059 
with them they were just twelve dollars
so<00:02:11.450> for<00:02:12.450> what<00:02:13.019> they<00:02:13.110> calls<00:02:13.379> they<00:02:13.739> were<00:02:13.890> pretty

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
so for what they calls they were pretty

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.309 
so for what they calls they were pretty
good<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.150> was<00:02:15.420> looking<00:02:15.540> for<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.870> same<00:02:16.049> type

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
good so I was looking for the same type

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.199 
good so I was looking for the same type
of<00:02:16.349> features<00:02:16.829> when<00:02:17.219> i<00:02:17.249> came<00:02:17.519> across<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
of features when i came across the

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.780

control<00:03:08.269> and<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:08.780> like<00:03:08.989> this<00:03:09.200> because<00:03:09.439> the

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
control and I like this because the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.920 
control and I like this because the
headphones<00:03:10.730> plug<00:03:11.180> in<00:03:11.510> right<00:03:12.169> here<00:03:12.909> and<00:03:13.930> the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
good thing about this volume control is

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.629 
good thing about this volume control is
that<00:03:17.060> it's<00:03:17.209> detachable<00:03:17.599> so<00:03:18.109> if<00:03:18.349> it's<00:03:18.620> if<00:03:18.859> your

ever had they don't fit all the way in
this<00:04:51.750> whole<00:04:51.990> section<00:04:52.380> is<00:04:52.680> kind<00:04:52.920> of<00:04:53.040> kind<00:04:53.730> of

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
this whole section is kind of kind of

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.660 
this whole section is kind of kind of
big<00:04:54.090> so<00:04:54.360> it<00:04:54.390> doesn't<00:04:54.890> get<00:04:55.890> all<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.190> way<00:04:56.460> in<00:04:56.580> my

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
big so it doesn't get all the way in my

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.400 
big so it doesn't get all the way in my
ear<00:04:56.910> but<00:04:57.150> it<00:04:57.330> doesn't<00:04:57.660> need<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:57.930> it<00:04:58.020> only<00:04:58.140> goes

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
ear but it doesn't need to it only goes

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.010 
ear but it doesn't need to it only goes
halfway<00:04:59.250> in<00:04:59.730> and<00:04:59.850> that's<00:04:59.970> fine<00:05:00.330> because<00:05:00.540> if

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
halfway in and that's fine because if

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.280 
halfway in and that's fine because if
you<00:05:01.500> notice<00:05:01.920> the<00:05:02.130> speaker<00:05:02.610> part<00:05:03.240> is<00:05:03.480> just<00:05:04.080> on

my<00:05:44.100> costs<00:05:44.550> headphones<00:05:45.060> they<00:05:45.660> would<00:05:46.170> just<00:05:46.200> be

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
my costs headphones they would just be

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.650 
my costs headphones they would just be
loud<00:05:47.220> these<00:05:48.090> have<00:05:48.450> a<00:05:48.690> rich<00:05:49.110> sound<00:05:49.470> to<00:05:49.800> them<00:05:49.950> and

loud these have a rich sound to them and

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.510 
loud these have a rich sound to them and
they<00:05:51.660> based<00:05:52.050> their<00:05:52.380> their<00:05:52.710> stay<00:05:52.890> still<00:05:53.340> can

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
they based their their stay still can

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.370 
they based their their stay still can
get<00:05:53.670> pretty<00:05:53.850> loud<00:05:54.060> but<00:05:54.360> they<00:05:54.480> also<00:05:54.630> have<00:05:55.170> a

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
get pretty loud but they also have a

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.190 
get pretty loud but they also have a
rich<00:05:56.310> texture<00:05:56.970> to<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.360> sound<00:05:57.630> which<00:05:57.870> I<00:05:57.990> really

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
rich texture to the sound which I really

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.990 
rich texture to the sound which I really
like<00:05:58.470> and<00:06:00.170> so<00:06:01.170> they're<00:06:01.620> very<00:06:01.650> comfortable<00:06:02.280> the

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000

terribly long you know maybe maybe well

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.429 
terribly long you know maybe maybe well
it's<00:06:32.770> it's<00:06:33.039> longer<00:06:33.400> than<00:06:33.430> a<00:06:33.580> ruler<00:06:34.000> but<00:06:34.439> it's
