 that accompanies the gaze and the mind 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.780
 of the observer in an imaginary world

 beyond the real theatrical scenography 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.690
 built on a rich graphic layout

 own mind to the discovery of emotions 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.270
 situations stories and messages from 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.060
 communicate the world that the artist 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.880
 describes and brings his works is a 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.780
 magical mythological world in which everything 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.310
 it is an illusion symbol of reality 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.099

 mythology living beings from the strange 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.900
 shapes mix with reals 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.870
 landscape architectural constructions 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.540
 fantastic tell of places without 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.569
 time and retrace moments of the 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.750
 our existence propose sensations 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.170
 strong and contrasting like the colors from 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.940
 which originate a chromatism 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:43.299
 unreal played in shades of blue and 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.299
 purple colors of dream and subconscious 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.379

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:53.939
 the artist's thought becomes image 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.849
 representation of an unconscious idea of 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:59.400
 a feeling of a perception 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:02.370
 surreal love of life in all 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.219
 its manifestations dream and madness for a 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.280
 overcome rationality liberation from 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:09.540
 each convention conditioning only 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.639
 no doubt the aspects that 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.090
 most striking in the painting of 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:17.939
 federico tamburri united with chromatism 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.709
 strong and intense graphic precision 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:21.889
 to the structural complexity and 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.689
 organizational composition 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.609
 decidedly scenographic that places 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:31.219
 each image in one dimension 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:31.219
 fantastic surreal and timeless
