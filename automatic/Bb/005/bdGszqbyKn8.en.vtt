 many voted and the battle was very 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.580
 fierce but today we will see the map 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.580
 space 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.590
 It speaks there personal and certainty more visible and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.570
 This time people are back here. 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.760
 with another episode of super maps and 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.539
 Look what used to sign up for god 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.400
 I found the music is angels is your side and 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.410
 It's the following guys I'm preparing. 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.750
 to see map as you know it goes 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.230
 be the most beautiful episode of all 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.480
 paraguay and it's going to be an episode mano vai 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.940
 being and I still say more 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.460
 In this episode you will have something that you 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.800
 already asked have already charged me for a long time 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.750
 but let's focus on today's episode 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.350
 if you call if this crazy map 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.030
 Look at this map guys, man I asked 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.090
 you vote in the last episode you 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.129
 chose the spatial and old map that 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.789
 was the best special brand of all 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.070
 I found it 's expensive it's very amazing 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.020
 and what else he called him had some 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.240
 other half an hour to others with more 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.130
 buildings but I liked it the most 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.530
 the car can make the space is then 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.450
 you see the sun of la luna da kia business 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.150
 very expect to see if he did this 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.640
 globe here, this planet and if you 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.890
 to repair such spatial data that 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.439
 maybe this will sound here 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.790
 little ones I do not know who I have 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.590
 impression that these are 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.159
 those aliens are aliens 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.509
 the dollar also made the team that if I 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.820
 come back a little bit and such 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.799
 and to speak the truth, there are 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.860
 few spatial maps to have a 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.290
 I can find this map here and I 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.240
 I really liked him and I'm going to show him 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.009
 according to spatial map to 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.759
 as it is here it is well 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.350
 small 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.689
 I just want to test an expensive deal. 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.619
 because I do not know if the guy who did this 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.049
 globe 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.469
 if he took the trouble to put the 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.570
 South pole to the north did it here in the 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.719
 hour that is the north pole in general arrives and 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.729
 You can see better is to face this map. 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.250
 here is very much of the time he put 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.069
 all steroids or whatever 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.800
 that is old round the earth does not 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.660
 so much human sense 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.910
 It looks like that winter ring from there. 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.520
 where are you from but it does not make much sense 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.170
 said that back from the earth no more beauty 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.450
 this was the first map the link goes 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.390
 being in the description I found very very 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.670
 very beast but go to the next let's go 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:34.220
 People, I'm already here, arriving in the second. 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:37.910
 map and face look at this link here map 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.920
 dude I'll say there are not many 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.980
 space maps but I quite liked it 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.170
 I found this one of the different 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:53.420
 of that which is space is a station of 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:55.820
 rocket launch here with 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.320
 these charges in the real I do not know face alone 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.170
 are Carlos 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.270
 I do not know how to say it but he has all the 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.770
 launch station negotiations 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.380
 here is the penalty for capturing this 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.120
 There for educational I do not know to say 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.730
 very technical kiss 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.410
 I'm pretty much barofsky, right? 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.690
 curious every thought of sancits 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.430
 coming here are stuck in the rocket 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.170
 of load 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.480
 I think it's August 6 will give 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.230
 first impulse because I was going to help 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.720
 the fluminense coming out of orbit in boston 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.209
 and it was something that I always 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.790
 impressive on these maps is the 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.780
 creativity of the 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.600
 small businesses but you can 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.209
 to understand what it is and there for it they 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.560
 make funny deal of putting these 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.050
 train rails here 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.550
 running in the real of this example the greater 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.790
 banks do not have an idea 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.250
 3 dimensions of studio rose is those 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.370
 paraffin wand that has nunes 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.050
 being a lot of metal is several item 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.610
 towers it's time to put on makeup 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.190
 then take a closer look and see 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.380
 more details or copy to your map 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.030
 will only scroll an option you can also 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.519
 download the book and tainá of ​​inscriptions 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.330
 for just our cart to here in 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.930
 hour 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.669
 it's great a place full of cards 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.039
 very very top mall this here is 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.180
 novelty faces the has almost nothing 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:26.440
 Is there anything that stands out? 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:32.000
 inside the acisp housing here then nothing 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:34.220
 of passages in here does not have 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.650
 a lot of things do not look like old crazy 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:41.150
 face heads buttons here I am I 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.190
 was talking about having to discuss the 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.229
 activity to do business already said 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.470
 that you still understand that you want 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.660
 send or should not do with it is 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.729
 also have these strollers up to 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.509
 I had seen the military carts 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:58.940
 arriving here in the launch spot and here 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:02.330
 this map that is very very very beast 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.949
 I only say one thing worth more than 300 reais 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.470
 but if there is one thing that will be worth more 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.509
 of 500 billion reais will be the 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.520
 on the faceless map I'm making a 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:13.009
 giant propaganda to see map 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.229
 because I already know what I'm going to do 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.210
 and you guys are going to vibrate a lot in that 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.909
 episode is power and this is it guys 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.770
 Unfortunately I'm very dedicated to 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:23.870
 macro sphere I will try to record an ep the 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.940

 shorter for you have liked 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.970
