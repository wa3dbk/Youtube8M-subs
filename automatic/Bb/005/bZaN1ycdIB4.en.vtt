00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.010 
years ago I've got one for solid lumber
and<00:02:09.330> I've<00:02:10.110> got<00:02:10.289> one<00:02:10.530> for<00:02:10.740> sheet<00:02:10.950> materials<00:02:11.610> and

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
and I've got one for sheet materials and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.640 
and I've got one for sheet materials and
basically<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.640> drew<00:02:14.640> six<00:02:15.470> representations<00:02:16.470> of

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
basically I drew six representations of

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.880 
basically I drew six representations of
imaginary<00:02:17.280> boards<00:02:17.820> in<00:02:18.140> sizes<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.320> I<00:02:19.410> knew<00:02:19.710> my

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
imaginary boards in sizes that I knew my

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.210 
imaginary boards in sizes that I knew my
supplier<00:02:20.340> would<00:02:20.640> carry

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
supplier would carry

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.600 
supplier would carry
in<00:02:21.340> this<00:02:21.850> case<00:02:22.150> six<00:02:22.810> inches<00:02:23.140> wide<00:02:23.410> by<00:02:24.130> 8<00:02:24.370> feet

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
in this case six inches wide by 8 feet

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.810 
in this case six inches wide by 8 feet
long<00:02:25.080> then<00:02:26.080> when<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.320> have<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.620> material<00:02:26.860> list<00:02:27.490> I

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
long then when I have a material list I

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.910 
long then when I have a material list I
take<00:02:28.330> my<00:02:28.480> architect's<00:02:29.110> scale<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.800> I

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
take my architect's scale and I

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.030 
take my architect's scale and I
literally<00:02:30.280> draw<00:02:30.760> each<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.810> every<00:02:32.200> piece<00:02:32.500> from

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
literally draw each and every piece from

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.310 
literally draw each and every piece from
my<00:02:33.250> material<00:02:33.820> list<00:02:34.060> onto<00:02:34.810> my<00:02:34.930> cutting

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
my material list onto my cutting

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.800 
my material list onto my cutting
diagrams<00:02:35.830> so<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.940> really<00:02:37.150> serves<00:02:37.510> as<00:02:37.780> a

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
diagrams so it really serves as a

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.560 
diagrams so it really serves as a
shopping<00:02:38.410> diagram<00:02:38.920> when<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:39.790> go<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.030> buy<00:02:40.300> my

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
shopping diagram when I go to buy my

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.110 
shopping diagram when I go to buy my
lumber<00:02:40.960> I'm<00:02:41.140> looking<00:02:41.800> for<00:02:42.010> specific<00:02:42.670> boards

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
lumber I'm looking for specific boards

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.230 
lumber I'm looking for specific boards
not<00:02:43.600> just<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.990> board<00:02:44.260> foot<00:02:44.530> quantity<00:02:45.070> so<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:46.030> I

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
not just a board foot quantity so that I

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.910 
not just a board foot quantity so that I
know<00:02:46.300> that<00:02:46.510> I've<00:02:46.780> accounted<00:02:47.320> for<00:02:47.530> each<00:02:47.710> and

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
know that I've accounted for each and

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.850 
know that I've accounted for each and
every<00:02:48.130> piece<00:02:48.340> i<00:02:48.580> need<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.940> make<00:02:49.530> really<00:02:50.530> bored

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
every piece i need to make really bored

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.860 
every piece i need to make really bored
