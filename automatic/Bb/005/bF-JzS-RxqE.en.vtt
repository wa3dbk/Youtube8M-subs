00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.109 
right now I've got no feeling in this
and<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.409> flesh<00:01:43.710> part<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.340> my<00:01:44.490> arm<00:01:44.790> here

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
and like the flesh part of my arm here

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.330 
and like the flesh part of my arm here
it's<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.420> completely<00:01:46.259> numb<00:01:46.740> I'm<00:01:46.979> tapping

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
it's just completely numb I'm tapping

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.950 
it's just completely numb I'm tapping
and<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.729> just<00:01:47.939> feels<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.720> know<00:01:48.840> when

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
and it just feels like you know when

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.569 
and it just feels like you know when
you've<00:01:49.110> got<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.619> your<00:01:49.740> arm<00:01:49.950> fell<00:01:50.220> asleep

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
you've got like your arm fell asleep

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.550 
you've got like your arm fell asleep
well<00:01:51.390> that's<00:01:51.540> how<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.780> feels<00:01:51.990> throughout<00:01:52.470> this

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
well that's how it feels throughout this

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.039 
well that's how it feels throughout this
entire<00:01:52.740> area<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.250> guess<00:01:53.430> because<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
entire area I guess because of the

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.630 
entire area I guess because of the
slicing<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
slicing of the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.160 
slicing of the
