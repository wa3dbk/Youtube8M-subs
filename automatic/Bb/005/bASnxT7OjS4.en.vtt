00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
hair and i'm kind of holding them at the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.250 
hair and i'm kind of holding them at the
point<00:01:05.100> where<00:01:05.369> my<00:01:05.670> actual<00:01:06.090> hair<00:01:06.270> ends<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
point where my actual hair ends and the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.200 
point where my actual hair ends and the
extension<00:01:07.619> needs<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.580> i'm<00:01:08.640> holding<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.180> a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
extension needs so i'm holding it for a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.820 
extension needs so i'm holding it for a
few<00:01:09.360> seconds<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.900> then<00:01:10.049> i'm<00:01:10.170> releasing<00:01:10.530> it

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
few seconds and then i'm releasing it

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.890 
few seconds and then i'm releasing it
slowly<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.030> going<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.299> i<00:01:12.479> find<00:01:12.810> that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
slowly and this is going to i find that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.300

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
this helps me blend the hair a lot

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.120 
this helps me blend the hair a lot
better<00:01:14.520> when<00:01:14.790> i'm<00:01:14.909> curling<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.920> then<00:01:16.920> like
