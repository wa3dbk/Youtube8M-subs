the LMS capability with the HP series
because<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.720> can<00:02:34.050> do<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.320> tuning<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.739> get<00:02:34.860> it

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
because you can do the tuning and get it

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.090 
because you can do the tuning and get it
going<00:02:35.010> yourself<00:02:36.110> HP<00:02:37.110> is<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.320> box<00:02:37.620> with<00:02:37.800> four

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
going yourself HP is a box with four

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.270 
going yourself HP is a box with four
inputs<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:38.760> four<00:02:38.940> outputs<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.660> can<00:02:39.840> control

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
inputs and four outputs you can control

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.150 
inputs and four outputs you can control
nitrous<00:02:41.280> water<00:02:41.670> man<00:02:41.940> boost<00:02:42.980> but<00:02:43.980> you're

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
nitrous water man boost but you're

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.180 
nitrous water man boost but you're
limited<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.489> those<00:02:44.640> four<00:02:44.940> inputs<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.600> outputs

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
limited to those four inputs and outputs

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.500 
limited to those four inputs and outputs
so<00:02:47.190> if<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.370> want<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.580> run<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.760> combination<00:02:48.420> of

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
so if you want to run a combination of

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.180 
so if you want to run a combination of
things<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.989> may<00:02:49.140> not<00:02:49.290> be<00:02:49.350> enough<00:02:49.500> for<00:02:50.010> you

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
things that may not be enough for you

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.430 
things that may not be enough for you
yeah<00:02:50.610> but<00:02:50.790> for<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.420> street<00:02:51.660> driven<00:02:52.019> you<00:02:52.320> know

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
yeah but for a street driven you know

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.289 
yeah but for a street driven you know
weekend<00:02:52.860> strip<00:02:53.190> car<00:02:53.430> that's<00:02:54.000> right<00:02:54.150> are

talking<00:02:54.959> man<00:02:55.080> it's<00:02:55.260> laptop<00:02:55.739> tunable<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:56.910> it

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
talking man it's laptop tunable so it

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.580 
talking man it's laptop tunable so it
gives<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.239> guy<00:02:57.390> control<00:02:57.810> if<00:02:57.930> he<00:02:58.049> wants<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.470> but

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
gives a guy control if he wants it but

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.470 
gives a guy control if he wants it but
it<00:02:58.709> also<00:02:58.860> has<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.580> self-learning<00:03:00.030> fuel

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
it also has the self-learning fuel

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.199 
it also has the self-learning fuel
strategies<00:03:01.080> okay<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:02.790> get<00:03:02.940> in<00:03:03.030> there<00:03:03.180> and

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
strategies okay so you get in there and

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.490 
strategies okay so you get in there and
you<00:03:03.360> can<00:03:03.480> get<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.720> close<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.200> will<00:03:04.290> finish

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
you can get it close and it will finish

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.800 
you can get it close and it will finish
it<00:03:04.799> up<00:03:04.920> or

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
it up or

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.470 
it up or
you<00:03:07.020> can<00:03:07.200> go<00:03:07.380> beyond<00:03:07.680> that<00:03:07.880> now<00:03:08.880> where<00:03:09.330> does

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
you can go beyond that now where does

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.170 
you can go beyond that now where does
this<00:03:09.660> start<00:03:10.230> as<00:03:10.500> far<00:03:10.739> as<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.880> know<00:03:12.000> like<00:03:12.150> a

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
you put it on whatever you okay and then

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.809 
you put it on whatever you okay and then
you<00:03:46.200> mentioned<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:47.280> LS<00:03:47.580> series

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
you mentioned the the LS series

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.000 
you mentioned the the LS series

go with it

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.610 
go with it
we<00:04:33.420> can<00:04:33.600> trip<00:04:33.840> we<00:04:33.990> can<00:04:34.140> now<00:04:34.290> control

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
we can trip we can now control

electronic transmissions with this unit

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.480 
electronic transmissions with this unit
so<00:04:37.260> you're<00:04:37.470> on<00:04:37.590> you're<00:04:37.710> not<00:04:37.740> by<00:04:37.920> two<00:04:37.980> separate

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
so you're on you're not by two separate

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.890 
so you're on you're not by two separate
boxes<00:04:38.880> for<00:04:39.090> your<00:04:39.210> one<00:04:39.360> for<00:04:39.480> your<00:04:39.540> fans<00:04:39.750> may

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
boxes for your one for your fans may

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.800 
boxes for your one for your fans may
feel<00:04:40.140> fear<00:04:40.410> fuel<00:04:40.710> so<00:04:41.100> our<00:04:41.250> engine<00:04:41.640> ECM<00:04:41.970> now<00:04:42.480> is

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
feel fear fuel so our engine ECM now is

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.020 
feel fear fuel so our engine ECM now is
manager<00:04:43.290> transmission<00:04:43.950> right<00:04:44.130> so<00:04:44.340> do<00:04:44.940> you

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
manager transmission right so do you

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.930 
manager transmission right so do you
know<00:04:45.150> do<00:04:45.540> they<00:04:45.630> communicate<00:04:45.870> inside<00:04:46.940> here's

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
know do they communicate inside here's

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.260 
know do they communicate inside here's
the<00:04:48.060> same<00:04:48.240> sensors<00:04:48.720> you<00:04:49.110> know<00:04:49.200> I<00:04:49.740> guess<00:04:50.550> a<00:04:50.820> lot

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
the same sensors you know I guess a lot

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.210 
the same sensors you know I guess a lot
of<00:04:51.300> times<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:51.830> transmission<00:04:52.830> controller

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
of times the transmission controller

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.090 
of times the transmission controller
will<00:04:53.490> need<00:04:53.640> to<00:04:53.760> see<00:04:53.940> throttle<00:04:54.360> position<00:04:55.100> yeah

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
will need to see throttle position yeah

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.520 
will need to see throttle position yeah
I'll<00:04:56.580> be<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:56.880> same<00:04:57.060> same<00:04:57.840> sensor<00:04:58.230> you're<00:04:58.410> not

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
I'll be the same same sensor you're not

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.250 
I'll be the same same sensor you're not
going<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.830> page<00:04:59.160> sensors<00:04:59.700> and<00:05:00.660> what's<00:05:00.870> really

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
going to page sensors and what's really

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.560 
going to page sensors and what's really
unique<00:05:01.290> about<00:05:01.620> it<00:05:01.800> say<00:05:02.070> a<00:05:02.100> guy's<00:05:02.370> a<00:05:02.400> tuner<00:05:02.970> he

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
unique about it say a guy's a tuner he

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.680 
unique about it say a guy's a tuner he
knows<00:05:03.780> that<00:05:04.050> he<00:05:04.230> had<00:05:04.970> this<00:05:05.970> transmission

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
knows that he had this transmission

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.830 
knows that he had this transmission
working<00:05:07.110> right<00:05:07.290> it<00:05:07.530> has<00:05:08.190> its<00:05:08.340> own<00:05:08.490> tables<00:05:09.090> yes

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
working right it has its own tables yes

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.560 
working right it has its own tables yes
so<00:05:10.230> I<00:05:10.620> have<00:05:11.610> an<00:05:11.730> engine<00:05:11.970> over<00:05:12.150> here<00:05:12.330> that<00:05:12.420> made

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
so I have an engine over here that made

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.240 
so I have an engine over here that made
700<00:05:13.110> horsepower<00:05:13.320> I<00:05:13.530> know<00:05:13.620> I've<00:05:13.800> got<00:05:13.950> a<00:05:13.980> fuel

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
700 horsepower I know I've got a fuel

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.980 
700 horsepower I know I've got a fuel
strategy<00:05:14.820> for<00:05:15.120> that<00:05:15.240> right<00:05:15.660> I've<00:05:15.840> got<00:05:15.960> a

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
strategy for that right I've got a

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.620 
strategy for that right I've got a
transmission<00:05:16.590> strategy<00:05:17.040> for<00:05:17.250> for<00:05:17.550> LA<00:05:17.820> te<00:05:18.000> dip

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
transmission strategy for for LA te dip

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.730 
transmission strategy for for LA te dip
and<00:05:19.310> the<00:05:20.310> next<00:05:20.490> motor<00:05:20.730> I<00:05:21.060> only<00:05:21.390> want<00:05:21.630> the

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
and the next motor I only want the

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.770 
and the next motor I only want the
transmission<00:05:22.740> strategy<00:05:23.220> I<00:05:23.460> pull<00:05:23.850> that<00:05:24.060> pop<00:05:24.600> it

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
transmission strategy I pull that pop it

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.870 
transmission strategy I pull that pop it
in<00:05:24.900> the<00:05:25.530> mixer<00:05:25.710> combine<00:05:25.980> them<00:05:26.400> so<00:05:26.520> I'm<00:05:26.700> not

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
in the mixer combine them so I'm not

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.120 
in the mixer combine them so I'm not
