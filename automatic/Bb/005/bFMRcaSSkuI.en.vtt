a<00:02:14.660> good<00:02:14.810> example<00:02:15.290> because<00:02:15.610> one<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:16.640> the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
a good example because one of the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.850 
a good example because one of the
pinball<00:02:17.150> tables<00:02:17.570> has<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.750> very<00:02:18.050> odd<00:02:18.110> placement

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
of buttons that makes it almost

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.540 
of buttons that makes it almost
impossible<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.510> play<00:02:21.130> so<00:02:22.130> we're<00:02:22.250> gonna<00:02:22.340> go

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
impossible to play so we're gonna go

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
buttons you can see are unusually put up

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.710 
buttons you can see are unusually put up
here<00:04:17.210> so<00:04:17.870> I'm<00:04:17.930> gonna<00:04:18.020> map<00:04:18.260> this<00:04:18.440> to<00:04:18.650> a

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.920 

and<00:04:21.720> I'm<00:04:21.810> gonna<00:04:21.900> map<00:04:22.080> this<00:04:22.260> to<00:04:22.440> be<00:04:26.780> I'm<00:04:27.780> not

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
and I'm gonna map this to be I'm not

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.830 
and I'm gonna map this to be I'm not
sure<00:04:27.990> that'll<00:04:28.350> work<00:04:28.470> a<00:04:30.440> second<00:04:31.440> here<00:04:32.840> yeah

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
sure that'll work a second here yeah

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.140 
sure that'll work a second here yeah
let's<00:04:33.870> try<00:04:34.260> this<00:04:34.320> again<00:04:34.910> that's<00:04:35.910> probably

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
let's try this again that's probably

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.840 
let's try this again that's probably
pretty<00:04:36.270> close<00:04:36.510> so<00:04:36.870> we<00:04:37.500> find<00:04:37.740> out<00:04:37.920> by<00:04:38.130> taking

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
pretty close so we find out by taking

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.390 
pretty close so we find out by taking
the<00:04:39.090> screen<00:04:39.360> off<00:04:39.510> by<00:04:39.690> pressing<00:04:39.900> plus<00:04:40.260> and<00:04:40.560> then

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
the screen off by pressing plus and then

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.490 
the screen off by pressing plus and then
we<00:04:41.490> see<00:04:41.730> if<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.180> buttons<00:04:42.480> work<00:04:42.690> as<00:04:42.930> we<00:04:43.110> expect

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
we see if the buttons work as we expect

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.960 
we see if the buttons work as we expect
as<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:43.890> can<00:04:44.100> see<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.310> magnet<00:04:44.640> saves<00:04:44.820> are

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
as you can see the magnet saves are

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.510 
as you can see the magnet saves are
pushing<00:04:45.150> fine<00:04:45.480> with<00:04:45.690> a<00:04:45.720> and<00:04:45.990> B<00:04:46.050> perfect<00:04:46.740> now<00:04:47.460> we

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
pushing fine with a and B perfect now we

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.950 
pushing fine with a and B perfect now we
can't<00:04:47.820> really<00:04:47.880> do<00:04:48.150> this<00:04:48.300> because<00:04:48.480> this<00:04:48.690> is<00:04:48.750> an

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
can't really do this because this is an

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.450 
can't really do this because this is an
analog<00:04:49.290> type<00:04:49.530> control<00:04:49.890> so<00:04:49.980> we<00:04:50.070> still<00:04:50.280> have<00:04:50.370> to

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
analog type control so we still have to

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.400 
analog type control so we still have to
shoot<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:50.790> ball<00:04:50.910> with<00:04:51.090> our<00:04:51.180> finger<00:04:51.510> but<00:04:52.290> as

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
shoot the ball with our finger but as

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.290 
shoot the ball with our finger but as
you<00:04:52.530> can<00:04:52.680> see<00:04:52.920> I<00:04:53.130> am<00:04:53.280> now<00:04:53.460> completely<00:04:53.730> playing

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
you can see I am now completely playing

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.870 
you can see I am now completely playing
with<00:04:54.510> a<00:04:54.540> wireless<00:04:55.230> controller<00:04:55.710> with<00:04:56.460> physical

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.420 
with a wireless controller with physical
buttons<00:04:57.240> which<00:04:57.480> of<00:04:57.660> course<00:04:57.690> make<00:04:58.430> pinball

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
buttons which of course make pinball

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.560 
buttons which of course make pinball
just<00:05:00.150> that<00:05:00.360> much<00:05:00.540> more<00:05:00.600> fun<00:05:01.400> now<00:05:02.400> no<00:05:02.610> time<00:05:02.940> with
