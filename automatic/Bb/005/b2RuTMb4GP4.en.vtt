 to the youtube channel theissen to captive 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.160
 I am being that you can find me in 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.529

 facebook by aysÃ©n and also if you want 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.550
 you can go through our website 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:31.129
 our blog is there code code dot net 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.509
 today we are going to have a compilation myself 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:33.860
 I think quite interesting from 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.840
 Free applications for a limited time 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.270
 but before I start I'm going to 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.969
 recommend the application of the week the 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.100
 appstore in itunes store not that it is not 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.079
 more nor less than the famous angry birds 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.700
 starwars that I already talk about it in the 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.989
 past and in the description of the video 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.760
 you have a link to watch the video 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.070
 analysis and download the application if 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.000
 you want, not without more, we start 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.000
 with today's tour 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.600
 today we start with an application that 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.449
 call cold your life you're calendar that 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.430
 it's a calendar application but 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.440
 perfectly integrated with gestures and with 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.080
 A different pure very nice interface 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.220
 'style windows phone or ios 7 let's 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.390
 enter the application so that it made me 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.950
 a little bit what is the interface for 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.300
 start we can see here the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.160
 calendar we can move by the 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.330
 different days but if we make a gesture 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.880
 down see what we see the 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.910
 full monthly calendar and we can 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.229
 to spend that way from month to month the truth is 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.940
 that is pretty good and notice that in 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.160
 red color appear the days where 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.330
 we have events marked in agreement 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.070
 note that it is a calendar 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.229
 conventional but that's pretty good 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.759
 because at a glance we'll see which ones 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.649
 are the next appointments that we 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.390
 We have not if you do not like the application 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.729
 native of calendars is I think that 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.860
 it's quite interesting enough we're going to 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.660
 the adjustments first tell you that we can 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.940
 put here all the calendars of 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.490
 icloud and gmail that we use 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.330
 in our system not a little bit more the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.649
 truth is that it is an application of 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.240
 calendar does not have many options either 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.580
 more simply when you give the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.679
 button you can also add a note 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.509
 so that you can define when 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.530
 is going to celebrate this note when it's going to 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.450
 end if it goes 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.610
 be held throughout the day and when 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.410
 You give the dead to notice that you can 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.390
 tell him I warned you on a date 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.709
 determined to agree that 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.959
 You can also tell him that they are going to 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.209
 participate different people in this 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.370
 event is not going to be held in a 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.530
 determined place of agreement to fix that 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.640
 here we can add a note to note that 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.750
 here we can this is to repeat it is 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.880
 quite interesting also for 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.380
 repeat a task periodically by 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.730
 example I on the 1st of each month 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.580
 I do a calibration of a thousand devices 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.760
 ipad macbook pro 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.380
 iphone and company and I do not know then this 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.700
 could serve I do not put it once and 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.530
 then I tell him to repeat it monthly 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.480
 and then here you have the little button 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.880
 delete a task as you see is a 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.100
 cool interface according to you 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.100
 I recommend to all of you we continue 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.390
 Video play is a universal application 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.709
 of video and it's tremendously good because 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.750
 we apply a series of filters in 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.549
 our videos that are awesome 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.629
 how will I show you now some of 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.519
 they simply enter the 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.950
 application and note that the interface is 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.420
 very very simple to agree that 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.310
 simply in this area that I am 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.690
 painting right now, what is it 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.459
 where we see knowing the previous one of what 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.170
 let's record us with this 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.150
 little button we can activate the flash with 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.650
 this little button we deactivated and little 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.780
 more the truth is that he has nothing else 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.730
 okay just down here we go 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.980
 to be able to choose a series of filters but 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.810
 see what this cool to set this 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.790
 here also pretty cool out there and 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.230
 We are in front of a pool 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.209
 we can put this like that with some effects 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.069
 of water or be with a background has been a 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.019
 landscape with a few light effects 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.760
 cool fix the filters we have 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.530
 to record video I hope you are 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.150
 seeing the truth is that the background 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.950
 It is not the most appropriate because you are 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.560
 watching the macbook pro but the truth is 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.900
 I hope you see that the filters are 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.359
 really very cool and with a background 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.760
 you're going to record a landscape of what 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.129
 that is to fix you this that scares you are 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.079
 there quietly with dark of 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.500
 agreement and from the group reason you see these 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.330
 screen effects 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.530
 we have a series of very good filters 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.970
 the application as I tell you does not do more 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.620
 only these filters but it's that 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.330
 we have in this of fire and this is the 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.800
 last filter we have done a tour by 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.050
 all the filters we just touch 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.640
 here and we start recording accordingly and 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.410
 see you later just when we want 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.299
 to re-record because we simply press 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.489
 in the little square he stops recording 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.079
 we can save this video on the reel 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.970
 of agreement and then already of the reel 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.400
 obviously we can share it where 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.800
 we would like an application 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.490
 incredible filters I recommend it and 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.490
 we continue 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.290
 it's time for today's video game 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.120
 it is neither more nor less than a videogame 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.060
 universal called hand 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.920
 baron 2 is a baseball old man I'm not 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.960
 very fan of baseball the truth but this 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.970
 video game hooks and taints because 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.770
 they have two game modes we can play 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.840
 in a multiplayer and we can also 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.460
 play on a single player here we can 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.650
 he decide then our category of 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.450
 I agree the language and such do not notice that 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.650
 the single player is fun but 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.510
 what am I cool is the multiplayer 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.690
 because we can compete with our 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.460
 friends or enemies to try to win a 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.980
 duel we are not going to give the click match 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.270
 to look for a random opponent and power 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.890
 face us as we had found 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.360
 this character who is a real person 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.040
 who is also looking for games like 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.930
 us not so let's play a 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.000
 little bit so you can see what it is 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.260
 how to play in the end do not notice that 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.660
 here we have the bar the first one 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.220
 has the bar wins is yours and this 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.810
 bar in the enemy's we're going to see 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.370
 summarize fix that is played with the 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.510
 gyroscope we have to move 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.520
 you have seen 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.870
 we have to move the ipad in this 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.140
 case something is a universal application 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.090
 to move that little white dot and put it 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.160
 right in front of the ball that we have 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.210
 released and when the ball is in the 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.190
 moment at the point 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.259
 to give you we have to press any 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.440
 part of the screen and we hit move 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:46.240
 this in agreement we hit and we hit this 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.560
 is the videogame to notice that right now 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.539
 we are tied, it has made me a ball 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.819
 curve has made me a strike sometimes what 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.500
 I move around here so I did not give to see 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:55.180
 now today this ball was slow but it 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.830
 given good has taken me quite an advantage 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.440
 the enemy my rival has made a hammer 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.580
 they have sued out I am going to lose but 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.289
 well this is the video game the truth is 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.389
 I 'm a baseball fan, you can fly 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.889
 quite this video game and if not because 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.180
 I'm not a fan as I tell you the truth is 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.669
 which is a pretty pretty video game 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.440
 handsome as I hope you are watching 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:13.180
 this is a home run, but I've already 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.210
 lost the game I lost with my 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.139
 rival 45,000 who have won me the round 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.550
 not good then nothing 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:22.050
 this is the video game I recommend it 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.050
 very much and we continue 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.940
 good friends, we've arrived at 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.530
 end of today's tour with an app 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.350
 for iphone that as you are seeing in 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.790
 screen is called let it is a bullshit 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.100
 one to know a nonsense that is not worth to 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.200
 nothing but it seems cool to me I like it 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.640
 I am an electronic professional and the 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.800
 truth is that that of playing with leds and 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.360
 so I've done it many times I did not 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.090
 it seems pretty funny and maybe 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.160
 Some of you are interested in some 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.360
 this application to do some of 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.620
 these effects I know that I know 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.480
 happens for example for me to record a 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.980
 video by in this application on the ipad 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.320
 that is not universal but good with 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.360
 retina peace looks relatively good and does not 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.430
 I know how to put something that moves a text that 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.260
 go moving accordingly with effects 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.610
 of leds and I know that there may be a 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.590
 video a little more original more 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.030
 curious is not very simple to note that 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:10.030
 you here can write what 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:12.250
 you want hello and you can save 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.870
 the text hello happy new year up 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.400
 then and senna code dot net which is what 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.290
 that I'm going to put you can not say that 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.060
 the LEDs are going to be round or square 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.710
 you can put the resolution hd 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.450
 you can mark the speed from here 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.180
 you can tell him that when he finishes he vibrates and 

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.610
 repeat or not agree you can tell 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.050
 that the text be upside down in agreement and 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.020
 here we have a little button that puts 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.300
 show message 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.830
 when you give it appears this message is 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.300
 a bullshit but I like the 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.069
 application and maybe one of 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.379
 you also like not to notice that 

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:42.259
 you put a text and that text is rotating to 

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:44.330
 mode of a panel of LEDs, I do not think 

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:46.039
 it's pretty pretty funny me so 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.720
 least I will use it and maybe some 

00:07:46.039 --> 00:07:49.490
 of you too it's cool for you to notice that 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.199
 well it looks the other way around, well this is the 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.220
 application and this has been the tour today 

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:54.229
 I hope you liked the 

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.419
 collection of applications and we 're going 

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:59.409
 to see if you want in a next video 

00:07:56.419 --> 00:07:59.409
 good weekend
