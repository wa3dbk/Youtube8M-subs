00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
years and I've always been quite

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.380

impressed with the design and quality of
the<00:00:21.660> product<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.140> when<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.289> saw<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.619> keyboard

the product so when I saw this keyboard
on<00:00:23.340> Amazon<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.090> 15<00:00:24.539> pounds<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.080> thought<00:00:25.560> it

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
on Amazon for 15 pounds I thought it

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.470 
on Amazon for 15 pounds I thought it
could<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> good<00:00:26.160> steal<00:00:26.580> because<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.330> should

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
could be a good steal because it should

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.779 
could be a good steal because it should
retail<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:28.050> around<00:00:28.109> 40<00:00:28.619> pounds<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.640> let's

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
retail for around 40 pounds so let's

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.130 
retail for around 40 pounds so let's
take<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> look<00:00:30.119> inside<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.510> see<00:00:30.779> what<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:30.990> get

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
take a look inside and see what we get

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.479 
take a look inside and see what we get
let's<00:00:34.140> add<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.440> out<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.710> box<00:00:34.829> all<00:00:35.070> ready<00:00:35.250> to

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
let's add this out the box all ready to

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.160 
let's add this out the box all ready to
have<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> go<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.719> thought<00:00:36.899> I'd<00:00:37.050> just

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
have a go of it but I thought I'd just

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.280 
have a go of it but I thought I'd just
repack<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.160> see<00:00:38.340> how<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.670> comes

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
repack it so you can see how it comes

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.540 
repack it so you can see how it comes
and<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.320> don't<00:00:40.770> get<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.890> great<00:00:41.070> deal<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and you don't get a great deal in the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.250 
and you don't get a great deal in the
box<00:00:41.760> just<00:00:42.120> pretty<00:00:42.300> much<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.570> keyboard<00:00:43.020> as<00:00:43.170> you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
box just pretty much the keyboard as you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.170 
box just pretty much the keyboard as you
can<00:00:43.410> see<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.219> don't<00:00:44.430> get<00:00:44.550> batteries<00:00:44.910> so

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
can see here you don't get batteries so

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.639 
can see here you don't get batteries so
you<00:00:45.239> will<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.719> use<00:00:46.110> your<00:00:46.260> own<00:00:46.289> batteries

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
you will have to use your own batteries

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.740 
you will have to use your own batteries
but<00:00:47.190> 15<00:00:47.610> pounds<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.059> wasn't<00:00:48.329> too<00:00:48.420> bad<00:00:48.600> about

similar and the Apple keyboard is
obviously<00:01:31.799> made<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.369> aluminium<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.420> does

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
obviously made of aluminium so it does

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.420 
obviously made of aluminium so it does
feel<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> lot<00:01:33.930> more<00:01:33.960> premium<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.189> fair

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
feel a lot more premium but to be fair

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.640 
feel a lot more premium but to be fair
for<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:36.030> fully<00:01:36.360> plastic<00:01:36.960> keyboard<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.439> does

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
for a fully plastic keyboard this does

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.010 
for a fully plastic keyboard this does
feel<00:01:37.860> good<00:01:38.220> quality<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.880> quite<00:01:39.119> impressed<00:01:39.479> so

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
feel good quality and quite impressed so

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.140

the Apple keyboard retails for 60 pounds

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.600 
the Apple keyboard retails for 60 pounds
the<00:01:42.630> Anker<00:01:42.960> keyboard<00:01:43.350> retails<00:01:43.799> for<00:01:43.890> 5<00:01:44.189> pounds

the Anker keyboard retails for 5 pounds

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.429 
the Anker keyboard retails for 5 pounds
but<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.790> did<00:01:45.000> pick<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.270> up<00:01:45.329> for<00:01:45.450> 15<00:01:45.810> pounds<00:01:46.259> on

but I did pick it up for 15 pounds on
Amazon<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.610> think<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.909> 15<00:01:48.210> pounds<00:01:48.390> it's

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
Amazon and I think it 15 pounds it's

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.899 
Amazon and I think it 15 pounds it's
definitely<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> bit<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.829> steal<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.790> this

not too much experience with it overall
the<00:02:41.129> layout<00:02:41.370> is<00:02:41.519> very<00:02:41.580> similar<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.209> Mac

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360

keyboard<00:02:42.750> what<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:42.930> am<00:02:43.080> used<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.500> but<00:02:44.040> there<00:02:44.190> is

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
keyboard what I am used to but there is

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.650 
keyboard what I am used to but there is
a<00:02:44.310> difference<00:02:44.670> between<00:02:44.849> the<00:02:45.180> enter<00:02:45.540> button

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
a difference between the enter button

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.600 
a difference between the enter button
it's<00:02:45.930> different<00:02:46.200> size<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:47.040> different<00:02:47.400> shapes

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
it's different size and different shapes

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.789 
it's different size and different shapes
so<00:02:47.910> I'm<00:02:48.000> really<00:02:48.420> pressing<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.410> wrong<00:02:49.620> key

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
so I'm really pressing the wrong key

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.020 
so I'm really pressing the wrong key

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
when I want to hit enter which is a bit

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.440 
when I want to hit enter which is a bit
annoying

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
annoying

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.819 
annoying

Mario uses keyboard but other than that
it's<00:02:55.230> very<00:02:55.290> similar<00:02:55.799> to<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.459> Mac<00:02:56.610> keyboard<00:02:56.940> in

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.050 
would set a little bit more moisture
than<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.139> Mac<00:03:34.859> keyboard<00:03:35.310> which<00:03:35.549> is<00:03:35.579> Kandra
