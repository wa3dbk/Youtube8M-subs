00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
can you know get various levels even

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.640 
can you know get various levels even
without<00:00:12.990> having<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.380> remove<00:00:13.500> your

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
without having to remove your

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.770 
without having to remove your
bookshelves<00:00:14.099> every<00:00:14.370> time<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.790> majority<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.690> the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
bookshelves every time a majority of the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.340 
bookshelves every time a majority of the
time<00:00:15.990> they<00:00:16.199> have<00:00:17.300> sticky<00:00:18.300> pistons<00:00:18.690> on<00:00:18.960> each<00:00:19.199> of

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
time they have sticky pistons on each of

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.929 
time they have sticky pistons on each of
the<00:00:19.410> walls<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.220> can<00:00:20.340> move<00:00:20.430> like<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.789> whole

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
the walls so you can move like the whole

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.960 
the walls so you can move like the whole
wall<00:00:21.210> back<00:00:21.590> that's<00:00:22.590> really<00:00:23.189> inefficient<00:00:23.519> I

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
wall back that's really inefficient I

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.060 
wall back that's really inefficient I
think<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.480> know<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:24.779> people<00:00:24.869> who<00:00:25.109> can't

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
think and you know for people who can't

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.130 
think and you know for people who can't
find<00:00:26.310> too<00:00:26.609> many<00:00:26.820> slam<00:00:27.210> bowls<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.689> mean<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:27.930> one

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
find too many slam bowls I mean this one

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.569 
find too many slam bowls I mean this one
still<00:00:28.410> requires<00:00:28.710> about<00:00:28.920> eight<00:00:29.429> at<00:00:30.330> max<00:00:31.369> but<00:00:32.369> um

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
still requires about eight at max but um

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.380 
still requires about eight at max but um
yeah<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.480> what<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.469> does<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:35.030> we've<00:00:36.030> got<00:00:36.210> two

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
yeah so what it does is we've got two

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.840 
yeah so what it does is we've got two
levers<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.739> them<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.190> makes<00:00:38.399> us<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.760> we

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
levers one of them that makes us that we

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.479 
levers one of them that makes us that we
have<00:00:38.969> really<00:00:39.270> low<00:00:39.390> levels<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.219> other<00:00:41.219> has

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
have really low levels and the other has

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.430 
have really low levels and the other has
so<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:41.910> medium<00:00:42.120> levels<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.320> is

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
so we have medium levels so this one is

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.260 
so we have medium levels so this one is
the<00:00:43.559> low<00:00:43.649> level<00:00:43.800> one<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.969> one<00:00:45.090> does

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
the low level one and so that one does

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.229 
the low level one and so that one does
is<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.539> pops<00:00:45.750> up<00:00:45.930> these<00:00:46.260> four<00:00:47.190> blocks<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
is it pops up these four blocks in the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.029 
is it pops up these four blocks in the
corners<00:00:48.600> here<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.469> well<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.680> does<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.010> it

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
corners here so well that does is it

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.639 
corners here so well that does is it
blocks<00:00:50.370> off<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:51.120> corner<00:00:51.809> piston<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.440> mean

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
blocks off this corner piston I mean

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.470 
blocks off this corner piston I mean
bookcases<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.399> corner<00:00:53.760> bookcase<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.270> this

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
bookcases this corner bookcase is this

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.240 
bookcases this corner bookcase is this
one<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:54.960> one<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.739> all<00:00:55.860> that's<00:00:55.980> left<00:00:56.100> is

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
one and that one so all that's left is

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.939 
one and that one so all that's left is
these<00:00:56.460> two<00:00:56.730> there<00:00:57.390> there<00:00:57.780> there<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.170> there<00:00:58.379> so

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
these two there there there and there so

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.740 
these two there there there and there so
that's<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.160> total<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.399> six<00:00:59.579> bookcases<00:01:00.059> which

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
that's a total of six bookcases which

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.810 
that's a total of six bookcases which
makes<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.260> get<00:01:01.530> all<00:01:01.710> things<00:01:02.340> ranging

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
makes it so you get all things ranging

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.120 
makes it so you get all things ranging
between<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.449> know<00:01:03.570> maybe<00:01:03.989> up<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.199> 15<00:01:04.830> at<00:01:05.100> max

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
between you know maybe up to 15 at max

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.920 
between you know maybe up to 15 at max
so<00:01:08.130> yeah<00:01:08.250> that's<00:01:08.369> what<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.909> leaver<00:01:09.180> does<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
so yeah that's what that leaver does the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.899 
so yeah that's what that leaver does the
other<00:01:10.110> one<00:01:10.260> lifts<00:01:11.130> up<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.250> opposite<00:01:11.729> blocks

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
other one lifts up the opposite blocks

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.530 
other one lifts up the opposite blocks
these<00:01:12.869> four<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:15.180> doesn't

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
these four and with that it doesn't

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.149 
these four and with that it doesn't
block<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.930> many<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> max<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.830> might<00:01:16.979> get

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
block as many so the max you might get

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.289 
block as many so the max you might get
maybe<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.790> 35<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.580> if<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.700> bring<00:01:20.939> up<00:01:21.060> both

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
maybe like 35 and if you bring up both

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.600 
maybe like 35 and if you bring up both
of<00:01:21.330> them<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:22.380> completely<00:01:23.100> get<00:01:23.369> rid<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.520> all

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
of them you completely get rid of all

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.280 
of them you completely get rid of all
the<00:01:23.729> bookcases<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.659> get<00:01:24.840> your<00:01:24.900> low

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
the bookcases so you can get your low

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.570 
the bookcases so you can get your low
level<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.770> Shan<00:01:25.920> Vince<00:01:26.130> arrangement<00:01:26.490> from

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
level and Shan Vince arrangement from

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.300 
level and Shan Vince arrangement from
one<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.909> five<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:29.610> that's<00:01:30.000> what<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.210> does<00:01:30.720> and

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
one to five so that's what that does and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.740 
one to five so that's what that does and
it's<00:01:32.310> really<00:01:32.369> simple<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.689> thought

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
it's really simple and I just thought

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.590 
it's really simple and I just thought
throw<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.470> tutorial<00:01:34.829> your<00:01:35.250> way<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.600> let's

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
second order this also gives me a

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.250 
second order this also gives me a
staircase<00:02:50.740> down<00:02:51.100> so<00:02:51.810> first<00:02:52.810> thing<00:02:52.930> you<00:02:53.020> can<00:02:53.080> do

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
staircase down so first thing you can do

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.960 
staircase down so first thing you can do
is<00:02:53.380> dig<00:02:53.560> out<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.710> block<00:02:53.950> underneath<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.670> labor

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
is dig out a block underneath the labor

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.420 
is dig out a block underneath the labor

put a piece of restaurant here and then

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.180 
put a piece of restaurant here and then
put<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.180> repeatedly<00:02:58.540> well<00:02:58.980> just<00:02:59.980> flick

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
put it repeatedly well just flick

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.830 
put it repeatedly well just flick
believer<00:03:00.430> um<00:03:01.180> you're<00:03:01.450> not<00:03:01.480> gonna<00:03:01.630> have<00:03:01.750> to

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
believer um you're not gonna have to

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.920 
believer um you're not gonna have to
worry<00:03:01.990> about<00:03:03.150> having<00:03:04.150> block<00:03:04.450> there<00:03:04.630> because

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
worry about having block there because

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.310 
worry about having block there because
the<00:03:05.170> repeater<00:03:05.830> will<00:03:06.010> still<00:03:06.160> get<00:03:06.280> power<00:03:07.320> next

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
the repeater will still get power next

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.470 
the repeater will still get power next
thing<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:08.470> gonna<00:03:08.530> want<00:03:08.740> to<00:03:08.830> do<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:09.400> figure<00:03:10.330> out

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
thing you gonna want to do is figure out

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.340 
thing you gonna want to do is figure out
where<00:03:10.720> we<00:03:10.840> are<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:11.110> suppose<00:03:11.640> lock<00:03:12.640> back<00:03:12.850> there

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
where we are I suppose lock back there

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.660 
where we are I suppose lock back there
aha<00:03:14.350> so<00:03:14.770> here<00:03:15.040> we<00:03:15.160> are<00:03:15.280> underneath<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:16.380> well

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
aha so here we are underneath the well

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.060 
aha so here we are underneath the well
sticky<00:03:18.670> pistons<00:03:19.290> let's<00:03:20.290> take<00:03:20.440> out<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.620> blocks

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
sticky pistons let's take out the blocks

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.070 
sticky pistons let's take out the blocks
underneath<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.640> stick<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:21.910> pittance<00:03:22.300> why<00:03:23.020> do

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
underneath the stick to pittance why do

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.800 
underneath the stick to pittance why do
we<00:03:23.230> have<00:03:23.290> sand<00:03:23.650> used<00:03:24.640> we're<00:03:25.480> going<00:03:25.570> to<00:03:25.660> put<00:03:25.750> a

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
we have sand used we're going to put a

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.090 
we have sand used we're going to put a
block<00:03:25.989> in<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.230> center<00:03:26.500> of<00:03:26.530> all<00:03:26.739> of<00:03:26.800> them<00:03:26.950> and

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
block in the center of all of them and

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.650 
block in the center of all of them and
put<00:03:27.820> torches<00:03:28.239> on<00:03:28.690> all<00:03:28.810> sides<00:03:29.140> of<00:03:29.320> it<00:03:30.360> so<00:03:31.360> now<00:03:31.450> as

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
put torches on all sides of it so now as

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.680 
put torches on all sides of it so now as
you<00:03:31.750> can<00:03:31.840> see<00:03:32.430> those<00:03:33.430> four<00:03:34.030> pistons<00:03:34.570> are

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
you can see those four pistons are

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.449 
you can see those four pistons are
extended<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.500> ones<00:03:35.680> in<00:03:35.800> the<00:03:35.890> edge<00:03:35.980> just<00:03:36.250> not

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
extended the ones in the edge just not

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.979 
extended the ones in the edge just not
on<00:03:36.550> the<00:03:36.610> corners<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.000> edges<00:03:37.239> then<00:03:37.900> we're

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
on the corners the edges then we're

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.440 
on the corners the edges then we're
going<00:03:38.080> to<00:03:38.140> put<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.700> torch<00:03:39.700> right<00:03:39.910> underneath<00:03:40.180> it

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
going to put a torch right underneath it

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.550 
going to put a torch right underneath it
to<00:03:40.540> turn<00:03:40.690> them<00:03:40.840> off<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.140> they're<00:03:41.260> not<00:03:41.380> always

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
to turn them off so they're not always

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.110 
to turn them off so they're not always
on<00:03:41.940> able<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:43.000> compute<00:03:43.510> there<00:03:43.780> just<00:03:44.709> for<00:03:45.120> later

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
on able to compute there just for later

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.199 
on able to compute there just for later
yeah<00:03:47.100> next<00:03:48.100> we're<00:03:48.190> going<00:03:48.280> to<00:03:48.340> want<00:03:48.550> to<00:03:48.670> put<00:03:48.910> a

yeah next we're going to want to put a

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.250 
yeah next we're going to want to put a
redstone<00:03:49.900> torch<00:03:50.110> there<00:03:51.510> put<00:03:52.510> it<00:03:52.600> up<00:03:52.660> here<00:03:52.900> here

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
redstone torch there put it up here here

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.810 
redstone torch there put it up here here
but<00:03:54.010> this<00:03:54.130> is<00:03:54.250> what<00:03:54.400> this<00:03:54.519> is<00:03:54.580> good<00:03:54.790> that

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
but this is what this is good that

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.100 
but this is what this is good that
repeater<00:03:55.330> is<00:03:55.390> going<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.600> do<00:03:55.660> is<00:03:55.780> carry<00:03:55.989> the

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
repeater is going to do is carry the

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.460 
repeater is going to do is carry the
current<00:03:56.440> from<00:03:56.739> this<00:03:57.640> torch<00:03:57.989> which<00:03:58.989> is<00:03:59.170> from

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
current from this torch which is from

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.920 
current from this torch which is from
the<00:04:00.280> other<00:04:00.430> torch<00:04:00.989> which<00:04:01.989> is<00:04:02.140> from<00:04:02.350> this<00:04:03.040> torch

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
the other torch which is from this torch

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.330 
the other torch which is from this torch
so<00:04:04.930> it<00:04:05.019> just<00:04:05.170> loops<00:04:05.350> around<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.920> heads<00:04:06.130> to<00:04:06.250> the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
so it just loops around and heads to the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.810 
so it just loops around and heads to the
other<00:04:06.489> one<00:04:06.640> wix2<00:04:07.630> it<00:04:08.110> saves<00:04:08.670> when<00:04:09.670> you're

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
other one wix2 it saves when you're

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.890 
other one wix2 it saves when you're
trying<00:04:10.239> to<00:04:10.330> compact<00:04:10.750> it<00:04:11.140> I<00:04:11.500> suppose<00:04:11.830> oops<00:04:12.900> now

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
trying to compact it I suppose oops now

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.800 
trying to compact it I suppose oops now
we're<00:04:14.050> going<00:04:14.140> to<00:04:14.200> put<00:04:14.260> that<00:04:14.620> there<00:04:15.419> run<00:04:16.419> a<00:04:16.450> line

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
we're going to put that there run a line

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.830 
we're going to put that there run a line
from<00:04:17.410> this<00:04:17.620> torch<00:04:17.859> into<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:19.030> first<00:04:19.359> torch

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
from this torch into the first torch

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.750 
from this torch into the first torch
right<00:04:20.049> here<00:04:20.260> that<00:04:21.039> makes<00:04:21.220> it<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:21.460> that<00:04:21.489> they're

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
right here that makes it so that they're

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.420 
right here that makes it so that they're
not<00:04:21.789> on<00:04:22.120> all<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.330> time<00:04:22.570> so<00:04:23.380> that<00:04:23.560> none<00:04:24.039> of<00:04:24.070> the

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
not on all the time so that none of the

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.650 
not on all the time so that none of the
Pistons<00:04:24.970> are<00:04:25.090> up<00:04:25.180> right<00:04:25.390> now

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
Pistons are up right now

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.680 
Pistons are up right now
so<00:04:25.780> we<00:04:25.870> might<00:04:25.990> as<00:04:26.050> well<00:04:26.170> just<00:04:26.970> put<00:04:27.970> our<00:04:28.150> blocks

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
so we might as well just put our blocks

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.620 
so we might as well just put our blocks
in<00:04:28.990> here<00:04:29.110> now<00:04:30.000> so<00:04:31.000> now<00:04:31.090> we<00:04:31.210> can<00:04:31.330> go<00:04:31.450> back<00:04:31.480> down

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
in here now so now we can go back down

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.080 
in here now so now we can go back down
here<00:04:31.990> and<00:04:32.490> we're<00:04:33.490> going<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.640> want<00:04:33.760> to<00:04:33.820> connect

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
here and we're going to want to connect

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.700 
here and we're going to want to connect
this<00:04:34.210> repeater<00:04:34.630> to<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:34.990> torch<00:04:35.200> so<00:04:35.530> that<00:04:35.650> we

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
this repeater to the torch so that we

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.830 
this repeater to the torch so that we
can<00:04:35.830> actually<00:04:35.890> turn<00:04:36.220> it<00:04:36.400> off<00:04:36.520> you<00:04:36.790> know<00:04:36.910> so

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
can actually turn it off you know so

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.650 
can actually turn it off you know so
there's<00:04:37.990> those<00:04:38.230> ones<00:04:38.500> already<00:04:38.860> set<00:04:39.250> up<00:04:39.600> now<00:04:40.600> we

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
there's those ones already set up now we

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.180 
there's those ones already set up now we
have<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:41.020> figure<00:04:41.170> out<00:04:41.320> how<00:04:41.410> where<00:04:41.920> we're<00:04:42.070> going

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
have to figure out how where we're going

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.050 
have to figure out how where we're going
to<00:04:42.250> do<00:04:42.310> with<00:04:42.400> that<00:04:42.430> one<00:04:42.670> so<00:04:42.790> we're<00:04:42.880> going<00:04:42.970> to

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
to do with that one so we're going to

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.960 
to do with that one so we're going to
put<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:44.050> there<00:04:46.470> hmm<00:04:47.520> this<00:04:48.520> is<00:04:48.670> I'm<00:04:48.910> just

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
put that there hmm this is I'm just

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.480 
put that there hmm this is I'm just
going<00:04:49.060> to<00:04:49.180> bake<00:04:49.300> those<00:04:49.450> for<00:04:49.630> a<00:04:49.690> second<00:04:50.490> so

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
going to bake those for a second so

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.250 
going to bake those for a second so
we're<00:04:51.910> gonna<00:04:52.030> have<00:04:52.210> to<00:04:52.240> get<00:04:52.390> power<00:04:52.750> to<00:04:52.900> that

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
we're gonna have to get power to that

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.310 
we're gonna have to get power to that
and<00:04:53.590> them<00:04:54.450> flat<00:04:55.500> sand<00:04:56.500> I<00:04:56.770> hate<00:04:56.980> sand<00:04:58.080> yeah<00:04:59.080> we

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
and them flat sand I hate sand yeah we

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.100 
and them flat sand I hate sand yeah we
need<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.470> get<00:04:59.620> to<00:04:59.770> this<00:04:59.920> this<00:05:00.460> torch<00:05:00.700> here

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
need to get to this this torch here

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.620 
need to get to this this torch here
probably<00:05:02.110> just<00:05:02.170> do<00:05:02.320> that<00:05:03.150> now<00:05:04.150> we<00:05:04.210> have<00:05:04.570> to

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
probably just do that now we have to

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.820 
probably just do that now we have to
figure<00:05:04.750> out<00:05:04.930> though<00:05:05.110> where<00:05:05.530> we're<00:05:05.650> going<00:05:05.770> to

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
figure out though where we're going to

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.960 
figure out though where we're going to
get<00:05:05.950> the<00:05:06.040> power<00:05:06.310> from<00:05:06.840> so<00:05:08.280> most<00:05:09.280> definitely<00:05:09.940> I

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
get the power from so most definitely I

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.670 
get the power from so most definitely I
mean<00:05:10.270> lets<00:05:10.600> me<00:05:10.720> remove<00:05:10.870> this<00:05:10.990> block<00:05:11.380> which<00:05:11.530> we

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
mean lets me remove this block which we

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.380 
mean lets me remove this block which we
can<00:05:12.120> it's<00:05:13.120> not<00:05:13.360> against<00:05:14.260> any<00:05:14.650> rules<00:05:15.040> here<00:05:15.610> can

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
can it's not against any rules here can

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.660 
can it's not against any rules here can
just<00:05:16.570> dig<00:05:16.750> that<00:05:16.960> out<00:05:17.020> and<00:05:18.510> that<00:05:20.430> works<00:05:21.430> quite

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
just dig that out and that works quite

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.220 
just dig that out and that works quite
well<00:05:21.700> actually<00:05:21.970> we'll<00:05:22.690> put<00:05:22.840> a<00:05:22.870> block<00:05:23.050> there

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
well actually we'll put a block there

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.310 
well actually we'll put a block there
and<00:05:23.470> the<00:05:24.370> block<00:05:24.550> are<00:05:24.790> on<00:05:24.910> top<00:05:25.180> of<00:05:25.480> the<00:05:25.720> redstone

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
and the block are on top of the redstone

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.360 
and the block are on top of the redstone
here<00:05:26.970> right<00:05:27.970> here<00:05:28.410> we'll<00:05:29.410> put<00:05:29.650> over<00:05:29.800> Peter<00:05:30.220> in

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
here right here we'll put over Peter in

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.970 
here right here we'll put over Peter in
between<00:05:30.640> so<00:05:31.390> that<00:05:31.510> way<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:32.290> line<00:05:32.590> runs<00:05:32.860> in

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
between so that way the line runs in

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.890 
between so that way the line runs in
here<00:05:33.160> runs<00:05:33.520> another<00:05:33.670> Peter<00:05:33.970> powers<00:05:34.600> the<00:05:34.720> block

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
here runs another Peter powers the block

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.630 
here runs another Peter powers the block
and<00:05:35.140> then<00:05:35.260> powers<00:05:35.650> the<00:05:35.830> red<00:05:35.980> stone<00:05:36.220> underneath

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
and then powers the red stone underneath

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.610 
and then powers the red stone underneath
it<00:05:37.350> so<00:05:38.350> we<00:05:38.590> can<00:05:38.650> fill<00:05:39.310> this<00:05:39.460> up<00:05:39.640> if<00:05:39.850> you<00:05:39.970> want

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
it so we can fill this up if you want

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.560 
it so we can fill this up if you want
case<00:05:41.620> until<00:05:41.919> one<00:05:42.100> thing<00:05:42.310> spawn<00:05:42.640> camp<00:05:43.000> fill<00:05:43.450> in

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
case until one thing spawn camp fill in

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.400 
case until one thing spawn camp fill in
that<00:05:43.750> area<00:05:43.960> unfortunately<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:45.940> that<00:05:46.480> is<00:05:47.230> it

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
that area unfortunately and that is it

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.130 
that area unfortunately and that is it
they're<00:05:47.440> so<00:05:48.510> now<00:05:49.510> they're<00:05:49.690> we're<00:05:49.960> going<00:05:50.080> to

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
they're so now they're we're going to

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.500 
they're so now they're we're going to
weaken<00:05:50.590> fill-in<00:05:50.980> up<00:05:51.220> to<00:05:51.490> there<00:05:51.790> but<00:05:52.150> we<00:05:52.240> can't

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
weaken fill-in up to there but we can't

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.210 
weaken fill-in up to there but we can't
cover<00:05:52.810> that<00:05:53.020> because<00:05:53.290> we<00:05:53.380> don't<00:05:53.560> want<00:05:53.919> the
