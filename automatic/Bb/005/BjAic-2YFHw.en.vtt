plastic and cosmetic surgeon and today

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.039 
plastic and cosmetic surgeon and today
I'll<00:00:05.370> be<00:00:05.460> talking<00:00:05.819> about<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.690> different

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
I'll be talking about the different

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.339 
I'll be talking about the different
types<00:00:07.319> of<00:00:07.649> tummy<00:00:08.099> tucks<00:00:08.750> this<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.900> procedure

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
types of tummy tucks this is a procedure

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.530 
types of tummy tucks this is a procedure
which<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:10.920> also<00:00:11.070> known<00:00:11.519> as<00:00:11.550> an<00:00:12.030> abdominoplasty

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
which is also known as an abdominoplasty

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.870 
which is also known as an abdominoplasty
and<00:00:13.320> they<00:00:14.099> protect<00:00:14.490> me

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
and they protect me

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.990 
and they protect me
so<00:00:15.179> it's<00:00:15.299> slightly<00:00:15.570> confusing<00:00:16.170> and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
so it's slightly confusing and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.630 
so it's slightly confusing and
terminology<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.830> tummy<00:00:19.830> tucks<00:00:20.189> are<00:00:20.279> basically

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
terminology so tummy tucks are basically

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.870 
terminology so tummy tucks are basically
divided<00:00:21.150> into<00:00:21.359> three<00:00:21.720> types<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.699> surgery<00:00:23.699> a

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
divided into three types of surgery a

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.349 
divided into three types of surgery a
scar<00:00:24.600> revision<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.529> mini<00:00:26.099> tummy<00:00:26.340> tuck<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.000> a

scar revision a mini tummy tuck and a

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.370 
scar revision a mini tummy tuck and a
full<00:00:27.570> tummy<00:00:27.810> tuck

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
full tummy tuck

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.700 
full tummy tuck
so<00:00:28.859> who's<00:00:29.810> generally<00:00:30.810> thinking<00:00:31.439> about<00:00:31.679> a

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
so who's generally thinking about a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.410 
so who's generally thinking about a
tummy<00:00:31.920> tuck<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.430> really<00:00:32.759> people<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.210> being

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
tummy tuck is really people of being

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.900 
tummy tuck is really people of being
pregnant<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.309> typically<00:00:35.309> they've<00:00:35.460> had<00:00:35.670> more

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
pregnant and typically they've had more

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.590 
pregnant and typically they've had more
than<00:00:36.059> one<00:00:36.450> child<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:38.070> pregnancy<00:00:39.030> stretches

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
than one child and pregnancy stretches

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.869 
than one child and pregnancy stretches
obviously<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.200> skin<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.860> abdomen<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
obviously the skin of the abdomen and

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.180 
obviously the skin of the abdomen and
also<00:00:42.360> causes<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.320> trauma<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> muscles

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
also causes and trauma to the muscles

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.340 
also causes and trauma to the muscles
particularly<00:00:44.579> separation<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.960> rectus

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
particularly separation of the rectus

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.529 
particularly separation of the rectus
abdominis<00:00:46.890> muscles<00:00:47.309> which<00:00:47.850> are<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> two<00:00:48.270> main

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
abdominis muscles which are the two main

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.330 
abdominis muscles which are the two main
vertical<00:00:49.110> muscles<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> stomach<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
vertical muscles in the stomach and the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.369 
vertical muscles in the stomach and the
tell<00:00:50.520> me<00:00:50.640> tell<00:00:51.000> me<00:00:51.090> which<00:00:51.539> tend<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.870> move<00:00:52.020> apart

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
tell me tell me which tend to move apart

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.819 
tell me tell me which tend to move apart
slightly<00:00:52.920> after<00:00:53.039> pregnancy<00:00:53.539> okay<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.230> three

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
slightly after pregnancy okay so three

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.080 
slightly after pregnancy okay so three
times<00:00:56.070> four<00:00:56.250> abdominoplasty

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
times four abdominoplasty

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.349 
times four abdominoplasty
the<00:00:57.300> first<00:00:57.629> one<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.280> scar<00:00:59.280> revision

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the first one is scar revision

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.779 
the first one is scar revision
so<00:01:00.780> often<00:01:01.140> people<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.469> had<00:01:01.649> caesareans

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
so often people have had caesareans

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.509 
so often people have had caesareans
because<00:01:03.359> cesarean<00:01:03.930> scars<00:01:04.290> tend<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.769> adhere<00:01:04.920> to

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
because cesarean scars tend to adhere to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.219 
because cesarean scars tend to adhere to
the<00:01:05.640> muscle<00:01:07.010> underneath<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.490> skin<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.600> you

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
the muscle underneath the skin so you

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.080 
the muscle underneath the skin so you
tend<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.560> get<00:01:10.710> overhangs<00:01:11.460> very<00:01:11.700> common<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.000> get

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
tend to get overhangs very common to get

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.649 
tend to get overhangs very common to get
overhang<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:13.229> skin<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.040> some<00:01:14.970> subcutaneous

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
overhang of skin and some subcutaneous

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.289 
overhang of skin and some subcutaneous
tissues<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.409> fatty<00:01:16.619> tissue<00:01:17.090> overhanging<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
tissues and fatty tissue overhanging the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.039 
tissues and fatty tissue overhanging the
skull<00:01:19.009> because<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.610> scar<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.090> tethered<00:01:21.450> so

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
skull because the scar is tethered so

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.570 
skull because the scar is tethered so
the<00:01:22.170> most<00:01:22.350> simple<00:01:22.680> thing<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.520> a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
the most simple thing we can do is a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.090 
the most simple thing we can do is a
scar<00:01:24.030> revision<00:01:24.270> which<00:01:25.110> basically<00:01:25.500> removes

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
scar revision which basically removes

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.030 
scar revision which basically removes
the<00:01:26.790> cesarean<00:01:27.390> scar<00:01:27.630> back<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.590> fresh<00:01:28.799> tissue

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the cesarean scar back to fresh tissue

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.520 
the cesarean scar back to fresh tissue
either<00:01:29.369> side<00:01:29.700> frees<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.720> up<00:01:30.840> from<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> muscle

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
either side frees it up from the muscle

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.109 
either side frees it up from the muscle
underneath<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.790> skin<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.780> sewn<00:01:34.200> together

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
underneath and the skin is sewn together

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.640 
underneath and the skin is sewn together
fresh<00:01:36.119> skin<00:01:36.420> sewn<00:01:36.720> together<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.409> get<00:01:37.590> a

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
fresh skin sewn together so you get a

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.460 
fresh skin sewn together so you get a
nice<00:01:37.880> flat<00:01:38.880> appearance<00:01:39.720> without<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
nice flat appearance without the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.859 
nice flat appearance without the
overhang<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.420> nothing<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.509> done<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
overhang and nothing is done to the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.020 
overhang and nothing is done to the
tawny<00:01:43.079> button<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.920> scar<00:01:44.220> revision

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
tawny button in a scar revision

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.179 
tawny button in a scar revision
so<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.600> scar<00:01:45.869> will<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.530> old<00:01:46.680> cesarean

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
so the scar will be the old cesarean

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.600 
so the scar will be the old cesarean
scar<00:01:47.310> will<00:01:47.610> be<00:01:47.729> gone<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:49.369> scar<00:01:50.369> will<00:01:50.490> be

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
scar will be gone the scar will be

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.210 
scar will be gone the scar will be
slightly<00:01:50.939> longer<00:01:51.540> than<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.930> older<00:01:52.409> cesarean

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
slightly longer than the older cesarean

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.850 
slightly longer than the older cesarean
scar<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.509> generally<00:01:54.899> works<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.320> very<00:01:55.649> well

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
scar that generally works a very well

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.410 
scar that generally works a very well
and<00:01:56.100> very<00:01:56.610> little<00:01:56.880> downtime

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
and very little downtime

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.859 
and very little downtime
okay<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.740> next<00:01:59.070> stage<00:01:59.250> up<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.390> was<00:02:00.659> called

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
okay the next stage up is it was called

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.649 
okay the next stage up is it was called
a<00:02:00.960> mini<00:02:01.229> tummy<00:02:01.530> tuck<00:02:01.619> now<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.729> used

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
a mini tummy tuck now this is used

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.270 
a mini tummy tuck now this is used
basically<00:02:04.590> from<00:02:04.829> people

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
basically from people

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.600 
basically from people
you<00:02:05.400> haven't<00:02:05.729> got<00:02:05.850> enough<00:02:05.880> tissue<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:07.350> remove

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
you haven't got enough tissue to remove
