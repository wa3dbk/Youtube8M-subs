video<00:04:08.699> is<00:04:09.090> kind<00:04:09.479> of<00:04:09.629> late<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.199> Brewfest<00:04:10.859> was<00:04:11.129> a

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
video is kind of late and Brewfest was a

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.729 
video is kind of late and Brewfest was a
long<00:04:11.370> time<00:04:11.609> ago<00:04:11.909> but<00:04:12.209> it's<00:04:12.959> nice<00:04:13.319> to<00:04:13.500> get<00:04:13.590> them

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
long time ago but it's nice to get them

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.830 
long time ago but it's nice to get them
out<00:04:13.829> there<00:04:14.099> and<00:04:15.289> it's<00:04:17.150> great<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.989> know

out there and it's great to you know
all<00:04:19.900> these<00:04:20.139> things<00:04:20.440> for<00:04:21.190> like<00:04:21.579> future<00:04:22.000> years

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
all these things for like future years

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.780 
all these things for like future years
so<00:04:23.320> now<00:04:23.470> I<00:04:23.500> think<00:04:23.650> it's<00:04:23.860> hops<00:04:24.190> he's<00:04:24.490> got<00:04:24.639> like<00:04:24.760> a

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
so now I think it's hops he's got like a

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.010 
so now I think it's hops he's got like a
2007<00:04:25.570> one<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:25.960> then<00:04:26.080> he's<00:04:26.169> got<00:04:26.260> a<00:04:26.320> 2008<00:04:26.919> one

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
2007 one and then he's got a 2008 one

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.510 
2007 one and then he's got a 2008 one

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
doing it and here's the Brewfest ram

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.879 
doing it and here's the Brewfest ram
which<00:04:39.370> i<00:04:39.490> got<00:04:39.699> and<00:04:39.910> i<00:04:40.120> said<00:04:40.330> i<00:04:40.389> didn't<00:04:40.630> record

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
which i got and i said i didn't record

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.290 
which i got and i said i didn't record
must<00:04:41.889> have<00:04:42.040> been<00:04:42.160> like<00:04:42.340> all<00:04:42.760> the<00:04:43.060> random

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
must have been like all the random

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.000 
must have been like all the random
groups<00:04:43.690> which<00:04:43.870> I<00:04:43.990> picked<00:04:44.199> up<00:04:44.290> from<00:04:44.410> trade<00:04:44.710> and

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
groups which I picked up from trade and

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.580 
groups which I picked up from trade and
then<00:04:45.160> you<00:04:45.729> know<00:04:45.820> forgot<00:04:46.360> to<00:04:46.449> record<00:04:46.570> it<00:04:46.870> this

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590

then you know forgot to record it this
was<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.860> code<00:04:48.070> oh<00:04:48.220> my<00:04:48.610> after<00:04:48.940> I<00:04:48.970> got<00:04:49.090> back<00:04:49.210> to

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
was the code oh my after I got back to

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.600 
was the code oh my after I got back to
my<00:04:49.449> own<00:04:49.540> forge<00:04:49.810> after<00:04:50.800> I<00:04:50.860> just<00:04:51.130> want<00:04:51.340> out<00:04:51.490> on

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
personally I really want the code up

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.670 
personally I really want the code up
more<00:05:04.300> than<00:05:04.389> the<00:05:04.450> RAM<00:05:04.690> just<00:05:05.169> because<00:05:05.440> like<00:05:05.620> I

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
more than the RAM just because like I

could<00:05:06.130> go<00:05:06.280> yeah<00:05:06.940> I'm<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.240> human<00:05:07.690> on<00:05:07.870> a<00:05:07.930> code<00:05:08.470> oh

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
could go yeah I'm a human on a code oh

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.420 
could go yeah I'm a human on a code oh
your<00:05:09.910> arguments<00:05:10.360> invalid<00:05:10.780> I<00:05:10.870> winter<00:05:11.430> anyway
