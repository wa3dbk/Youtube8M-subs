because this is such an awesome TNT

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.320 
because this is such an awesome TNT
cannon<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.980> it's<00:00:17.130> been<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.609> long<00:00:17.940> since<00:00:17.970> I've

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
cannon and it's been so long since I've

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.870 
cannon and it's been so long since I've
built<00:00:18.539> one<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.160> basically<00:00:20.160> what<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.369> decided

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
built one and basically what I decided

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.870 
built one and basically what I decided
to<00:00:21.150> do<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.539> thought<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.050> concept<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.850> when<00:00:23.850> I

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
to do I thought of a concept and when I

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.089 
to do I thought of a concept and when I
actually<00:00:24.119> built<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:25.019> worked<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.380> well<00:00:25.859> that

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
actually built it it worked so well that

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.650 
actually built it it worked so well that
I<00:00:26.130> was<00:00:26.310> like<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.460> have<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.300> show<00:00:27.480> this

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
I was like I have to I have to show this

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.779 
I was like I have to I have to show this
you<00:00:27.869> know<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:27.990> need<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.619> need<00:00:29.160> people<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.580> know

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
you know I need to need people to know

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.120 
you know I need to need people to know
about<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:31.080> essentially<00:00:31.740> what<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:31.949> is

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
about this so essentially what this is

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.660 
about this so essentially what this is
is<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.610> versatile<00:00:33.559> tnt<00:00:34.559> cannon<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.309> shoot

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
is a versatile tnt cannon that can shoot

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.069 
is a versatile tnt cannon that can shoot
in<00:00:36.170> 360<00:00:37.170> degrees<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:38.570> essentially<00:00:39.570> wherever

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
in 360 degrees so essentially wherever

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.660 
in 360 degrees so essentially wherever
you<00:00:40.290> place<00:00:40.559> TNT<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.640> water<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:43.309> this<00:00:44.309> this

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
you place TNT on this water is this this

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.670 
you place TNT on this water is this this
whole<00:00:44.879> platform<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.629> be<00:00:45.690> lit<00:00:46.170> at<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> same

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
whole platform can be lit at the same

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.889 
whole platform can be lit at the same
time<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.730> right<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.450> you

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
time so do you do this right and you

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.240 
time so do you do this right and you
want<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> TNT<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.649> shoot<00:00:49.860> off<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.160> that

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
want the TNT to shoot off in that

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.010 
want the TNT to shoot off in that
direction<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.300> just<00:00:51.449> put<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.780> top

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
direction and you just put it on top

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.959 
direction and you just put it on top
here<00:00:52.289> go<00:00:52.829> ahead<00:00:53.100> flip<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.820> button<00:00:55.850> they<00:00:56.850> all

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
here go ahead flip the button they all

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.520 
here go ahead flip the button they all
get<00:00:57.149> set<00:00:57.329> off<00:00:57.420> at<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> same<00:00:57.840> time<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.350> then

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
get set off at the same time and then

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.020 
get set off at the same time and then
you<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.859> manually<00:00:59.280> discharge<00:00:59.910> it

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
you have to manually discharge it

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.990 
you have to manually discharge it
yourself<00:01:00.420> but<00:01:00.870> there<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.170> goes<00:01:01.609> off<00:01:02.609> into<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
yourself but there it goes off into the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.060 
yourself but there it goes off into the
distance<00:01:03.239> let's<00:01:04.170> try<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.500> again<00:01:04.589> let's

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
distance let's try that again let's

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.679 
distance let's try that again let's
actually<00:01:05.220> see<00:01:05.580> if<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:05.760> can<00:01:05.909> nail<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.270> creeper

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
actually see if we can nail that creeper

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.510 
actually see if we can nail that creeper
because<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.560> thing<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.890> takes<00:01:08.070> some<00:01:08.220> aiming

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
because this thing it takes some aiming

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.280 
because this thing it takes some aiming
but<00:01:09.119> if<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.510> want<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.750> put<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.080> right

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
but if you want to put it like right

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.219 
but if you want to put it like right
there<00:01:10.530> or<00:01:10.680> something<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.880> put<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.990> put<00:01:13.200> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
there or something and I put a I put a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.039 
there or something and I put a I put a
combination<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.799> half<00:01:14.010> slabs<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:15.049> fences

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
combination of half slabs and fences

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.280 
combination of half slabs and fences
just<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.040> get<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> maximum<00:01:17.970> oh<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:19.140> was

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
just to get the maximum oh that was

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.100 
just to get the maximum oh that was
really<00:01:19.950> close<00:01:20.250> we<00:01:21.150> had<00:01:21.240> some<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.689> little<00:01:22.020> bit

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
really close we had some a little bit

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.340 
really close we had some a little bit
less<00:01:22.290> TNT<00:01:22.770> maybe<00:01:23.009> let's<00:01:23.909> do<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.210> let's<00:01:25.200> do

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
less TNT maybe let's do that let's do

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.219 
less TNT maybe let's do that let's do
that<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.090> something<00:01:27.090> like<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.420> let's<00:01:28.049> see

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
that and something like that let's see

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.510 
that and something like that let's see
let's<00:01:28.470> see<00:01:28.590> if<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:28.979> hit<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> creeper

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
let's see if that can hit the creeper

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.560 
let's see if that can hit the creeper
and<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:30.689> put<00:01:30.930> half<00:01:31.140> slabs<00:01:31.470> because<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.420> get

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
and I put half slabs because just to get

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.289 
and I put half slabs because just to get
the<00:01:33.689> different<00:01:34.020> ranges<00:01:34.939> because<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the different ranges because that it

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.749 
the different ranges because that it
goes<00:01:36.630> down<00:01:36.990> more<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.590> with<00:01:37.740> if<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.430> put<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.700> on

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
goes down more but with if you put it on

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.149 
goes down more but with if you put it on
top<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.090> fences<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.570> goes<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:40.020> goes<00:01:40.170> higher<00:01:40.380> so

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
top of fences it goes it goes higher so

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.580 
top of fences it goes it goes higher so
I<00:01:41.430> actually<00:01:41.790> need<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.180> little<00:01:42.509> bit<00:01:42.750> more<00:01:43.079> range

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
I actually need a little bit more range

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.310 
I actually need a little bit more range
on<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.520> I'm<00:01:44.610> thinking<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.869> actually

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
on this so I'm thinking this is actually

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.920 
on this so I'm thinking this is actually
pretty<00:01:46.649> decent<00:01:47.119> it's<00:01:48.119> gonna<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.450> hard<00:01:48.720> though

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
pretty decent it's gonna be hard though

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.450 
pretty decent it's gonna be hard though
so<00:01:49.409> let's<00:01:49.890> see<00:01:50.070> if<00:01:50.159> maybe<00:01:50.450> whoops<00:01:51.450> oh<00:01:51.750> no<00:01:52.470> no

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
so let's see if maybe whoops oh no no

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.319 
so let's see if maybe whoops oh no no

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
so let's see if this just nails the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.400 
so let's see if this just nails the
creeper<00:02:30.440> cool<00:02:31.340> all<00:02:32.090> right<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.960> bit<00:02:33.140> worried

fine
oh<00:02:36.640> if<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:37.820> okay<00:02:38.209> I<00:02:38.240> actually<00:02:38.570> really<00:02:39.080> like<00:02:39.290> that

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
oh if I okay I actually really like that

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.830 
oh if I okay I actually really like that
here<00:02:40.010> let's<00:02:40.220> try<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.550> again<00:02:40.640> so<00:02:41.450> it's<00:02:41.600> three

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
here let's try that again so it's three

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.760 
here let's try that again so it's three
like<00:02:42.020> this<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:43.100> one<00:02:43.370> right<00:02:43.790> here<00:02:44.360> right<00:02:44.770> cool

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
like this and one right here right cool

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.920 
like this and one right here right cool
and<00:02:46.130> then<00:02:46.580> we<00:02:46.700> put<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:47.000> here<00:02:47.330> no<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.720> was<00:02:47.840> like

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
and then we put it here no it was like

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.580 
and then we put it here no it was like
this<00:02:49.150> so<00:02:50.150> like<00:02:50.390> that<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.930> I'm<00:02:50.989> gonna<00:02:51.140> set<00:02:51.440> the

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
this so like that and I'm gonna set the

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.150 
this so like that and I'm gonna set the
TNT<00:02:52.040> off<00:02:52.220> really<00:02:52.670> quickly<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.180> like<00:02:54.110> that<00:02:54.350> and

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
TNT off really quickly so like that and

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.570 
TNT off really quickly so like that and
like<00:02:55.310> that

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
like that

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.580 
like that
hopefully<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.690> nails<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:57.110> creeper<00:02:57.410> over

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
hopefully that nails that creeper over

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.270 
hopefully that nails that creeper over
there<00:02:57.820> what<00:02:58.820> oh<00:02:59.680> so<00:03:00.680> close

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
there what oh so close

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.780 
there what oh so close
but<00:03:01.730> basically<00:03:02.500> this<00:03:03.500> TNT<00:03:03.890> cannons<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.430> lot<00:03:04.670> of

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
but basically this TNT cannons a lot of

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.400 
but basically this TNT cannons a lot of
fun<00:03:04.940> there's<00:03:05.120> there's<00:03:05.390> a<00:03:05.450> lot<00:03:05.780> of<00:03:05.959> really<00:03:06.260> cool

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
fun there's there's a lot of really cool

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.340 
fun there's there's a lot of really cool
things<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.770> can<00:03:06.890> do<00:03:07.070> with<00:03:07.190> it<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:08.350> there's

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
things you can do with it and there's

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.810 
things you can do with it and there's
there's<00:03:09.680> a<00:03:09.739> few<00:03:10.040> things<00:03:10.280> you<00:03:10.489> should<00:03:10.520> you

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
there's a few things you should you

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.640 
there's a few things you should you
should<00:03:11.030> probably<00:03:11.360> worry<00:03:11.989> about<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.470> that's

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
should probably worry about and that's

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.800 
should probably worry about and that's
like<00:03:12.920> covering<00:03:13.280> up<00:03:13.370> an<00:03:13.489> entire<00:03:13.790> side<00:03:14.150> like

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
like covering up an entire side like

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.780 
like covering up an entire side like
it's<00:03:14.959> like<00:03:15.200> this<00:03:15.470> like<00:03:16.100> if<00:03:16.190> you<00:03:16.280> cover<00:03:16.459> up<00:03:16.670> this

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
it's like this like if you cover up this

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.350 
it's like this like if you cover up this
entire<00:03:17.150> side<00:03:17.540> with<00:03:18.290> with<00:03:18.680> TNT<00:03:18.980> when<00:03:19.880> they<00:03:20.180> all

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
entire side with with TNT when they all

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.330 
entire side with with TNT when they all
get<00:03:20.510> set<00:03:20.750> off<00:03:20.870> at<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.140> same<00:03:21.320> time<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:22.100> water

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
get set off at the same time the water

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.660 
get set off at the same time the water
is<00:03:22.700> actually<00:03:23.030> going<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.720> be<00:03:23.870> pushing<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.680> TNT

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
is actually going to be pushing the TNT

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.280 
is actually going to be pushing the TNT
like<00:03:25.850> this<00:03:26.060> way<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:26.420> it's<00:03:26.870> probably<00:03:27.140> got<00:03:27.200> to

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
like this way and it's probably got to

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.110 
like this way and it's probably got to
pop<00:03:27.440> up<00:03:27.620> on<00:03:27.769> these<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.310> it<00:03:28.700> starts<00:03:28.970> blowing

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
pop up on these and it starts blowing

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.780 
pop up on these and it starts blowing
everything<00:03:29.420> up<00:03:29.600> because<00:03:30.440> it<00:03:30.860> doesn't<00:03:31.190> have<00:03:31.340> it

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
everything up because it doesn't have it

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:32.590 
everything up because it doesn't have it
doesn't<00:03:31.850> that<00:03:32.150> EIC

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
doesn't that EIC

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.300 
doesn't that EIC
you<00:03:32.959> see<00:03:33.110> how<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.380> all<00:03:33.410> just<00:03:33.530> pushes<00:03:34.010> like<00:03:34.130> that

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
you see how it all just pushes like that

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.750 
you see how it all just pushes like that
it<00:03:34.549> doesn't<00:03:34.760> have<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:34.910> time<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.200> regenerate

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
it doesn't have the time to regenerate

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.009 
it doesn't have the time to regenerate
so<00:03:37.760> if<00:03:38.150> you're<00:03:38.330> gonna<00:03:38.420> be<00:03:38.570> doing<00:03:38.750> something

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
so if you're gonna be doing something

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.890 
so if you're gonna be doing something
like<00:03:39.049> that<00:03:39.370> it's<00:03:40.370> best<00:03:40.610> to<00:03:40.730> just<00:03:40.820> do<00:03:41.120> four<00:03:41.600> and

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
like that it's best to just do four and

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.039 
like that it's best to just do four and
leave<00:03:42.500> one<00:03:42.799> of<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:42.950> corners<00:03:43.340> like<00:03:43.610> that<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:44.720> if

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
leave one of the corners like that so if

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.030 
leave one of the corners like that so if
you<00:03:45.170> wanted<00:03:45.320> to<00:03:45.410> do<00:03:45.500> something<00:03:45.680> like<00:03:45.799> that

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
you wanted to do something like that

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.580 
you wanted to do something like that
maybe<00:03:46.220> we<00:03:46.370> can<00:03:46.489> hit<00:03:46.610> the<00:03:46.700> creeper<00:03:47.019> honestly<00:03:48.019> so

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
maybe we can hit the creeper honestly so

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.810 
maybe we can hit the creeper honestly so
let's<00:03:49.070> try<00:03:49.310> it<00:03:50.980> see<00:03:51.980> it<00:03:52.100> doesn't<00:03:52.370> push<00:03:52.519> it<00:03:52.670> and

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
let's try it see it doesn't push it and

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.809 
let's try it see it doesn't push it and
then<00:03:52.970> if<00:03:53.060> we<00:03:53.150> do<00:03:53.269> this

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
then if we do this

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.570 
then if we do this
just<00:03:55.300> pushes<00:03:55.629> it<00:03:55.750> a<00:03:55.780> little<00:03:55.930> bit<00:03:56.050> down<00:03:56.580> not

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
just pushes it a little bit down not

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.809 
just pushes it a little bit down not
high<00:03:57.670> enough<00:03:57.700> that's<00:03:58.120> still<00:03:58.360> really<00:03:59.170> cool<00:03:59.379> and

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
high enough that's still really cool and

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.430 
high enough that's still really cool and
building<00:04:00.819> it<00:04:00.970> is<00:04:01.150> actually<00:04:02.110> quite

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
building it is actually quite

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.890 
building it is actually quite
interesting<00:04:02.700> because<00:04:03.700> there's<00:04:04.060> layers<00:04:04.420> upon

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
interesting because there's layers upon

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.869 
interesting because there's layers upon
layers<00:04:04.930> of<00:04:05.379> this<00:04:05.769> because<00:04:06.099> essentially<00:04:06.760> what

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
layers of this because essentially what

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.470 
layers of this because essentially what
you<00:04:07.000> need<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.239> do<00:04:07.390> is<00:04:07.599> have<00:04:07.980> this<00:04:08.980> huge<00:04:09.480> under

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
you need to do is have this huge under

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.280 
you need to do is have this huge under
part<00:04:10.750> this<00:04:11.290> huge<00:04:11.650> just<00:04:12.720> part<00:04:13.720> what<00:04:14.140> is<00:04:14.200> it

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
part this huge just part what is it

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.550 
part this huge just part what is it
called

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
called

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.770 
called
there's<00:04:15.069> like<00:04:15.190> there's<00:04:15.519> basically<00:04:15.970> a<00:04:16.090> disc<00:04:16.449> or

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
there's like there's basically a disc or

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.759 
there's like there's basically a disc or
a<00:04:16.959> square<00:04:17.530> of<00:04:18.419> redstone<00:04:19.440> torches<00:04:20.440> that

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
a square of redstone torches that

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.460 
a square of redstone torches that
all<00:04:20.919> need<00:04:21.130> to<00:04:21.250> be<00:04:21.400> lit<00:04:21.790> off<00:04:21.970> lit<00:04:22.419> lit<00:04:23.020> on<00:04:23.169> at<00:04:23.380> the

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
all need to be lit off lit lit on at the

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.340 
all need to be lit off lit lit on at the
same<00:04:23.650> time<00:04:23.790> so<00:04:24.790> you<00:04:24.910> need<00:04:25.150> a<00:04:25.180> big<00:04:25.690> delay<00:04:25.960> here

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
same time so you need a big delay here

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.860 
same time so you need a big delay here
and<00:04:26.889> it<00:04:27.520> just<00:04:27.669> goes<00:04:27.789> all<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.240> way<00:04:28.330> around<00:04:28.720> and

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
and it just goes all the way around and

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.779 
and it just goes all the way around and
then<00:04:28.990> you<00:04:29.080> have<00:04:29.110> this<00:04:29.380> redstone<00:04:30.310> here<00:04:30.460> that

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
then you have this redstone here that

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.140 
then you have this redstone here that
extends<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:33.340> source<00:04:33.610> because<00:04:33.910> otherwise

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
extends the the source because otherwise

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.090 
extends the the source because otherwise
this<00:04:34.419> one<00:04:34.570> wouldn't<00:04:34.750> be<00:04:34.900> this<00:04:35.680> one<00:04:35.919> wouldn't

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
this one wouldn't be this one wouldn't

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.640 
this one wouldn't be this one wouldn't
get<00:04:36.520> powered<00:04:36.789> and<00:04:37.240> also<00:04:37.900> make<00:04:38.080> sure<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.260> keep

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
get powered and also make sure to keep

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.379 
get powered and also make sure to keep
these<00:04:38.830> holes<00:04:39.100> because<00:04:39.669> otherwise<00:04:39.910> if<00:04:40.150> you<00:04:40.240> put

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
these holes because otherwise if you put

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.020 
these holes because otherwise if you put
like<00:04:40.539> this<00:04:40.720> you<00:04:41.350> do<00:04:41.470> like<00:04:41.620> this<00:04:41.830> it's<00:04:42.789> never

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
like this you do like this it's never

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.129 
like this you do like this it's never
gonna<00:04:43.180> stay<00:04:43.360> powered<00:04:43.510> because<00:04:43.930> it's<00:04:44.050> just

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
gonna stay powered because it's just

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.240 
gonna stay powered because it's just
gonna<00:04:44.260> go<00:04:44.410> like<00:04:44.530> that<00:04:44.560> because<00:04:44.889> of<00:04:44.979> powers

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
gonna go like that because of powers

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.210 
gonna go like that because of powers
this<00:04:45.789> one<00:04:46.030> I<00:04:46.060> believe<00:04:46.240> or<00:04:46.960> no<00:04:47.320> this<00:04:47.620> this<00:04:48.070> is

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
this one I believe or no this this is

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.710 
this one I believe or no this this is
gonna<00:04:48.310> power<00:04:48.610> this<00:04:48.820> block<00:04:49.090> which<00:04:49.270> powers<00:04:49.539> this

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
gonna power this block which powers this

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.080 
gonna power this block which powers this
so<00:04:50.080> you<00:04:50.169> don't<00:04:50.289> want<00:04:50.410> that<00:04:50.500> cool<00:04:51.280> so<00:04:51.850> then<00:04:51.970> if

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
so you don't want that cool so then if

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.850 
so you don't want that cool so then if
we<00:04:52.180> drop<00:04:52.389> down<00:04:52.570> to<00:04:52.690> this<00:04:52.780> row<00:04:53.020> it's<00:04:53.289> pretty

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
we drop down to this row it's pretty

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.010 
we drop down to this row it's pretty
much<00:04:54.010> the<00:04:54.220> exact<00:04:54.490> same<00:04:54.520> thing<00:04:54.910> and<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:55.990> only

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
much the exact same thing and the only

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.240 
much the exact same thing and the only
thing<00:04:56.320> you<00:04:56.440> need<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:56.680> worry<00:04:56.830> about<00:04:56.860> is<00:04:57.130> this

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
thing you need to worry about is this

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.159 
thing you need to worry about is this
delay<00:04:57.520> here<00:04:57.760> set<00:04:58.000> it<00:04:58.030> to<00:04:58.240> two<00:04:58.389> ticks<00:04:58.600> and

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
delay here set it to two ticks and

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.529 
delay here set it to two ticks and
everything<00:04:59.770> else<00:04:59.979> is<00:05:00.340> should<00:05:01.000> go<00:05:01.180> off<00:05:01.300> at<00:05:01.450> the

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
everything else is should go off at the

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.650 
everything else is should go off at the
same<00:05:01.720> time<00:05:01.930> and<00:05:02.139> those<00:05:02.830> power<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.880> middle<00:05:04.270> the

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
same time and those power the middle the

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.610 
same time and those power the middle the
inner<00:05:04.870> nine<00:05:05.710> or<00:05:06.039> inner<00:05:06.550> eight<00:05:06.760> is<00:05:07.090> and<00:05:07.620> this

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
inner nine or inner eight is and this

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.930 
inner nine or inner eight is and this
powers<00:05:09.010> the<00:05:09.190> outer<00:05:09.400> twenty<00:05:10.150> five<00:05:10.510> and<00:05:11.940> twenty

powers the outer twenty five and twenty

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.629 
powers the outer twenty five and twenty

first year 25-20 I don't know whatever

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.300 
first year 25-20 I don't know whatever
doesn't<00:05:18.300> matter<00:05:18.659> but<00:05:19.499> and<00:05:19.889> then<00:05:20.039> you<00:05:20.129> just

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
doesn't matter but and then you just

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.860 
doesn't matter but and then you just
have<00:05:20.460> this<00:05:20.610> one<00:05:20.669> right<00:05:21.210> in<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.330> middle<00:05:21.479> that

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
have this one right in the middle that

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.409 
have this one right in the middle that
you<00:05:22.169> set<00:05:22.499> the<00:05:22.590> two<00:05:22.740> ticks<00:05:22.979> and<00:05:23.219> it<00:05:24.120> just<00:05:24.300> goes

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
you set the two ticks and it just goes

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:25.909 
you set the two ticks and it just goes
all<00:05:24.569> the<00:05:24.599> way<00:05:24.749> down<00:05:24.960> and<00:05:25.229> what<00:05:25.349> this<00:05:25.469> does<00:05:25.650> it

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
all the way down and what this does it

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.739 
all the way down and what this does it
goes<00:05:26.039> up<00:05:26.189> right<00:05:26.279> in<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:26.460> middle<00:05:26.580> and<00:05:27.180> it<00:05:27.599> goes

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:27.749 
goes up right in the middle and it goes

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:30.019 
goes up right in the middle and it goes
up<00:05:28.229> to<00:05:28.439> that<00:05:28.590> one<00:05:28.770> right<00:05:28.919> there<00:05:29.099> where<00:05:29.819> is<00:05:29.879> it

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:30.029 
up to that one right there where is it

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:33.409 
up to that one right there where is it
let<00:05:30.300> me<00:05:30.330> see<00:05:30.509> what<00:05:32.029> that<00:05:33.029> one<00:05:33.180> right<00:05:33.330> in<00:05:33.360> the

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
let me see what that one right in the

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.300 
let me see what that one right in the
middle<00:05:33.569> right<00:05:33.659> there<00:05:33.779> and<00:05:34.139> then<00:05:34.860> that<00:05:35.039> goes<00:05:35.189> up

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
middle right there and then that goes up

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.890 
middle right there and then that goes up
to<00:05:35.340> that<00:05:35.520> middle<00:05:35.669> one<00:05:35.759> so<00:05:35.969> if<00:05:36.240> they<00:05:36.479> are<00:05:36.659> all

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
to that middle one so if they are all

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.820 
to that middle one so if they are all
timed<00:05:37.349> correctly<00:05:39.529> basically<00:05:40.529> what<00:05:40.740> you

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
timed correctly basically what you

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.230 
timed correctly basically what you
should<00:05:41.009> be<00:05:41.099> doing<00:05:41.400> is<00:05:41.580> if<00:05:41.879> you<00:05:41.999> hit<00:05:42.120> this

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
should be doing is if you hit this

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.510 
should be doing is if you hit this
button<00:05:42.469> they<00:05:43.469> all<00:05:43.590> go<00:05:43.710> on<00:05:43.740> at<00:05:43.919> the<00:05:44.039> exact<00:05:44.340> same

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
button they all go on at the exact same

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.659 
button they all go on at the exact same
time<00:05:44.759> and<00:05:44.969> it<00:05:45.779> powers<00:05:46.110> the<00:05:46.139> entire<00:05:49.669> platform

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
time and it powers the entire platform

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.820 
time and it powers the entire platform
here<00:05:50.969> it<00:05:51.509> basically<00:05:51.840> sets<00:05:52.139> off<00:05:52.349> all<00:05:52.620> of<00:05:52.740> your

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
aim it however you want and you can

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.439 
aim it however you want and you can
completely<00:05:58.740> replace<00:05:59.180> you<00:06:00.180> know<00:06:00.270> what<00:06:00.419> I

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
completely replace you know what I

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.059 
completely replace you know what I
actually<00:06:00.599> kind<00:06:01.259> of<00:06:01.379> like<00:06:01.560> that<00:06:01.680> better<00:06:01.860> I<00:06:02.039> just

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:02.069 
actually kind of like that better I just

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.700 
actually kind of like that better I just
had<00:06:02.340> the<00:06:02.430> half<00:06:02.639> slabs<00:06:02.939> as<00:06:03.210> a<00:06:03.270> as<00:06:04.259> a<00:06:04.409> placeholder

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
had the half slabs as a as a placeholder

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.909 
had the half slabs as a as a placeholder
but<00:06:05.490> I<00:06:05.550> actually<00:06:05.729> kind<00:06:06.210> of<00:06:06.330> like<00:06:06.740> setting<00:06:07.740> it

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
but I actually kind of like setting it

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.459 
but I actually kind of like setting it
all<00:06:08.129> to<00:06:08.430> be<00:06:08.699> fences<00:06:09.330> instead<00:06:09.779> because<00:06:10.110> fences

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:10.469 
all to be fences instead because fences

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:14.450

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.459 
build this like on the top of your base
or<00:06:47.129> something<00:06:47.430> it<00:06:47.699> is<00:06:48.000> a<00:06:48.149> really<00:06:48.719> good<00:06:48.870> defense

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:49.469 
or something it is a really good defense

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:51.019 
or something it is a really good defense
system<00:06:49.770> the<00:06:50.099> only<00:06:50.310> reason<00:06:50.580> I<00:06:50.669> have<00:06:50.819> this<00:06:50.969> is

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:51.029 
system the only reason I have this is

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:52.339 
system the only reason I have this is
because<00:06:51.389> it's<00:06:51.539> in<00:06:51.629> the<00:06:51.719> Mountain<00:06:51.990> biome<00:06:52.259> and

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
because it's in the Mountain biome and

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:54.829 
because it's in the Mountain biome and
the<00:06:52.620> water<00:06:52.800> would<00:06:53.009> freeze<00:06:53.159> so<00:06:54.060> it's<00:06:54.479> not<00:06:54.719> the

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:54.839 
the water would freeze so it's not the

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:57.439 
the water would freeze so it's not the
biggest<00:06:54.990> deal<00:06:55.110> anyway<00:06:56.039> I<00:06:56.250> hope<00:06:56.909> you<00:06:56.969> all<00:06:57.149> enjoy
