00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
seem completely open especially since we

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.120 
seem completely open especially since we
matched<00:01:08.970> up<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.360> boards<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.860> seems<00:01:11.040> like

to Iceland was it your first time or
second<00:03:32.480> time<00:03:32.600> first<00:03:33.110> first<00:03:33.740> time<00:03:33.950> a<00:03:34.160> lot<00:03:34.580> of

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
second time first first time a lot of

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.120 
second time first first time a lot of
our<00:03:34.850> relationship<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:35.660> exploring<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.740> Arctic

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
our relationship is exploring the Arctic

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.350 
our relationship is exploring the Arctic
and<00:03:37.280> our<00:03:37.400> first<00:03:37.610> big<00:03:37.790> trip<00:03:37.940> together<00:03:38.210> was

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
and our first big trip together was

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.180 
and our first big trip together was
actually<00:03:38.660> skin<00:03:38.870> maybe<00:03:39.050> as<00:03:39.260> well<00:03:39.470> I<00:03:39.680> think<00:03:39.800> that

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
actually skin maybe as well I think that

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.590 
actually skin maybe as well I think that
the<00:03:40.520> Scandinavian<00:03:41.150> side

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
the Scandinavian side

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.260 
the Scandinavian side
I<00:03:41.630> definitely<00:03:41.990> introduced<00:03:42.890> but<00:03:43.460> John<00:03:43.880> got

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
I definitely introduced but John got

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.820 
I definitely introduced but John got
really<00:03:44.510> into<00:03:44.690> Japan<00:03:45.020> and<00:03:45.200> so<00:03:45.350> he<00:03:45.530> kind<00:03:45.710> of

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
really into Japan and so he kind of

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.100 
really into Japan and so he kind of
brought<00:03:45.980> that<00:03:46.040> in<00:03:46.460> we<00:03:47.060> see<00:03:47.330> a<00:03:47.570> lot<00:03:47.840> of<00:03:47.870> the

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
brought that in we see a lot of the

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.690 
brought that in we see a lot of the
similarities<00:03:48.680> between<00:03:48.710> these<00:03:49.130> cultures<00:03:49.490> and

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
similarities between these cultures and

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.640 
similarities between these cultures and
Canada<00:03:50.090> so<00:03:50.480> in<00:03:50.600> a<00:03:50.660> way<00:03:50.840> we<00:03:51.020> think<00:03:51.170> of<00:03:51.320> this<00:03:51.440> home

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
Canada so in a way we think of this home

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.220 
Canada so in a way we think of this home
as<00:03:51.800> being<00:03:52.040> kind<00:03:52.520> of<00:03:52.640> a<00:03:52.760> Canadian<00:03:53.060> style<00:03:53.780> the

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
as being kind of a Canadian style the

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.780 
as being kind of a Canadian style the
materials<00:03:54.770> here<00:03:55.040> they're<00:03:55.220> all<00:03:55.340> natural

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
materials here they're all natural

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.270 
materials here they're all natural
materials<00:03:56.270> to<00:03:56.510> Canada<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.470> use<00:03:57.650> of<00:03:57.830> light<00:03:58.040> you

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
materials to Canada the use of light you

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.680 
materials to Canada the use of light you
know<00:03:58.400> we<00:03:58.520> have<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.730> darker<00:03:59.030> winter<00:03:59.360> so<00:03:59.540> we're

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
know we have the darker winter so we're

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.060 
know we have the darker winter so we're
trying<00:03:59.900> to<00:03:59.990> incorporate<00:04:00.410> as<00:04:00.530> much<00:04:00.680> light<00:04:00.920> as

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
trying to incorporate as much light as

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.700 
trying to incorporate as much light as
possible<00:04:01.100> it's<00:04:02.030> easy<00:04:02.300> living<00:04:02.750> in<00:04:03.020> Canada<00:04:03.470> and

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
possible it's easy living in Canada and

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.440 
possible it's easy living in Canada and
kind<00:04:04.010> of<00:04:04.100> forgetting<00:04:04.460> all<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:05.000> benefits<00:04:05.390> that
