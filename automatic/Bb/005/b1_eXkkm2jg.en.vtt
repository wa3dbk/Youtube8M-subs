00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:19.169
 Hello and welcome love to show to today's exhibition forum 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.240
 Meter pilot and two animals sing and with me is the 3 0 TDI of the 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.879
 Handwerkskammer Konstanz bowed why find it on a construction site 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.019
 Year over payments we are as here because we are here on the construction site 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.530
 in the next two years the new education academy of the Chamber of Crafts 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.550
 Build constancy 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.740
 but with us it is about to show the profession today and to have the form of place 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.670
 Frank's environment was supposed to be there with the utility OMV 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.670
 What should I say about the euro? 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.800
 so keep waiting 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.800
 German Post DHL 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.590
 the one for one 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.590
 Driver free 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.770
 time is running out 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.610
 enough for that 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.610
 simplified 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.420
 the right clothes are an absolute must 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.130
 and let's go, at least that's what I thought 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.609
 first I have to understand the theory how does a 30 30 work 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.120
 Vienna is the mixing ratio of the colors 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.220
 all things that a hairdresser has to master 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.220
 then it goes to the customers 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.720
 at least for the apprentices this on their master 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.160
 that's pretty much the case, but then he goes back 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.260
 while the two are doing a type consultation 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.120
 the customers for another turn around 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.140
 then it starts 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.350
 for them, the road may be damaged 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.360
 Accuracy is required here so that the right color is hit 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:13.009
 then it's time to die 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:17.009
 since i have no experience i am not allowed to go directly to the customers i am 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.489
 but I would have provided a medium a little bit just that 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.879
 Bertz can also do it by the customer 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.970
 starting from logging game scenes to inherit 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.730
 Source of the Neckar that looks easy to grab 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:35.289
 there is a lot to consider 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:38.289
 Karstadt will 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:41.869
 to be able to do his training as nastier 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:44.619
 a secondary school degree 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:48.029
 both in the company and in the inter-company training at the 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:49.269
 Chamber of Trade 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.269
 In total, the training offered three years 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:54.639
 Norbert 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.339
 we can see that a bit more clearly than the moon 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:00.840
 or really unbelievable 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.669
 exhausting has ceded light good luck 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:05.289
 for a variety of reasons 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.069
 So the social skills should really be there with Buy 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.449
 running is manual skill or talent is with the left hand 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:13.479
 has - that calculates the movie 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.169
 then the protest will be on the colors and so on 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.169
 unbelievable what 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.989
 Luckily I was not allowed to pick this up today 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.869
 reported that would have done 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:26.239
 make other clubs now 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.239
 if I wanted to do the whole thing pretend that direction 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:31.899
 Leon is very interested in the profession 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:35.119
 We recommend to all of you that it works the way you are doing 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.689
 Markus Plathner 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.019
 We are convinced that with a significant and talent 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.549
 Munich has for this profession 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.540
 all this does not bring any good white car or has anywhere to start 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.449
 he does not get through 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.519
 Takeda is everyone's information 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.909
 the audience the water in abundance, we have unfortunately already over 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.889
 but I'm afraid that's what Franz Liszt called it
