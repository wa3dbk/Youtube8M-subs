00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.939 

so<00:00:00.570> now<00:00:00.690> we're<00:00:00.840> ready<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:01.079> graph<00:00:01.439> the<00:00:01.770> knit

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
so now we're ready to graph the knit

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.490 
so now we're ready to graph the knit
stitches<00:00:02.340> and<00:00:02.850> just<00:00:03.629> like<00:00:03.780> with<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.200> purl

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
stitches and just like with the purl

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.499 
stitches and just like with the purl
stitches<00:00:04.890> we're<00:00:05.339> going<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.640> work<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.089> series<00:00:06.480> of

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
stitches we're going to work a series of

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.839 
stitches we're going to work a series of
four<00:00:06.930> steps<00:00:07.379> all<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.830> way<00:00:07.980> across<00:00:10.849> starting

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
four steps all the way across starting

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.150 
four steps all the way across starting
with<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.150> bridge<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.809> time<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.830> for<00:00:14.070> the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
with the bridge this time so for the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.099 
with the bridge this time so for the
first<00:00:15.199> pad<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.560> first<00:00:16.830> step<00:00:17.750> we<00:00:18.750> create<00:00:19.080> a

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
first pad the first step we create a

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.759 
first pad the first step we create a
bridge<00:00:19.439> over<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.160> purl<00:00:20.520> stitch<00:00:20.990> by<00:00:21.990> going

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
bridge over a purl stitch by going

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.089 
bridge over a purl stitch by going
through<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.100> V<00:00:23.930> that<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.080> created<00:00:25.529> when<00:00:25.890> we

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
through the V that we created when we

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.359 
through the V that we created when we
grafted<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.090> purl<00:00:27.359> stitches<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:29.130> first

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
grafted the purl stitches on the first

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:39.139 
grafted the purl stitches on the first
pass<00:00:30.740> that's<00:00:31.740> step<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:33.649> step<00:00:34.649> two<00:00:37.070> is<00:00:38.149> from

the knit stitch that's step two step

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.110 
the knit stitch that's step two step
three<00:00:48.559> is<00:00:49.559> through<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.190> knit<00:00:50.399> stitch<00:00:50.760> from

the provisional cast on row following
the<00:00:54.090> same<00:00:54.360> path<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:57.120> bridge<00:00:57.480> took<00:00:57.840> from

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
the same path that the bridge took from

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.410 
the same path that the bridge took from
the<00:00:58.469> first<00:00:58.739> pass<00:00:59.070> and<00:01:00.440> then<00:01:01.440> step<00:01:01.949> four<00:01:05.420> from

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the first pass and then step four from

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.179 
the first pass and then step four from
front<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.810> back<00:01:06.930> through<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> knit<00:01:07.890> stitch

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
front to back through the knit stitch

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:16.130 
front to back through the knit stitch
and<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.640> yarn<00:01:08.909> over<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:12.479> that's<00:01:12.659> step<00:01:13.200> one<00:01:15.140> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
and the yarn over so that's step one the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:25.609 
and the yarn over so that's step one the
bridge<00:01:16.670> over<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> purl<00:01:18.000> stitch<00:01:21.290> step<00:01:22.290> two<00:01:24.619> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
bridge over the purl stitch step two the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:34.620 
bridge over the purl stitch step two the
yarn<00:01:25.890> over<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.460> knit<00:01:26.610> stitch<00:01:29.210> step<00:01:30.210> three

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.880 

and<00:01:35.400> step<00:01:36.400> four<00:01:36.939> from<00:01:37.840> front<00:01:38.229> to<00:01:38.290> back<00:01:38.409> through

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
and step four from front to back through

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.980 
and step four from front to back through
the<00:01:38.979> knit<00:01:39.310> stitch<00:01:39.580> and<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.119> yarn<00:01:40.330> over

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.050 

so<00:01:43.990> let's<00:01:44.170> thread<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:45.190> working<00:01:45.670> yarn<00:01:45.700> onto

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
so let's thread the working yarn onto

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.430 
so let's thread the working yarn onto
the<00:01:46.299> tapestry<00:01:46.990> needle<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:52.330> now<00:01:53.110> we<00:01:53.170> can

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
the tapestry needle and now we can

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.210 
the tapestry needle and now we can
remove<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:54.009> waste<00:01:54.220> yarn<00:01:55.170> from<00:01:56.170> this<00:01:56.440> lower

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
remove the waste yarn from this lower

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:05.430 
remove the waste yarn from this lower
piece<00:02:01.500> step<00:02:02.500> one<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:03.070> bridge<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:05.140> all<00:02:05.229> hard

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
piece step one the bridge it's all hard

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.559 
piece step one the bridge it's all hard
to<00:02:05.590> see<00:02:05.830> on<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.039> edge<00:02:06.190> here<00:02:06.670> but<00:02:06.850> look<00:02:07.390> for

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
to see on the edge here but look for

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:22.170 
to see on the edge here but look for
that<00:02:07.690> V

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.789 

step<00:02:23.049> two<00:02:24.269> through<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:25.420> yarn<00:02:25.690> over<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.620> the

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
step two through the yarn over and the

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:36.490 
step two through the yarn over and the
knit<00:02:26.950> stitch<00:02:27.280> from<00:02:27.549> back<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.760> front

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:46.420 

step<00:02:37.500> 3

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:58.230 

and<00:02:46.879> step<00:02:47.780> 4

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.810 

and<00:02:59.240> usually<00:02:59.510> when<00:02:59.990> I<00:03:00.350> work<00:03:00.790> Kitchener<00:03:01.790> stitch

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
and usually when I work Kitchener stitch

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.030 
and usually when I work Kitchener stitch
or<00:03:02.390> any<00:03:02.540> kind<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.810> grafting<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.620> leave<00:03:03.890> the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
or any kind of grafting I leave the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.370 
or any kind of grafting I leave the
stitches<00:03:04.460> a<00:03:04.490> little<00:03:04.790> loose<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.330> then<00:03:05.990> I<00:03:06.020> go

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
stitches a little loose and then I go

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.350 
stitches a little loose and then I go
back<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.920> adjust<00:03:07.400> them<00:03:07.640> later<00:03:07.880> on<00:03:08.000> but<00:03:08.270> you

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
back and adjust them later on but you

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.430 
back and adjust them later on but you
don't<00:03:08.540> want<00:03:08.690> to<00:03:08.780> do<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:09.020> with<00:03:09.200> brioche

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
don't want to do that with brioche

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.000 
don't want to do that with brioche
because<00:03:10.100> of<00:03:10.460> its<00:03:11.150> interwoven<00:03:11.860> structure<00:03:12.860> it's

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
because of its interwoven structure it's

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.690 
because of its interwoven structure it's
just<00:03:13.190> going<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.400> be<00:03:13.490> way<00:03:13.730> too<00:03:13.790> hard<00:03:14.210> to<00:03:15.490> to<00:03:16.490> do

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
just going to be way too hard to to do

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.580 
just going to be way too hard to to do
that<00:03:16.970> so<00:03:17.300> you<00:03:17.360> want<00:03:17.600> to<00:03:17.690> adjust<00:03:17.780> them<00:03:18.230> as<00:03:18.440> you

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
that so you want to adjust them as you

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.790 
that so you want to adjust them as you
go<00:03:19.450> so<00:03:20.450> here<00:03:20.690> we<00:03:20.810> can<00:03:21.020> remove<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.620> waist

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
go so here we can remove the waist

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:36.380 
go so here we can remove the waist
journal<00:03:22.190> from<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.340> purl<00:03:22.670> stitch<00:03:24.640> step<00:03:25.640> one

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:51.210 

one

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:57.890 

to

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:05.500 

three

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.350 

and<00:06:06.010> for<00:06:07.010> then<00:06:07.490> make<00:06:07.940> sure<00:06:07.970> you<00:06:08.210> go<00:06:08.330> through

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
and for then make sure you go through

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:17.380 
and for then make sure you go through
both<00:06:08.780> of<00:06:08.840> those<00:06:09.380> on<00:06:09.830> the<00:06:09.980> last<00:06:10.190> step<00:06:16.180> and<00:06:17.180> now

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
both of those on the last step and now

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:27.990 
both of those on the last step and now
we<00:06:17.480> can<00:06:17.810> remove<00:06:18.680> the<00:06:18.890> chain<00:06:26.260> just<00:06:27.260> undo<00:06:27.710> it

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
we can remove the chain just undo it

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:39.370 
we can remove the chain just undo it
from<00:06:29.000> the<00:06:29.270> last<00:06:29.750> stitch<00:06:30.200> that<00:06:30.230> we<00:06:30.680> created

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:47.760 

you<00:06:40.380> can<00:06:40.590> get<00:06:40.800> that

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:07:06.150 

find<00:06:48.550> that<00:06:48.729> here<00:06:49.090> I<00:06:51.060> can<00:06:52.060> just<00:06:52.419> cut<00:06:52.660> it<00:06:52.780> too

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.749 

it<00:07:07.160> can<00:07:07.310> be<00:07:07.400> a<00:07:07.430> little<00:07:07.729> hard<00:07:07.940> to<00:07:08.090> find<00:07:08.479> that

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 
it can be a little hard to find that

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:30.090 
it can be a little hard to find that
beginning<00:07:10.759> here

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:30.100 

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.460 

and<00:07:30.640> sometimes<00:07:31.090> it<00:07:31.270> can<00:07:31.420> stick<00:07:32.080> a<00:07:32.110> little<00:07:32.350> bit

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:32.470 
and sometimes it can stick a little bit

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:37.170 
and sometimes it can stick a little bit
on<00:07:32.740> the<00:07:32.920> yarn<00:07:33.550> but<00:07:35.640> just<00:07:36.640> kind<00:07:36.880> of<00:07:36.940> have<00:07:37.150> to

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.180 
on the yarn but just kind of have to

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:56.450 
on the yarn but just kind of have to
work<00:07:37.780> it<00:07:38.020> out

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:56.460 

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.700 

you<00:07:57.060> can<00:07:57.210> see<00:07:57.449> that<00:07:58.220> the<00:07:59.220> grafting<00:07:59.880> has

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:00.710 
you can see that the grafting has

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.700 
you can see that the grafting has
duplicated<00:08:01.710> the<00:08:02.009> brioche<00:08:03.229> exactly<00:08:04.229> and<00:08:04.470> you

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:04.710 
duplicated the brioche exactly and you

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.879 
duplicated the brioche exactly and you
can't<00:08:04.979> even<00:08:05.099> tell<00:08:05.840> where<00:08:06.840> that<00:08:07.050> grafted<00:08:07.560> joint

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:07.889 
can't even tell where that grafted joint

00:08:07.889 --> 00:08:13.099 
can't even tell where that grafted joint
is<00:08:08.250> the<00:08:08.849> only<00:08:09.060> indication<00:08:09.660> is<00:08:09.990> the<00:08:10.289> yarn<00:08:10.620> ends
