00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Servus people welcome to the fitness tv 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.430
 my name is rafael today it's about 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.960
 the topic of meat, if we are 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.000
 we have one muscle building 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.410
 increased need for proteins and if 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.389
 If we do not cover this then they grow 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.950
 muscles only moderately 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.389
 we are looking for different sources 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.670
 so that we can say our protein 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.310
 Need blankets and meat can of course 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.250
 to be a source for that, assuming one 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.300
 is not vegetarian or vegan though 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.039
 Today I do not necessarily want to 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.750
 meat but rather 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.420
 to do a bit of enlightenment in 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:37.140
 referring to marmalade and meat 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.129
 gets therefore been excited wood day 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.510
 you really really meat 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.340
 thrown out afterwards no matter if one 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.510
 Doner kebab around the corner at the supermarket 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.000
 discounter or at any 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.860
 restaurant everywhere there is meat on 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.510
 the menu until at least always 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.430
 a meat dish and you have that 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.579
 feel that the flesh abounds 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.469
 are and when you consider that the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.980
 Production of one kilo of meat 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.590
 we are meat very elaborate that is 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.530
 we have several thousand liters of water and 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.229
 several kilos of cereals , so to speak 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.119
 kilo of beef to produce 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.950
 it is actually quite perverted 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.869
 in itself this idea now this 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.479
 Animal welfare and climate protection now 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.430
 really left out 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.860
 and since I am very up to date with that 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.049
 theme meat disputes alone 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.220
 already by this topic of the citizen 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.509
 the meat maybe from the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.220
 test tube what i did recently 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.310
 and that I did so 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.979
 makes a half paleo diet and a lot 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.450
 so much meat is currently consumed 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.770
 at least once a day arrives 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.540
 little meat on my plate 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.320
 and I try a little too 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.600
 vary 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.689
 I 'm so a little more 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.439
 set apart and I stand 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.880
 generally the whole 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.610
 food industry so a bit 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.500
 always suspicious of 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.320
 and now i have a short article 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.900
 of a 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.280
 google sent by me with 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.660
 what is the topic of sticking mischievous thing 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.310
 Misbehaviour is me then 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.650
 I asked myself that through 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.690
 and I thought oh my god 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.760
 so I knew where nothing 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.209
 that really was completely new territory for 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.459
 me and clearly i knew it 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.890
 I also knew that there is mold 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.690
 like cheese there are other things 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.570
 but I did not know that mischievous 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.780
 is what is meat-eating mischief meat 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:26.140
 is similar to compound meat 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.940
 how to shape meat just differently with splash 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.090
 is it so that you media pieces of meat 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.200
 this time does not knock 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.690
 so to speak the points e mail in the 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.330
 solve meat what gives you in shape and 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.670
 are heated by the heat by 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.959
 so to speak by the cooking is there 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.070
 These proteins combine 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.519
 meat again, so to speak 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.989
 before by the topic of each other 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.090
 The meat has dissolved so to speak 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.130
 the heat reassembled when 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.820
 Meat is quite different in the case of 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.830
 maybe you take care 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.350
 meat leftovers now we take from 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.860
 pig at the slaughterhouse 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.860
 is left over and gives one to it 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:07.420
 special material Transnet ami nose is 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.820
 This material throughout tami nose is a 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.709
 enzyme or are media enzymes 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.090
 made from certain bacteria 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.799
 be and transmitter ensures the nose 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.000
 for that proteins reappear 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.500
 network with each other 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.230
 So no matter what kind of proteins 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.060
 hurt each other again and again 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.799
 Now you do the more meat chunks 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.549
 them once and skin over them 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.200
 Transfluid ami nose and because I have that 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.940
 Everything is a bit like this 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.060
 this this this whole meat lumps 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.709
 in a form and leaves that for twelve 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.420
 hours rather cool 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.760
 and then you have a complete one 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.900
 club meat on the piece that looks then 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.000
 for example, if I am so now 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.370
 then it looks like an oblong shape 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.250
 How to piece off him from one piece 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.480
 pig or something or from the cow and man 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.160
 does not see that meat 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.930
 glued together you do not see it 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.419
 therefore generally towards meat and 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.640
 pork depending on where is 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:03.850
 Now come tell her you're right 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.430
 yes fibrous and with fat strem 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.600
 you do not see that this is offset 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:13.000
 meat is composed and this 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.770
 basic idea that you stick meat 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.140
 really can glue really live 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.959
 people really have me all over again 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.240
 completely different picture on these foods 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.419
 given to this meat industry 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.880
 I really thought what is there 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.669
 so go on how far is it going so 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.120
 theme in meat from the test tube is 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.700
 in itself really tricky I think 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.160
 times if that is healthy 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.950
 permanently be quite interesting 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.780
 Now for the world hunger I say 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.490
 because that too and a delicate one 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.710
 but this is actually the topic 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.010
 klebefleisch that's really a topic where 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:54.460
 I think that must be me there 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.360
 lament so much that is 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.040
 yes still meat 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.660
 it is he is not something 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.540
 is made or otherwise anyway 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.070
 but it does not even have to be 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.570
 be characterized that it for example 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.580
 Misery is it may be that you 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.470
 goes to the restaurant and you get one 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.000
 thick fat steak on the plate or 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.440
 something similar and that is 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.580
 Klebefleisch because it is the the 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.700
 restaurant owner is cheap 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.990
 has bought or is itself 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.669
 glued does this is also possible to 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.890
 you can plant these tami nose plants 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.780
 buy yourself there is online 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.310
 shop you pass the sowas come there 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.750
 I think a bag is 100 euros 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.380
 and then you can do your own 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.280
 make klebefleisch and yes that was 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.580
 so what did me a bit 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.479
 has a startled and a very different picture 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:40.180
 to this meat industry, so to speak 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.110
 has mediated and generally in itself 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.940
 meat is already with you 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.930
 antibiotics and stuff 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.650
 and I tried by now 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.810
 right to make sure that I bio 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.050
 so buy products in terms of meat 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:56.210
 not necessarily all of this now 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.160
 ready-made products buy now finished 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.710
 sliced ​​ham or 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.070
 so that's funny that then 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.000
 really 6 7 8 9 10 outgoing are the 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.730
 all are the same size 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.960
 that can not be so me 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.790
 I myself think everyone grows 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.230
 somehow a little bit different and this one 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.790
 whole slices are similar 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.190
 is finally a tricky topic 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.350
 and I have to say honestly that I am there 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.700
 no longer paying attention and preferably 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.530
 if I really could, I would at 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.320
 dearest to the farm around the 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.600
 corner and me from the farmer or 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.700
 from the butcher somehow fresh 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.220
 Unfortunately, meat does not come in one 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.430
 big city and farm is here 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.590
 do not drive safely out into the country 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.700
 and accordingly, that's a tricky one 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.230
 topic publicly and I wanted you 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.970
 at that time a bit inform in the 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.160
 video description you will find two links 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.900
 with two short documentations to the 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.790
 theme klebefleisch look at this 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.010
 Really this is really interesting to you 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.410
 and get you another one then 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.360
 look at this topic otherwise 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.980
 I also like to know how you stand 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.870
 you're the one opposite 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.760
 no matter the meat is stuck 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.260
 meant that can be any 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.840
 damage to health 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.730
 So far, there are no studies on them 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.890
 There is no such thing as a transport ami nose 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.300
 studies if that now any 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.830
 harmful effects on the 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.480
 but humans has how do you do that 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.740
 all about me just that trend 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.480
 let's take a look again 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.730
 bit discuss in the comments 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.830
 writes definitely have a look and 

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.360
 let me and we know in general 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.520
 how you are facing the topic 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.860
 since then, for sticking meat for mold meat 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.140
 respects her on when buying meat 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.160
 organic products or it does not matter 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.500
 Let's do it a bit 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.450
 would be very happy to discuss 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.850
 otherwise that was the topic 

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.350
 visit us on facebook as well 

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:40.570
 www.facebook.com / in fitness tv 

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.570
 that's it for the next time
