00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
pretty fun to fight go tanks actually

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.279 
pretty fun to fight go tanks actually
because<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.330> fight<00:00:30.570> him<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.900> get<00:00:31.050> him<00:00:31.170> down

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
because you fight him you get him down

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.350 
because you fight him you get him down
to<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> certain<00:00:31.859> health<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.369> he<00:00:32.820> splits<00:00:33.180> apart

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
to a certain health and he splits apart

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.780 
to a certain health and he splits apart
and<00:00:33.960> then<00:00:34.350> trunks<00:00:34.710> come<00:00:34.980> then<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.550> fight

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
and then trunks come then you fight

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.970 
and then trunks come then you fight
balls<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.480> then<00:00:36.809> they<00:00:36.930> go<00:00:37.140> back<00:00:37.170> together<00:00:37.559> at

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
balls and then they go back together at

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.920 
balls and then they go back together at
the<00:00:38.010> fusion<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.329> pretty<00:00:39.510> much<00:00:39.600> fight

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
the fusion so you pretty much fight

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.100 
the fusion so you pretty much fight
about<00:00:40.260> three<00:00:40.530> times<00:00:41.420> nothing<00:00:42.450> nothing<00:00:42.899> real

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
about three times nothing nothing real

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.549 
about three times nothing nothing real
hard<00:00:43.469> um<00:00:44.149> but<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.629> move<00:00:46.820> has<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:49.260> most

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
hard um but this move has to be the most

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.939 
hard um but this move has to be the most
defensive<00:00:50.370> move<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.180> game<00:00:51.390> why<00:00:51.989> because

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
defensive move in the game why because

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.069 
defensive move in the game why because
when<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.309> activate<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.300> become<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.719> Kazi

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
when you activate this you become a Kazi

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.250 
when you activate this you become a Kazi
attack<00:00:55.620> nothing<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.879> hit<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.300> when<00:00:58.079> those

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
attack nothing can hit you when those

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.770 
attack nothing can hit you when those

constantly<00:01:23.729> calling<00:01:24.479> out<00:01:24.750> go<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.320> mean<00:01:25.619> just

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
constantly calling out go so I mean just

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.160 
constantly calling out go so I mean just
try<00:01:26.790> for<00:01:27.030> yourself<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.509> tried<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.020> myself

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
try for yourself I tried it for myself

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.980 
try for yourself I tried it for myself
try<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:28.770> yourself<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.280> see<00:01:29.460> how<00:01:29.670> nothing<00:01:30.600> can

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
try for yourself and see how nothing can

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.359 
try for yourself and see how nothing can
attack<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.500> when<00:01:31.650> you're<00:01:31.829> calling<00:01:32.100> those

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
attack you when you're calling those

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.580 
attack you when you're calling those
ghosts<00:01:32.729> out<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> other<00:01:33.900> cool<00:01:34.380> part

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
ghosts out and then the other cool part

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.380 
ghosts out and then the other cool part
is<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.159> control<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.880> ghosts<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
is that you can control the ghosts and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.190 
is that you can control the ghosts and
bless<00:01:36.659> them<00:01:36.930> at<00:01:37.110> your<00:01:37.619> opponent<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:39.200> mean

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
bless them at your opponent so I mean

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.300 
bless them at your opponent so I mean
that's<00:01:40.439> pretty<00:01:40.619> much<00:01:40.829> it

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
that's pretty much it

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.960 
that's pretty much it
self-explanatory<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:43.860> go<00:01:44.040> tanks<00:01:44.549> match

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
self-explanatory and the go tanks match

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.499 
self-explanatory and the go tanks match
with<00:01:45.630> versus<00:01:46.229> me<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.799> my<00:01:47.490> super<00:01:47.759> vanishing

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
with versus me and my super vanishing

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.330 
with versus me and my super vanishing
ball<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.899> keeps<00:01:49.200> missing<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.829> really<00:01:50.130> not

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
ball that keeps missing and really not

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.649 
ball that keeps missing and really not
affecting<00:01:50.790> him<00:01:51.000> anymore

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
affecting him anymore

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.840 
affecting him anymore
I<00:01:51.689> guess<00:01:52.439> because<00:01:52.590> he<00:01:52.890> Super<00:01:53.549> Saiyan<00:01:53.759> or

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
I guess because he Super Saiyan or

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.819 
I guess because he Super Saiyan or
whatever<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.210> anyway<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.720> want<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.560> thank<00:01:55.619> you
