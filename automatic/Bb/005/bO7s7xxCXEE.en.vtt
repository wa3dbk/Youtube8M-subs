00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.820
 I was with rpm 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.359
 but you know what rpm belongs to 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.359
 maker 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:30.570
 As you can see I already have all this and I'm with 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.560
 this because they left me activated the me 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.560
 they left him activated 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.620

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.620
 everything is zero 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.510
 everything is zero, because I have already 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.270
 my contract has already finished as 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.170
 I 'm going to teach it now but I'm staying 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.900
 guarded 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.440
 according 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.030
 I am already saved access to the 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.000
 dashboard 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.100
 ok you want to go for example in this case 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.010
 As I tell you I teach you to get out of rpm 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.490
 OK 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.050
 rpm studio social blade or any 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.220
 another network that has access to this day 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.900
 why you have to be underage 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.270
 it just does not matter that you have exposed 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.430
 that when we signed the contract, 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.720
 willing that he had and six years or 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.240
 Twenty-nine I do not care 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.110
 no that does not matter I can be put 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.110
 good ones 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.780
 Yes, good 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.969
 I will show you only if you are older 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.560
 of age is worth how it can come out good 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:39.789
 of age or that you have put a 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.700
 contract that is of legal age although 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.500
 be less me for example in my contract 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.520
 when it was a contract that rpm I put 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.590
 that he was 30 years old but 14 so he 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.990
 I'm going to teach, you're going to 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.090
 support where we put per click aysÃ©n 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.560
 support 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:03.780
 ok here you have support vale 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.780
 and here you give him for example I gave him 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.220
 technical support 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.130
 and good 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.540
 here you have several 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.110
 good things but but good the museum 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.110
 that we have already studied 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.200
 here if I 'm not wrong I have my tickets 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.200
 best life rpm 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.820
 good to go out rpm I had to send two 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.400
 times not once did I have to leave for 12 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.020
 times 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.060
 one because he had done it wrong 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.280
 another so the right one good and this is 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.130
 a doubt that I had once 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.180
 you give him here where they put crea 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.180
 support and have blue 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.020
 OK 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.970
 as you can see the service of rpm is ominous 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.200
 so you will only have English but 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.930
 good 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:11.030
 the subject that is let's go to the hour 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:14.030
 you put live rpm it's worth quitting rpm 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.030
 category 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.440

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.120
 ok here you have here you put 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.450

 Earn no profit with good rpm with 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.760
 no company youtube is worth and 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.000
 I would need to cancel my contract since I would not 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.170
 I have permission from my parents worth putting 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.390
 it's something like that you do not invent 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:58.530
 something easy they are minors will 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:01.110
