00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
can't explain wait a minute why am i why

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.139 
can't explain wait a minute why am i why
am<00:01:55.410> I<00:01:55.590> thinking<00:01:55.890> out<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> one<00:01:56.520> negative<00:01:56.880> thing

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
am I thinking out the one negative thing

things because that's who you are if

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.950 
things because that's who you are if
that's<00:02:01.680> your<00:02:01.979> nature<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.700> find<00:02:03.270> those<00:02:03.570> one

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
that's your nature to find those one

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.380 
that's your nature to find those one
thing<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.979> one<00:02:05.310> small<00:02:05.700> negative<00:02:05.910> thing<00:02:06.240> and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
thing that one small negative thing and

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.139 
thing that one small negative thing and
then<00:02:06.479> pointed<00:02:06.899> out<00:02:07.020> then<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:08.640> are<00:02:08.880> going<00:02:09.060> to

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
then pointed out then you are going to

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.330 
then pointed out then you are going to
be<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.270> less<00:02:09.600> of<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.869> person<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.560> will<00:02:10.950> feel

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
be a less of a person you will feel

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.570 
be a less of a person you will feel
worse<00:02:12.030> about<00:02:12.209> yourself<00:02:13.130> if<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.280> don't<00:02:14.430> know

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
you know let's say we was in math class

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.190 
you know let's say we was in math class
in<00:02:56.130> high<00:02:56.370> school<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:56.880> was<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.120> smart<00:02:57.480> kid<00:02:57.690> in

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
think if he actually just set a goal and

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.370 
think if he actually just set a goal and
just<00:06:52.460> ran<00:06:53.000> with<00:06:53.240> it<00:06:53.300> he'd<00:06:53.630> be<00:06:53.750> able<00:06:53.960> to<00:06:54.020> do<00:06:54.200> it

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
just ran with it he'd be able to do it

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.230
