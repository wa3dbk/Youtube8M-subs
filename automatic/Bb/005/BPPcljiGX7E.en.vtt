00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.100
 de toledo what happened then happened 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.220
 the archive x of Brazilian ufology what 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.769
 was this file x objects started to 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.470
 fly over the region of toledo mongaguá 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.800
 to go to me but who is not of sane 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.520
 paulo gives a description where he is 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.730
 toledo in toledo is after peruíbe there 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.190
 on the south coast of sao paulo and has to 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.879
 who 's going the law for br-116 to 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.489
 valley of the river is not 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.010
 region for him to fulfill that 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.190
 region the law then it has several sites 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.010
 and there happened a bizarre case one 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.170
 object appeared there in the locality a 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.359
 person was toasted in the house with 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.940
 locked door including some animals 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.530
 died and we got 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.990
 the police report when we are 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.390
 speaking here of the military police is to hear 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.350
 a very intense search has the photos 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.110
 that are horrible 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.390
 suddenly shows the foot of the person who 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.060
 one because it is to show why we are going 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.150
 choose because the images are solid but 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.400
 What I wanted to talk about the military police 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.350
 besides having left the papers hence the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.090
 newspaper you can show yourself or you can 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.850
 give me one I'll show if they were worth between 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:38.009
 girls the newspaper at the time left the UFO 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:42.329
 scares and counties of the south coast and 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.549
 here we have an original telex from 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.460
 military police of the 3rd 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:52.549
 mongaguá that says that the vehicles will turn 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.470
 a UFO on February 16, 1994 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.079
 including they communicated to the air base 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.719
 of saints and the 4th comar 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.180
 here in são paulo lieutenant gordini stayed 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.290
 aware of this and passed on the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.530
 its commander to take the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.410
 with the annotations there 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.360
 and the interesting thing is that the radar is 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.700
 Paulo passed the information that was not 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.340
 no conventional aircraft 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.470
 in that region at that time and the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.310
 capital or captain alaor josé gasparoto 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:28.120
 who was from the 3rd company he got there 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.270
 Vehicle to vehicle 302/303 is written 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.360
 here and sent to the place and they 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.520
 saw this object near the saw 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.040
 on the following days when we 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.910
 we interviewed the captain there the joseph 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.980
 Gasparoto said he came to see 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.410
 again on subsequent days 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.180
 subsequent such objects but 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.790
 unfortunately despite having taken 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.090
 cameras to try not to shoot. 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.680
 were able to get sharp images 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.540
 of those objects in the region of 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.580
 danger to the édson machine in the 90 's. 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.890
 state of são paulo do not know if you will 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.320
 remember the moment had an index of 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.930
 fantastic sightings because the thing 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.010
 one but created then the region of peruíbe 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.540
 the region of Judea I say that I am 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.610
 much in that region I really like that 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.380
 region I see my wife one 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.900
 analysis and the sea there for our 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.049
 surprise being sea ​​upright and 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.510
 interesting to know but it's me 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.570
 I believe there is some kind of 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.660
 The subsea underground installation is 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:38.709
 if any of these races in that region 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.200
 but it's there I will not remember the name 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.290
 now it 's in this area of ​​Pedro de 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.570
 toledo has a person via sonda sitting 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.100
 within career being identical - 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.820
 It's always orange's personal. 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.160
 huh 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.700
 pm soldiers is within 14 siblings 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.400
 they are walking on the side of the state 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.130
 with this is very interesting this case 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.519
 present per year we research the region is 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.980
 since 1988 when I was the first 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.579
 time there by anne was there year of 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.510
 new 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:14.380
 we saw some objects and we photographed 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.049
 objects that have already been parsed 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.750
 including by specialist and was given 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.630
 as flying object no no no 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.789
 identified and for several years the 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.480
 jammil new village and I know he already 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.330
 had not here not yet 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.790
 so he got to photograph several 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.650
 objects there in the poranga region and we 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.400
 We also collect testimonials from 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.130
 people who saw serys serys luminosos 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.070
 bluish trees near waterfalls 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.080
 near caves and objects entering and 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.390
 coming out of the caves in that 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.670
 region has about 300 caves 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.040
 cataloged by peta which is the park 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.290
 tourist state of high river and 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:58.330
 people there, it is very common to see 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:01.760
 objects and name them as being 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.680
 folklore or is it the mother of gold is the ox 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.680
 There's a little mister that we 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.350
 we once interviewed that he saw a 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.050
 serzinho that he said was the sati 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.570
 only that it did not have characteristics of satiation 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:18.260
 sosaci has a leg only the mythological 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:20.390
 baby river geninho only this that saci 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.280
 he lived was a man the little one 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.040
 with two legs wearing a suit 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.560
 silver with a luminous hand ball or 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.720
 whether it is more for a crew member than a 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.630
 unidentified flying object than 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.240
 so the mythological version 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:39.050
 modernity of Israel is not very 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.850
 modern in this hyper super modern risk 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.880
 I do not believe there's anything 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:46.100
 in that region always this amount of 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.050
 sighting but I would like to go back one 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.140
 A little while again, the dish I 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.820
 I would like to know your opinion is not a 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.000
 The anthem has already gone through an event for normal 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.040
 in it's a tray simply 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.130
 he decided to move the wife of 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.840
 tobacco got desperate went upstairs 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.180
 flying to the room where he was 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.750
 talking to him happened 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.630
 then he finds out that there were 26 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:15.140
 inside your room 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:18.650
 even he drew in 100 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:21.140
 that is to say the following hypothetically 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.630
 Speaking the obvious, let's put it that way. 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.850
 hypothetical 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:28.430
 did iran already have some kind of 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.390
 connection with the phenomenon without it 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.670
 knew 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:35.540
 hypothetically speaking because he is 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:38.510
 chosen at the exact moment you start doing 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.430
 an investigation and accompanying the 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.900
 operation for not being you 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.480
 You do not know who was investigating. 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.950
 who receives the military by investigating 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.740
 Russians announced south is investigating 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.330
 because the military will not at any time 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.490
 We have had difficulty filming the object 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.430
 object standing on top of the 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.200
 aeronautics make the pose, the 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.260
 case of some window service in making 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.600
 a little show the rest they did, right? 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.370
 then it has the presence of being inside 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.140
 from his house 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.750
 would there be an important link 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:12.260
 with the forming mind is only then taking into 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:14.180
 view that in the interview he gave pro 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.060
 aerial game by marco antônio ticto was 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.040
 recorded including it shows including 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.260
 a sort of an implant in the arm 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.450
 then it may be that perhaps implant 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.550
 to activate something could be that this 

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:28.730
 implant was not placed 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:31.040
 during the dish operation may have been 

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:33.020
 But the chances are that the school will 

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.560
 will be able to see the mother of the parliament 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:39.470
 now that the paranormal phenomena 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:41.630
 sometimes linked to the 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:45.800
 ufo phenomenon this is fact 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:48.830
 then for example is telepathy objects if 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.870
 moving are fascinating things 

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.430
 also to worry about searching 

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.110
 If you have not done this you should get some 

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.490
 cases like this we go to our 

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.770
 second interval 

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.210
 we already assemble the last block phenomenon 

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:03.430
 physiological interview with a friend 

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:03.430
 edson boaventura john we'll be right back
