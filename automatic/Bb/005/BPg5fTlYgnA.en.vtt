00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 but if the presence of the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.089
 father at this moment the father is the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.099
 hobby that is going to be supporting a 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.650
 team and the team has to provide 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.410
 you have to do it because really if 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.690
 we want a stadium with a lot of 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.820
 amateurs we also have that we have 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.170
 than having a team that can be a 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.340
 stadium that was full like when 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.990
 you played the only time in your life 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.820
 provocation a friendly match you 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.460
 they lend for another person Spain so 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.869
 the inauguration of the stadium although 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.609
 many others remembered that what was discussed 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.360
 when it came well pleased to Barcelona 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.760
 as a party you are not crazy 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.250
 another Spanish version well and we won the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.590
 party was easier to lend 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.280
 loans for direct play is in the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.460
 circle that day in front of the shirt 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.210
 number 10 a rather partial story 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.210
 that shirt 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.940
 exactly and it 's another curious fact 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.330
 when you direct the selection of ecuador 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.460
 a half time in peru in lima 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.740
 that's right in that party in the transmission 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.660
 one of the most famous phrases of 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.640
 Ecuadorean journalism says who 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.440
 now he is your president but that works 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.150
 screams we go to the world we go to the 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.979
 world broadcasting that video 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.860
 and you were the leader of iu alfonso 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.479
 do you think your president was to that phrase 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.720
 When I tell you, I'm already looking for everything 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.250
 connection no longer serves anything but it serves in 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.750
 every case to be an anecdote and 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.270
 to have because at the end after 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.490
 all that is anecdotes the past is already 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.610
 past the past stepped says but 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.750
 there are always the most beautiful memories 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.640
 for people telling me it's good 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.860
 that now that you're there like when 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.740
 I played yes but I'm already futuristic 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.450
 I do not leave it in the sense that 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.190
 He did not let me teach him, he told me 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.170
 many to also be able to transmit to 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.210
 the guys that are now helps me 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.400
 in the dressing room it helps a lot because 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.770
 for 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.260
 the contact with the players and having 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.070
 the dressing room is easier the way 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.070
 you have to go far
