00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:08.589
 hello in this video I will explain 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.659
 how it makes the crossing point 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:13.709
 Distillate type cross stitch many 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:17.440
 people are asking me to 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:19.810
 put more videos of this distillate but 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.160
 look at if this is what you need 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:27.010
 distill the fabric and make the squares and 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.110
 also what all of this need 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:33.129
 is here this is called us the 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.679
 we know as a primer all of these 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.249
 cross stitch type are also made 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:41.469
 you can do it in distilled 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:44.079
 preparing the fabric can you do 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:47.170
 everything you want, look at me 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.190
 I prepared the web right now this is a 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.920
 rebozo 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.559
 is the part of an overflow then 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.589
 prepare the fabric and what I am now 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.980
 doing, look, I'm doing this 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.850
 flower that I am already doing here for 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.770
 what I'm doing here I'm going to do 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.950
 So far this is what I'm going to draw 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.770
 here then you just what 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.070
 they have that is assuming if they want 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.970
 do these little birds have to tell 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.000
 how many squares are here below for 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.429
 that you can make the squares 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.009
 on the web and they are already based on the primer 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.950
 and they are filling you also the 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.590
 can fill with color thread but 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.590
 no more that is what you have to 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.560
 make the fabric distill and make it like that in 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.539
 small squares already being the fabric you 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.890
 you can make the figure that you 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:48.770
 want they can make a flower can 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.180
 do this also as I tell you just 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.270
 your 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.600
 make the web look what they are going to do 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.210
 and try to center it look at how to be 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.240
 in this case I already told them that I'm going to 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.720
 make a flower here a few leaves 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:11.210
 a flower and some leaves then here I 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:14.420
 I counted and they are 80 squares then 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:18.040
 what I need from here are 63 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:22.880
 squares the rest I will try to 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.160
 leave them similar to trying to center the 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.130
 so that they understand me better then 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.660
 here I will sobrar seems to 9 and already 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:36.320
 every 8 is not exact but it is something else 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:40.490
 that's why, as I say, I do not have 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:43.300
 I have to make them a flower or 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.410
 what you want to do 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.020
 simply no more if you have 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:54.140
 this or a cross stitch type embroidery 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.660
 prepare the fabric in small squares and 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.720
 can you do what you 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.660
 want to do that as I say no 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.300
 have a case that I continue to upload a 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.600
 flower or what what you want 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.180
 can do so in distillate by 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.300
 I tell you that it's called frayed type 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.180
 cross stitch I do not know in reality how 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.370
 it is called but as you want thank you very much
