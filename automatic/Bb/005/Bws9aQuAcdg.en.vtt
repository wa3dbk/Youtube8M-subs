00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.000 
this story I'm going to teach you guys
how<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.620> add<00:00:07.740> data<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:09.120> your<00:00:09.420> files<00:00:09.750> so<00:00:10.590> in<00:00:10.889> the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
how to add data to your files so in the

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.039 
how to add data to your files so in the
last<00:00:11.190> story<00:00:11.580> we<00:00:11.820> pretty<00:00:12.059> much<00:00:12.150> learn<00:00:12.750> how<00:00:12.990> to

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
last story we pretty much learn how to

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.220 
last story we pretty much learn how to
create<00:00:13.469> an<00:00:13.590> empty<00:00:13.950> file<00:00:14.190> not<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.089> useful<00:00:15.330> so

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
create an empty file not that useful so

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.200 
create an empty file not that useful so
let's<00:00:16.830> go<00:00:16.980> ahead<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.279> put<00:00:17.430> something<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:18.029> it

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
let's go ahead and put something in it

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.870 
let's go ahead and put something in it
in<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:19.080> tutorial<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.100> hold<00:00:20.369> on<00:00:20.460> one<00:00:20.580> second

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
in this tutorial and hold on one second

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.279 
in this tutorial and hold on one second
I<00:00:20.910> got<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.240> itching<00:00:21.390> right<00:00:21.750> here<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:24.109> felt<00:00:25.109> good

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
I got to itching right here I felt good

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.560 
I got to itching right here I felt good
I<00:00:25.470> got<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.740> all<00:00:26.220> right<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:26.789> let's<00:00:27.029> go<00:00:27.180> ahead<00:00:27.269> and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
I got it all right so let's go ahead and

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.689 
I got it all right so let's go ahead and
import<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.019> couple<00:00:28.320> things<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.980> need<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.250> import

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
import a couple things we need to import

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.410 
import a couple things we need to import
Java<00:00:30.619> dot<00:00:31.619> IO<00:00:31.669> and<00:00:32.669> let's<00:00:32.940> go<00:00:33.090> ahead<00:00:33.270> and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
Java dot IO and let's go ahead and

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.049 
Java dot IO and let's go ahead and
import<00:00:33.660> everything<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.350> there<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.770> as<00:00:35.700> you

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
import everything from there and as you

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.819 
import everything from there and as you
can<00:00:36.149> see<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.360> made<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> separate<00:00:37.170> class<00:00:37.410> outside

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
can see I made a separate class outside

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.889 
can see I made a separate class outside
my<00:00:37.980> main<00:00:38.219> class<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:38.940> just<00:00:38.969> named<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.510> create

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
my main class and I just named it create

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.240 
my main class and I just named it create
file<00:00:40.140> because<00:00:40.559> that's<00:00:40.800> where<00:00:40.980> we're<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.190> to

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
file because that's where we're going to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.430 
file because that's where we're going to
be<00:00:41.370> doing<00:00:41.550> creating<00:00:42.239> files<00:00:42.450> that's<00:00:43.200> why<00:00:43.410> I

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
be doing creating files that's why I

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.889 
be doing creating files that's why I
named<00:00:43.649> did<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.670> next<00:00:45.090> let's<00:00:45.480> go<00:00:45.570> ahead

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
named did that so next let's go ahead

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.040 
named did that so next let's go ahead
and<00:00:46.079> put<00:00:46.379> Java<00:00:46.710> dot<00:00:47.100> Lang<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:48.239> need<00:00:48.450> some<00:00:48.660> crap

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
and put Java dot Lang we need some crap

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.630 
and put Java dot Lang we need some crap
from<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.500> there<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:52.039> lastly<00:00:53.039> let's<00:00:53.340> go<00:00:53.520> ahead

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
from in there and lastly let's go ahead

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.939 
from in there and lastly let's go ahead
and<00:00:53.940> import<00:00:54.420> Java<00:00:55.910> dot<00:00:56.910> util<00:00:57.600> I'm<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.620> exactly

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
and import Java dot util I'm not exactly

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.380 
and import Java dot util I'm not exactly
sure<00:00:59.190> what<00:00:59.340> we're<00:00:59.640> going<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.850> be<00:00:59.969> building<00:01:00.210> in

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
sure what we're going to be building in

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.610 
sure what we're going to be building in
this<00:01:00.480> tutorial<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.289> should<00:01:01.440> cover

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
this tutorial but this should cover

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.509 
this tutorial but this should cover
everything<00:01:02.809> so<00:01:03.809> without<00:01:04.379> further<00:01:04.680> ado<00:01:05.129> let<00:01:05.430> me

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
everything so without further ado let me

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.670 
everything so without further ado let me
think<00:01:05.700> what<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.090> want<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.479> do<00:01:06.659> first<00:01:06.990> well

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
think what do I want to do first well

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.200 
think what do I want to do first well
the<00:01:07.860> first<00:01:08.100> thing<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.400> need<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.640> do<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.180> a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the first thing we need to do is do a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.160 
the first thing we need to do is do a
private<00:01:11.180> formatter<00:01:12.180> variable<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.900> I'm<00:01:12.990> going

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
private formatter variable and I'm going

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.320 
private formatter variable and I'm going
to<00:01:13.200> name<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.500> X<00:01:13.740> as<00:01:14.040> usual<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.760> what<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.210> is

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
to name on X as usual and what this is

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.510 
to name on X as usual and what this is
going<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.600> do<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.900> hold<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.380> formatter<00:01:16.890> object

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
going to do is hold a formatter object

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.080 
going to do is hold a formatter object
and<00:01:17.729> let's<00:01:18.390> go<00:01:18.509> ahead<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.020> make<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.710> method<00:01:20.250> to

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
and let's go ahead and make a method to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.440 
and let's go ahead and make a method to
pretty<00:01:21.720> much<00:01:21.869> create<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.590> open<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:23.189> file<00:01:23.790> so

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
pretty much create and open a file so

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.960 
pretty much create and open a file so
let's<00:01:24.479> go<00:01:24.750> ahead<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.049> put<00:01:25.200> public<00:01:25.619> void<00:01:26.610> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
let's go ahead and put public void and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.289 
let's go ahead and put public void and
we'll<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.479> name<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.890> Open<00:01:28.890> File<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.939> name<00:01:30.150> it

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
we'll just name it Open File you name it

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.069 
we'll just name it Open File you name it
whatever<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.720> want

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
whatever you want

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.080 
whatever you want
it's<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.740> doesn't<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.310> any<00:01:32.490> parameters

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
it's a doesn't like any parameters

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.190 
it's a doesn't like any parameters
because<00:01:33.329> they're<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.840> open<00:01:34.110> a

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
because they're just going to open a

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.950 
because they're just going to open a
file<00:01:34.640> now<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:35.939> method<00:01:36.150> what<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:36.509> want<00:01:36.869> to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
file now in this method what we want to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.899 
file now in this method what we want to
do<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.229> got<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.979> our<00:01:38.009> try<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.729> catch

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
do we got to have our try and catch

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.510 
do we got to have our try and catch
block<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:39.659> always<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.770> let's<00:01:41.040> go<00:01:41.159> ahead<00:01:41.280> and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
block like always so let's go ahead and

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.609 
block like always so let's go ahead and
try<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.150> set<00:01:42.750> X<00:01:43.020> equal<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.530> new<00:01:44.299> for<00:01:45.380> Matt's<00:01:46.380> or

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
try and set X equal to new for Matt's or

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.609 
try and set X equal to new for Matt's or
object<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.399> go<00:01:48.240> ahead<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.479> write<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> file<00:01:49.290> name

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.340 
um make sure you write one that you
don't<00:01:52.350> already<00:01:53.210> have<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> file<00:01:54.720> or<00:01:54.990> else<00:01:55.170> you're

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
don't already have a file or else you're

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.870 
don't already have a file or else you're
going<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.590> overwrite<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.369> don't<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.790> a

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
going to overwrite it so I don't have a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.560 
going to overwrite it so I don't have a
file<00:01:57.090> called<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.570> Chinese<00:01:58.110> text<00:01:59.570> you

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
file called like Chinese text you

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.880 
file called like Chinese text you
probably<00:02:00.840> don't<00:02:01.020> either<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.710> use

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
probably don't either so you can use

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.010 
probably don't either so you can use
that<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:04.020> go<00:02:04.320> ahead<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.700> try<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.149> set<00:02:06.780> this

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
that so go ahead and try and set this

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.760 
that so go ahead and try and set this
file<00:02:07.409> equal<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.459> X<00:02:08.869> if<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.080> can't<00:02:10.349> let's<00:02:10.619> just

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
file equal to X if you can't let's just

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.860 
file equal to X if you can't let's just
go<00:02:10.920> ahead<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.400> catch<00:02:11.580> an<00:02:11.730> exception

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
go ahead and catch an exception

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.690 
go ahead and catch an exception
catch<00:02:13.730> exception<00:02:14.730> II<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:17.250> pretty<00:02:17.610> much

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
catch exception II and this pretty much

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.789 
catch exception II and this pretty much
means<00:02:18.060> if<00:02:18.299> you<00:02:18.510> get<00:02:18.720> an<00:02:18.840> error<00:02:19.140> what<00:02:19.650> do<00:02:19.709> you

want to do
let's<00:02:20.670> do<00:02:20.879> system.out.print<00:02:22.010> line<00:02:26.299> just<00:02:27.299> put

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
let's do system.out.print line just put

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.640 
let's do system.out.print line just put
you<00:02:28.080> have<00:02:28.470> an<00:02:28.799> air<00:02:29.750> air<00:02:30.750> no<00:02:31.140> error<00:02:31.890> there<00:02:32.670> we<00:02:32.879> go

method open file it's pretty much just
going<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.930> set<00:02:40.170> X<00:02:40.379> equal<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.099> this<00:02:41.129> file<00:02:41.489> it's

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
going to set X equal to this file it's

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.940 
going to set X equal to this file it's
pretty<00:02:42.000> much<00:02:42.209> just<00:02:42.599> going<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.930> give<00:02:43.170> us<00:02:43.379> a<00:02:43.560> file

pretty much just going to give us a file

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.330 
pretty much just going to give us a file
so<00:02:44.489> we<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.819> use<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:45.750> now<00:02:46.019> we<00:02:46.560> have<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.769> file<00:02:47.069> that

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
so we can use so now we have a file that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.849 
so we can use so now we have a file that
we<00:02:47.459> can<00:02:47.579> use<00:02:47.879> so<00:02:48.540> what<00:02:48.810> we<00:02:49.049> want<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.379> do<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.650> that

adding<00:03:02.280> records<00:03:02.489> is<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:02.970> easiest<00:03:03.540> thing<00:03:03.930> in

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
adding records is the easiest thing in

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.410 
adding records is the easiest thing in
the<00:03:04.200> world<00:03:04.319> all<00:03:04.859> you<00:03:05.250> need<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.519> do<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:05.909> put<00:03:06.299> the

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
file you want to add to which is X

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.759 
file you want to add to which is X
because<00:03:09.209> remember<00:03:09.569> we<00:03:09.840> set<00:03:10.049> equal<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.349> Chinese

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
because remember we set equal to Chinese

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.110 
because remember we set equal to Chinese
dot<00:03:10.950> txt<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.489> what<00:03:12.359> you<00:03:12.480> do<00:03:12.659> is<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.290> method<00:03:13.680> is

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
dot txt and what you do is the method is

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.309 
dot txt and what you do is the method is
format<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.359> this<00:03:15.569> pretty<00:03:15.750> much<00:03:15.959> is<00:03:15.989> like

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
format and this pretty much is like

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.199 
format and this pretty much is like
printf<00:03:16.889> for<00:03:17.700> files<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.630> now<00:03:19.430> again<00:03:20.430> how

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
printf for files and now again how

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.089 
printf for files and now again how
familiar<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.959> this<00:03:22.169> the<00:03:22.440> format<00:03:22.889> and<00:03:23.040> the

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
familiar is this the format and the

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.809 
familiar is this the format and the
arguments<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.329> for<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.780> format<00:03:25.230> let's<00:03:25.819> let's

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
arguments so for the format let's let's

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.180 
arguments so for the format let's let's
insert<00:03:27.090> three<00:03:27.540> strings<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:30.840> first<00:03:31.109> one<00:03:31.379> say

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
insert three strings the first one say

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.849 
insert three strings the first one say
we're<00:03:32.370> making<00:03:32.489> like<00:03:32.879> a<00:03:32.910> user<00:03:33.660> account<00:03:34.109> the

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
we're making like a user account the

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.770 
we're making like a user account the
first<00:03:35.069> one<00:03:35.280> will<00:03:35.430> be<00:03:35.579> the<00:03:35.700> ID<00:03:35.879> number<00:03:36.419> so<00:03:36.450> we'll

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
first one will be the ID number so we'll

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.729 
first one will be the ID number so we'll
put<00:03:37.019> like<00:03:37.549> 20<00:03:38.549> it's<00:03:38.790> my<00:03:38.910> favorite<00:03:39.269> number<00:03:39.540> and

which is Bucky and the third piece of

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.770 
which is Bucky and the third piece of
data<00:03:46.169> will<00:03:46.440> be<00:03:46.790> Roberts<00:03:47.790> which<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.389> my<00:03:48.540> last

what this is going to do is insert three

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.129 
what this is going to do is insert three
elements<00:03:56.489> in<00:03:56.639> the<00:03:57.180> same<00:03:57.419> line<00:03:57.660> it's<00:03:57.900> going<00:03:58.019> to

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
elements in the same line it's going to

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.860 
elements in the same line it's going to
say<00:03:58.260> 20<00:03:58.709> Bucky<00:03:59.370> Roberts<00:04:00.120> it's<00:04:00.599> going<00:04:00.810> to

insert<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.500> in<00:04:01.739> our<00:04:02.190> file<00:04:02.519> whenever<00:04:03.359> we<00:04:03.540> call

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
insert that in our file whenever we call

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.349 
insert that in our file whenever we call
this<00:04:03.989> method<00:04:04.199> add<00:04:04.620> records<00:04:04.919> and<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:06.120> last

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
this method add records and the last

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.330 
this method add records and the last
thing<00:04:06.660> that<00:04:06.690> we<00:04:06.989> want<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.319> do<00:04:07.530> is<00:04:07.799> write<00:04:08.310> a

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
thing that we want to do is write a

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.580 
thing that we want to do is write a
method<00:04:08.579> to<00:04:08.849> close<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.329> file<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:10.169> go<00:04:10.199> ahead<00:04:10.470> and

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
method to close the file so go ahead and

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.129 
method to close the file so go ahead and
write<00:04:10.799> public<00:04:11.989> void<00:04:13.340> close<00:04:14.340> file<00:04:15.030> or<00:04:15.389> name<00:04:16.019> it

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
write public void close file or name it

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.420 
write public void close file or name it
whatever<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:16.560> want<00:04:16.680> but<00:04:16.949> that's<00:04:17.099> pretty<00:04:17.280> easy

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
whatever you want but that's pretty easy

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.779 
whatever you want but that's pretty easy
to<00:04:17.699> remember<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.419> why<00:04:19.410> do<00:04:19.470> we<00:04:19.620> need<00:04:19.949> to<00:04:20.340> put<00:04:20.579> oh

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
to remember and why do we need to put oh

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.580 
to remember and why do we need to put oh
I<00:04:20.909> would<00:04:21.390> show<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:21.900> guys<00:04:21.959> what<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.380> thing<00:04:22.560> is

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
I would show you guys what the thing is

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.110 
I would show you guys what the thing is
X<00:04:23.030> close<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:24.419> closes<00:04:24.930> built-in<00:04:25.409> methods

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
X close and closes built-in methods

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.540 
X close and closes built-in methods
that's<00:04:26.330> why<00:04:26.690> we<00:04:26.870> can<00:04:27.050> use<00:04:27.230> this<00:04:27.470> and<00:04:27.770> that's

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
that's why we can use this and that's

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.340 
that's why we can use this and that's
why<00:04:28.699> we<00:04:28.880> need<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.210> include<00:04:29.600> all<00:04:29.810> these<00:04:30.020> so<00:04:30.230> we

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
why we need to include all these so we

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.680 
why we need to include all these so we
can<00:04:30.500> use<00:04:30.650> this<00:04:30.800> close<00:04:31.160> method<00:04:31.460> but<00:04:31.820> now<00:04:32.000> let<00:04:32.600> me

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
can use this close method but now let me

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.689 
can use this close method but now let me
tell<00:04:32.810> you<00:04:32.960> guys<00:04:33.050> why<00:04:33.380> we<00:04:33.680> need<00:04:33.889> to<00:04:33.980> close<00:04:34.310> this

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
tell you guys why we need to close this

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.000 
tell you guys why we need to close this
file<00:04:35.290> it's<00:04:36.290> pretty<00:04:36.590> much<00:04:36.740> like<00:04:36.800> a

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
file it's pretty much like a

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.939 
file it's pretty much like a
housekeeping<00:04:37.699> thing<00:04:38.000> whenever<00:04:38.930> we<00:04:39.410> exit<00:04:39.860> our

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
housekeeping thing whenever we exit our

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.550 
housekeeping thing whenever we exit our
program<00:04:40.400> windows<00:04:41.120> usually<00:04:42.050> and<00:04:42.290> I<00:04:42.350> say

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
program windows usually and I say

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.850 
program windows usually and I say
usually<00:04:43.120> closes<00:04:44.120> our<00:04:44.330> file<00:04:44.750> from<00:04:45.260> writing<00:04:45.680> so

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
usually closes our file from writing so

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.710 
usually closes our file from writing so
nothing<00:04:46.280> else<00:04:46.400> can<00:04:46.610> write<00:04:46.820> in<00:04:46.970> it<00:04:47.150> but

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
nothing else can write in it but

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.840 
nothing else can write in it but
sometimes<00:04:48.160> remember<00:04:49.160> every<00:04:49.430> operating

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
sometimes remember every operating

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.240 
sometimes remember every operating
system<00:04:50.150> is<00:04:50.300> different<00:04:50.810> sometimes<00:04:51.500> depending

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
system is different sometimes depending

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.100 
system is different sometimes depending
on<00:04:52.370> your<00:04:52.490> program<00:04:52.880> it<00:04:53.060> can<00:04:53.449> leave<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:53.840> file

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
on your program it can leave the file

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.350 
on your program it can leave the file
open<00:04:54.560> it<00:04:54.740> can<00:04:54.949> lead<00:04:55.160> to<00:04:55.190> some<00:04:55.460> errors<00:04:55.760> so<00:04:56.330> you

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
open it can lead to some errors so you

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.740 
open it can lead to some errors so you
always<00:04:57.050> want<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:58.010> close<00:04:58.790> your<00:04:59.060> files<00:04:59.419> it's

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
always want to close your files it's

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.690 
always want to close your files it's
good<00:05:00.020> programming<00:05:00.530> you<00:05:01.010> always<00:05:01.310> want<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.580> do

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
good programming you always want to do

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.700 
good programming you always want to do
it<00:05:01.850> I<00:05:02.000> mean<00:05:02.389> you<00:05:02.570> can<00:05:02.720> probably<00:05:03.020> get<00:05:03.290> away<00:05:03.320> with

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
it I mean you can probably get away with

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.800 
it I mean you can probably get away with
not<00:05:03.950> doing<00:05:04.340> it<00:05:04.490> but<00:05:04.729> if<00:05:04.850> you<00:05:04.970> ever<00:05:05.180> get<00:05:05.389> job<00:05:05.660> as

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
not doing it but if you ever get job as

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.540 
not doing it but if you ever get job as
a<00:05:05.840> Java<00:05:06.110> programmer<00:05:06.560> there<00:05:07.100> are<00:05:07.190> going<00:05:07.340> to<00:05:07.400> be

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
a Java programmer there are going to be

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.580 
a Java programmer there are going to be
pio<00:05:08.000> to<00:05:08.180> you<00:05:08.479> if<00:05:08.570> you<00:05:08.750> forget<00:05:09.110> to<00:05:09.169> close<00:05:09.410> your

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
pio to you if you forget to close your

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.350 
pio to you if you forget to close your
files<00:05:09.860> it's<00:05:10.460> probably<00:05:10.760> going<00:05:10.850> to<00:05:10.970> cause<00:05:11.120> some

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
files it's probably going to cause some

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.600 
files it's probably going to cause some
errors<00:05:11.840> later<00:05:11.990> down<00:05:12.320> the<00:05:12.350> road<00:05:12.530> so<00:05:12.889> we're

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
errors later down the road so we're

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.150 
errors later down the road so we're
pretty<00:05:13.790> much<00:05:14.590> recap<00:05:15.590> talking<00:05:16.040> about

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
pretty much recap talking about

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.409 
pretty much recap talking about
something<00:05:16.370> different<00:05:16.520> now<00:05:16.880> we're<00:05:17.270> pretty

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
something different now we're pretty

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.510 
something different now we're pretty
much<00:05:17.539> got<00:05:17.810> three<00:05:18.080> methods<00:05:18.470> in<00:05:18.620> here<00:05:18.860> we<00:05:19.340> need

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
much got three methods in here we need

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.580 
much got three methods in here we need
to<00:05:19.610> open<00:05:19.850> the<00:05:19.970> file<00:05:20.180> we<00:05:20.900> need<00:05:21.110> to<00:05:21.229> add<00:05:21.350> some

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
to open the file we need to add some

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.560 
to open the file we need to add some
records<00:05:22.010> into<00:05:22.310> it<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:22.639> then<00:05:23.150> we<00:05:23.300> need<00:05:23.479> to

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
records into it and then we need to

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.879 
records into it and then we need to
close<00:05:23.780> the<00:05:23.960> file<00:05:24.139> because<00:05:24.320> we're<00:05:24.560> done<00:05:24.740> with

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
close the file because we're done with

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.320 
close the file because we're done with
it<00:05:25.010> we<00:05:25.160> don't<00:05:25.250> want<00:05:25.460> anyone<00:05:25.669> else<00:05:25.910> messing

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
it we don't want anyone else messing

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.930 
it we don't want anyone else messing
with<00:05:26.360> it<00:05:26.630> so<00:05:27.260> go<00:05:27.470> ahead<00:05:27.710> and<00:05:27.979> in<00:05:28.130> your<00:05:28.310> main<00:05:28.610> or

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
with it so go ahead and in your main or

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.779 
with it so go ahead and in your main or
whatever<00:05:29.360> your<00:05:29.660> main<00:05:30.320> method<00:05:30.650> is<00:05:30.830> just<00:05:31.580> go

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
whatever your main method is just go

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.879 
whatever your main method is just go
ahead<00:05:32.030> and<00:05:32.300> well<00:05:32.900> we<00:05:33.229> don't<00:05:33.350> need<00:05:33.530> to<00:05:33.650> include

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
ahead and well we don't need to include

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.150 
ahead and well we don't need to include
anything<00:05:34.750> but<00:05:35.750> what<00:05:35.900> we<00:05:35.990> do<00:05:36.200> need<00:05:36.440> is<00:05:36.680> to

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
anything but what we do need is to

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.800 
anything but what we do need is to
create<00:05:37.310> an<00:05:37.520> object<00:05:37.910> and<00:05:38.060> I<00:05:38.150> named<00:05:38.389> my<00:05:38.510> class

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
create an object and I named my class

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.219 
create an object and I named my class
create<00:05:39.440> file<00:05:39.650> so<00:05:40.550> create<00:05:41.120> firearms<00:05:41.840> can<00:05:42.050> name

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
create file so create firearms can name

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.040 
create file so create firearms can name
it<00:05:42.260> like<00:05:42.440> G<00:05:42.800> or<00:05:42.979> something<00:05:43.750> new

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
it like G or something new

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.589 
it like G or something new
great<00:05:46.010> file<00:05:46.460> doesn't<00:05:47.030> take<00:05:47.240> any<00:05:47.389> parameters

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:47.599 
great file doesn't take any parameters

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:49.650 
great file doesn't take any parameters
we<00:05:48.110> didn't<00:05:48.320> make<00:05:48.410> a<00:05:48.470> constructor<00:05:49.160> and

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
we didn't make a constructor and

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.870 
we didn't make a constructor and
remember<00:05:50.660> we<00:05:50.810> have<00:05:50.930> three<00:05:51.580> methods<00:05:52.580> you<00:05:52.700> go

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
remember we have three methods you go

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.080 
remember we have three methods you go
open<00:05:53.630> file<00:05:53.990> right<00:05:54.500> there

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
open file right there

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.540 
open file right there
G<00:05:56.090> would<00:05:56.539> rename<00:05:56.870> it<00:05:57.080> add<00:05:57.680> records<00:05:58.280> right

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
G would rename it add records right

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.210 
G would rename it add records right
there<00:05:58.789> and<00:05:59.030> so<00:05:59.900> now<00:06:00.110> we<00:06:00.169> open<00:06:00.380> the<00:06:00.620> file<00:06:00.830> we

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
there and so now we open the file we

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.029 
there and so now we open the file we
added<00:06:01.550> the<00:06:01.669> records<00:06:02.060> and<00:06:02.300> now<00:06:03.169> what<00:06:03.889> we<00:06:04.010> need

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
added the records and now what we need

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.060 
added the records and now what we need
to<00:06:04.340> do<00:06:04.490> is<00:06:04.639> close<00:06:05.240> that<00:06:06.050> file<00:06:06.349> because<00:06:06.889> we're

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
to do is close that file because we're

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.040 
to do is close that file because we're
done<00:06:07.220> with<00:06:07.400> it<00:06:07.580> and<00:06:07.729> now<00:06:08.389> once<00:06:08.660> you<00:06:08.810> go<00:06:08.930> ahead

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
done with it and now once you go ahead

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.330 
done with it and now once you go ahead
and<00:06:09.380> run<00:06:09.620> this<00:06:09.740> program

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
and run this program

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.089 
and run this program
nothing<00:06:11.300> happens<00:06:11.780> but<00:06:12.229> what<00:06:12.560> it<00:06:12.680> did<00:06:12.830> is

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:13.099 
nothing happens but what it did is

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:15.850 
nothing happens but what it did is
created<00:06:13.610> a<00:06:13.700> file<00:06:13.970> on<00:06:14.300> our<00:06:14.479> computer<00:06:14.930> so<00:06:15.620> if<00:06:15.710> we

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
created a file on our computer so if we

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.740 
created a file on our computer so if we
highlight<00:06:16.099> source<00:06:16.700> are<00:06:16.970> actually<00:06:17.330> Bucky<00:06:17.720> and

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
highlight source are actually Bucky and

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.010 
highlight source are actually Bucky and
put<00:06:18.139> file<00:06:19.150> refresh<00:06:20.150> it's<00:06:20.450> pretty<00:06:20.690> much<00:06:20.840> going

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
put file refresh it's pretty much going

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.890 
put file refresh it's pretty much going
to<00:06:21.139> refresh<00:06:21.560> our<00:06:21.830> computer<00:06:22.280> so<00:06:23.180> now<00:06:23.389> you<00:06:23.450> see

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
to refresh our computer so now you see

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.440 
to refresh our computer so now you see
we<00:06:24.169> get<00:06:24.289> this<00:06:24.440> Chinese<00:06:24.979> text<00:06:25.760> file<00:06:26.090> that<00:06:26.330> we

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
we get this Chinese text file that we

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.420 
we get this Chinese text file that we
just<00:06:26.479> created<00:06:26.990> and<00:06:27.229> the<00:06:28.039> cool<00:06:28.220> thing<00:06:28.400> about

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
just created and the cool thing about

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.360 
just created and the cool thing about
eclipse<00:06:29.060> is<00:06:29.240> is<00:06:29.389> actually<00:06:30.020> a<00:06:30.260> text<00:06:30.860> editor<00:06:31.250> as

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
eclipse is is actually a text editor as

so<00:06:47.830> now<00:06:47.979> let's<00:06:48.219> recap<00:06:48.490> one<00:06:48.969> last<00:06:49.240> time<00:06:49.509> what<00:06:49.869> we

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
so now let's recap one last time what we

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.600 
so now let's recap one last time what we
did<00:06:50.939> in<00:06:52.110> create<00:06:53.110> file<00:06:53.349> that<00:06:53.830> Java<00:06:54.249> is<00:06:54.369> pretty

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
did in create file that Java is pretty

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.459 
did in create file that Java is pretty
much<00:06:54.729> the<00:06:54.879> meat<00:06:55.089> of<00:06:55.209> our<00:06:55.360> program<00:06:55.809> we<00:06:56.259> created

00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:56.469 
much the meat of our program we created

00:06:56.469 --> 00:07:00.239 
much the meat of our program we created
a<00:06:56.860> method<00:06:57.339> to<00:06:57.729> create<00:06:57.969> a<00:06:58.179> file<00:06:58.569> and<00:06:58.869> that<00:06:59.860> was

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:00.249 
a method to create a file and that was

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:03.329 
a method to create a file and that was
open<00:07:00.849> file<00:07:01.300> right<00:07:01.779> here<00:07:02.020> and<00:07:02.199> we<00:07:02.919> needed<00:07:03.219> a

00:07:03.329 --> 00:07:03.339 
open file right here and we needed a

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:05.969 
open file right here and we needed a
try-catch<00:07:03.909> because<00:07:04.389> of<00:07:04.509> Java<00:07:04.809> and<00:07:05.110> we<00:07:05.770> said

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:05.979 
try-catch because of Java and we said

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:08.309 
try-catch because of Java and we said
all<00:07:06.159> right<00:07:06.689> we're<00:07:07.689> going<00:07:07.869> to<00:07:07.929> look<00:07:08.110> for

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 
all right we're going to look for

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:11.189 
all right we're going to look for
Chinese<00:07:08.699> text<00:07:09.699> that<00:07:09.999> file<00:07:10.360> we<00:07:10.659> want<00:07:10.899> to<00:07:11.020> write

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 
Chinese text that file we want to write

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:13.649 
Chinese text that file we want to write
on<00:07:11.379> if<00:07:11.529> we<00:07:12.219> don't<00:07:12.249> have<00:07:12.639> it<00:07:12.669> already<00:07:12.939> then

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:13.659 
on if we don't have it already then

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:15.449 
on if we don't have it already then
create<00:07:14.050> a<00:07:14.110> new<00:07:14.289> one<00:07:14.439> so<00:07:14.499> we<00:07:14.770> can<00:07:14.860> write<00:07:15.129> in<00:07:15.309> it

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:15.459 
create a new one so we can write in it

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:18.779 
create a new one so we can write in it
and<00:07:15.610> that's<00:07:15.939> what<00:07:16.149> X<00:07:16.569> new<00:07:17.110> formatter<00:07:17.680> does<00:07:18.009> so

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:18.789 
and that's what X new formatter does so

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:22.079 
and that's what X new formatter does so
now<00:07:19.149> we<00:07:19.209> have<00:07:19.749> a<00:07:19.779> Chinese<00:07:20.409> text<00:07:21.249> file<00:07:21.430> so<00:07:21.699> we

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:22.089 
now we have a Chinese text file so we

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:24.869 
now we have a Chinese text file so we
can<00:07:22.240> write<00:07:22.449> text<00:07:22.899> in<00:07:23.020> it<00:07:23.199> so<00:07:23.830> what<00:07:24.369> do<00:07:24.459> we<00:07:24.699> want

00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:24.879 
can write text in it so what do we want

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:26.339 
can write text in it so what do we want
to<00:07:24.999> write<00:07:25.149> in<00:07:25.270> it<00:07:25.389> well<00:07:25.599> we<00:07:25.779> just<00:07:25.959> wanted<00:07:26.199> to

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:26.349 
to write in it well we just wanted to

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:29.100 
to write in it well we just wanted to
add<00:07:26.589> a<00:07:26.619> record<00:07:27.309> we<00:07:27.879> gave<00:07:28.240> myself<00:07:28.479> like<00:07:28.839> an<00:07:28.930> ID

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.110 
add a record we gave myself like an ID

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.639 
add a record we gave myself like an ID
number

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:29.649 
number

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:32.790 
number
Bucky<00:07:30.249> Roberts<00:07:30.789> and<00:07:31.119> if<00:07:31.839> we<00:07:32.019> had<00:07:32.319> to<00:07:32.409> make<00:07:32.559> like

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 
Bucky Roberts and if we had to make like

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.659 
Bucky Roberts and if we had to make like
a<00:07:32.830> system<00:07:33.309> of<00:07:33.580> like<00:07:33.789> I<00:07:35.189> had<00:07:36.189> to<00:07:36.309> make<00:07:36.459> like<00:07:36.639> a

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:36.669 
a system of like I had to make like a

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:39.029 
a system of like I had to make like a
library<00:07:37.360> for<00:07:37.719> school<00:07:38.019> or<00:07:38.289> they<00:07:38.679> have<00:07:38.889> like

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 
library for school or they have like

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:40.919 
library for school or they have like
credit<00:07:39.339> card<00:07:39.639> numbers<00:07:40.059> or<00:07:40.360> anything<00:07:40.659> where

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:40.929 
credit card numbers or anything where

00:07:40.929 --> 00:07:42.749 
credit card numbers or anything where
you<00:07:40.990> need<00:07:41.139> a<00:07:41.169> ID<00:07:41.379> number<00:07:41.830> you'd<00:07:42.219> add<00:07:42.399> a<00:07:42.430> record
