00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 Let's continue with the gold medals from 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.410
 gta 5 in the fourth mission that is called 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.440
 job actually relatively easy you can 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.280
 barely miss the gold medal 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.830
 the only thing you have to do it 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.710
 actually that one must be careful that 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.320
 his or the white van with the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.840
 he is always on the road not to hurt 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.550
 Insert also damage minimal 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.010
 should drive carefully and then has 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.099
 me the gold medal these missions 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.600
 Almost gotten 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:35.219
 for the sake of completeness, the others 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
 both mission goal is in once that 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.730
 you like the 7 seconds long 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.370
 special ability of frenkel used and 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.140
 once the special ability of around 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.000
 or no idea you have to be ten 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.200
 for a second the face from around 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.930
 but that's what I mean 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.730
 automatically if you do not special 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.460
 watch out 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.629
 Well, that's why I have now 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.930
 relatively much skipped the most 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.570
 Just skip me because of us 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.739
 no unnecessary time too 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.680
 For example, I have this piece 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.689
 skipped we just drive the navi 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.450
 according to what it prohibits then come to 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.060
 Of course you can do this cutscene 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.920
 skip again 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.280
 After the cutscene it continues 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.979
 We'll sprint somehow to that 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.119
 transporter and track like that and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.680
 practice red dot or the only one 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.990
 what I have to take care of again and 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.490
 again activate the ability and 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.329
 just not decided the traffic 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.259
 necessarily drive 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.579
 If you do that then watch out 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.820
 but not very hard I have 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.990
 now again a piece skipped 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.390
 you do not need to shoot 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.180
 or something to make the will 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.079
 automatically drove down and then 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:59.180
 you have to follow this on foot 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.180
 that lasts whole so is the cats 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:14.260
 and out and yes, then we follow the 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:15.250
 guys walk best not to here 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.780
 shoot death 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:23.040
 that does not bring anything to the red resp 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.040
 follow blue point 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:42.430
 climb over it gives itself through 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:56.320
 the wall somehow but that does too 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:03:01.239
 Automatically function acacia the train 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:04.060
 or by the by the wagon yes who 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.130
 because I know now I do that 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.239
 gaddafi or or this I show you 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.489
 the medal not only the 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.890
 for the sake of completeness, all of me 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.930
 missions are really that easy 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.019
 there is nothing whatever 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.370
 need to be problematic now 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.870
 we somehow idle the bunch 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.260
 and that's how the dog runs 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.610
 you do not know the snoop of the 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.760
 franken runs after you have one now 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.110
 then almost the ten seconds full 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.110
 who have to walk more than 100 um 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.969
 You can change back to franklin 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.719
 well then check it just in the 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.700
 different wagon wagons wagons 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:48.730
 purely 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.739
 here is also completely nee that 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.280
 happened so to speak dog is distracted 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.709
 no idea 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.989
 In any case, if you can handle it 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:04.409
 his and then it's on the wagons 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.450
 daily 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:11.019
 I believe it can be done without it 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.150
 the dog in others here in any case 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.569
 is then in this wagon is then the 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.569
 type in it 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.810
 just run after it again 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.230
 visit the dog afterwards 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.530
 he does it automatically and running 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:32.030
 a small piece is not needed 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.660
 to shoot or anything including 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:39.170
 falls in 1 comeback then he comes 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:43.760
 never exactly hidden and you have to go back 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:45.200
 then you can drive one again 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.630
 special ability for use 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.200
 I got the facts skipped me to 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.200
 driving house 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.570
 but cutscene I have none at all 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.570
 plan 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.580
 after the cutscene only the guys out 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.730
 Law against second I have it 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.460
 jumped and then you stop here 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:26.470
 pull there and that should have been 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:29.360
 get out and get your thoughts 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.430
 extremely easy there is no time limit 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.340
 You only have to work as a dog as a dog 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:37.340
 run around and somehow stop by 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.160
 franklin used car also has no 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.780
 that's why we took damage 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.780
 See you 15 missions next time
