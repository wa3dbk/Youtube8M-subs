00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.780
 [Music] 

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.780
 d 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.010
 hello how about pirates look here you have a 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.139
 little bag and I'll show you how 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.480
 we can realize look at the materials 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.780
 what we are going to need are very simple 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.780
 [Music] 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.560
 The first thing we are going to do is double 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:31.580
 a paper a large sheet we doubled it 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.980
 the middle and we draw in the middle 8 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.790
 now I have to cut out this medium 8 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.980
 so that I get 18 whole 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.480
 [Music] 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.720
 what we have to do now is 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.680
 support it in the cardboard and we begin to 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.680
 silhouette 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.989
 let's cut with the cutter but that you 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.780
 help an older person your brother 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:56.170
 your parents or something and we started the 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.420
 We're going to start cutting the two 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.699
 cut-out cartons are these that you 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.210
 I show now then to do the 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.520
 width of the bag and we cut it too 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.530
 just as before the careful trade 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.300
 we are cutting everything and we have to 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.550
 do now simply with a pencil 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.800
 we are making holes all over the 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.229
 edge about two centimeters one 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.920
 from another we are gathering to make them happen 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.750
 until the other side by pressing hard and 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.300
 a distance more or less than two 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.160
 centimeters the stitching as we have done 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.429
 the holes is simply with a 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.789
 rope we are putting the rope for a 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.710
 hole and taking it out for the other one we have 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:40.590
 that unite the three parts that are going to 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.590
 shape the bag the two sides 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.070
 and the central part now we have to 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.350
 grab some sauces from a paper bag 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.370
 and we put them to our evolution and 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:56.600
 we give each other the handles with the part of 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.610
 and this is how we have the result 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.680
 final result we have put a 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.520
 wooden ball with an elastic band 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.560
 to close it we close it here what 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.600
 we have and we are ready to go for a walk 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.390
 better than nothing if it does not rain 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.810
