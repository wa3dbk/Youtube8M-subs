00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.120
 well before I start I think that 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.649
 you will wonder what function 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.780
 they meet those white keys and what 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.480
 function they fulfill those black keys and 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.940
 soon some will see them all the same 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.020
 but not today we are going to learn from a 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.510
 easy way to recognize the keys 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.170
 then to start this keyboard 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.090
 start at 2 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.090
 and it ends up going 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.820
 we are going to make a successive order of the 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:38.070
 musical notes starting from this 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:42.270
 1st 2nd re my 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.700
 a sun the yes 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:51.480
 as we can see in this first group of 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:53.130
 keys there are 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 to this 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.320
 first group of keys we're going to 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.870
 call first octave 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.220
 that first octave is repeated 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.650
 successively here 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:10.630
 here act and here's why we're going to say 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.630
 that this keyboard is 5 octaves 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:16.780
 2. 3 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.780
 4 and 5 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.509
 the first octave and all the rest 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.090
 they have a set of five keys 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.939
 black these black keys are going to 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.770
 call sharps and flats that are going to 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.350
 functions meet them later 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.860
 I will explain then how we do 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.710
 to recognize that these 2 keys and so 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.170
 these also this this is also these 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.110
 two state and these two how can we 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.350
 do it then if you realize the first 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.920
 set of black keys begins with 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.320
 a pair 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.360
 to the left side of these black keys 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:04.180
 will always be there then there are 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.310
 a pair of black keys and then 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.310
 there is a set of three 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.680
 a pair of black keys a group of three 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.840
 a pair of black keys a group of three 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.480
 then always to the left side of the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.319
 pair of black keys will be located 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.930
 do 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.000
 then this this 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.110
 this show 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.110
 this this
