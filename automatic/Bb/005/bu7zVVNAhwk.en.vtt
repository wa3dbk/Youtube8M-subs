 hello how are you greeted by duch sativa and 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:09.820
 this time we're going to talk about a trailer 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.920
 a call of duty black ops' trailer 2 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.889
 origins which is causing a lot 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.800
 Mr. cat a lot of controversy that is 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.740
 happening because the other way 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.840
 the trailer was originally shown in 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.090
 the website of the people of trailer and 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.259
 others but the most interesting thing to put 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.259
 a lot of employer spoiler have seen 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.909
 do not all mediate all yourselves 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.699
 93 spurred or anything but what I want 

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:40.550
 know what they think about this 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.559
 trailer says in English this is not you 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.710
 torrijas to beginning to the babe be all 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.710
 the story has a beginning and an end 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.710
 yesterday some images a little curious and 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.930
 then I repeat it and almost lacquered and I say 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.090
 something but you can comment on it 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.929
 so I leave a link down there in the 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.100
 description so you can see what 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.100
 happen with these 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:13.400
 well I want to say many things weon 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.740
 about the zombie characters 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.110
 but you do not want to fight 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.140
 Fuck the characters we see 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.960
 there I realize that there is attack or 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.180
 and subtracted faith I do not know if I'm wrong they seem not 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.800
 saying that they look like I suppose the other 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.410
 2 can tell you itself or with like no 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.430
 snow and alex mason has not been fixed 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.410
 look very well the image or this 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:44.409
 mean I do not know but hopefully it's the 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:48.100
 end of zombies 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.049
 and then if I say better I do not say anything 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.640
 so I fired fifa agent the 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.890
 favorite comments and obviously we 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.899

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.759
 of zombies that please be like the 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.770
 previous zombies and no more points 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.799
 interest and puzzle because that bores 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.719

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.090
