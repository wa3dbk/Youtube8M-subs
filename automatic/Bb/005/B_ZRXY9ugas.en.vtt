let's have wrinkles like fold and
created<00:01:23.710> a<00:01:23.770> sketch<00:01:24.130> first<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.759> then<00:01:25.420> step<00:01:25.840> by

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
created a sketch first and then step by

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.880 
created a sketch first and then step by
step<00:01:26.320> I<00:01:26.530> start<00:01:26.979> adding<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.759> color<00:01:28.770> because<00:01:29.770> of

step I start adding the color because of

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.100 
step I start adding the color because of
