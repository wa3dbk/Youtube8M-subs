00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
sorry I'm leaning down but I'm either

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.940 
sorry I'm leaning down but I'm either
too<00:01:35.189> high<00:01:35.430> or<00:01:35.460> I'm<00:01:35.880> too<00:01:36.210> short<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:37.259> never<00:01:37.530> mind

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
too high or I'm too short but never mind

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.640 
too high or I'm too short but never mind
this<00:01:38.400> will<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.570> put<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.960> onto<00:01:40.229> V

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
this will do so just put that onto V

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.310 
this will do so just put that onto V
like<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.310> take<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.450> through<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.079> V<00:01:43.290> R

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
like that take that through to the V R

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.530 
like that take that through to the V R
and<00:01:43.680> then<00:01:44.399> I'm<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.939> put<00:01:45.060> another<00:01:45.149> one<00:01:45.509> on

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
and then I'm going to put another one on

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.289 
and then I'm going to put another one on
so<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.049> completely<00:01:46.680> covers<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.970> tie

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
so that that completely covers that tie

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.780 
so that that completely covers that tie
now<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.079> wanted<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.740> see<00:01:50.100> that's<00:01:50.280> moving

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
now if you wanted to see that's moving

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.399 
now if you wanted to see that's moving
make<00:01:51.299> sure<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.630> when<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.259> you

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
make sure that when you do this that you

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.270 
make sure that when you do this that you
pull<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.770> tightly<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:54.799> this<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:56.159> some

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
pull that tightly and this is some

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.160 
pull that tightly and this is some
well<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.400> might<00:01:59.610> put<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.480> onto<00:02:00.780> there<00:02:01.080> and

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
well you might put that onto there and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.500 
well you might put that onto there and
I'll<00:02:01.410> put<00:02:01.620> the<00:02:01.710> next<00:02:01.920> one<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.520> through<00:02:03.360> to

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
I'll put the next one and through to

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.780 
I'll put the next one and through to
there<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.800> will<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:05.100> sitting<00:02:05.490> me<00:02:05.610> like

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
there and that will just sitting me like

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.719 
there and that will just sitting me like
that<00:02:05.970> so<00:02:06.180> that's<00:02:06.300> covering<00:02:06.810> up<00:02:06.960> my<00:02:06.990> workings

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
that so that's covering up my workings

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.070 
that so that's covering up my workings
and<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.850> other<00:02:08.970> thing<00:02:09.240> is<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.600> that's<00:02:09.929> just

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
and the other thing is that that's just

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.390 
and the other thing is that that's just
going<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.320> give<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> little<00:02:10.770> bit<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.009> twinkle

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
going to give a little bit of twinkle

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.370 
going to give a little bit of twinkle
down<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.670> bottom<00:02:11.940> now<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.600> next<00:02:12.960> thing<00:02:13.110> is

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
down the bottom now the next thing is

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.650 
down the bottom now the next thing is
I'm<00:02:13.650> going<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.370> just<00:02:14.550> insert<00:02:14.910> some<00:02:15.120> IV<00:02:15.360> there's

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
I'm going to just insert some IV there's

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.510 
I'm going to just insert some IV there's
a<00:02:15.720> little<00:02:15.959> hole<00:02:16.200> into<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:16.709> so<00:02:16.980> all<00:02:17.160> I'm<00:02:17.340> going

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
a little hole into this so all I'm going

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.970 
a little hole into this so all I'm going
to<00:02:17.670> do<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:19.050> need<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.320> use<00:02:19.470> fresh<00:02:19.770> or

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
to do is you need to use fresh or

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.970 
to do is you need to use fresh or
artificial<00:02:20.550> ivy<00:02:20.970> possibly<00:02:21.810> if<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.230> was<00:02:22.470> head

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
artificial ivy possibly if I was head

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.010 
artificial ivy possibly if I was head
time<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.430> would<00:02:23.790> do<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.120> with<00:02:24.420> fresh<00:02:24.720> but<00:02:24.930> it

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
time I would do this with fresh but it

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.870 
time I would do this with fresh but it
just<00:02:25.170> gives<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.470> an<00:02:25.650> indication<00:02:26.400> as<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.670> what

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
just gives you an indication as to what

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.060 
just gives you an indication as to what
you<00:02:27.030> can<00:02:27.060> use<00:02:27.540> just<00:02:28.110> sticking<00:02:28.440> all<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:28.980> the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
you can use just sticking all of the

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.040 
you can use just sticking all of the
foliage<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.730> through<00:02:30.030> there<00:02:30.209> like<00:02:30.420> there<00:02:30.750> and

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
foliage and through there like there and

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.880 
foliage and through there like there and
then<00:02:31.770> just<00:02:31.800> bend<00:02:32.459> it<00:02:32.610> around<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.650> it

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
then just bend it around so that it

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.479 
then just bend it around so that it
falls<00:02:35.190> down<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.590> through<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.920> down<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.340> those

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
falls down and through and down to those

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.970 
falls down and through and down to those
bottoms<00:02:38.880> flowers<00:02:39.480> now<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.050> want<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.350> long<00:02:40.739> but

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
bottoms flowers now I want a long but

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.640 
bottoms flowers now I want a long but
here<00:02:41.959> put<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:42.989> into<00:02:43.530> there<00:02:44.010> like<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:46.080> so

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
here put that into there like so and so

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.170 
here put that into there like so and so
it's<00:02:46.830> it's<00:02:47.130> actually<00:02:47.550> going<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.760> be<00:02:47.880> falling

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
it's it's actually going to be falling

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.960 
it's it's actually going to be falling
in<00:02:48.450> amongst<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.200> cups<00:02:50.070> where<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.520> candles

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
in amongst the cups where the candles

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.000 
in amongst the cups where the candles
are<00:02:51.060> going<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.330> go<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.110> feel<00:02:52.410> like<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.860> need

are going to go and I feel like I need
one<00:02:53.730> more<00:02:53.970> piece<00:02:54.330> so<00:02:55.140> I'm<00:02:55.350> just<00:02:55.530> gonna<00:02:55.680> put

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
one more piece so I'm just gonna put

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.040 
one more piece so I'm just gonna put
that<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.820> might<00:02:57.000> get<00:02:57.150> two<00:02:57.480> bit<00:02:57.690> than<00:02:57.900> two<00:02:58.020> then

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
that I might get two bit than two then

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.160 
that I might get two bit than two then
it's<00:02:58.350> quite<00:02:58.650> nice<00:02:58.920> when<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.610> can<00:02:59.730> find<00:03:00.170> lovely

it's quite nice when you can find lovely

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.860 
it's quite nice when you can find lovely
mechanics<00:03:02.160> or<00:03:02.370> bits<00:03:02.640> on<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.880> candelabra<00:03:03.420> we<00:03:03.750> you

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
mechanics or bits on a candelabra we you

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.780 
mechanics or bits on a candelabra we you
don't<00:03:04.080> have<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.320> be<00:03:04.470> mucking<00:03:05.040> around<00:03:05.340> with

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
don't have to be mucking around with

them and wiring or cable tying things on

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.400 
them and wiring or cable tying things on
now<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.239> other<00:03:09.450> thing<00:03:09.660> that<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.870> needed<00:03:10.170> to

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
now the other thing that I needed to

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.259 
now the other thing that I needed to
share<00:03:10.650> with<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.130> there<00:03:11.340> even<00:03:11.970> though<00:03:12.090> it's

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
share with you is there even though it's

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.430 
share with you is there even though it's
out<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.570> fishermen<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.019> doesn't<00:03:13.290> look<00:03:13.410> like

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
out of fishermen it doesn't look like

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.710 
out of fishermen it doesn't look like
it's<00:03:13.799> bending<00:03:14.040> or<00:03:14.340> going<00:03:14.580> very<00:03:14.790> far<00:03:15.120> don't

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
it's bending or going very far don't

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.240 
it's bending or going very far don't
worry<00:03:15.930> about<00:03:16.049> that<00:03:16.290> because<00:03:16.440> in<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.799> warm<00:03:17.070> room

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
worry about that because in a warm room

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.870
