00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.850 
took their time in this I made a good
game<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.420> made<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.990> price<00:02:04.140> even<00:02:04.350> better<00:02:04.649> than

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
game and made the price even better than

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.600 
game and made the price even better than
I<00:02:05.100> expected

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.400 

the<00:02:08.610> trophies<00:02:09.030> are<00:02:09.179> fairly<00:02:09.420> easy<00:02:09.599> beating

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
the trophies are fairly easy beating

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.979 
the trophies are fairly easy beating
this<00:02:10.530> game<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.039> didn't<00:02:11.370> feel<00:02:11.520> rewarded<00:02:12.270> which

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
this game I didn't feel rewarded which

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.760 
this game I didn't feel rewarded which
is<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.319> main<00:02:13.470> reason

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
is the main reason

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.310 
is the main reason
while<00:02:13.950> really<00:02:14.250> like<00:02:14.400> playing<00:02:14.670> games<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.900> um

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
while really like playing games so um

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.440 
while really like playing games so um
like<00:02:16.890> urban<00:02:17.250> trial<00:02:17.460> I<00:02:17.580> felt<00:02:17.790> really<00:02:17.940> rewarded

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
like urban trial I felt really rewarded

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.970 
like urban trial I felt really rewarded
when<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.630> got<00:02:18.840> one<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.170> those<00:02:19.260> trophies<00:02:19.650> but

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
when I got one of those trophies but

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.420 
when I got one of those trophies but
this<00:02:20.190> one<00:02:20.400> seems<00:02:21.300> like<00:02:21.510> they're<00:02:21.930> just<00:02:22.140> very

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
this one seems like they're just very

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.980 
this one seems like they're just very
easy<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.670> get<00:02:23.850> they<00:02:24.120> just<00:02:24.330> take<00:02:24.480> time<00:02:24.720> and

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
easy to get they just take time and

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.140 
easy to get they just take time and
that's<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.920> little<00:02:26.160> bit<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.460> downside<00:02:26.640> for<00:02:26.880> me

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
that's a little bit of a downside for me

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.690 
that's a little bit of a downside for me
but<00:02:27.450> it's<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.660> plus<00:02:27.870> side<00:02:28.110> because<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.950> course

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
but it's a plus side because of course

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.400 
but it's a plus side because of course
it's<00:02:29.880> an<00:02:30.000> easy<00:02:30.120> platinum<00:02:30.660> it's<00:02:30.990> nothing<00:02:31.320> like

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
it's an easy platinum it's nothing like

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.780 
it's an easy platinum it's nothing like
resistance<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.130> still<00:02:32.280> have<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.520> put<00:02:32.640> work

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
resistance you still have to put work

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.220 
resistance you still have to put work
into<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.210> but<00:02:33.840> eventually<00:02:34.140> you'll<00:02:34.620> get<00:02:34.770> there

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
into it but eventually you'll get there

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.830 
into it but eventually you'll get there
the<00:02:37.230> downsides<00:02:37.830> for<00:02:37.950> me<00:02:38.340> would<00:02:38.730> be<00:02:38.940> having<00:02:39.300> to

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
the downsides for me would be having to

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.630 
the downsides for me would be having to
watch<00:02:40.080> these<00:02:40.350> cutscenes<00:02:40.830> all<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.190> time

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
watch these cutscenes all the time

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.570 
watch these cutscenes all the time
you<00:02:41.910> can<00:02:42.060> only<00:02:42.270> skip<00:02:42.510> half<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:44.040> the

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
you can only skip half of the of the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.310 
you can only skip half of the of the
scene<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.660> have<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.960> watch<00:02:46.110> them

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
scene and you have to watch them

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.690 
scene and you have to watch them
multiple<00:02:46.710> times<00:02:46.950> if<00:02:47.160> you're<00:02:47.310> gonna<00:02:47.430> get<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
multiple times if you're gonna get the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.370 
multiple times if you're gonna get the

platinum trophy because you have to beat

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.670 
platinum trophy because you have to beat

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
be in four times you have to be the main

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.550 
be in four times you have to be the main
story<00:02:54.480> then<00:02:55.320> you<00:02:55.410> have<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.710> do<00:02:56.060> precision

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
story then you have to do precision

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.700 
story then you have to do precision
convert<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.270> demolition<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:00.690> each<00:03:01.440> one<00:03:01.680> of

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
convert and demolition and each one of

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.050 
convert and demolition and each one of
those<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.040> have<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.310> beat<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.580> mission<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:03.000> a

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
those you have to beat the mission in a

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.110 
those you have to beat the mission in a
certain<00:03:03.360> way<00:03:03.740> so<00:03:04.740> convert<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:05.550> more<00:03:05.820> stealth

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
certain way so convert is more stealth

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.330 
certain way so convert is more stealth
demolition<00:03:07.110> is<00:03:07.260> going<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:07.650> loud<00:03:07.830> with<00:03:08.160> like<00:03:08.310> a

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
demolition is going in loud with like a

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.830 
demolition is going in loud with like a
rocket<00:03:08.790> launcher<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.210> stuff<00:03:09.480> like<00:03:09.600> that

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
rocket launcher and stuff like that

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.890 
rocket launcher and stuff like that
certain<00:03:10.770> weapons<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.190> have<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.520> use<00:03:11.700> that<00:03:12.600> I

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
certain weapons you have to use that I

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.810 
certain weapons you have to use that I
don't<00:03:13.080> have<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.200> problem<00:03:13.830> with<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.160> but<00:03:14.790> I

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
don't have a problem with that but I

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.550 
don't have a problem with that but I
felt<00:03:15.210> like<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.630> was<00:03:15.750> kind<00:03:15.960> of<00:03:16.020> a<00:03:16.110> cheap<00:03:16.320> way<00:03:16.500> to

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
felt like it was kind of a cheap way to

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.650 
felt like it was kind of a cheap way to
add<00:03:16.830> more<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.400> game<00:03:17.550> because<00:03:18.390> all<00:03:18.510> we're

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
add more to the game because all we're

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.180 
add more to the game because all we're
doing<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:18.870> playing<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.230> story<00:03:19.470> over<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.070> over

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
doing is playing a story over and over

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.960 
doing is playing a story over and over
and<00:03:20.490> over<00:03:20.610> again<00:03:20.959> but<00:03:22.340> other<00:03:23.340> than<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:23.610> I

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
and over again but other than that I

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.030 
and over again but other than that I
have<00:03:24.209> no<00:03:24.390> problems<00:03:24.870> it's<00:03:25.080> just<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.530> cutscenes

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
have no problems it's just the cutscenes

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.830 
have no problems it's just the cutscenes
not<00:03:26.490> being<00:03:26.730> able<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:27.000> skip<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.330> whole<00:03:27.450> thing

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
not being able to skip the whole thing

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.410 
not being able to skip the whole thing
because<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.350> just<00:03:28.530> wanna<00:03:28.740> you<00:03:29.730> just<00:03:30.000> really

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
sometimes you have to be stealthy or

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.830 
sometimes you have to be stealthy or
else<00:04:31.530> you<00:04:31.650> start<00:04:31.830> from<00:04:32.569> where<00:04:33.569> your

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
else you start from where your

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.390 
else you start from where your
checkpoint<00:04:34.139> was<00:04:34.560> that's<00:04:34.889> one<00:04:35.159> good<00:04:35.370> thing

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
checkpoint was that's one good thing

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.529 
checkpoint was that's one good thing
though<00:04:35.669> you<00:04:35.789> didn't<00:04:36.000> have<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.240> start<00:04:36.449> the

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
though you didn't have to start the

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.119 
though you didn't have to start the
whole<00:04:36.659> mission<00:04:36.990> all<00:04:37.080> over<00:04:37.379> again<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.830> was<00:04:37.919> just

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
whole mission all over again it was just

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.290 
whole mission all over again it was just
from<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.580> checkpoint

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
from the checkpoint

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.570 
from the checkpoint
but<00:04:39.960> after<00:04:40.830> beating<00:04:41.039> the<00:04:41.219> whole<00:04:41.370> mission

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
but after beating the whole mission

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.790 
but after beating the whole mission
sometimes<00:04:42.150> it<00:04:42.330> would<00:04:42.449> glitch<00:04:42.689> for<00:04:42.930> me<00:04:43.080> why

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
sometimes it would glitch for me why

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.830

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.339 
perfectly and when the sniper works the
zooming<00:07:42.219> in<00:07:42.399> and<00:07:42.550> out<00:07:42.669> works<00:07:42.909> very<00:07:43.240> good<00:07:43.539> but

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:44.349 
zooming in and out works very good but

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:46.769
