00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 yes, the biggest box has just arrived 

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.710
 and unfortunately a little late is still the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.219
 september glossybox and i would have her 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.700
 actually bring a few days ago 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.200
 should 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.330
 but that does not matter, I'm glad 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.699
 still very much about what to do 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.080
 on and you do not need any longer 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.730
 and as the whole box this time 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.740
 is made according to a specific topic 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.539
 and it is already quite white edition 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.679
 I already knew because 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.110
 glossybox point up a bit 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.370
 instagram and facebook that's called 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.770
 He actually gets it before we 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.890
 the class box gets you get even 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.710
 with what wants to go 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.840
 and yes then in a friday game a lot 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.780
 Male out of possible say the USA 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.680
 okay there is the men edition and as 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.680
 the women get caught 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.030
 there is an invitation to a nice 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.489
 check in 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.619
 this is a fashion show in cooperation 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.360
 I think with the big box I think 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.159
 I did not hear anyone go with him because 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.540
 I have an invitation for that 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.340
 but maybe I can 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.840
 time and so it looks like when us 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.240
 there we are always these 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.979
 typical can be flyers and coupons 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.750
 Here is what is in it then everything will be 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.979
 I do not look at much then it is from 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.229
 be there something in there is code 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.509
 and the coach is the one you can 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.800
 internet better than typing and then 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.470
 you get 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.690
 just the hair packaging i know 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.330
 Not when does this expire because I'm always in 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.520
 closer future we have an interest 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.140
 i want to get my hair closer 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.270
 do not dye because I actually do them 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.080
 I will bring forth and my color was 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.180
 actually, but I have a small one 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.880
 raffle planned so a little 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.560
 gewinnspiel for you and it will be a 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.750
 guilty of making the 1,000 subscribers 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.670
 but I 'll do it now 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.530
 in the next days she will be from the canal 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.270
 just give a raffle and I believe 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.610
 I give you this because I need 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.340
 not that and either I'll give it one 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.220
 close friends or just then 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.500
 mesh on you can already see the inside 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.180
 Pressebox first that I see is one 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.960
 little flyer 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.270
 which is very long and shows a a 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.220
 few pictures then here is a 20 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.560
 glossybox discount by a bit 13 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.570
 october for the body shop or the 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.560
 glasbox from this month all that 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.810
 contained inside 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.970
 ok i 'll come to the first product 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:44.730
 and it looks very good it is from 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.950
 The boycott is called hania and is body 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.600
 butter 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.080
 Who can not pronounce it 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.160
 but it's a party in orange 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.820
 probably they are different 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.190
 to have 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.630
 it smells very good and body butter 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:06.180
 not happen to know body cream 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:09.330
 So a cream or lotion that's 50 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:14.160
 milliliters and the original product 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:16.140
 costs 18 euros, so 20 liters are not 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.489
 the original product but also a good one 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.200
 size to test 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.610
 especially with the 20 percent already good 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.410
 you can always get to that then 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.799
 equal to the original port of 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.620
 venice from bb 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:31.680
 moisturizing cream babymord 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.840
 break off he is actually whole 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.090
 neutral after these typical cranes 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.310
 after these nivea and bw krems the 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.950
 just do not smell what I have a lot 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.359
 I like this one no lesser 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.939
 as a matter of fact this smell is however 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.819
 probably judge still cream like 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:49.530
 i very much like i will i have been since i am 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.750
 I can almost think only baby 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.849
 That 's why it's creams for the skin 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.480
 very good and is like moore i want to come 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.620
 out with baby are 50 milliliters inside 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.040
 and that means it's one 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.919
 original product and costs 6 euro 49 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.659
 when is an old one in there from 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:10.519
 bierbaum schell I do not know him but 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:12.209
 I have the spoiler already with some 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.159
 seen videos 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.560
 I call it spoiler so at 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.000
 some in loose box videos that you can 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.380
 and I think that's real 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.349
 cool is they will pin must go quietly 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.110
 pretty tough but also thin 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:30.090
 I will not go through the very thick one 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.889
 can probably just use 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.289
 to draw a line in the eye and 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.570
 then a thinner around the ring 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:39.120
 to make them lie down 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.159
 but otherwise I think so 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.080
 very cool and therefore a cool one 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:45.150
 Dull finish somehow and leaves 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.530
 after a few seconds, that's already on 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.409
 dried and can not be more 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:54.020
 especially that would cost 410 euros 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:58.949
 who is something very cool and 20 cent 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:01.169
 goldsmith ii 1 5 letters smooth luxury 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.389
 league and supple straight hair anti 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.340
 frizz no glue opens 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.610
 faster dry on wet hair 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.520
 feel feel as desired then find 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.259
 I'm fine because I often make straight hair 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.360
 because you are a natural curl 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.520
 somehow they do not wake up either 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.750
 that's why it's definitely a good one 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:24.270
 substitute for skate food 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:25.980
 that's 2 7 liters and costs 15 99 and 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.220
 we will come to the original products 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:32.460
 for the last product and 21 baroque beetles 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.770
 and is also representing 5 milliliter 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:39.030
 included and the original product would have 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:42.030
 50 milliliters and would cost 76 eur 20 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:49.590
 I'm curious to see what it looks like 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:51.750
 little problem of first solar I was 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.820
 really beautiful it is such a beautiful 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.780
 I do not even know about that 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:02.130
 does and it looks like that's up there 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:04.620
 his little glittering stones and always 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.050
 Barofsky and I have here is the 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:14.870
 that is, you make fluid 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:14.870
 align it with God 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.130
 yes it is quite refreshing I think so 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.750
 it has to rise again and me 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.210
 I think I broke it with the 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.560
 last video uncommented two same 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.010
 things has'd already 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.010
 interest
