Swain<00:00:09.900> in<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.440> one<00:00:10.650> after<00:00:10.800> we<00:00:11.040> saw<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> couple

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
Swain in this one after we saw a couple

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.310 
Swain in this one after we saw a couple
of<00:00:11.759> swings<00:00:12.000> already<00:00:12.540> what<00:00:12.990> did<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.139> make<00:00:13.290> of

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
of swings already what did you make of

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.230 
of swings already what did you make of
the<00:00:13.500> pic<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.769> this<00:00:13.920> one<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.340> actually<00:00:14.849> really

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
the pic in this one I actually really

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.790 
the pic in this one I actually really
like<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.480> swing<00:00:15.690> versus<00:00:16.020> meraki<00:00:16.440> but<00:00:16.710> they

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
like the swing versus meraki but they

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.349 
like the swing versus meraki but they
really<00:00:17.070> needed<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.369> force<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.850> into<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.090> 1v1

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
really needed to force it into the 1v1

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.510 
really needed to force it into the 1v1
so<00:00:19.230> unless<00:00:19.560> they<00:00:19.740> can<00:00:19.859> get<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.070> decent<00:00:20.430> one

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
so unless they can get that decent one

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.769 
so unless they can get that decent one
be<00:00:20.640> one<00:00:20.789> where<00:00:20.939> he<00:00:21.029> can<00:00:21.150> bully<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.570> have<00:00:21.660> that

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
be one where he can bully and have that

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.120 
be one where he can bully and have that
bully<00:00:21.990> matchup<00:00:22.410> he<00:00:22.619> really<00:00:22.800> doesn't<00:00:23.100> have

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
bully matchup he really doesn't have

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.920 
bully matchup he really doesn't have
that<00:00:23.310> much<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.580> an<00:00:23.670> impact<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.060> Lane<00:00:24.240> face<00:00:24.449> but

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
that much of an impact in Lane face but

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.509 
that much of an impact in Lane face but
when<00:00:25.050> they<00:00:25.140> started<00:00:25.410> getting<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.710> going<00:00:25.920> we

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
when they started getting that going we

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.279 
when they started getting that going we
could<00:00:26.670> survive<00:00:26.939> many<00:00:27.269> gangs<00:00:27.660> by<00:00:27.900> flashing

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
could survive many gangs by flashing

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.230 
could survive many gangs by flashing
walls<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.710> surviving<00:00:29.130> long<00:00:29.279> enough<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.029> yeah

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
walls and surviving long enough and yeah

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.189 
walls and surviving long enough and yeah
I<00:00:30.269> think<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.570> was<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.689> really<00:00:30.779> good<00:00:30.960> pick<00:00:31.050> up<00:00:31.140> by

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
I think it was a really good pick up by

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.350 
I think it was a really good pick up by
him<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:32.070> also<00:00:32.250> had<00:00:32.489> their<00:00:32.700> some<00:00:33.059> very<00:00:33.239> good

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.569 
him and also had their some very good

fights<00:02:51.930> but<00:02:52.170> instead<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.680> gave<00:02:52.950> me<00:02:53.040> they<00:02:53.129> keep

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
fights but instead it gave me they keep

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.860 
fights but instead it gave me they keep
doing<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.609> same<00:02:53.670> deal<00:02:53.940> they<00:02:53.970> never<00:02:54.510> want<00:02:54.810> to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
doing the same deal they never want to

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.059

buy these walls like him and it just

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.319 
buy these walls like him and it just
makes<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:56.609> hard<00:02:56.640> for<00:02:57.060> them<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.180> actually

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
makes it so hard for them to actually

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.330 
makes it so hard for them to actually
