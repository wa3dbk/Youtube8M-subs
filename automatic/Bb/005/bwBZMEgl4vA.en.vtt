00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.700
 hi how are you today we will talk about 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.219
 types of headphones 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.590
 for its position we have circles 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:14.410
 now they completely surround their ears 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.910
 they allow the sound guideline almost by 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.430
 complete of the subject that listens 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.250
 Likewise 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.150
 a red is a nest out the outside 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.730
 It is generally used in the field 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.000
 professional and monitoring 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:35.550
 enduro amplification or mix for djs 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.920
 its main characteristic of these 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.050
 is that being slightly separated 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.030
 of the ear generate a greater sensation 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.340
 natural of the stereo field 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.480
 and a reproduction of more frequencies 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.480
 linear and precise 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.530
 well we have the oral supra the 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.820
 speakers cover most of the 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.760
 auditory pavilion 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.829
 these are more portable lighter and 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.829
 less bulky than work 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.170
 being the standard design in sound 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.170
 hi-fi domestic 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.830
 finally we have are the 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.560
 Intra-earphones are small and allow 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.470
 to the listener greater mobility isolation 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.870
 and subjective comfort its biggest flaw is 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.030
 that the sound seems to come from 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.980
 inside of the head so it's 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.980
 loses the natural auditory sensation 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.120
 also because of its size it offers a lower 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.510
 a sound output device 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.670
 larger its use is widespread in 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:44.080
 mp3 devices 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.080
 and portable players 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.750
 another way to classify the 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.010
 headphones is by their mechanism of 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.500
 support 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.500
 in that we have the hells 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.140
 what does it mean that they have no support 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.140
 these are part of the intra-earphones 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.070
 brush died ground clip 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.709
 Each headset has a mobile arm 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.050
 or fixed but flexible to be placed 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.690
 behind the ear 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.340
 these are the back in and similar to the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.610
 clickers but we see when I make a 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.819
 tape that goes down the neck and compresses it 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.640
 towards the head 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.709
 we just have the heads and the 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.989
 oldest restraint system the 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.269
 headphones that have placed are ear 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.459
 slightly compressed by the action of 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.420
 the tape that is placed by the part 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.420
 top of the head 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.040
 I hope you have served them this 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.830
 information to make you urresti 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.280
 lifetime 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.280
 and later
