00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hi there, hunter themselves and in this video 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.629
 I'll tell you about the sonnet processor from 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.849
 fashion run reactor and also show how she 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.580
 beautiful how does it work so that 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.120
 it must be crafted reactor 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.920
 body red dust 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:21.150
 iron bar piston 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.100
 and hyaluronic fuel rod after 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.740
 how you scrubbed it and installed it 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.660
 he looks like this 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.939
 right-clicking you hit 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.059
 in the internal interface for his work 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.079
 firstly it is necessary for waters secondly rf 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.510
 energy is also necessary for his work 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.530
 appreciates and you and ingots of 2 cyanide marketing 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.020
 ingots you get a plutonium ingot 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.120
 butane you cells is the same as 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.059
 elfimova if so that is you can him 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.949
 use instead of fuel so 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:59.090
 we open the reactor we see 63 percent 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:02.280
 throwing see 12 5 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.120
 in this case if we click to remove the fuel 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.769
 then we get 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.630
 and lari mad you if so that is 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.470
 plutonium above the clock here in such 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.810
 ingot appreciates and you can get ingots 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.689
 in two ways the first way is the most 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.290
 simple it and and lari small sledak and 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.720
 sand here we get the scene of this ingot 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.259
 the second way is using a reactor 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.570
 because during reactor operation 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:31.290
 fuel elfimova and turns like 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.420
 cyanide and you and bullion here we see we 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.159
 we can pick them up from here and already 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.530
 recycle as a result of two color 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.299
 ingots we can get one as if 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.640
 it is an ingot that is two to one 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.460
 break in 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.760
 As for these values, this is also 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.100
 the most that in the thermal expansion legs 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:59.230
 there is for example red is the entrance we can 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:02.890
 put a funnel on top and calm 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:07.090
 upload there these here prices of it 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.000
 bullion if we see green it 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.100
 extraction that is the top but vice versa 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.260
 pushed off already finished was tony you 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:27.790
 bars so let us fill in now 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:29.530
 some water so look the process goes and 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:35.320
 that's where it looks like he has an ingot 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:38.050
 It should be the one that's like this process 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.400
 ended this why is the top not 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:46.270
 I wanted to get it will do so and that 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:50.260
 I will say differently on the left and put 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:53.410
 funnel yes here we see them 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:57.120
 moved and on top of us for example 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.810
 it will flood it in this way 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.680
 take meals 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:07.450
 so let's put any item 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:12.970
 for example, this is what we say 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:16.870
 bottom on here we see the energy is there so 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:20.709
 so on the left to the right we will load 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.320
 appreciates you bullion from this side we 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.209
 let's put a funnel with us these ingots will 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.760
 retrieved, you can certainly put 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:31.870
 the chest on the idea it should automatically in 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.830
 chests send yes now we see about 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.880
 behind us we will have for example water so 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.880
 correctly configured 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:54.470
 it's up so it's left it's right it's not 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:58.250
 gathering here and so yes and here we will water 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.950
 apply the truth in my corpse not well 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:11.210
 let 's pick it up now 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:13.670
 anything water line though in 1 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.250
 I think you yourself will understand that is 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.600
 This here on pipes to pump water and 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.170
 still show 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:33.230
 in a quick way so take 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:35.300
 ordinary pump pump so interesting 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:40.180
 through this you can try like this 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.180
 supplies power never tried and 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.740
 it must be the engines 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:52.370
 no energy is being pumped 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:55.730
 just here are two buckets of water even let's 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:05:03.760
 infinite source and take instantly 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:08.970
 pipe liquid pipe 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:12.580
 such as we connect 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.430
 here we see water there is generally everything 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.620
 works well then put it all 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.420
 likes and subscribe to my channel 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.940
 if that was not clear write to 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.060
 comments and that's it and see you soon 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.060
 meeting
