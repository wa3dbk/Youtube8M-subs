00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.830
 in this project point 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.400
 we hope there is a flood at mosques 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.010
 yellowish and if they start talking 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.820
 good but in general to think about everything 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.730
 operations news is not true 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.650
 but because Russia 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.490
 at least I will not spare at the same time 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.810
 someone that he then definitely will not 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.830
 no point with ministries 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.100
 increase in strength of the whole log now 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.400
 from this point to where you are from 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.800
 let's authorities not be as it should 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.070
 it is impossible to say yes the same effect as 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.309
 provocative today will bring and 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:43.700
 then they too 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.080
 exchange data 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.290
 that someone did not understand 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.840
 also found i want to talk about your 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.020
 daily routine number of cigarettes 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.030
 pryadkin 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.100
 this particular notes what reads 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.150
 I think at all other days that 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.819
 worries 

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:00.560
 heads 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.590
 the club was loved for us is why not at all 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.240
 Chekmarev returned to then they can 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.920
 to leave paris which is not 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.090
 maybe more than once and just huge 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.970
 the word was given 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.440
 usually does not happen in the first 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.290
 turn comes the matter that russia the matter is 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.440
 what confidence 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.060
 we had a simple preliminary 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.970
 data lived was mentally 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.970
 unhealthy nothing to eat is good 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.490
 nothing to say 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.689
 just a question a question what is the framework of the law 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.890
 Strasbourg 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.969
 converters 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.840
 just for the broken Kazan vaz is difficult 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.260
 just from there until kravets 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.930
 and tell you honestly evaluate the hour and what 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.020
 so that you hinted that remind 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.810
 Kadyrov to 3 4 billion rubles can be 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.390
 paris interested already nothing 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.399
 correct and even noticeable rise 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.419
 especially the law but the point
