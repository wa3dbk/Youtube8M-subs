hello<00:00:00.900> everyone<00:00:01.290> I<00:00:01.500> wanted<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.220> work<00:00:02.340> this

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
hello everyone I wanted to work this

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.450 
hello everyone I wanted to work this
problem<00:00:03.000> from<00:00:03.179> the<00:00:03.419> homework<00:00:03.810> set<00:00:04.460> the

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
problem from the homework set the

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.020 
problem from the homework set the
instructions<00:00:05.940> asked<00:00:06.150> us<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.529> rationalize<00:00:07.529> the

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.030 
instructions asked us to rationalize the

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.930 
instructions asked us to rationalize the
denominator<00:00:09.080> this<00:00:10.080> one<00:00:10.290> was<00:00:10.440> from<00:00:10.620> the

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
denominator this one was from the

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.339 
denominator this one was from the
section<00:00:11.940> dealing<00:00:12.120> with<00:00:12.420> dividing<00:00:12.900> radical

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
section dealing with dividing radical

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.580 
section dealing with dividing radical
expressions<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.160> believe<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:14.610> was<00:00:15.410> 7.4<00:00:16.410> and

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
expressions I believe that was 7.4 and

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.130 
expressions I believe that was 7.4 and
it's<00:00:16.730> was<00:00:17.730> one<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.000> more<00:00:18.150> missed<00:00:18.420> ones<00:00:18.660> not

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
it's was one of the more missed ones not

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.609 
it's was one of the more missed ones not
the<00:00:19.170> most<00:00:19.740> prominently<00:00:20.550> missed<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.619> miss

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
the most prominently missed but miss

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.370 
the most prominently missed but miss
quite<00:00:22.890> often<00:00:23.210> so<00:00:24.210> how<00:00:24.720> do<00:00:24.779> we<00:00:24.869> get<00:00:25.050> rid<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
quite often so how do we get rid of the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.679 
quite often so how do we get rid of the
radicals<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.580> denominator<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.449> right

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
radicals in the denominator and right

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.000 
radicals in the denominator and right
off<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.840> bat<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.260> might<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.529> stumbled<00:00:28.800> by

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
off the bat you might have stumbled by

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.109 
off the bat you might have stumbled by
saying<00:00:29.250> hey<00:00:29.369> look<00:00:29.550> there<00:00:29.730> aren't<00:00:29.970> any

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
saying hey look there aren't any

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.749 
saying hey look there aren't any
radicals<00:00:30.570> down<00:00:30.750> here<00:00:30.990> but<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.130> course<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.579> can

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
radicals down here but of course you can

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.560 
radicals down here but of course you can
rewrite<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:34.850> what<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.880> call<00:00:35.940> going<00:00:36.270> from<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
rewrite this as what I call going from a

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.830 
rewrite this as what I call going from a
house<00:00:36.750> United<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> house<00:00:38.660> divided

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
house United to a house divided

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.790 
house United to a house divided
and<00:00:40.050> then<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.100> more<00:00:41.309> clearly<00:00:41.790> see<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
and then you more clearly see the

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.529 
and then you more clearly see the
radical<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.160> denominator<00:00:44.539> this

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
radical in the denominator this

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.500 
radical in the denominator this
represents<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.640> irrational<00:00:47.640> number<00:00:47.940> almost

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
represents a irrational number almost

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.319 
represents a irrational number almost
certainly<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.079> they<00:00:49.289> want<00:00:49.500> us<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.910> rideth<00:00:50.910> rid

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
certainly and they want us to rideth rid

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.869 
certainly and they want us to rideth rid
that<00:00:51.510> fraction<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.879> irrational

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
that fraction of that irrational

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.600 
that fraction of that irrational
expression<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:56.039> how<00:00:56.219> do<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:56.370> go<00:00:56.520> about

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
expression and so how do we go about

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.290 
expression and so how do we go about
doing<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.239> well<00:00:58.850> I'm<00:00:59.850> gonna<00:01:00.000> make<00:01:00.180> an

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
doing that well I'm gonna make an

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.660 
doing that well I'm gonna make an
observation<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:01.140> let<00:01:01.890> me<00:01:01.920> drag<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.250> in

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
observation here let me drag this in

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.600 
observation here let me drag this in
here's<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> observation<00:01:04.470> notice<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:05.489> I've

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
here's the observation notice what I've

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.399 
here's the observation notice what I've
done<00:01:06.090> here<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.390> I've<00:01:06.479> taken<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.900> denominator

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
done here is I've taken the denominator

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.350 
done here is I've taken the denominator
and<00:01:07.740> then<00:01:08.400> I've<00:01:08.549> written<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.909> two<00:01:09.119> more<00:01:09.299> times

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
and then I've written it two more times

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.219 
and then I've written it two more times
multiplying<00:01:10.350> these<00:01:11.130> three<00:01:11.549> together<00:01:12.240> now

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
multiplying these three together now

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.929 
multiplying these three together now
essentially<00:01:13.530> what<00:01:13.740> we<00:01:13.860> have<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.460> number

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
essentially what we have is a number

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.480 
essentially what we have is a number
being<00:01:15.090> cubed<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.650> could<00:01:16.830> rewrite<00:01:17.009> this

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
being cubed and I could rewrite this

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.230 
being cubed and I could rewrite this
right<00:01:18.210> here<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.630> expression<00:01:18.950> in<00:01:20.000> terms<00:01:21.000> of

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
right here this expression in terms of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.380 
right here this expression in terms of
exponents<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:23.670> I'm<00:01:23.759> doing<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.150> -

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
exponents like this and I'm doing this -

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.859 
exponents like this and I'm doing this -
bang<00:01:24.960> bang<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.710> drum<00:01:25.950> one<00:01:26.189> more<00:01:26.369> time<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.939> this

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
bang bang the drum one more time on this

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.620 
bang bang the drum one more time on this
observation<00:01:28.650> I've<00:01:28.770> been<00:01:28.890> making<00:01:29.509> that<00:01:30.509> I've

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
observation I've been making that I've

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.840 
observation I've been making that I've
been<00:01:30.750> hitting<00:01:30.930> pretty<00:01:31.200> hard<00:01:31.439> namely<00:01:31.799> that

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.660 

powers<00:01:35.850> or<00:01:36.030> exponents<00:01:36.409> undo<00:01:37.409> radicals<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.579> so

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
powers or exponents undo radicals and so

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.460 
powers or exponents undo radicals and so
this<00:01:38.820> third<00:01:39.060> power<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.540> going<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.930> undo<00:01:40.259> this

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
this third power is going to undo this

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.639 
this third power is going to undo this
third<00:01:40.799> root<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:42.020> they<00:01:43.020> are<00:01:43.259> inverse

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
third root and they are inverse

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.889 
third root and they are inverse
operations<00:01:43.799> they<00:01:44.729> undo<00:01:45.030> each<00:01:45.060> other<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:45.659> as

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
operations they undo each other just as

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.139 
operations they undo each other just as
multiplication<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.740> division<00:01:47.189> subtraction

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
multiplication and division subtraction

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.870 
multiplication and division subtraction
and<00:01:48.810> addition<00:01:49.079> undo<00:01:49.590> each<00:01:49.740> other<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.159> so

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
and addition undo each other and so

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.670 
and addition undo each other and so
essentially<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.750> radical<00:01:52.229> would<00:01:52.409> vanish

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
essentially the radical would vanish

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.060 
essentially the radical would vanish
under<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.880> third<00:01:54.270> power<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.619> would<00:01:55.829> end

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
under that third power and we would end

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.889 
under that third power and we would end
up<00:01:56.219> with<00:01:56.280> something<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.969> has<00:01:57.000> no<00:01:57.450> radical

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
up with something that has no radical

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.160 
up with something that has no radical
and<00:01:58.079> would<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.860> fact<00:01:59.040> be<00:01:59.310> rational<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.140> a

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
and would in fact be rational so the a

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.530 
and would in fact be rational so the a
game<00:02:01.740> here<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.219> essentially<00:02:02.969> duplicate

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
game here is to essentially duplicate

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.700 
game here is to essentially duplicate
this<00:02:05.119> series<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.329> steps<00:02:06.750> right<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.500> the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
this series of steps right here in the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.499 
this series of steps right here in the
denominator<00:02:08.149> up<00:02:09.149> above

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
denominator up above

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.530 
denominator up above
and<00:02:10.599> so<00:02:11.170> how<00:02:11.650> do<00:02:11.709> we<00:02:11.890> do<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.189> well<00:02:12.540> whenever

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
and so how do we do that well whenever

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.149 
and so how do we do that well whenever
you're<00:02:13.659> dealing<00:02:13.780> with<00:02:13.989> fractions<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.920> can

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 
you're dealing with fractions you can

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.440 
you're dealing with fractions you can
change<00:02:15.549> the<00:02:15.760> way<00:02:15.909> they<00:02:16.150> look<00:02:17.909> by<00:02:18.909> multiplying

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
change the way they look by multiplying

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.050 
change the way they look by multiplying
them<00:02:19.689> by<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.900> fancy<00:02:20.349> form<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.739> one<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.370> that's

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
them by a fancy form of one and that's

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.009 
them by a fancy form of one and that's
what<00:02:22.209> I'm<00:02:22.299> going<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.510> do<00:02:22.689> I'm<00:02:22.810> going<00:02:22.930> to

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
what I'm going to do I'm going to

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.800 
what I'm going to do I'm going to
multiply<00:02:23.439> the<00:02:23.829> bottom<00:02:24.400> by<00:02:24.430> this<00:02:24.760> notice<00:02:25.659> I

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
multiply the bottom by this notice I

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.509 
multiply the bottom by this notice I
would<00:02:25.870> then<00:02:26.140> have<00:02:26.170> three<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.680> these<00:02:26.799> it<00:02:27.430> would

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
would then have three of these it would

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.520 
would then have three of these it would
be<00:02:27.670> cubed<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.540> cube<00:02:28.780> would<00:02:28.870> undo<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.290> cube

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
be cubed the cube would undo the cube

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.789 
be cubed the cube would undo the cube
root<00:02:29.739> so<00:02:30.780> let<00:02:31.780> me<00:02:31.840> draw<00:02:32.019> in<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.200> fraction<00:02:32.650> bar

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
root so let me draw in the fraction bar

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:38.520 
root so let me draw in the fraction bar
and<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:36.010> course<00:02:36.370> we<00:02:37.239> are<00:02:37.390> going<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.810> have<00:02:38.079> we're

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
and of course we are going to have we're

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.289 
and of course we are going to have we're
going<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.739> have<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:39.180> maintain<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:42.180> value<00:02:43.180> of

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
going to have to maintain the value of

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.369 
going to have to maintain the value of
that<00:02:43.420> fraction<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.079> left<00:02:45.870> by<00:02:46.870> multiplying

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
that fraction to the left by multiplying

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.920 
that fraction to the left by multiplying
the<00:02:47.560> top<00:02:48.000> by<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.150> same<00:02:49.420> number<00:02:49.750> as

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
the top by the same number as

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.300 
the top by the same number as
multiplying<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.859> bottom

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
multiplying the bottom

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.259 
multiplying the bottom
in<00:02:51.579> other<00:02:51.790> words<00:02:52.980> banging<00:02:53.980> home<00:02:54.159> a<00:02:54.609> point

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
in other words banging home a point

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.520 
in other words banging home a point
that's<00:02:55.389> probably<00:02:55.720> been<00:02:55.870> banged<00:02:56.079> too<00:02:56.290> much

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
that's probably been banged too much

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.979 
that's probably been banged too much
this<00:02:57.370> is<00:02:57.430> really<00:02:57.579> just<00:02:57.879> a<00:02:58.120> fancy<00:02:58.239> form<00:02:58.629> of<00:02:58.750> 1

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
this is really just a fancy form of 1

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.720 
this is really just a fancy form of 1
and<00:02:59.379> when<00:02:59.769> you<00:02:59.829> multiply<00:02:59.950> this<00:03:00.280> expression

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
and when you multiply this expression

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.879 
and when you multiply this expression
which<00:03:01.359> happens<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.780> be<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.930> fraction<00:03:02.409> by<00:03:02.590> one

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
which happens to be a fraction by one

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.280 
which happens to be a fraction by one
you<00:03:03.069> don't<00:03:03.220> change<00:03:03.609> its<00:03:03.849> value<00:03:04.030> so<00:03:04.959> that's<00:03:05.139> the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
you don't change its value so that's the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.410 
you don't change its value so that's the
game<00:03:05.470> going<00:03:05.769> on<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.190> let's<00:03:07.000> create<00:03:07.150> some

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
game going on and let's create some

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.680 
game going on and let's create some
space<00:03:07.720> here<00:03:08.079> and<00:03:08.549> continue<00:03:09.549> on<00:03:09.700> with<00:03:09.730> this<00:03:10.060> now

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
space here and continue on with this now

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.649 
space here and continue on with this now
in<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.109> bottom<00:03:11.730> we<00:03:12.730> are<00:03:12.849> going<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.239> go

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
in the bottom we are going to go

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.960 
in the bottom we are going to go
straight<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.970> number<00:03:16.269> being<00:03:16.419> cubed<00:03:16.810> and

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
straight to that number being cubed and

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.020 
straight to that number being cubed and
on<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.569> top<00:03:19.780> I've<00:03:20.079> left<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:21.030> radical

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
on the top I've left the radical

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.420 
on the top I've left the radical
separate<00:03:22.750> and<00:03:23.379> since<00:03:23.709> all<00:03:23.859> I've<00:03:24.010> done<00:03:24.129> is<00:03:24.190> the

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
separate and since all I've done is the

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.220 
separate and since all I've done is the
multiplication<00:03:25.000> straight<00:03:25.480> across<00:03:26.160> now<00:03:27.160> again

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
multiplication straight across now again

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.309 
multiplication straight across now again
the<00:03:29.459> third<00:03:30.459> power<00:03:30.669> is<00:03:31.030> going<00:03:31.269> to<00:03:31.389> rid<00:03:32.139> us<00:03:32.290> of

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
the third power is going to rid us of

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.000 
the third power is going to rid us of
this<00:03:32.919> cube<00:03:33.669> root<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:34.269> we<00:03:35.199> are<00:03:35.319> going<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.680> have

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
this cube root and we are going to have

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.930 
this cube root and we are going to have
what<00:03:36.609> we<00:03:36.699> desire<00:03:37.389> in<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.870> bottom<00:03:38.139> a<00:03:38.940> situation

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
what we desire in the bottom a situation

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.300 
what we desire in the bottom a situation
an<00:03:40.359> expression<00:03:41.049> that<00:03:41.079> has<00:03:41.199> no<00:03:41.530> radicals<00:03:42.010> and

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
an expression that has no radicals and

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.909 
an expression that has no radicals and
so<00:03:43.030> I've<00:03:43.389> rationalized<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.169> denominator<00:03:44.199> of

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
so I've rationalized the denominator of

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.199 
so I've rationalized the denominator of
course<00:03:45.129> I<00:03:45.250> need<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.549> take<00:03:45.730> care<00:03:45.970> of<00:03:46.030> the

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
course I need to take care of the

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.780 
course I need to take care of the
business<00:03:46.389> and<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.780> top<00:03:46.989> and<00:03:47.590> I'm<00:03:48.280> going<00:03:48.519> to<00:03:48.579> go

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
business and the top and I'm going to go

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.050 
business and the top and I'm going to go
to<00:03:48.849> a<00:03:49.030> house<00:03:49.389> United<00:03:50.199> here<00:03:50.440> since<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:51.430> roots

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
to a house United here since the roots

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.240 
to a house United here since the roots
are<00:03:52.389> all<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:53.319> the<00:03:54.720> same<00:03:55.720> index<00:03:56.049> we<00:03:56.739> can<00:03:56.919> rewrite

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
are all to the same index we can rewrite

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.410 
are all to the same index we can rewrite
this<00:03:58.169> as<00:03:59.459> a<00:04:00.459> house<00:04:00.760> United

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
this as a house United

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.420 
this as a house United
and<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:03.500> question<00:04:03.800> is<00:04:03.920> what<00:04:04.069> are<00:04:04.160> we<00:04:04.190> going<00:04:04.340> to

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
and the question is what are we going to

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.730 
and the question is what are we going to
get<00:04:04.520> under<00:04:04.790> there<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:06.250> I'm<00:04:07.250> going<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:08.740> let's

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
get under there and I'm going to let's

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.090 
get under there and I'm going to let's
see<00:04:09.980> well<00:04:10.340> we're<00:04:10.850> gonna<00:04:10.940> have<00:04:11.150> 5a<00:04:11.930> squared<00:04:12.650> and

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
see well we're gonna have 5a squared and

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.120 
see well we're gonna have 5a squared and
B<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.030> fourth<00:04:14.440> but<00:04:15.440> since<00:04:15.680> we're<00:04:15.830> talking

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
B to the fourth but since we're talking

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.650 
B to the fourth but since we're talking
about<00:04:16.220> a<00:04:16.630> cubed<00:04:17.630> root<00:04:17.720> I'm<00:04:18.560> going<00:04:18.950> to<00:04:19.660> rewrite

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
about a cubed root I'm going to rewrite

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.590 
about a cubed root I'm going to rewrite
that<00:04:20.900> slightly<00:04:21.739> like<00:04:22.010> this<00:04:22.040> instead<00:04:22.940> of<00:04:23.030> 5a

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
that slightly like this instead of 5a

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.210 
that slightly like this instead of 5a
squared<00:04:23.900> B<00:04:24.320> to<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.560> fourth<00:04:24.800> I'm<00:04:24.950> going<00:04:25.160> to

squared B to the fourth I'm going to

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.570 
squared B to the fourth I'm going to

write it 5a squared b cubed times b and

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.320 
write it 5a squared b cubed times b and
the<00:04:28.940> reason<00:04:29.180> is<00:04:29.300> is<00:04:29.480> because<00:04:29.510> obviously<00:04:31.330> we

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
the reason is is because obviously we

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.190 
the reason is is because obviously we
are<00:04:33.820> once<00:04:34.820> again<00:04:34.940> going<00:04:35.419> to<00:04:35.510> note<00:04:35.720> that<00:04:35.750> this

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
are once again going to note that this

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.340 
are once again going to note that this
cube<00:04:36.650> root<00:04:36.830> is<00:04:36.980> going<00:04:37.130> to<00:04:37.250> undo<00:04:37.669> this<00:04:38.030> q<00:04:38.840> and

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
cube root is going to undo this q and

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.580 
cube root is going to undo this q and
the<00:04:40.100> b<00:04:40.250> will<00:04:40.430> come<00:04:40.580> out<00:04:40.730> front<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.630> we'll<00:04:42.260> end

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
the b will come out front and we'll end

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.330 
the b will come out front and we'll end
up<00:04:42.770> with<00:04:43.040> something<00:04:43.400> that<00:04:44.210> looks<00:04:44.240> like<00:04:44.570> this

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.740 

and<00:04:49.340> we're<00:04:49.550> very<00:04:49.580> close<00:04:49.880> to<00:04:50.120> being<00:04:50.300> done<00:04:50.540> now

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
and we're very close to being done now

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.930 
and we're very close to being done now
please<00:04:51.710> notice<00:04:52.010> that<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:54.460> we<00:04:55.460> have<00:04:55.580> a<00:04:55.610> B<00:04:55.880> in

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
please notice that the we have a B in

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.640 
please notice that the we have a B in
the<00:04:56.090> top<00:04:56.330> and<00:04:56.570> we<00:04:56.660> have<00:04:56.690> a<00:04:56.840> B<00:04:57.080> in<00:04:57.200> the<00:04:57.320> bottom

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
the top and we have a B in the bottom

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.400 
the top and we have a B in the bottom
and<00:04:57.800> they<00:04:58.100> can<00:04:58.340> in<00:04:58.460> fact<00:04:58.490> cancel<00:04:59.240> this<00:04:59.840> B<00:05:00.110> will

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
and they can in fact cancel this B will

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.159 
and they can in fact cancel this B will
cancel<00:05:00.890> one<00:05:01.130> of<00:05:01.160> these<00:05:01.400> two<00:05:02.240> B's<00:05:02.450> down<00:05:02.720> here

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
cancel one of these two B's down here

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.290 
cancel one of these two B's down here
and<00:05:03.740> all<00:05:03.830> that's<00:05:04.010> left<00:05:04.070> to<00:05:04.460> do<00:05:04.640> is<00:05:04.790> really<00:05:05.030> box

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
and all that's left to do is really box

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.719 
and all that's left to do is really box
our<00:05:05.510> answer<00:05:05.540> and<00:05:06.169> pretty-pretty<00:05:06.950> phi<00:05:07.280> it<00:05:07.340> and

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
our answer and pretty-pretty phi it and

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.909 
our answer and pretty-pretty phi it and
that's<00:05:08.270> what<00:05:08.390> i've<00:05:08.479> done<00:05:08.600> here<00:05:08.660> and<00:05:09.140> so<00:05:09.710> there

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
that's what i've done here and so there

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.580 
that's what i've done here and so there
you<00:05:10.010> go<00:05:10.190> notice<00:05:10.880> that<00:05:11.000> there<00:05:11.210> aren't<00:05:11.360> any

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
you go notice that there aren't any

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.340 
you go notice that there aren't any
radicals<00:05:12.590> in<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:13.220> denominator<00:05:13.250> and<00:05:14.350> this

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
radicals in the denominator and this

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.830 
radicals in the denominator and this
thing<00:05:15.590> has<00:05:15.740> been<00:05:15.890> rationalized<00:05:16.630> okay<00:05:17.630> I<00:05:17.660> hope

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
thing has been rationalized okay I hope

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.280 
thing has been rationalized okay I hope
I<00:05:18.140> hope<00:05:18.440> that<00:05:18.680> helped<00:05:19.720> take<00:05:20.720> you<00:05:20.900> home<00:05:21.050> on

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
I hope that helped take you home on

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.730 
I hope that helped take you home on
these<00:05:21.880> there<00:05:22.880> will<00:05:23.180> be<00:05:23.210> one<00:05:23.690> similar<00:05:24.560> to<00:05:24.620> this

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
these there will be one similar to this

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.700 
these there will be one similar to this
on<00:05:25.040> the<00:05:25.220> final<00:05:25.690> so<00:05:26.690> give<00:05:27.020> it<00:05:27.110> a<00:05:27.169> good<00:05:27.290> look<00:05:27.500> and

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
on the final so give it a good look and

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.600 
on the final so give it a good look and
I'll<00:05:28.669> be<00:05:28.790> talking<00:05:28.970> to<00:05:29.150> you<00:05:29.270> soon
