as a comment so live video as well as my

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.540 
as a comment so live video as well as my
channel<00:00:49.930> get<00:00:50.050> out<00:00:50.140> there<00:00:50.320> I<00:00:50.500> also<00:00:50.980> saw<00:00:51.370> this

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
channel get out there I also saw this

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.369 
channel get out there I also saw this
off<00:00:51.730> a<00:00:51.760> glitch<00:00:52.030> between<00:00:52.300> channel<00:00:52.720> where<00:00:53.170> she's

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
off a glitch between channel where she's

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.770 
off a glitch between channel where she's
posted<00:00:53.680> about<00:00:53.800> 10<00:00:54.160> spots<00:00:54.550> and<00:00:55.120> out<00:00:55.210> of<00:00:55.360> all<00:00:55.540> 10

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
posted about 10 spots and out of all 10

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.660 
posted about 10 spots and out of all 10
spots<00:00:56.140> I<00:00:56.379> thought<00:00:56.590> this<00:00:56.739> was<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:57.070> coolest<00:00:57.309> one

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
spots I thought this was the coolest one

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.729 
spots I thought this was the coolest one
as<00:00:57.820> most<00:00:58.540> spots<00:00:58.809> in<00:00:58.960> her<00:00:58.989> video<00:00:59.320> were<00:00:59.440> simply

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
as most spots in her video were simply

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.530 
as most spots in her video were simply
on<00:00:59.860> barricades<00:01:00.400> and<00:01:00.610> I<00:01:01.180> thought<00:01:01.360> they<00:01:01.449> were

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
on barricades and I thought they were

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.299 
on barricades and I thought they were
sort<00:01:01.720> of<00:01:01.780> pointless<00:01:02.110> as<00:01:02.409> well<00:01:02.949> as<00:01:03.100> being

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
sort of pointless as well as being

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.310 
sort of pointless as well as being
pointless<00:01:03.760> this<00:01:04.479> glitch<00:01:04.690> isn't<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.170> easiest

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
pointless this glitch isn't the easiest

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.130 
pointless this glitch isn't the easiest
to<00:01:05.650> do<00:01:05.920> so<00:01:06.640> once<00:01:06.790> again<00:01:06.970> I<00:01:07.270> thought<00:01:07.720> this<00:01:07.960> one

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
to do so once again I thought this one

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.600 
to do so once again I thought this one
spot<00:01:08.380> which<00:01:08.590> I'm<00:01:08.770> showing<00:01:08.979> you<00:01:09.130> in<00:01:09.340> this<00:01:09.430> video

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
spot which I'm showing you in this video

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.120 
spot which I'm showing you in this video
was<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.510> coolest<00:01:10.780> so<00:01:11.620> once<00:01:11.860> you're<00:01:12.040> on<00:01:12.070> the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
was the coolest so once you're on the

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.800 
was the coolest so once you're on the
map<00:01:12.340> transit<00:01:12.940> you<00:01:13.270> want<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.510> make<00:01:13.630> your<00:01:13.750> way

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
map transit you want to make your way

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.570 
map transit you want to make your way
towards<00:01:13.930> a<00:01:14.170> diner<00:01:14.409> so<00:01:15.010> that<00:01:15.190> you<00:01:15.280> can<00:01:15.400> build

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
towards a diner so that you can build

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.010 
towards a diner so that you can build
the<00:01:15.700> shield<00:01:15.880> as<00:01:16.090> you<00:01:16.360> will<00:01:16.510> be<00:01:16.630> using<00:01:16.810> the

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
the shield as you will be using the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.289 
the shield as you will be using the
shield<00:01:17.290> to<00:01:17.740> knife<00:01:17.920> lunge<00:01:18.159> from<00:01:18.909> there<00:01:19.120> you

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
shield to knife lunge from there you

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:20.730 
shield to knife lunge from there you
want<00:01:19.600> to<00:01:19.720> make<00:01:19.810> your<00:01:19.990> way<00:01:20.140> towards<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.530> power

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
want to make your way towards the power

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.680 
want to make your way towards the power
room<00:01:21.010> and<00:01:21.250> once<00:01:21.850> you<00:01:21.940> open<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.270> door<00:01:22.299> you

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
room and once you open the door you

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.969 
room and once you open the door you
should<00:01:22.780> fall<00:01:23.110> down<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:23.560> there<00:01:23.740> should<00:01:23.890> be<00:01:23.950> a

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
should fall down and there should be a

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.530 
should fall down and there should be a
window<00:01:24.280> chair<00:01:24.490> right<00:01:24.700> on<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.030> bottom<00:01:25.210> of<00:01:25.450> the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
window chair right on the bottom of the

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.930 
window chair right on the bottom of the
hallway<00:01:25.810> and<00:01:26.200> from<00:01:26.890> there<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.400> more<00:01:27.580> players

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
hallway and from there the more players

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.359 
hallway and from there the more players
in<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.210> lobby<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:29.530> makes<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.920> glitch<00:01:30.070> even

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
in the lobby it makes the glitch even

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.370 
in the lobby it makes the glitch even
easier<00:01:30.549> as<00:01:30.940> they<00:01:31.390> will<00:01:31.540> need<00:01:31.960> to<00:01:32.140> keep

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
easier as they will need to keep

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.200 
easier as they will need to keep
rebuilding<00:01:32.620> the<00:01:32.860> window<00:01:33.130> also<00:01:33.850> if<00:01:34.060> they

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
rebuilding the window also if they

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.510 
rebuilding the window also if they
permit<00:01:34.600> jug<00:01:35.020> it<00:01:35.860> would<00:01:35.980> make<00:01:36.160> this<00:01:36.280> glitch

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
permit jug it would make this glitch

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.180 
permit jug it would make this glitch
even<00:01:36.880> easier<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:38.140> once<00:01:38.410> you<00:01:38.530> have<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.860> couple

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
even easier so once you have a couple

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.860 
even easier so once you have a couple
friends<00:01:39.400> or<00:01:39.730> just<00:01:39.760> a<00:01:40.000> friend<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.420> lobby<00:01:40.570> to

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
friends or just a friend to the lobby to

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.290 
friends or just a friend to the lobby to
keep<00:01:41.170> rebuilding<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:41.650> window<00:01:41.920> all<00:01:42.910> you<00:01:43.150> want

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
keep rebuilding the window all you want

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.330 
keep rebuilding the window all you want
to<00:01:43.330> do<00:01:43.420> is<00:01:43.540> place<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.900> shield<00:01:44.200> as<00:01:44.410> close<00:01:45.100> as

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
to do is place the shield as close as

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.580 
to do is place the shield as close as
possible<00:01:45.370> to<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.210> window<00:01:46.630> so<00:01:47.170> you<00:01:47.200> can<00:01:47.380> place

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
possible to the window so you can place

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.740 
possible to the window so you can place
it<00:01:47.740> down<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:48.280> cannot<00:01:48.580> be<00:01:48.730> read<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.180> it

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
it down so it cannot be read and it

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.350 
it down so it cannot be read and it
should<00:01:49.930> be<00:01:50.080> like<00:01:51.010> mine<00:01:51.310> in<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.580> video<00:01:51.820> like<00:01:52.330> a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
should be like mine in the video like a

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.290 
should be like mine in the video like a
little<00:01:52.750> bit<00:01:52.870> in<00:01:52.990> front<00:01:53.320> of<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.740> line<00:01:53.980> and<00:01:54.310> what

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
little bit in front of the line and what

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.090 
little bit in front of the line and what
you<00:01:55.420> want<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.660> do<00:01:55.810> is<00:01:56.050> try<00:01:56.440> to<00:01:56.470> get<00:01:56.620> the<00:01:56.740> zombie

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
you want to do is try to get the zombie

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.310 
you want to do is try to get the zombie
to<00:01:57.280> be<00:01:57.370> in<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.580> middle<00:01:57.760> of<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.060> barricade<00:01:58.840> or

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
to be in the middle of the barricade or

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.500 
to be in the middle of the barricade or
the<00:01:59.530> left<00:01:59.710> side<00:01:59.980> now<00:02:00.520> if<00:02:00.820> he's<00:02:01.120> in<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.360> right

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
the left side now if he's in the right

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.090 
the left side now if he's in the right
side<00:02:01.780> I<00:02:02.050> do<00:02:02.140> believe<00:02:02.620> it's<00:02:02.830> going<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:03.010> be<00:02:03.070> a

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100

little bit more difficult which is

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.450 
little bit more difficult which is
something<00:02:04.930> you<00:02:05.140> guys<00:02:05.350> don't<00:02:05.590> want<00:02:05.800> so<00:02:06.280> if<00:02:06.370> you

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
something you guys don't want so if you
