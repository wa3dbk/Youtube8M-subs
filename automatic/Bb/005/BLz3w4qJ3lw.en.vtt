00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
know what that means is that basically

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.899 
know what that means is that basically
where<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.530> get<00:01:40.710> used<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.310> something<00:01:41.549> too<00:01:41.880> much

where you get used to something too much

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.569 
where you get used to something too much

apparently people think that

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
because our brains you know think that

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.750

oil um and we need to over moisturize so

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.080 
oil um and we need to over moisturize so
that<00:02:22.410> our<00:02:22.500> brain<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.130> like<00:02:23.280> Oh<00:02:23.459> your<00:02:23.790> skin's
