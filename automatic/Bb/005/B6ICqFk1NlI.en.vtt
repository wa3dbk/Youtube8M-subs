00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:21.170
 well it's time to try the 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:25.189
 new summer summer tea is a turbo 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:28.070
 I'm going to drive it on the road 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.859
 and back now that I'm going to do some 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.200
 reports is the most silent sedan in 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.720
 the market thanks to the way it is 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.600
 built in the cockpit and that I'm going to 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.530
 be testing now in the city and in 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.530
 the road populates 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:51.079
 in its category this summer is the most 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.510
 It has potent 250 horsepower 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.960
 and thanks to the architecture with which 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.120
 it is designed is seen as the sedan 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.770
 quieter than there is in the market 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.890
 especially in this category 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.130
 four turbo cylinders let's try it 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.520
 as if it were a sports car I'm going to 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.010
 handle on the rise of the river to the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.990
 road of puebla I want to see how it 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.370
 comprises one of the advantages 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.160
 this vile summer is that you can handle it 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.880
 manually or automatically a box of 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.420
 six super-equipped speeds has 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.760
 everything that you can think of inside 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.330
 of the team accounts for example with 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.830
 front seat heater 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.290
 independent enjoy the butt of 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:45.080
 frost air front already comes with 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.990
 browser like this one that I already have 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.670
 that I am already using to reach the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.990
 puebla road 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.840
 you will be able to hear that it is very 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.570
 silent 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.810
 accelerated thoroughly and still you do not 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:03.060
 perceived more than noise at its maximum 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.060
 revolution that the engine could generate 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.360
 this summer has controls in the 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:15.970
 steering wheel brings us shifter succession other 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:18.970
 levers on the steering wheel but yes yes I have 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.500
 the ease of using the lever in 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.920
 automatic or manual as I already 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.700
 mentioned I can select the use of the 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.750
 bluetooth dial the automatic 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.880
 cruising the automatic cruise control 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.850
 increase or decrease the volume 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.870
 change stations and between 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:44.200
 input options or options to 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.080
 connect you have for example an auxiliary 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.310
 if you want to connect your mp3 you have the 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.470
 control of the ipod or connected iphone 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.770
 through the usb you have here and in 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.200
 automatically you handle it from the 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.540
 board or from the console and few 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.790
 ages can reach from 0 to 100 in 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.060
 six seconds 6.2 seconds in 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:11.260
 normal conditions I was already 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.330
 testing the truth roughly seven 7.5 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.820
 seconds in the city but remember 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:20.380
 that we are up to it should be 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.960
 really 6.2 seconds because with the 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.780
 turbo there should be no difference to the 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.770
 height automatically regulates views 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:33.070
 summer comes with the concierge system 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:35.620
 system or help that they give as if it were 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.870
 your private secretary and you are made 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.760
 hotel reservations can you 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.450
 indicate how 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.430
 to a destination if you are lost or not 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:50.890
 find the path I do not achieve on the gps 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:52.689
 you tell him I want to go to the center of al 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.430
 convention center in puebla o 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.110
 I want to go to the Cuauhtémoc stadium in 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.790
 puebla or zaragoza street and I say 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.600
 populate because that's where I'm going and the 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:04.120
 concert is going to give you the necessary help 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.080
 and the advantage is that this assistant or 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.840
 Secretary is 365 days a year 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.170
 ready to support us I'll try it 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.989
 with five people inside the car myself and 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:21.360
 four people from my work team 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.360
 in the return of the highway of puebla 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.080
 now back I can comment 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.510
 who was delighted with the car 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.690
 like the way he responds in the 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:43.850
 rise reaches the speed of 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:45.980
 220 kilometers on the straight and 180 in the 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.610
 rise of population towards the zone of 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.490
 Ríofrío had to stop several times 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.880
 emergency for two reasons 1 because 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.980
 there were trucks that opened since 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.480
 they had to pass other vehicles that 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.730
 they came a lot slower 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.850
 the buses did reach a 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:07.250
 speed greater than 85 kilometers that 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.740
 supposedly regulated it came to 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.440
 reach speeds of up to 110 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.930
 kilometers and on the other hand I had to 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.180
 tie because I threw the camera 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.730
 gop pro with which they were filming 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.760
 the test of return I did it of day in 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.010
 the test and I did it at night in 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.560
 the proof of return we came five 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.770
 people on my team work well 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.120
 radio of the production team and my 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.360
 partner 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.900
 but with antonio morals the cabin the 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:42.050
 Summer cabin is truly 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.840
 silent type is very smooth handling 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.320
 European does not anchors it to has good 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.810
 mooring has good grip the brakes that 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.419
 are a bs and it also comes with several 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.610
 bags inside the cabin allow you 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.380
 have a very comfortable handling and 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.180
 also for the passengers who go back 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.030
 one of the things I like are the 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.550
 front windows between the post and 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.800
 the board that is usually a point 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.650
 dead when you go in curve this helps 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.419
 have a better understeer turn when 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.930
 you come with the open coconut theme is the 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:17.870
 aerodynamics of the vehicle does not affect 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:20.090
 Noise comes in and I can tell you that if 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.160
 you feel like doing a test drive 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.160
 of the summer
