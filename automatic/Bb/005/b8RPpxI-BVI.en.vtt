00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:04.460
 we can also get the effect of chipped dust 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.460
 but partially dragged 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:15.619
 denied we will start airbrushing by giving a layer of dust with his paintings a 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.619
 rolex masters 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.849
 we will not worry left accumulations of paint operates in the 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.089
 wrong areas 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.070
 since this as a dressmaker previously will help us to get an effect 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:33.069
 of the marginalist dust 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.369
 with a flat brush of pretty hard pigs 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.319
 slightly moistened in solvent a goal we started to remove paint 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.030
 as we can see in this phase 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.920
 the effect is pretty ugly the model looks more like a disheveled zebra 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.920
 however, we did not worry because we just started 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.220
 with a piece of sponge slightly moistened in solvent a bronze 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.240
 we will give small blow on the previous prefect 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.100
 and we see how it tends to unify and there will not be an effect as ugly as katzav 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.100
 previously 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.009
 we have not finished yet 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:18.969
 now using a new flat brush but with the certainty very very soft 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.779
 and also slightly moistened in solvent a bronze 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:24.260
 We apply intended vertical movements 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.499
 and we see how we unify even more 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:29.499
 the contrast so ugly that was previously 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:34.289
 we can wet stf in said event and a bronze 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:37.849
 clean the areas where we hope that the dust disappeared him by 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.849
 full 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:18.159
 this process we should apply for free ie re-apply 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.620
 the sponge sponge brush sequence thinks about the leg that we left 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.810
 satisfied I rented applied only a couple of times 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.460
 finally we can airbrushes 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.010
 again a little dust i unify the contrast 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.469
 finally some words of encouragement for our newest friends 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.200
 if I just got this young man and still apply some oil techniques that 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.199
 shake your legs do not dare do not worry 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.969
 this technique has the great advantage that it is absolutely reversible 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:34.610
 If you do not like the result, you can remove all the paint with the fruit 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.949
 sure that the base layer and everything will not be changed at all 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.680
 the work that you have faced 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.810
 you just have to take a very very wet brush solvent a product 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.699
 and rub vigorously with him the whole model 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.879
 you will see how the painting comes out without any difficulty 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:56.489
 ica you just have again tuca poba ready to try again
