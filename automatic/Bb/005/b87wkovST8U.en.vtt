00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hi, Jorge talks about learning to 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.170
 drive well today I'll teach you to 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.749
 park in the specific case in the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.079
 parking of my apartment I arrive 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:14.909
 for here every day if then you 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:17.250
 I will explain how I park there all 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:19.710
 the days and how you can do it is a 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.290
 typical aerial park sets 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.490
 closed and shopping centers 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.860
 then when you tell me to create 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.470
 a space of these the blue squares 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.669
 here represent vehicles 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.980
 they are unoccupied and dotted lines 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.629
 mean free spaces can be 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.670
 pass over them in this case I can not 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.160
 because there are vehicles then when I 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.280
 I'm going to park, I have to find out 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.780
 towards the left side have there 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.180
 all the cars that I have here as 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.180
 you can see not on this side or on the 7 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.309
 but as much as I can hit where 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.370
 I'm going to park because I do this, I'm going 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.019
 to explain why then how have I 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.820
 recommended lately we have to 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.129
 try to park always in reverse 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.650
 besides the shopping centers and 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.750
 apartments demand it for security by 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.340
 speed in the block writes this week 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.810
 you can find out because it's for 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.180
 always be in reverse 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.790
 then I shoot my car towards the 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.490
 left side in this case stuck 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.740
 where I have the vehicles and stuck to 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.840
 where I'm going to park then I go 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.600
 I make this movement and why will it be 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.049
 stuck because the tires are going to have 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.420
 this this tour I want the 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.340
 tires to the left 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.619
 and they will have this journey to the average 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.909
 who's wanting to reverse and remember 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.490
 have here 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.560
 look at your windshield on the glass towards 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.140
 back that you have to be watching 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.119
 well where are you getting into I had the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.990
 car start doing this movement in 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.990
 the measure that reverse 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.510
 in this way you place the car if 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.570
 you did well in one turn you can 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.700
 do if you do not have to make several 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.380
 books the idea is that it has no contact 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.380
 with one of the vehicles that is this 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.050
 side if the car already well located here 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.940
 it can be this movement 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.280
 you will already feel with this mirror that is not 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.270
 be very stuck to dry 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.730
 and here we have left our car 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.720
 in the middle space that in this case 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.310
 It was not very complicated then remember 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.310
 you come by the side 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.180
 left in this case 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.409
 and you put it in reverse to your space in 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.999
 this case so I do it always 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.999
 remember subscribe to my channel 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.340
 so that you receive more videos of salt or 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.680
 Jorge Buitrago of learning to drive 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.120
 well see you in the next one doing 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.120
 better drivers see you later
