00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.290
 next composition 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:15.059
 part of the structure of the haircut is from hard that 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.059
 such a hard pull it 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.340
 delay is the degree to which 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.279
 strand rises relative 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:30.130
 natural hair fall again 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:32.320
 I will say the delay is the degree to which 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.180
 strand rises relative 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:42.129
 natural hair fall visually 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:46.390
 Now we will analyze it in more detail and now 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.249
 More details about the lift that is with hard 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.289
 delay is our degree 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:57.190
 strand rises relative 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:59.890
 natural hair fall and to 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:07.860
 explain i'm giving myself a little here 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:10.300
 here is the strand itself 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:17.969
 which we have now natural 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:20.380
 fall and fall and when the strand is with us 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.479
 falls natural drop and this 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.610
 coincides with the delay we have it 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.689
 my degrees are actually this 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:32.469
 called 0 degrees from hard now we 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:37.240
 Imagine this 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:40.799
 a quickdraw which is called a quickdraw in 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.859
 one finger she is sometimes called 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.750
 minimum grave for example that's wider here 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:48.939
 I have one finger here 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.219
 called one finger pull 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:57.700
 minimum hard it often happens 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:02:04.570
 need this in this way next 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:07.479
 kind of a delay is 45 degrees here 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.910
 natural falls like this 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.910
 45 degrees of delay 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:20.180
 follows backstay 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.250
 90 degrees 90 degrees this 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:29.180
 perpendicular with natural fall 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:33.410
 hair right angle let's us again 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:36.860
 repeat 0 degrees from hard choke 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:44.020
 Vadim finger 45 degrees and a delay in 90 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:47.990
 degrees there is still a delay 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:51.260
 above 90 degrees any heavy you 90 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.370
 degrees any hard above 90 degrees 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.780
 called perry directed from grievous 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.270
 redirected from the grave term 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.270
 redirection in this case is 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.570
 redirected i'm hard it 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.660
 I am redirected relatively 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.810
 natural growth that is from 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.300
 natural you go there it is 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.950
 redirected me hard which serves 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:24.070
 for increase in length and volume in a hairstyle 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:26.570
 often used just so hard 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.530
 redirected i'm hard this is any other 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:35.110
 except 9045 one finger or zero that is 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:38.180
 any other more is all in terms of 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.160
 delay we have the same way you 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.370
 I recommend rehearsing well and 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.489
 to understand when you have 0 hard when 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:51.760
 one finger when 45 for each strand she 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.760
 would be different for example in this case 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:00.480
 here is my strand 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:07.709
 45 degrees my hard and my hard one 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:10.319
 finger or 90 degrees my heavy here 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.440
 in such a way necessarily 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.799
 rehearse this topic see you on 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.799
 next lesson
