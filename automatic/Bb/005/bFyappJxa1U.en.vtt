00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.430 
will play with AS Roma I thought this
they<00:00:53.520> would<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> fun<00:00:54.449> team<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.690> use<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> lot<00:00:55.410> of

they would be a fun team to use a lot of
you<00:00:55.680> guys<00:00:55.739> wanted<00:00:56.280> me<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.579> use<00:00:56.760> Roman<00:00:57.270> FIFA<00:00:57.899> so

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.959

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
i thought i would pick roma and

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.000 
i thought i would pick roma and
basically<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.629> will<00:01:00.780> play<00:01:01.020> all<00:01:01.289> other<00:01:01.620> four

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
basically we will play all other four

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.910 
basically we will play all other four
teams<00:01:02.039> twice<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.210> now<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.660> will<00:01:03.870> simulate<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
teams twice and now we will simulate the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.179 
teams twice and now we will simulate the
other<00:01:05.070> results<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.180> will<00:01:06.390> work<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:07.189> like

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
other results so it will work like like

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.969 
other results so it will work like like
