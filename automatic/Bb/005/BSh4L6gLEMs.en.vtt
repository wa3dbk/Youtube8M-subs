00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.070
 yes hello and welcome 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.890
 mister's unexpected yes is likely 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.890
 still what it is about 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.300
 maybe this one is listening and is 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.140
 I rolled out the mat 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.140
 installed 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.870
 the line 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:53.130
 so really very far down here and 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.130
 then it goes up to the top 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.870
 these sounds awful if not 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.300
 just talk to the audio 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.940
 a bit louder and try it once 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:13.130
 It is that way a bit louder 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.130
 bad I do not scare so animal 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:33.080
 can you do it 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:35.570
 the wind that 's what it is 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.470
 so peaceful i know i have no word 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.090
 Installed this for info I suspect 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.789
 mostly just the wind but it 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:49.520
 It is so scary 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.570
 or yes that's her by the way is the new one 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.069
 texture pack of mine 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:58.630

00:01:52.069 --> 00:02:02.119
 hole continue to use there is that 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.500
 this annoys too 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.319
 it just scares me the sun is rising 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.090

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.150

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.849
 is there on demand of my want 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.269
 Subscribers prefer the bad luck pursued 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.459
 to have 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:23.799
 and instead of 128 mb photo erl is gone 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.889
 and then we'll see each other next 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.219
 Good bye, good bye 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.219
