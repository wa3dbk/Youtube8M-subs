this<00:00:06.800> is<00:00:06.980> the<00:00:07.100> varakin<00:00:07.580> unit<00:00:08.330> that

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.560 

Bourdain<00:00:13.210> Harry<00:00:13.990> Matt<00:00:14.230> box<00:00:15.180> the<00:00:16.180> unit<00:00:16.420> was

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
Bourdain Harry Matt box the unit was

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.750 
Bourdain Harry Matt box the unit was
developed<00:00:16.750> by<00:00:17.320> Arriflex<00:00:18.310> after<00:00:18.640> they

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
developed by Arriflex after they

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.400 
developed by Arriflex after they
purchased<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:19.420> light<00:00:19.750> flicks<00:00:20.080> you<00:00:20.289> know

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
purchased the light flicks you know

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.019 
purchased the light flicks you know
which<00:00:20.560> was<00:00:20.770> a<00:00:20.800> huge<00:00:21.250> you<00:00:21.700> know<00:00:21.820> that<00:00:21.970> were

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
which was a huge you know that were

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.850 
which was a huge you know that were
bolted<00:00:22.390> under<00:00:22.599> the<00:00:22.720> front<00:00:22.869> of<00:00:23.050> lens<00:00:23.680> you're

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
bolted under the front of lens you're

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.499 
bolted under the front of lens you're
most<00:00:24.070> needed<00:00:24.250> construction<00:00:25.000> to<00:00:25.119> be<00:00:25.240> able<00:00:25.419> to

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
most needed construction to be able to

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.409 
most needed construction to be able to
fit<00:00:25.660> it<00:00:25.779> on<00:00:25.930> and<00:00:26.770> once<00:00:27.400> Arriflex<00:00:28.000> bought<00:00:28.270> the

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
fit it on and once Arriflex bought the

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.350 
fit it on and once Arriflex bought the
light<00:00:28.599> flex<00:00:28.960> they<00:00:29.230> decided<00:00:29.710> to<00:00:30.059> turn<00:00:31.059> it<00:00:31.239> into

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
light flex they decided to turn it into

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.519 
light flex they decided to turn it into
something<00:00:31.630> that<00:00:31.750> was<00:00:31.960> a<00:00:31.989> little<00:00:32.169> bit<00:00:32.349> more

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
something that was a little bit more

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.639 
something that was a little bit more
user<00:00:32.800> friendly<00:00:32.950> and<00:00:33.840> developed<00:00:34.840> it<00:00:34.989> as<00:00:35.170> this

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
user friendly and developed it as this

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.680 
user friendly and developed it as this
unit<00:00:36.100> that<00:00:36.129> would<00:00:36.520> literally<00:00:37.059> fit<00:00:37.390> into<00:00:37.540> a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
unit that would literally fit into a

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.889 
unit that would literally fit into a
matte<00:00:37.960> box<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:39.430> how<00:00:40.000> does<00:00:40.059> this<00:00:40.360> unit<00:00:40.719> work

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
matte box so how does this unit work

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.680 
matte box so how does this unit work
well<00:00:41.379> in<00:00:41.739> this<00:00:42.100> housing<00:00:42.640> on<00:00:42.820> top<00:00:42.850> there<00:00:43.510> is<00:00:43.660> a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
well in this housing on top there is a

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.890 
well in this housing on top there is a
bulb<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:45.370> bulb<00:00:45.579> passes<00:00:46.120> light<00:00:46.329> down<00:00:46.570> through

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
bulb the bulb passes light down through

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.440 
bulb the bulb passes light down through
the<00:00:47.050> unit<00:00:47.470> and<00:00:47.620> it<00:00:48.160> passes<00:00:48.400> through<00:00:48.850> a<00:00:48.880> shutter

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
the unit and it passes through a shutter

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.840 
the unit and it passes through a shutter
which<00:00:49.840> is<00:00:50.200> controlled<00:00:50.860> by<00:00:50.950> the<00:00:51.070> dial<00:00:51.430> on<00:00:51.700> the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
which is controlled by the dial on the

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.479 
which is controlled by the dial on the
side<00:00:52.060> here<00:00:52.390> now<00:00:53.230> what<00:00:53.530> that<00:00:53.560> allows<00:00:53.950> you<00:00:54.190> to<00:00:54.250> do

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
side here now what that allows you to do

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.530 
side here now what that allows you to do
is<00:00:54.700> vary<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.239> intensity<00:00:55.410> across<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.710> filter

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
is vary the intensity across the filter

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.700 
is vary the intensity across the filter
without<00:00:58.540> changing<00:00:58.960> color<00:00:59.170> temperature

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
without changing color temperature

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.550 
without changing color temperature
obviously<00:00:59.980> if<00:01:00.670> we<00:01:00.850> were<00:01:00.940> dialing<00:01:01.899> intensity

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 
obviously if we were dialing intensity

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.530 
obviously if we were dialing intensity
up<00:01:02.680> and<00:01:02.860> down<00:01:03.040> and<00:01:03.430> changing<00:01:03.850> voltage<00:01:04.059> then

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
up and down and changing voltage then

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.880 
up and down and changing voltage then
there<00:01:04.689> would<00:01:04.809> be<00:01:04.839> a<00:01:04.989> color<00:01:05.379> temperature

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
there would be a color temperature

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.649 
there would be a color temperature
change<00:01:06.159> as<00:01:06.520> you<00:01:06.700> did<00:01:06.880> that<00:01:07.090> so<00:01:07.329> the<00:01:07.360> blacks

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
change as you did that so the blacks

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.899 
change as you did that so the blacks
would<00:01:07.899> would<00:01:08.229> take<00:01:08.710> on<00:01:08.860> a<00:01:08.890> color<00:01:09.159> cast<00:01:09.399> as<00:01:09.729> you

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
would would take on a color cast as you

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.149 
would would take on a color cast as you
change<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:10.299> voltage<00:01:10.450> up<00:01:10.810> and<00:01:10.960> down<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:11.439> if

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
change the voltage up and down and if

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.679 
change the voltage up and down and if
you're<00:01:12.310> looking<00:01:12.549> at<00:01:12.670> it<00:01:12.790> properly<00:01:13.210> calibrated

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
you're looking at it properly calibrated

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.340 
you're looking at it properly calibrated
monitor<00:01:13.930> if<00:01:14.799> you<00:01:14.979> set<00:01:15.219> the<00:01:15.310> monitor<00:01:15.460> up<00:01:15.759> to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
monitor if you set the monitor up to

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.830 
monitor if you set the monitor up to
color<00:01:17.350> bars<00:01:17.590> and<00:01:17.860> grayscale<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:18.670> then<00:01:19.540> dial

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
color bars and grayscale and then dial

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.630 
color bars and grayscale and then dial
this<00:01:20.049> up<00:01:20.229> and<00:01:20.380> down<00:01:20.560> you<00:01:20.770> can<00:01:20.920> actually<00:01:21.159> see

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
this up and down you can actually see

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.640 
this up and down you can actually see
exactly<00:01:21.670> how<00:01:22.240> much<00:01:22.450> shadow<00:01:22.810> detail<00:01:23.350> you're

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
exactly how much shadow detail you're

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.039 
exactly how much shadow detail you're
getting<00:01:23.680> in<00:01:24.220> those<00:01:24.520> shadow<00:01:24.760> areas<00:01:25.240> now

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
getting in those shadow areas now

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.920 
getting in those shadow areas now
obviously<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.670> comment<00:01:28.060> is<00:01:28.210> well

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
obviously the the the comment is well

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.630 
obviously the the the comment is well
why<00:01:29.170> not<00:01:29.200> just<00:01:29.409> bring<00:01:29.710> up<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:30.070> master<00:01:30.400> blacks

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
why not just bring up the master blacks

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.080 
why not just bring up the master blacks
or<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.030> or<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.420> pedestal<00:01:31.900> in<00:01:32.580> in<00:01:33.580> color

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
or the or the pedestal in in color

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.210 
or the or the pedestal in in color
grading<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:34.750> yeah<00:01:35.380> you<00:01:35.500> can<00:01:35.710> do<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:36.070> but

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
grading and yeah you can do that but

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.039 
grading and yeah you can do that but
there's<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.490> price<00:01:36.729> you<00:01:36.909> pay<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.840> price

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
there's a price you pay and the price

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.100 
there's a price you pay and the price
you<00:01:38.229> pay<00:01:38.440> is<00:01:38.770> increased<00:01:39.520> noise<00:01:39.760> the<00:01:40.659> advantage

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
you pay is increased noise the advantage

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.859 
you pay is increased noise the advantage
of<00:01:41.260> this<00:01:41.500> system<00:01:41.740> is<00:01:42.189> that<00:01:42.939> you're<00:01:43.299> telling

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
of this system is that you're telling

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.080 
of this system is that you're telling
the<00:01:44.080> circuitry<00:01:44.680> that<00:01:44.950> there<00:01:45.280> is<00:01:45.490> actually

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
the circuitry that there is actually

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.630 
the circuitry that there is actually
light<00:01:46.360> in<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.689> shadow<00:01:46.960> areas<00:01:47.439> so<00:01:48.340> when<00:01:48.520> you

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
light in the shadow areas so when you

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.250 
light in the shadow areas so when you
dial<00:01:48.939> this<00:01:49.150> up<00:01:49.390> you're<00:01:49.960> not<00:01:50.049> actually

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
dial this up you're not actually

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.690 
dial this up you're not actually
increasing<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.010> noise<00:01:51.189> level<00:01:51.549> you're

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
increasing the noise level you're

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.270 
increasing the noise level you're
putting<00:01:51.939> light<00:01:52.150> into<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.600> end<00:01:52.900> of<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.280> image

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
putting light into the end of the image

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.039 
putting light into the end of the image
and<00:01:54.840> you're<00:01:55.840> gaining<00:01:56.290> more<00:01:56.860> shadow<00:01:57.159> detail

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and you're gaining more shadow detail

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.679 
and you're gaining more shadow detail
without<00:01:59.049> the<00:01:59.710> without<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.310> cost<00:02:00.640> of<00:02:00.880> of<00:02:01.180> noise

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
without the without the cost of of noise

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.710 
without the without the cost of of noise
so<00:02:03.000> that's<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.150> advantage<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.630> other

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
so that's the advantage the other

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.560 
so that's the advantage the other
advantage<00:02:05.200> is<00:02:05.350> that<00:02:05.409> you<00:02:05.619> can<00:02:06.040> in<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:07.390> back

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
advantage is that you can in the back

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.109 
advantage is that you can in the back
here<00:02:07.810> there's<00:02:07.990> a<00:02:08.080> little<00:02:08.289> filter<00:02:08.860> tray<00:02:09.220> that

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
here there's a little filter tray that

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.910 
here there's a little filter tray that
you<00:02:10.179> can<00:02:10.390> put<00:02:10.569> filters<00:02:10.810> in<00:02:11.140> so<00:02:11.319> you<00:02:11.439> can<00:02:11.590> slide

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
you can put filters in so you can slide

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.940 
you can put filters in so you can slide
that<00:02:12.189> into<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.670> back<00:02:12.909> of<00:02:12.939> the<00:02:13.209> unit<00:02:13.709> right<00:02:14.709> in

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
that into the back of the unit right in

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.869 
that into the back of the unit right in
here<00:02:15.129> like<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:15.579> and<00:02:17.280> then<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.430> can<00:02:18.579> color

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
here like this and then you can color

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.150 
here like this and then you can color
that<00:02:19.209> light<00:02:19.689> to<00:02:20.049> whatever<00:02:20.260> you<00:02:20.500> want<00:02:20.709> again

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
that light to whatever you want again

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.229 
that light to whatever you want again
it's<00:02:21.489> something<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:21.880> can<00:02:22.000> do<00:02:22.120> in

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
it's something you can do in

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.600 
it's something you can do in
post-production<00:02:22.630> so<00:02:23.260> it's<00:02:24.190> really<00:02:24.400> not

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
post-production so it's really not

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.770 
post-production so it's really not
something<00:02:25.030> that's

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
something that's

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.420 
something that's
it's<00:02:25.840> real<00:02:25.990> necessary<00:02:26.590> at<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.830> moment<00:02:27.220> but

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
it's real necessary at the moment but

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.949 
it's real necessary at the moment but
the<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.720> actual<00:02:29.970> changing<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.240> of<00:02:31.540> the

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
the the actual changing of the of the

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.870 
the the actual changing of the of the
amount<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.319> shadow<00:02:32.530> detail<00:02:33.069> is<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.340> really

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
amount of shadow detail is a really

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.230 
amount of shadow detail is a really
valuable<00:02:34.590> tool<00:02:35.590> now<00:02:36.490> of<00:02:36.610> course<00:02:36.790> there<00:02:37.060> are<00:02:37.209> a

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
valuable tool now of course there are a

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.360 
valuable tool now of course there are a
few<00:02:37.480> things<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.870> keep<00:02:37.990> in<00:02:38.170> mind<00:02:38.440> when<00:02:38.709> using

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
few things to keep in mind when using

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.790 
few things to keep in mind when using
the<00:02:39.700> Varick<00:02:39.970> on<00:02:40.170> obviously<00:02:41.170> going<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.590> milk

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
the Varick on obviously going to milk

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.440 
the Varick on obviously going to milk
out<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.130> blacks<00:02:42.370> when<00:02:42.700> you<00:02:42.880> when<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.270> bring

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
out the blacks when you when you bring

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.220 
out the blacks when you when you bring
the<00:02:43.770> bring<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:44.800> level<00:02:45.130> up<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:46.540> bring<00:02:47.080> you

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
the bring the level up to bring you

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.340 
the bring the level up to bring you
shadow<00:02:47.739> detail<00:02:48.250> in<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.780> you<00:02:49.840> are<00:02:50.050> going<00:02:50.230> to

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
shadow detail in so you are going to

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.660 
shadow detail in so you are going to
have<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.560> pull<00:02:50.739> them<00:02:50.920> back<00:02:50.980> down<00:02:51.370> in

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
have to pull them back down in

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.550 
have to pull them back down in
post-production<00:02:52.390> if<00:02:52.930> that's<00:02:53.170> not<00:02:53.319> a<00:02:53.380> look

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
post-production if that's not a look

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.320 
post-production if that's not a look
you're<00:02:53.709> after<00:02:53.890> if<00:02:54.400> you're<00:02:54.760> going<00:02:54.910> for<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.180> low

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
you're after if you're going for a low

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.940 
you're after if you're going for a low
contrast<00:02:55.720> look<00:02:56.050> and<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.260> want<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.530> blacks<00:02:56.770> up

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
contrast look and you want the blacks up

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.250 
contrast look and you want the blacks up
a<00:02:57.040> little<00:02:57.190> bit<00:02:57.400> higher<00:02:57.640> then<00:02:58.360> yeah<00:02:59.050> that's

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
a little bit higher then yeah that's

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.740 
a little bit higher then yeah that's
fine<00:02:59.530> you<00:02:59.739> can<00:02:59.890> you<00:03:00.160> can<00:03:00.310> use<00:03:00.550> it<00:03:00.760> but

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
fine you can you can use it but

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.910 
fine you can you can use it but
generally<00:03:02.230> if<00:03:02.350> you're<00:03:02.470> just<00:03:02.650> going<00:03:02.860> for

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
generally if you're just going for

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.130 
generally if you're just going for
shadow<00:03:03.550> detail<00:03:04.090> you'll<00:03:04.330> bring<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.660> blacks<00:03:04.870> up

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
shadow detail you'll bring the blacks up

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.960 
shadow detail you'll bring the blacks up
and<00:03:05.590> then<00:03:05.860> you<00:03:05.920> have<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.160> pull<00:03:06.340> them<00:03:06.489> back<00:03:06.519> down

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
and then you have to pull them back down

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.690 
and then you have to pull them back down
to<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.510> saturation<00:03:07.959> level<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:08.530> want<00:03:08.739> in<00:03:09.070> post

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
to the saturation level you want in post

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.780 
to the saturation level you want in post
in<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.360> color<00:03:10.569> grade<00:03:11.130> but<00:03:12.130> you'll<00:03:12.340> still<00:03:12.580> hold

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
in the color grade but you'll still hold

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.729 
in the color grade but you'll still hold
onto<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.120> shadow<00:03:13.360> detail<00:03:13.900> instead<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:14.530> going

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
onto the shadow detail instead of going

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.110 
onto the shadow detail instead of going
the<00:03:14.830> other<00:03:14.860> way<00:03:15.069> where<00:03:15.489> you<00:03:15.760> you're

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
the other way where you you're

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.640 
the other way where you you're
struggling<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.720> get<00:03:16.810> enough<00:03:16.930> light<00:03:17.260> into<00:03:17.530> the

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
struggling to get enough light into the

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.140 
struggling to get enough light into the
shadows<00:03:17.980> you're<00:03:18.220> pulling<00:03:18.519> detail<00:03:18.940> out

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
shadows you're pulling detail out

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.479 
shadows you're pulling detail out
bringing<00:03:19.630> up<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.959> noise<00:03:20.080> level<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:21.370> the

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
bringing up the noise level so the

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.890 
bringing up the noise level so the
advantage<00:03:21.880> obviously<00:03:22.090> is<00:03:22.600> that<00:03:22.630> you're

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
advantage obviously is that you're

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.600 
advantage obviously is that you're
bringing<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.290> bringing<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.890> shadow<00:03:24.160> areas

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
bringing the bringing the shadow areas

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.330 
bringing the bringing the shadow areas
down<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.330> if<00:03:26.319> there<00:03:26.500> is<00:03:26.620> any<00:03:26.830> noise<00:03:27.010> in<00:03:27.040> the

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
down and if there is any noise in the

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.949 
down and if there is any noise in the
shadow<00:03:27.550> areas<00:03:27.880> you're<00:03:28.030> decreasing<00:03:28.390> it<00:03:28.750> rather

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
shadow areas you're decreasing it rather

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.560 
shadow areas you're decreasing it rather
than<00:03:29.200> increasing<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.940> other<00:03:31.090> advantage

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
than increasing it the other advantage

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.430 
than increasing it the other advantage
of<00:03:31.720> this<00:03:31.870> is<00:03:32.110> that<00:03:32.380> if<00:03:32.650> you're<00:03:33.459> going<00:03:33.820> for<00:03:34.440> what

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
of this is that if you're going for what

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.979 
of this is that if you're going for what
everyone<00:03:35.820> lovingly<00:03:36.820> refers<00:03:37.239> to<00:03:37.269> as<00:03:37.600> a<00:03:37.630> film

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
everyone lovingly refers to as a film

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.620 
everyone lovingly refers to as a film
look<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:39.730> can<00:03:39.910> achieve<00:03:40.000> that<00:03:40.390> with<00:03:40.540> the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
look you can achieve that with the

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.460 
look you can achieve that with the
Vericom<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:41.560> does<00:03:41.920> give<00:03:42.850> you<00:03:43.090> a<00:03:43.120> nice<00:03:43.470> softness

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
Vericom it does give you a nice softness

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.490 
Vericom it does give you a nice softness
in<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.799> in<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.610> blacks<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:46.239> you<00:03:47.019> can't<00:03:47.260> get

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
in the in the blacks that you can't get

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.180 
in the in the blacks that you can't get
other<00:03:48.160> than<00:03:48.549> by<00:03:48.760> manipulating<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:50.190> the

manipulating<00:03:54.250> it<00:03:54.340> in<00:03:54.459> post-production<00:03:55.290> I

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
manipulating it in post-production I

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.050 
manipulating it in post-production I
actually<00:03:56.709> like<00:03:57.040> to<00:03:57.130> do<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.370> in<00:03:57.489> camera<00:03:57.730> so<00:03:57.970> I've

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
actually like to do it in camera so I've

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.819 
actually like to do it in camera so I've
got<00:03:58.239> control<00:03:58.630> over<00:03:58.660> it<00:03:59.019> on<00:03:59.109> the<00:03:59.260> set<00:03:59.470> and<00:03:59.590> I<00:03:59.680> can

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
got control over it on the set and I can

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.380 
got control over it on the set and I can
see<00:04:00.040> what<00:04:00.220> I'm<00:04:00.370> what<00:04:00.730> I'm<00:04:00.880> getting<00:04:01.150> when<00:04:01.269> I'm

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
see what I'm what I'm getting when I'm

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.210 
see what I'm what I'm getting when I'm
shooting<00:04:01.660> but<00:04:02.560> in<00:04:02.680> terms<00:04:02.920> of<00:04:03.100> digital

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
shooting but in terms of digital

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.310 
shooting but in terms of digital
cinematography<00:04:03.820> it<00:04:04.329> does<00:04:04.510> give<00:04:04.720> you<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:04.870> really

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
cinematography it does give you a really

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.250 
cinematography it does give you a really
nice<00:04:05.500> look<00:04:05.769> in<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.100> blacks<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:07.299> and<00:04:07.690> gives

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
nice look in the blacks and and gives

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.340 
nice look in the blacks and and gives
overall<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:09.280> little<00:04:10.239> bit<00:04:10.480> more<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.930> filmic

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
overall a little bit more of a filmic

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.860 
overall a little bit more of a filmic
look<00:04:11.380> rather<00:04:11.890> than<00:04:12.130> than<00:04:12.549> the<00:04:12.820> hard<00:04:13.420> edge<00:04:13.600> that

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
look rather than than the hard edge that

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.740 
look rather than than the hard edge that
you<00:04:14.140> normally<00:04:14.650> associate<00:04:15.100> with<00:04:15.750> digital

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
you normally associate with digital

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.229 
you normally associate with digital
cinematography<00:04:17.109> these<00:04:17.650> days<00:04:17.919> now<00:04:18.640> the

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
cinematography these days now the

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.599 
cinematography these days now the
question<00:04:19.600> is<00:04:19.780> okay<00:04:20.620> it<00:04:20.709> works<00:04:20.919> great<00:04:21.160> on<00:04:21.190> film

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
question is okay it works great on film

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.120 
question is okay it works great on film
but<00:04:21.910> is<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.270> necessary<00:04:22.390> on<00:04:22.960> HD<00:04:23.620> well<00:04:23.890> I've<00:04:23.950> done

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
but is it necessary on HD well I've done

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.820 
but is it necessary on HD well I've done
a<00:04:24.160> lot<00:04:24.310> of<00:04:24.460> testing<00:04:24.820> on<00:04:24.910> HD<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:25.600> I've<00:04:26.560> used

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
a lot of testing on HD and I've used

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.950 
a lot of testing on HD and I've used
this<00:04:26.979> unit<00:04:27.340> ever<00:04:27.490> since<00:04:27.760> it<00:04:28.000> was<00:04:28.180> built<00:04:28.660> and<00:04:28.900> I

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
this unit ever since it was built and I

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.950 
this unit ever since it was built and I
think<00:04:29.169> my<00:04:29.500> unit<00:04:30.070> is<00:04:30.220> actually<00:04:30.400> zero<00:04:31.150> zero<00:04:31.570> zero

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
think my unit is actually zero zero zero

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.430 
think my unit is actually zero zero zero
one<00:04:33.330> so<00:04:34.330> I've<00:04:34.419> used<00:04:34.659> it<00:04:34.780> for<00:04:34.810> quite<00:04:35.110> a<00:04:35.140> while

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
one so I've used it for quite a while

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.350 
one so I've used it for quite a while
and<00:04:35.740> I<00:04:35.890> was<00:04:36.010> one<00:04:36.190> of<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.400> few<00:04:36.580> guys<00:04:36.760> using<00:04:37.270> it

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
and I was one of the few guys using it

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.590 
and I was one of the few guys using it
on<00:04:37.510> TV<00:04:38.020> which<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:38.979> couldn't<00:04:39.280> really

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
on TV which I couldn't really

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.720 
on TV which I couldn't really
understand<00:04:40.020> because<00:04:40.350> TV<00:04:40.560> is<00:04:40.740> a<00:04:40.890> perfect<00:04:41.580> place

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
understand because TV is a perfect place

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.670 
understand because TV is a perfect place
to<00:04:41.760> use<00:04:41.970> it<00:04:43.700> but<00:04:44.700> I<00:04:44.970> did<00:04:45.330> a<00:04:45.360> lot<00:04:45.540> of<00:04:45.570> testing<00:04:46.110> in

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
to use it but I did a lot of testing in

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.580 
to use it but I did a lot of testing in
the<00:04:47.340> early<00:04:47.640> days<00:04:47.850> on<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.750> early<00:04:49.020> generation

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
the early days on the early generation

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.730 
the early days on the early generation
HD<00:04:49.950> cameras<00:04:50.430> in<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.330> late<00:04:51.540> 90s<00:04:52.080> mid<00:04:52.470> to<00:04:52.590> late

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
HD cameras in the late 90s mid to late

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.790 
HD cameras in the late 90s mid to late
90s<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:54.390> results<00:04:54.750> were<00:04:54.870> spectacular<00:04:55.110> and

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
90s and the results were spectacular and

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.040 
90s and the results were spectacular and
I've<00:04:56.640> used<00:04:56.880> it<00:04:57.030> on<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.270> new<00:04:57.420> generation

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
I've used it on the new generation

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.840 
I've used it on the new generation
cameras<00:04:58.500> and<00:04:59.040> in<00:04:59.190> actual<00:04:59.520> fact<00:04:59.640> we<00:04:59.820> just

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
cameras and in actual fact we just

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.930 
cameras and in actual fact we just
finished<00:05:00.330> using<00:05:00.570> it<00:05:00.810> on<00:05:01.020> a<00:05:01.050> shoot<00:05:01.380> in<00:05:02.100> herethe

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
finished using it on a shoot in herethe

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.730 
finished using it on a shoot in herethe
Spain<00:05:03.300> where<00:05:03.600> we<00:05:03.750> use<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:04.080> Alexa<00:05:04.470> and<00:05:04.620> the

flex<00:05:08.670> unit<00:05:08.880> worked<00:05:09.240> fantastically<00:05:10.200> well<00:05:11.600> it

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
flex unit worked fantastically well it

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.290 
flex unit worked fantastically well it
gave<00:05:13.020> me<00:05:13.290> in<00:05:13.830> areas<00:05:14.250> where<00:05:14.460> we<00:05:14.670> we<00:05:14.970> couldn't

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
gave me in areas where we we couldn't

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.000 
gave me in areas where we we couldn't
put<00:05:15.480> fill<00:05:15.720> light<00:05:15.930> it<00:05:16.290> allowed<00:05:16.680> me<00:05:16.860> to

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
put fill light it allowed me to

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.120 
put fill light it allowed me to
basically<00:05:17.430> dial<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.150> fill<00:05:18.360> light<00:05:18.600> in<00:05:19.130> dialed

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
basically dial the fill light in dialed

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.590 
basically dial the fill light in dialed
up<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:20.400> down<00:05:20.520> get<00:05:20.760> the<00:05:20.850> shadow<00:05:21.090> detail<00:05:21.570> I

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
up and down get the shadow detail I

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.440 
up and down get the shadow detail I
wanted<00:05:22.430> without<00:05:23.430> having<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.970> put<00:05:24.120> up<00:05:24.240> lights

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
wanted without having to put up lights

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.780 
wanted without having to put up lights
in<00:05:24.630> a<00:05:24.720> dangerous<00:05:25.080> situation<00:05:25.260> or<00:05:26.160> go<00:05:26.460> to<00:05:26.520> the

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
in a dangerous situation or go to the

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.730 
in a dangerous situation or go to the
added<00:05:27.270> time<00:05:28.220> cost<00:05:29.220> of<00:05:30.050> lighting<00:05:31.050> lighting<00:05:31.680> a

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
added time cost of lighting lighting a

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.120 
added time cost of lighting lighting a
big<00:05:31.980> big<00:05:32.700> area<00:05:33.350> so<00:05:34.350> that's<00:05:34.470> the<00:05:34.650> light<00:05:34.830> flicks
