in<00:02:31.170> your<00:02:31.260> leap<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.680> go<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.160> just

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
in your leap and you go and you just

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.160 
in your leap and you go and you just
maintain<00:02:32.640> your<00:02:32.760> momentum<00:02:33.240> we<00:02:33.750> have<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.990> lean

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
maintain your momentum we have the lean

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.780 
maintain your momentum we have the lean
feature<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.770> allows<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.190> lean<00:02:35.370> out<00:02:35.400> and

working<00:02:39.510> with<00:02:39.540> animation<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.350> slide<00:02:40.590> it

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
working with animation is the slide it

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.920 
working with animation is the slide it
allows<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.670> get<00:02:41.970> somewhere<00:02:42.270> quickly<00:02:42.330> get

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
allows you to get somewhere quickly get

allows you to get somewhere quickly get
out<00:02:43.050> of<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.350> line<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:43.530> fire<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.190> at<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.640> same

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
out of the line of fire and at the same

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.550 
out of the line of fire and at the same
time<00:02:45.000> do<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.209> in<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.450> really<00:02:45.720> cool-looking<00:02:46.020> way

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
time do it in a really cool-looking way

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.250 
time do it in a really cool-looking way
we've<00:02:47.340> added<00:02:47.490> fluid<00:02:47.970> dynamics<00:02:48.480> interactive

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
we've added fluid dynamics interactive

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.190 
we've added fluid dynamics interactive
smoke<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.890> also<00:02:50.310> added<00:02:50.550> an<00:02:50.850> AI<00:02:51.060> system<00:02:51.330> to<00:02:52.050> it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
smoke and also added an AI system to it

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.040 
smoke and also added an AI system to it
so<00:02:52.560> we<00:02:52.709> have<00:02:52.920> fish<00:02:53.580> move<00:02:54.270> out<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.630> way<00:02:54.660> when

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
so we have fish move out of the way when

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.080 
so we have fish move out of the way when
you<00:02:55.140> get<00:02:55.290> close<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.709> them<00:02:55.830> there<00:02:56.370> Polly<00:02:56.550> counts

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
you get close to them there Polly counts

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.210 
you get close to them there Polly counts
