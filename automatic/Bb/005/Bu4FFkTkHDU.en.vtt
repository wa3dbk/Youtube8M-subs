 I tried installing java on my computer 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.400
 and an operating system does not support or 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.200
 I'll explain to you if you 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.939
 have a windows 7 there for you 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.490
 trying to install java on your computer 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.380
 you will probably visit this 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.270
 page here that I 'll be leaving 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.400

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.140
 Right this page you click here 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.110
 where is written the free download of the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.720
 and you automatically do the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.119
 there download the java application 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.460
 but what happens if you have the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.100
 windows 8 probably you will 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.950
 find some kind of impediment in the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.409
 path of the java installation, ie 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.450
 Do you have windows 8 or windows 8.1? 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.700
 Just as I'm showing that I'm 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.829

 What is the operating system in my case? 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.009
 I'm using windows 8 touch the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.619
 windows 8.1 own then you will see 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.190
 that the operating system is 64 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.200
 bits 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.700
 that is the time I went to install the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.470
 java application 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.470
 You'll realize that I'm going to have one. 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.560

 This is the pure footprint if you have 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.030
 difficulty sometimes you will not 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.010
