00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.870 

this<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.470> pretty<00:01:40.470> much<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> first<00:01:40.890> try

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
this is pretty much the first try

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:58.690 
this is pretty much the first try
I've<00:01:42.270> been<00:01:42.630> using<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:47.600> I<00:01:50.960> get<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.080> rhythm

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.910 

okay<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:01.310> all<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.460> primers<00:02:02.840> this<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.049> rigid

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.710 

some<00:02:07.920> improvements<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.700> made<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.239> can

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
some improvements that I made that can

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.680 
some improvements that I made that can
be<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.110> way<00:02:10.289> sometimes<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:15.120> primers<00:02:15.480> come

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
be that way sometimes the primers come

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.449 
be that way sometimes the primers come
out<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.989> front<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.500> that's<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.250> fact

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
out the front and that's just the fact

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.660 
out the front and that's just the fact
of<00:02:17.580> life<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:18.120> gonna<00:02:18.330> happen<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:20.310> can<00:02:20.459> put<00:02:20.640> a

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
of life it's gonna happen you can put a

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.009 
of life it's gonna happen you can put a
piece<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:21.000> straw<00:02:21.239> in<00:02:21.269> there<00:02:21.630> but<00:02:21.840> then<00:02:21.989> you

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
piece of straw in there but then you

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.590 
piece of straw in there but then you
can't<00:02:22.380> use<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.860> priming<00:02:23.760> tool<00:02:23.790> if<00:02:24.420> you're

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
can't use the priming tool if you're

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.130 
can't use the priming tool if you're
gonna<00:02:24.720> use<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:26.130> as<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.340> go<00:02:26.580> up<00:02:27.110> go<00:02:28.110> down

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
gonna use it so as you go up go down

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.509 
gonna use it so as you go up go down
pushes<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:30.769> pushes<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.920> show<00:02:32.130> out<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.459> you

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
pushes it pushes the show out and you

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:44.990 
pushes it pushes the show out and you
got<00:02:32.670> any<00:02:32.819> hit<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> little<00:02:33.450> bit<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:44.760> works

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
got any hit in a little bit it works

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.560 
got any hit in a little bit it works
pretty<00:02:45.269> well<00:02:45.390> however<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:47.060> was<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.299> little

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
pretty well however I was a little

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.960 
pretty well however I was a little
worried<00:02:48.900> when<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.140> first<00:02:49.470> put<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:49.799> on<00:02:49.970> because

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
worried when I first put it on because

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.590 
worried when I first put it on because
it<00:02:51.360> took<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:52.140> little<00:02:53.040> bit<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.579> adjusting<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.420> get

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
it took a little bit of adjusting to get

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.380 
it took a little bit of adjusting to get
it<00:02:54.720> just<00:02:54.900> right<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:58.310> but<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.340> think<00:02:59.430> I'm<00:03:00.150> gonna

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
it just right and but I think I'm gonna

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.460 
it just right and but I think I'm gonna
be<00:03:00.540> happy<00:03:00.720> with<00:03:00.959> it<00:03:01.519> if<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:02.700> get<00:03:02.880> one<00:03:03.470> don't

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
be happy with it if you get one don't

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.420 
be happy with it if you get one don't
get<00:03:04.829> frustrated<00:03:05.160> too<00:03:05.760> quickly<00:03:07.250> you<00:03:08.250> gotta

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
get frustrated too quickly you gotta

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
get frustrated too quickly you gotta
give<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:09.140> chance<00:03:10.140> now<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.040> only<00:03:11.640> see<00:03:11.760> clamped

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.550 
it on it's not firm but put in place I
thought<00:03:18.359> I<00:03:18.420> did<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:18.959> because<00:03:19.200> that<00:03:19.410> way<00:03:19.530> I

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
thought I did that because that way I

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:28.069 
thought I did that because that way I
can<00:03:19.709> get<00:03:20.070> an<00:03:20.190> idea<00:03:20.310> how<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:20.910> want<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:26.840> that's<00:03:27.840> it
