00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
yeah it's uh it was pretty fun build

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.580 
yeah it's uh it was pretty fun build
mm<00:01:58.619> got<00:01:59.189> like<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.969> said<00:02:00.210> there's<00:02:00.810> decals<00:02:01.350> for

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
mm got like I said there's decals for

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.709 
mm got like I said there's decals for
the<00:02:01.680> side<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> pinstriping<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.180> decided

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
the side like the pinstriping I decided

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.380 
the side like the pinstriping I decided
not<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.960> use<00:02:04.140> them<00:02:04.619> there<00:02:05.460> was<00:02:05.579> also<00:02:05.759> some<00:02:06.119> kind

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
not to use them there was also some kind

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.850 
not to use them there was also some kind
of<00:02:06.509> like<00:02:06.799> jaw<00:02:07.799> mouth<00:02:08.729> buckles<00:02:09.300> for<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.690> front

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
of like jaw mouth buckles for the front

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.370 
of like jaw mouth buckles for the front
I'm<00:02:11.130> not<00:02:11.310> gonna<00:02:11.490> use<00:02:11.640> them<00:02:11.880> either<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.480> thought

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
I'm not gonna use them either I thought

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.290 
I'm not gonna use them either I thought
it<00:02:13.500> looked<00:02:13.530> kind<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.980> cheesy<00:02:14.220> be<00:02:14.760> honest<00:02:15.120> with

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
it looked kind of cheesy be honest with

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.360 
it looked kind of cheesy be honest with
ya<00:02:16.310> not<00:02:17.310> too<00:02:17.520> much<00:02:17.700> detail<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.540> inside

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
ya not too much detail on the inside

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.950 
ya not too much detail on the inside
it's<00:02:20.370> really<00:02:20.580> hard<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.940> see<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.240> there<00:02:21.390> anyway

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
it's really hard to see in there anyway

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.690 
it's really hard to see in there anyway
but<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:24.630> know<00:02:24.720> I'm<00:02:24.960> gonna<00:02:25.110> probably<00:02:25.640> add<00:02:26.640> some
