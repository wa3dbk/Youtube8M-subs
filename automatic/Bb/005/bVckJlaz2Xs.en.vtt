00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.120
 new video of me 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.730
 My name is Change and I want you 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.980
 Today a super tasty strawberry milk 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.379
 Tart really show this very much 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.270
 fresh and easy, but you can too 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.029
 just plaster a bit more 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.590
 and yes as I have done that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.730
 I want to show you so much now 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.699
 fun while watching 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.070
 we start with a 123 with icahn for 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.390
 We share a portion of sugar 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.920
 butter and dispute parts need more 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.989
 First, the still cold butter comes in 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.450
 small pieces with the train in one 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.010
 bowl and must be mixed with kneading hook 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.940
 until the sugar is with the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.039
 After that, butter has mixed up 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.770
 girl cynicism continues to be mixed 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.360
 that a green mass is created and that 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.430
 whole is then roughly in the first 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.050
 bowl kneaded and then on 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.160
 the work surface so far a smooth 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.160
 dough gets out 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.950
 we'll pack the dough right away 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.170
 a bank of paper and dreaming nice 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.170
 even and especially thin 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.570
 then we are stuck with a cake ring 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.040
 a round circle and out of the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.930
 you can still rest then either 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.100
 Bake cookies or just in one 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.100
 Freeze breakfast loot 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.500
 the advertising circle then comes on 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.810
 baking tray and must first for 30 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.100
 minutes in the fridge and in the 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.280
 in the meantime, they prepare a lot 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.380
 buttermilk comfort for these needs 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.540
 her butter milk sugar fresh 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.550
 squeezed lemon juice a few 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.650
 fresh or frozen strawberries the 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.950
 small pieces would have to be cut 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.660
 cold cream and agar agar where you are too 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.760
 to fresh your means such as for example 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.500
 use circuit board can but I do 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.450
 the tortilla for us vegetarian 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.250
 Now start with the buttermilk from 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.530
 the three quarters of the amount in a pot 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.220
 must be filled and in the rest 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.890
 we have the commitment medium would 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.780
 here just after the instructions and 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.860
 we'll just watch it 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.840
 must now in the pot follow the sugar 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.060
 the rest of the buttermilk mixture and 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.739
 still the lemon juice and you have to 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.480
 then just boil again before 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.480
 then the heirlooms can do it 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.960
 the mass has to cool down for so long now 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.790
 until she slowly started to rehabilitate and 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.310
 then we will come back to ours 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.260
 heritage is ready chilled and is 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.540
 the line now with a fork small 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.250
 poke holes so that the dough then 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.940
 bake well evenly at the end 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.280
 then it can be done at 170 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.930
 degrees upper and lower heat for ten to fifteen 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.340
 minutes in the preheated oven with it 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.050
 for the cream, we still beat the 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.240
 cream stiff and if the buttermilk 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.280
 then cream has become firm or 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.890
 slowly you can fix that again 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.910
 mix briefly and then cream 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.440
 live under it 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.090
 that could be too quiet with one 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.680
 make whisk because the mass then 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.190
 in the fridge anyway completely solid 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.190
 becomes 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.070
 then I have the day before 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.680
 baked a bit of the ground from the 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.620
 diameter about 2 cm smaller than 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.270
 the amount should be or if 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.460
 her the other way market like me 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.410
 First make the bizkit bake here then 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.770
 her the short pastry just two later 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.690
 centimeters larger the recipe for left 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.740
 I also here once on the cake 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.540
 and I 'm fit in the infobox snack 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.010
 then cut into three soil and 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.650
 since I only have two for the strawberry pie 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.600
 was needed was the third first 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.230
 fresh foil packed and set aside 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.240
 posed 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.920
 then it could either be small 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.920
 making tartlets or cake pops 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.440
 because I have finished baked short crust pastry 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.330
 I cool down after all 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.360
 put pies cardboard and then with 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.140
 geothermal plant pocketed 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.060
 then you put the first 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.760
 tortenboden and now comes again 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.290
 the touring we use for yours 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.850
 Shortcrust pastry sets before you the ring 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.040
 must turn draws the first nor 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.020
 Baking paper strips are turned off 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.860
 so that the ring at the end also easy 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.860
 can be removed again 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:40.960
 I still have the first layer biscuit 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.819
 once with some strawberry jam 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.060
 and then it comes on 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:47.319
 half of buttermilk cream and that 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.909
 then you have to be even with it 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.530
 a spoon pass with it 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:54.000
 Cream then up to the edge too 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.000
 comes down shortcrust 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.970
 Here is now carefully the second 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:08.740
 Biscuit and the rest of the 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.099
 buttermilk cream can be spread on it 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.099
 become 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.690
 I still have something for the topping 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.190
 strawberry jam warmed in a pot 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.320
 so that the expertise's just something 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.240
 becomes more fluid and then I have that 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.870
 Carefully and with little pressure on the 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.460
 Crimea distributed now the pie still needs 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.290
 for at least three hours in the 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.810
 fridge and ready is the strawberry 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.180

 slightly fresh and with a few strawberries 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.470
