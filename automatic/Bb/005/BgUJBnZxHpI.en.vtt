00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:05.830
 in fact it is an animal essentially trait since the air the day the 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.619
 most of the time he sleeps in the countries mentioned 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:12.289
 or even in a rocky slope often 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:14.519
 in any case it takes vegetation 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.659
 but seldom mentioned discovered near the border for example 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.560
 and yet often 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.060
 it also varies depending on the season but 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.060
 an hour or two before sunset 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.239
 past 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.920
 and this is often also when the three are the most active 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.900
 that May 25 hunting 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.870
 visit 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.050
 an opportunist 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.670
 as for those who write by hand 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.870
 to be interested in what he meets most of the time 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.400
 loving its main 3% makes its only equivalent e meet most often 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.400
 so here in the jura this tactics most often use two days 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.140
 backward 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.250
 maybe higher on the high-vienne for example its own as well 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.820
 spoke the chamois 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.630
 here it is not the case since one did not pronounce between them between capture 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.080
 a big cross 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.310
 equivalent to the size or would be so it can be a I am a month 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.840
 even a button 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.970
 so between them these two captures life can sometimes happen 4 e 5 days 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.450
 even more than a week to 1 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.450
 with the telemetry it has already been demonstrated 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.200
 the meetings in this period 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.150
 we do not really know what the 26 sleeves of necessarily eat something so 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.730
 it's possible when came kassem henry who settle for small rodents 2 of 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.600
 the bird of the folding lapointe a hearty the device of the portuguese 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.600
 represented here 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.140
 so here we are tracing his trail mans 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.090
 why not at the end of the road the discovery of its prey 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.389
 here in the voice better 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:16.389
 that's done 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.029
 it's an imprint the afld 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.179
 the snow the lakes below is a mark of end of 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:24.179
 last night 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.839
 of troy 4 school 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.279
 well spaced from each other 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:30.909
 training counts 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.370
 and why not an interesting criterion for the lynx footprint and 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.759
 dissymmetry 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:38.759
 if your it's like that right m 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.909
 in the middle of their imprint 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.519
 you do not really have the same thing on both sides of the right it's 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.229
 that dissymmetry exactly like when you look at your hand 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:51.199
 m 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:53.359
 I did not have 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.779
 perfect symmetry 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.779
 and that's what allows years in addition to increase 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.339
 this trace so there is a paste 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.959
 we go there we see that m 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.239
 but a little ledge 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.300
 he hijacks the climbs on the small ledge 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:21.239
 but here so he leaves him again to join Toulon throughout 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.129
 this part of his journey is there 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.219
 it allowed him to have a point of view in the slope 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:30.939
 - and what he tried like that to spot a prey to a cauldron that 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.939
 found at the bottom 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:37.959
 I remember once today I was at the afp 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:43.019
 has not had a foot for a long time after a while I started 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.949
 hear the stones then you want to cgt and so installed down a 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:49.869
 career in less than an hour 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:51.529
 once the nuclear 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:55.469
 in fact these two pilots they came back like that play and their game of 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:58.839
 line pinball to work with pats before stones 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:03.869
 boileau of the quarry to watch them fall but it caused small 

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:04.939
 wrecked 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.749
 quebec the bulls had ended there at the worst comment she was it was a game 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.759
 like that for two hours they stayed there 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:15.769
 this is added like that and bring down the stones in a career 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.029
 cps all along a road 

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:21.029
 of course nobody is 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.689
 so that's the growth 

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:27.789
 apparently here it's hard to discern with this little powder and 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.409
 snow that fell there 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:33.209
 but she must go back the probably dance that is felt as above 

00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:35.270
 there is another way with 33 cents 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.319
 it may be appropriate to make a rather methodical survey of the place 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.090
 woerth but sometimes it's been a while 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.909
 We see it 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:00.909
 we must continue 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.729
 nicolas dehon quietly 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.729
 jt at the top of the cliff watching us pass 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.710
 it will not bother me that's what's pretty fabulous 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.029
 she is an animal 

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:20.839
 sector 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:23.749
 not even if we never see him before 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:25.779
 we can always tell ourselves 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:27.960
 nine in the head squared 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.400
 I observed
