00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:15.459
 and this sound that will be 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.460
 that sounds at his age admit to see that 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:21.070
 such partners as you are and another that 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.810
 involved in the little birds nice fuck 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.779
 again with elite to see what tired 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.579
 that you are not what is happening is that 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.189
 you know that I like to upload gameplays 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:33.010
 commented on the live is depends on 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.830
 how they come out but comments on 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.710
 I like to do things that where 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:42.339
 can talk about an interesting topic 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.600
 eye that I give a pineapple was calm 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.600
 it was being tested a little 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.160
 shock absorbers of the defender and in this 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.859
 example I tell you we were a 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.949
 departure in channels were I or I 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:56.739
 hello me or how are we and we were 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.629
 playing the first bases was a while 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.010
 standing for a while in a helicopter making a 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.960
 little fool was not playing very 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.390
 concentrated not the truth is that it is 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.950
 doing a good game but in this 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.280
 base is already complicating things 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.539
 because there was a level 59 a colonel 59 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:17.140
 thousand 859 eyes shot the flares but 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.350
 nothing happens and I win the tuna looking for 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.159
 prim 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.250
 in search of one of public green 0 and 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:30.229
 attention because I say 432 not calm 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.810
 that now I'm saved, no, no, no, it's not 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.880
 something is an epic fail and one what you 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.890
 I was commenting I was doing a 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.170
 departure in channels that had started 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.080
 more or less well the first two bases 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.049
 and without many problems typical departure 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.780
 what was already the last of 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.070
 done I think it was the last of the night 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.780
 but we came to this third base the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.220
 thing was getting very complicated because 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.090
 the 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:00.100
 Tunguska boy controlled pretty 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:03.380
 as I said a 59 controlled a lot and 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:07.010
 our team like that it scared a 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.130
 little and while johnny was trying to do 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.000
 his work at ground level I tried 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.410
 since from heaven bother a little and 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.730
 Keep the toulouse a bit entertaining 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.500
 for what happens is that you already know that 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.100
 Being one is always a bit 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.250
 complicated and this will be the moral if you 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.700
 you fix and there are only 28 tickets left 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.230
 through the flares gives me again 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.970
 inexplicably they were already going twice 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.690
 they fired the flares when he fired 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.580
 and he gave me and he killed me here is the level 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.790
 59 as I said is the same as before 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.090
 before it had not gone well to the second 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.820
 there were no results and the thing was 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.130
 getting pretty ugly because in these 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.400
 moments now well obviously I am 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.980
 cutting some parts 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.930
 because what I want is for you to see a 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.379
 little the most important thing in these moments 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.860
 I leave with the little bay 12 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:05.890
 tickets right now 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.950
 give you time will not give the time anymore 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.180
 we will see here I will not even tell me look 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.970
 tried below there's no way to 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:19.600
 can enter what we do I say look 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.960
 put yourself in engineer and you come to repair 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.150
 I loaded myself to the tuna search first 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.600
 and then I'll try to go for the 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.170
 charge that give seven eyes 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.390
 I do not even become an engineer that I know 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.150
 many many call me normal man 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.810
 it takes those people repairing you that I do not know 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.490
 what that being selfish I do not know how many 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.480
 Well I have shown you that before without 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:49.480
 people repairing eye 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.120
 albert lasker and a dog and I wanted it 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.420
 I wanted to dodge worth third assault you 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.030
 I was looking for 20 new earning 20 in this 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.310
 game third assault the me from before me 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.990
 he fixed it before he shot it now yes that 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.450
 works the flares start to give 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.510
 estopa yes if you shoot that now I have 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.010
 a boy engineer and you're going to shit 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.710
 Uncle is starting to get a little 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.950
 five tickets are left only for 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.440
 lose no 6 to lose the game on 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.920
 Uncle comes out of your search the shit or kill him 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:25.330
 left your search that rot there and I say 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.670
 I did not leave and throw yourself there in plan plan 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.490
 suicidal for the load that I clean the 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.190
 rest I do not even throw attentive is going to put 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.020
 the load there is putting it I try 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.000
 kill this one could not at the end be it 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.740
 They load jon made like a clay marc 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.420
 inexplicably before there had not been 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.030
 eaten those that were there next 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.640
 all die, only I was left trying 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.020
 that defend begin to throw me and all 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.840
 the missiles and everything they have 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.050
 enemies I keep shooting I did not see a 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.669
 shit everything was dust I look like I think 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.530
 there's nothing I shot because I was 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.479
 firing me or saying no no it goes up that 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.610
 I'm repairing two enemies appear 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.139
 beware that under this abuse the 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.289
 boy that runs over you we had passed 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:08.349
 the moral base 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.719
 if you have to repair a little birds if 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:14.050
 someone on the team has to provide a 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:17.420
 little is provided because this at the end 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:21.050
 it has its reward 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.730
 You have already seen between 2 and a little 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.050
 help from the guiris who were out there 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:29.650
 next we have caught the base we have 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.650
 made a strategy 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.419
 I would have flown more to hear it live 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.370
 clear because because like that we 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.759
 we got a little excited about plans we've already 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.340
 past I do not know who it is as such 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:45.190
 good here a car that the poor car 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:48.220
 the cars is that it has nothing that you 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:51.099
 Look for me to get my back if a tuna 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.710
 look for you caught unprepared 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:57.810
 the best thing is to go up yesterday you have to accept 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:02.379
 that you can crush and look a little 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:04.900
 again the advantage here the uncle had it 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:07.870
 done very very well and I knew if he had gone 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.979
 still further back I was surprised but 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:14.259
 I could save thanks to the building this one 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:16.120
 it was coming from pearls the exercise and 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:18.699
 all these berries that are here because 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.460
 look eye I stay here so pancho me 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:23.500
 pulled out the cocacola now I pulled the 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.840
 blanket of the potatoes I hope that it 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.280
 arrange of subject is your car let her 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.800
 come in to be that I do not want what 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.370
 bother salt to desserts less 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.249
 and nothing and the boys team 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.469
 would be 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:40.409
 removed the fear from above they had seen 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:43.229
 that the tuna search had already disappeared 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:45.589
 A bit of the map here marked me a flight 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:45.589
 flush 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.280
 I can assure you that this live 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:53.370
 it was in web plan 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.560
 I thought it was very nice but 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.990
 I went up a couple of things to the 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:03.330
 throat here the tuna looks for we have already 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:05.580
 as 21 is worth here we are going to tie the 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.530
 because I get off because I already 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.200
 be trained remember low flights 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:13.560
 short flights that we can not aim and 

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:18.120
 we finish the game winning moraleja 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:20.610
 again in battlefield the little help 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.100
 that you can give him or the help he can 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.440
 lend to your partner always comes from 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.840
 pearls 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.960
 there are few tickets left, nothing happens 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.790
 better keep a cool head and think 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.220
 something if you have to go insane it goes to 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:37.770
 crazy but always thinking a little rock 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.810
 the steps the steps first good that 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:44.070
 we had an uncle of the time that was 38 

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:45.830
 9 but of course I do believe that 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:48.840
 if it were not for the last 

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.700
 maneuver that we did not have 

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.130
 I've already told you, not on our part 

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.650
 it was not a brilliant game but it was very 

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.960
 effective 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:00.139
 I do not know I ended up quite happy and 

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.820
 I think it's a game that gives 

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:03.800
 pretty example and that shows quite 

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:07.340
 the subject that I say of repairing of not 

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:10.190
 repair how good that is there is 

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:12.560
 good for the computer and well used 

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.810
 here the enemies if well said and everything 

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.680
 but good nothing else until later guys 

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.680
 until another video
