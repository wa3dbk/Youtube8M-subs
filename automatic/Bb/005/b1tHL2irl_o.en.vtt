00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.029
 The reasons for the story was one of my favorites. 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.480
 cartoons watched him being quite 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.259
 small 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.049
 this is probably the first foreign cartoon 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:13.159
 what I saw 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:15.409
 showed him on the train channel and if 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:17.359
 honestly that time is nothing but the first 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:18.820
 version and I can not remember 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.529
 although perhaps just Anton TV 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:21.890
 I didn't catch anything else 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.779
 during which was rich in all sorts 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.590
 interesting characters but more 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.289
 all did not like brothers 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:27.899
 darts 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.219
 I remember that in my childhood I didnâ€™t impress that 

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:32.619
 At the beginning of the cartoon screensaver is boring 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.670
 A number of money was admired by the fact that 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.690
 that he is rich in what floats in coins 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.550
 always wanted to also try 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.190
 on the stand owning part of this 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.960
 great game in london longtime 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.920
 time I was sure that there are 3 of them and because 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.400
 the first part of the novel pirates 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.740
 I had a third 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.650
 the essence of the game is traveling around 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.480
 the world and the quest for treasure 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.059
 we are to visit Africa 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.329
 pennsylvania himalayas on amazon 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.310
 and even romania 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.290
 level you can choose and take place in any 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.630
 sequences it is pleasant that locations 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.780
 he is not a friend 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.830
 a maze that allows 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.700
 examine in more detail hopein these 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.270
 secret jewels 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.210
 In general, this game is very richly different 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.710
 editions did not become and so 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.970
 become the richest drakes in the world 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.040
 will have to find two secret treasures 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.010
 the levels will also be periodically 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.710
 meet obstacles for example 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.080
 the forests of the Amazon will require 300 thousand 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.530
 babenko deflated 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.230
 although I never paid them 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.330
 I will have to look for a way 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.610
 order to call a robot which 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.700
 will help to break through the passage sometimes even 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.980
 will have to come back from 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.520
 one level previous to 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.910
 take some key 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.670
 this will help us zigzag he always 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.390
 ready to pick us up level on your own 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.180
 strange flying machine 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.380
 of weapons we have canes using 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.780
 which is possible with both catechins 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.860
 regional slaves above destroy them 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.240
 true in the Himalayas with its use 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.780
 will have to wait so as not to fail 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.410
 all not 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.310
 also can be used as 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.680
 stick and run some amount of work 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.480
 which is 120 km from the place 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.340
 after a serious threat not 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.590
 represents speaking of complexity 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.619
 pskov whole except 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.130
 some moments are pretty simple 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.310
 summing up I will say that I loved very much 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.229
 this game in childhood and precisely because on 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.899
 upcoming tv channel atmosphere 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.930
 cartoon and was just as interesting and 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.840
 fascinatingly suffering could 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.510
 turn on the game and wonder from 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.399
 seen so now 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:19.279
 interesting new generation of coaches 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:20.869
 experienced something like what we 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:22.109
 tested 90 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.049
 on this perhaps you can finish 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.529
 all the best of luck
