00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.599
 so many questions are asked 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.759
 often looking for that recipe 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.099
 miraculous for this or that 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.619
 special situation of snow or 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.720
 land or equipment a little 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.909
 impossible that you bet available 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.690
 managing to respond to all of these 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:43.879
 questions 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.890
 we prefer darwin and inputs for 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.130
 to give you the chance to try 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.560
 of the things that 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.900
 can be a contribution to building 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.690
 solid technical bases for yours 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.910
 skiing convinced that then the adaptations 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.710
 if you have solid bases be it 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.630
 some things that come a little on their own 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.230
 also nice to go go to 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.960
 look for and then maybe confront 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.030
 do not hesitate, however, to write me valerio 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.680
 snail jam session punto.it be me 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.170
 personally if my colleagues jam 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.690
 session we can give you all directly 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.990
 the answers of the believer and the answers of the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.990
 field 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.240
 let's see now slowly 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.600
 elements of this design are on a 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.539
 slope it is important to learn to 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.820
 visualize to imagine the spaces that 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:43.510
 we will travel e 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.330
 and it is important to begin to understand 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.490
 which parts are the phases of the curve 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.430
 we can imagine a very corridor 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.909
 wide one narrower one even more 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.820
 normally skiers tight what 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.310
 they start fast and close a little 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.130
 the curves with very trajectories 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.060
 very streamlined we try very slowly 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.270
 to exercise to round off well 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.270
 the curves going to touch what is 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.920
 the bordeaux once right a lot 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.140
 to the left of our corridor 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.870
 the mechanism is the same in wide curves 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.030
 in medium curves or in short curves 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.950
 what are the parts of the curve la 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.890
 we can consider the curve divided into 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.330
 three parts a first third a second 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.459
 third and a third third if we go back to the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.170
 previous curve 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:42.970
 the third third is a phase of abandonment 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.420
 of this curve to the right for 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.940
 the entrance in the curve to the left then 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.780
 this plus this are pretty much one 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.209
 preparation for this area than the area 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.060
 strong of this curve to the left and the 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.310
 important area where we should be 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.730
 in perfect balance and with an action 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.940
 really dynamic and also powerful for 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:11.909
 then at this point having solved the curve 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.909
 and leave in the opposite direction 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.050
 we talked about the spaces and it is a lot 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.450
 very important to visualize oneself 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.660
 corridor within which to stay in this 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.610
 in this case this is an execution 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.470
 at the short radius then corridors 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.840
 rather narrow it corresponds more or less 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.810
 to the trace of a snowcat e 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.030
 here we see it highlighted by the graphic 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.570
 anyway having in mind what it is 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.010
 the width of land to occupy 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.690
 you automatically put this space 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.350
 in relation to the speed of 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.480
 progress and begin to rhythm 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.850
 inside therefore giving to the work of the 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.170
 our body to muscle tension 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:55.270
 that alternation that leads us to 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.190
 perform a well-coordinated gesture in 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.740
 proportion to the space that we are 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.280
 we see it here in a space 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.620
 wider then wider corridor e 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.360
 we will also see highlighted here by 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.400
 graphic just to the extent of this 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.380
 corridor with the two demonstrators who 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.350
 I am one to lick one side 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.150
 on the other side, this is the space 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:21.760
 busy that also gives us a reference 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.960
 clear for the executive smi times 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.110
 see here 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.440
 oriano rigamonti in a short range 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.030
 still here we have highlighted with the 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.440
 graphic importance also of the 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.100
 direction of 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.780
 of the look because clearly if we 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.040
 let us look forward as a certain one 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.230
 advance we have possibility of 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.300
 better plan our action e 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.250
 the occupation of spaces here we see 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.370
 a reduction in space to a corridor 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.510
 narrower even if only for two 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.910
 curves to then return to expand it 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.340
 space the space occupied is the beauty of 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.360
 of sherlock is to vary 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:04.350
 frequently with little as if it were a 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.350
 change of pace in a dance 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.440
 we see one on the same ground now 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:38.490
 descent of davide cervini descent a 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.700
 rather sustained speed with gods 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:45.060
 rhythm changes 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:47.790
 here he is David and on this snow that 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.450
 rather soft we are at noon in 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:53.430
 rather spring snow pope is 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.470
 clearly the technique is always here 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.650
 that obviously the sensitivity of the 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.940
 skier trying to understand the 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.660
 soil texture is what it does 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:06.120
 then the difference is good adaptation 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.000
 so I would say that there is no technique 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.970
 particular to answer how many me 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.490
 they ask how it is on snow 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.680
 spring soft there is no technique 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.480
 particular the coordination gestures 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.990
 are always those obviously there is one 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.870
 muscle tension management 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:29.070
 different and it is very important to succeed 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:31.440
 to visually evaluate the terrain that 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.170
 we have to try to foresee 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.900
 what could be the answer 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:40.320
 precisely of the terrain to our support e 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:43.710
 consequently adjust the intensity of the 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.170
 of our of our snow effort 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.060
 fresh very important here too 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:51.450
 space management have the ideas 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.550
 clear of very clear ideas on the rhythm from 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:58.680
 keep the most important thing 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:07:02.460
 rhythm and preparation of the stick for 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.560
 at all costs, respect the times 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.139
 executive smi and come up with 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:10.530
 curve readiness with the stick 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:13.289
 that at every bend must prepare with a 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.360
 good advance because without the 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:18.360
 stick preparation at the moment 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.449
 right it is very difficult to have the good ones 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.449
 balances
