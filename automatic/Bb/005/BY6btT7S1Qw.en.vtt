00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.080
 hi to all and nice big gamer is to 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.379
 orders today of what's going to be 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.240
 the best class of weapons at the ASM in 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.070
 weeks laye and these objects 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.750
 particularly formidable 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.699
 in the first episode I had you 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.420
 already talked about the 27 ball that was 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.310
 patched meanwhile arms that's enough 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.109
 overpowered leash and mun where the asm 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.570
 call it anyway 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.480
 in passing is clearly we will say the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.450
 smg that has been increased but which 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.540
 corresponds we will say alarm which is the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.309
 more versatile the deadliest the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.930
 more used also on the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.789
 multiplayer why do you do that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.070
 precisely a video a lot of 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.199
 people still do not adopt we're gonna 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.090
 say good combinations with sem i 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.070
 fast present throwing gameplay and 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.109
 even the hour gameplay it matters little 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.989
 it's a very rush gameplay very nervous 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.019
 to illustrate my bath simply 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.970
 no accessories that I will use 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.560
 even though this gameplay dates from there are very 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.900
 long shauna bull too much to you the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.010
 propose anyway so she classifies it 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.100
 she will appear on the screen 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.560
 here you see it especially 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.580
 I advise you to quickly do it anyway 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.500
 unlock the challenges to get the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.880
 ergotherapist handle and hand very 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.830
 often to win his duel 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.840
 it's the person opposite do not use it 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.210
 not also why because the first 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.400
 drop allows to enter instantly 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.920
 in his viewfinder is also to make 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.750
 drop shots as instant but 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.439
 also to be very fair so 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.299
 instant 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.090
 then you also see in this game it's 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.649
 there that I used the laser sight which 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.780
 allows you to have a very very good shot 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.680
 to the vigil is not necessarily put in my 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.899
 class because a lot of 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.850
 combinations are possible in Cairo 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.259
 but if you galley that thiro judge for 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.290
 to know that the rites rayol was obliged 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.329
 on adventures would not necessarily be pretty 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.939
 I strongly advise you and 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.520
 especially from so-called 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.159
 the heavy truck on the cox 2 may on 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.480
 advanced warfare the advanced stripes that 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.340
 is a truck that allows cassava 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.380
 mounted both the scope but it's 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.730
 also to increase from 1 even 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.820
 maybe two notches and I'm not saying 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.470
 nonsense the damage of a png it takes 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.640
 know that it's very important these are 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.740
 men who are mainly 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.450
 used in close combat we need 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.370
 sometimes damage including mid 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.710
 distance especially when they point a 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.810
 good shoot you still need a sacred 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.320
 pack of bullets to kill even if you 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.900
 know you're hungry and we're going to say lls 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.730
 does not mean she is she 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.900
 clearly above the lot I have not 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.550
 afraid to say it I'm telling you clearly 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.990
 to say if it's one of the souls that's the 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.550
 more used than it is on the multi 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.780
 but also other kinds is 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.580
 that's because it's a weapon that 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.740
 is above the lot sometimes you cross 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.600
 of maps of really very far you 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.430
 can put if you are a good game very little 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.500
 of bullets and you can kill the person in 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.640
 question that's what I had to 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.410
 advise you so I'll talk about the 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.030
 panier god the advanced stripes for 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.620
 increase your reach but also 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.690
 your damage I spoke to you 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.030
 possibly laser aiming what 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.640
 I have to offer you normally I 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.870
 torremila cross the worry being it's 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.650
 for people who do not necessarily have a 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.080
 very good shoot 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.820
 they are not used to rhinestones do 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.950
 steps aside for those who would not 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.600
 not understood I wanted to started for 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.360
 the players a little more nervous in the 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.100
 rush that make a lot of duels in 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.470
 strategic point and that's for example 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.790
 their domination at war of the remains that 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.950
 know they're going to make a tale of 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.600
 a check very often but the cross 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.830
 test there and tell me what you think 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.510
 frankly it's a dinguerie 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.550
 if not personally I do not have 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.230
 absolutely no need perso I put the 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.730
 large cape loader that gives me I 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.380
 think more than forty kim of 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.540
 bullets that meant that shaikh a 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.800
 improved version of the asm one a 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.870
 improved version that everyone 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.880
 unlocks without exception to the leash is 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.550
 my skill if I say no nonsense 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.290
 I did not get an elite sm this 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.640
 that I find very often on the multi 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.260
 besides chew a big fish 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.550
 saw that I stopped prestige is 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.709
 currently you see you dream of 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.180
 prestige 8 and that it does not hurt to 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.070
 time I have not played at call of duty 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.080
 by the way, you have to know a 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:06.010
 thing is that I have a lot of 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.110
 gameplay attempt d na vicious arfa 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.150
 sometimes succeeds I miss you 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.690
 propose I do not necessarily ask 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.209
 gameplay 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.560
 how to explain this adema and that's 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.970
 I sometimes ask yourself just the gameplay 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.530
 because I want to 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.820
 even if it's the same facts 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.079
 I was block of bloodthirsty but if 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.790
 I liked the Belgian gameplay you the 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.040
 post it it was absolutely necessary that I 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.240
 tell you about the finery it takes 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.250
 to know one thing is that you can 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.010
 play even without light weight this test 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.630
 1800 smg you will be very fast and very 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.990
 fluid in temouchent of consequence of 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.610
 put it 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.580
 if you're not used to it, that's fine 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.230
 allow for much more research 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.610
 freely and quickly if we can say 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.400
 that way you'll be more agile what 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.290
 I put down profile of course the fact 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.540
 is that we get too easily the 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.860
 drones with if we will say this ability 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.600
 to put the support that's why I 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.270
 played low profile I advise you 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.190
 also of lato m that allows you to do 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.080
 not appear the movements of his 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.140
 exoskeleton especially for a very very 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.490
 big rauscher nervous and his accounts the 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.490
 rhin through you put on gameplay when 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.050
 even stealthy and robust impulses that 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.470
 allows you to not work during a 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.380
 duel 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.360
 it is particularly interesting 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.620
 especially on large maps or maps 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.790
 crisis and that has a lot of corridor 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.340
 middle distance etc 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.860
 for small maps with a weapon 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.990
 like the asm one you can clearly time 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.970
 pass and robustness sets to a good 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.919
 shoot and that you shoot often first 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.690
 on the opponents have heard the good 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.460
 cause is also for something 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.169
 I would advise you to put impulse 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.650
 on 10 cities and then after me I 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.750
 already made very big gameplay with 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.010
 apple are stealthy and stone whatever 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.280
 in all that's all I had to you 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.450
 say 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.310
 I would like to ask you a little 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.510
 question just before the end of precisely 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.760
 this episode you want you I 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.350
 continues these condensed versions of 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.570
 gtech so the best place of arms 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.130
 with a lot of other weapons do you count 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.900
 to make men exclusively that 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.550
 I appreciate the game huh as lee is 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.090
 mother leaves night eventually 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.590
 some 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.850
 I do not want to do all the 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.500
 panoply of requests on earth even though 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.180
 it is a beautiful I miss of time 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.770
 sorely sadly or if you 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.500
 want me to resume the gt that since 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.000
 the beginning with basel 27 aka pods this 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.160
 abstract art all the weapons that ge has 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.010
 played there Eric and cnr are worth 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.330
 really blow tell me that there will be 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.979
 two comments in space 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.030
 comment so either tech jets be 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.620
 you continue to a wall classes of weapons 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.449
 anyway but witnesses max the 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.069
 legacy why 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.990
 those big 17 for the second episode the 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.219
 sea ​​arms classes at the ASM in charles 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.539
 logan forget lay people and that makes me 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:21.809
 extremely pleasure for work 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.370
 provided 

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:25.370
 charley wider range and attic
