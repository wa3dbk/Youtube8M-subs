00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.280
 my name is armin obert i do that 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.380
 pr management for zeiss and me 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.779
 present here today the 18 x 54 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.119
 victory ht binoculars an absolute 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.770
 optical revolution two years ago 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.460
 we have the victory ht binoculars 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.430
 presented as 8 and 10 times 42 since then 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.160
 we are again the world record holder in 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.190
 things brightness of binoculars us 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.190
 realize a transmission of 95 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.930
 percent absolute world record the only one 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.979
 what was missing in this line were 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:46.589
 large lens diameter our 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:48.610
 Developers are right from the start 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.760
 54 millimeter objective diameter 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.640
 gone because we have that concept 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.610
 which is so bright that we are not 56 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.350
 millimeters mean 56 millimeters 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.350
 lens diameter must realize 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.010
 We can save weight because we have 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.110
 the ht concept of shotshop is part of the 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.910
 foundation company we have however 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.760
 king prism systems on the highest 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:16.660
 level we can maximum transmission 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.280
 coat the project we have with 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.500
 us in the house with a set 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.830
 summarized our project was a 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.190
 to build binoculars which is brighter than 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.290
 every classic 856 but as easy as 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.700
 a 50s and we did that and 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.270
 thereby a new class of binoculars 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.850
 created 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.370
 because we are talking about 20 percent here 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.830
 weight savings and 20 percent that 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.040
 means 200 grams and that is their 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.930
 Neck feel this night is glass 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.180
 Perfect for the night but you can 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.680
 In addition, they can use it 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.810
 Use it on the stalk or even 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.740
 abroad because it's so easy though 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.659
 brighter than any classic 856 me 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.159
 wish all users out there in the 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.659
 field all hunters much waidmannsheil 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.450
 have fun watching 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.159
