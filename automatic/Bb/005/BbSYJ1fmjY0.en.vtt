00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 a new action thriller with liam neeson 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.670
 expected us mid april in the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.480
 German cinemas and that's it now 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:31.969

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:35.910
 No, I'm not a boy looking killed 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.210
 I never killed it because I had to 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.309
 do 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:44.730
 He wanted to shoot my son 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.360

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.360
 behind your family 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.120
 I was the only what the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.739
 opportunity 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.910
 that was over when you were my son 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.570
 killed you can not help it 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.370
 do 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.790
 I say the boy with all means 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.790
 that I have 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.350
 when it is over I will be in the 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.360
 eyes look like you now in me 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.750
 Eyes see and then I will the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.270
 see blank look if it is not so 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.840
 gives more and then I leave you 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.850
 to die 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:31.920
 I'll do anything to Michael 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:34.080
 protect you can never push off 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.170
 Do you hear when you do it you are not 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:41.240
 better than me the people after him 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.240
 home and family of his wife 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.080
 bring to china 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.370
 drink coffee harding six cups 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.500
 the day since 30 years 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.830
 Take more sugar today 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.830
 a long night 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:02.229
 I have you have frank dead in the u 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.640
 letting go of a train I thought he was doing 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.640
 I'm ready, too 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.090
 a night to clarify the 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.090
 one night 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.760
 and wherever we go if we have this 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.870
 cross a border 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.870
 we go together 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.060
 Ronald toured and 14 minutes from 16 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.430
 years and starts from the 60th 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.500
 april 2015 in German cinemas 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.330
 tells the story of Jimmy he was 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.340
 once a great professional killer in the 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.290
 Underworld they called him the dead grave 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.790
 By now he has come in the years 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.440
 and it lapses on the alcohol 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.700
 He is currently fit for family events 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.860
 even worse than right 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.300
 Drunken Santa Claus at least 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.100
 almost one of the first scene inside 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.600
 the film but its deep and tight 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.260
 friendship with the former partner 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.020
 and still very successful 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.790
 on the way his gangsta played by ed 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.320
 harris is at least one of the constant ones 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.240
 in his life and his love for his 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.680
 son to whom we hardly a bond 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.450
 One day it comes to one 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.880
 fateful incident at the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.950
 jimi this so the son of his former 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.510
 kills friend and that is clearly revenge 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.459
 must also in the former gangster world 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.989
 therefore, and that means jimmy's son 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.940
 believe it himself but he wants that 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.130
 not warm and that's the name of a laugh 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.810
 be hunted and try to be long 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.610
 to protect a child that then results 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.050
 action thriller in which the im 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.520
 to face harris for the next moment 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.110
 ed harris also a damn cool 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.430
 actor but that means the whole 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.590
 of course a lot of weapons 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.269
 Ballerei action and chases 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.010
 and there you have to say honestly, liam 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.630
 Neeson has been in this genre for years 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.459
 no longer indispensable but that means 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.260
 Also that the movies are almost a bit 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.060
 how assembly line work is so tron 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.230
 light definitely not a bad movie 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.459
 but also nothing new 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.230
 especially not for the next 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.570
 Strip the camera in many moments 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.190
 it is reasonably imaginative 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.540
 implemented and the dialogues are also here 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.610
 and really bubbly 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.110
 and different but the whole action 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.519
 made way to hand but you have 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.220
 simply to punish like the equalizer 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.570
 or john tripp or just the raid movie 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.519
 just let the feeling of life 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.900
 again and again the same films with 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.670
 delivers different action and 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.019
 while the first two parts still 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.730
 very cool then I found so the last 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.620
 like peace in peace or tekken three 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.450
 Not really good at all nonstop 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.700
 still a good exception 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.169
 freeloader joins somewhere in the 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.359
 Gray zone should mean one 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.010
 who relatively rarely goes to the cinema and 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.570
 Action thriller in general already likes to leave 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.250
 and co may not have looked in the 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.330
 moment definitely look wasted 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.820
 not at the time even if the film 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.260
 ticking has become too lengthy with 114 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.729
 minutes and back out and dizzy 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.500
 makes where I say to myself, would not be 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.230
 have reinvented had the 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.400
 gruesome means for me all office 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.690
 end you do not have to see them in the cinema 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.550
 you can do it on blu 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.720
 ray dvd looks at home too 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.730
 you do not see him anything big 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.470
 missed means he is ok he is 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.210
 acceptable and gets from me as 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.100
 action thriller then six and a half by 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.930
 ten possible points total 1 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.300
 gray zone movie five and a half out of 10 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.920
 possible points overall after or 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.510
 which probably no hair fight back 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.530
 a few weeks later it will crow and 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.240
 I was a bit like that then 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.620
 disappointed because I liked the trailer 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.000
 The film then lets in a bit 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.350
 wish you some of the coolest 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.700
 are unfortunately already trailer 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.790
 burned and with it me too 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.440
 my review on from 16 april in 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.700
 Germans like to read a thumb 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.620
 because if this video made 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.730
 Do not let us know otherwise 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.140
 There are still a few left around me 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.540
 around and tomorrow at 15 o'clock, of course 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.920
 at the latest a new video until then 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.900
 I hope you are with us again 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.900
 of course at 3
