00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
there's a 50 paise team so obviously 50

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.410 
there's a 50 paise team so obviously 50
paise<00:01:14.189> or<00:01:14.340> less<00:01:14.490> bronze<00:01:14.909> team<00:01:15.180> pretty

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
paise or less bronze team pretty

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.660 
paise or less bronze team pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:16.130> longshot<00:01:17.130> team<00:01:17.430> and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
self-explanatory longshot team and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.760 
self-explanatory longshot team and
basically<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.900> take<00:01:19.170> long<00:01:19.470> shots

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
basically you have to take long shots

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.679 
basically you have to take long shots
from<00:01:19.890> outside<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> box<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.150> take<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.420> shot

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
from outside the box if you take a shot

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.050 
from outside the box if you take a shot
inside<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.470> box<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.920> an<00:01:23.100> own<00:01:23.220> goal<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.700> even

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
inside the box it's an own goal so even

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.490 
inside the box it's an own goal so even
if<00:01:24.150> doesn't<00:01:24.360> go<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.750> it's<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.259> shot

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
if doesn't go in and it's just a shot

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.320 
if doesn't go in and it's just a shot
