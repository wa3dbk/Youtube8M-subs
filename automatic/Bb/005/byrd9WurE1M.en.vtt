00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.400
 here it was jorge restoration're restoring 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.799
 a table 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.260
 that same round table she was all over 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.540
 damaged but the person who 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.210
 I would make service look how it is 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.029
 it's under her underneath it 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.640
 Connect Jorge has already given a general 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.830
 over it was worse than it is here 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.080
 one thing that was not good and the china 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.750
 can not restore and throw away this 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.750
 there will not eat the person's money 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.760
 So, how is it here? 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.010
 What barbarity is still lacking in 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.320
 down but not we look at it here 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.450
 low so fault is over 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.399
 restored young yet but you will see 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.300
 this here after ready will say that 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.300
 do you think it's not easy right? 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.870
 as she had released from the woods are 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.479
 noble wood a piece of wood that does not 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.939
 picks termite on wood that's great strong 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.320
 home made of cinnamon wood that never 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.840
 more 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:18.900
 There are 90 more my new house. 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.430
 Look there then the hit, but we'll go. 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.189
 do a job on it 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.220
 looks like we spend here is ok 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.150
 traffic is already on 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.240
 baby you'll see her come to you day 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.040
 will see that it is being restored to be 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.240
 restored look how the fee was 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.580
 up here is already done 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.230
 It's okay to say ready on top of that 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.650
 which we have now shown by 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.650
 low 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:55.250
 underneath it was all still broken 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.930
 down but has already made a change and was only 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.880
 which was no longer good and now there is a 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.590
 Wonderful work, I work very hard.

 here and only it will still be restored 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.679
 Then it was showing if everything worked out.
