it's going off the microphone on the top
which<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.920> not<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.250> world's<00:00:35.550> best<00:00:35.670> microphone

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
which is not the world's best microphone

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.619 
which is not the world's best microphone
so<00:00:37.790> you're<00:00:38.790> gonna<00:00:38.879> want<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.210> use<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.480> camera

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
so you're gonna want to use the camera

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.900 
so you're gonna want to use the camera
kit<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.860> connect<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.280> USB<00:00:41.399> connector<00:00:41.790> and

a<00:00:42.030> real<00:00:42.239> microphone<00:00:42.600> probably<00:00:43.200> let's<00:00:43.710> switch

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
a real microphone probably let's switch

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.880 
a real microphone probably let's switch

surprise<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.110> stuff<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.440> trimming

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
surprise you can do stuff like trimming

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.459 
surprise you can do stuff like trimming
you<00:00:56.699> actually<00:00:57.660> quite<00:00:57.809> intuitive<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.320> sit

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
you actually quite intuitive to sit

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.729 
you actually quite intuitive to sit
there<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.739> sort<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.010> type<00:00:59.280> it<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.559> drag<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
there to sort of type it just drag the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.200 
there to sort of type it just drag the
handles<00:01:02.129> around<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.460> audio<00:01:02.730> snippets<00:01:03.120> and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
handles around the audio snippets and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.490 
handles around the audio snippets and
then<00:01:03.300> be<00:01:03.390> able<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.780> arrange<00:01:04.080> them<00:01:04.260> which<00:01:04.409> is

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
then be able to arrange them which is

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.320 
then be able to arrange them which is
pretty<00:01:04.619> cool<00:01:04.799> now<00:01:05.430> I've<00:01:05.640> noticed<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.119> it's

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
pretty cool now I've noticed that it's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.950 
pretty cool now I've noticed that it's
really<00:01:06.750> buggy<00:01:06.990> um<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.909> iPad<00:01:09.600> 1<00:01:09.810> I'm

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
really buggy um on the iPad 1 I'm

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.810 
really buggy um on the iPad 1 I'm
imagining<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> enhanced<00:01:11.310> processing

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
imagining with the enhanced processing

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.880 
imagining with the enhanced processing
power<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.240> iPad<00:01:12.750> 2<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.200> will<00:01:13.290> be<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> lot

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
power of a iPad 2 that it will be a lot

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.740 
power of a iPad 2 that it will be a lot
a<00:01:14.369> lot<00:01:14.760> smoother<00:01:15.119> especially<00:01:15.450> some<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
a lot smoother especially some of the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.630 
a lot smoother especially some of the
audio<00:01:16.020> recording<00:01:16.439> stuff<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.250> sound<00:01:17.490> is

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
audio recording stuff but the sound is

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.730 
audio recording stuff but the sound is
not<00:01:17.670> bad<00:01:17.970> let's<00:01:18.360> listen<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> clip<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.590> made

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
of the iPad which I guess makes it pad

applications<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.110> far<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.770> good

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
applications so far so good

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.120

hopefully we'll have some more ok now
what's<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.520> handy<00:01:35.700> for<00:01:36.600> those<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.930> us<00:01:37.020> who

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
what's really handy for those of us who

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.830 
what's really handy for those of us who
have<00:01:37.320> workflows<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.390> being<00:01:39.659> this

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
have workflows is you just being this

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.580 
have workflows is you just being this
straight<00:01:40.140> out

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
straight out

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.520 
straight out
beam<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.700> straight<00:01:41.880> out<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.270> email<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.380> it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
beam is straight out to to email so it

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.219 
beam is straight out to to email so it
makes<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.860> nice<00:01:43.979> little<00:01:44.009> m4a<00:01:44.640> audio<00:01:45.299> file<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
makes a nice little m4a audio file and

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.590 
makes a nice little m4a audio file and
then<00:01:46.710> zips<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.610> out<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.880> your<00:01:48.030> gmail<00:01:48.570> account

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
then zips out out to your gmail account

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.800 
then zips out out to your gmail account
or<00:01:49.020> whatever<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.820> safety<00:01:51.750> of
