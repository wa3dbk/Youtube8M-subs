set<00:02:53.290> everything<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:53.709> sort<00:02:54.100> of<00:02:54.160> just<00:02:54.430> neutral

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
set everything to sort of just neutral

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.229 
set everything to sort of just neutral
so<00:02:55.300> there's<00:02:55.510> no<00:02:55.750> no<00:02:56.500> reverb<00:02:56.770> no<00:02:57.340> bass<00:02:57.940> no

trouble<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.959> we'll<00:02:59.950> just<00:03:00.310> kind<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.060> get<00:03:01.180> an

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
trouble and we'll just kind of get an

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.300 
trouble and we'll just kind of get an
idea<00:03:01.570> of<00:03:01.630> how<00:03:01.930> each<00:03:02.170> guitar<00:03:02.380> sounds<00:03:03.040> in<00:03:03.160> case

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.560 
the 335 or the Rickenbacker 360 I think
both<00:03:09.340> guitars<00:03:09.730> are<00:03:09.970> just<00:03:10.180> absolutely

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
one that came through Amazon which was

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.520 
one that came through Amazon which was
Gibson<00:03:17.140> custom<00:03:17.880> was<00:03:18.880> already<00:03:19.450> set<00:03:20.140> up<00:03:20.290> really

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
Gibson custom was already set up really

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.979 
Gibson custom was already set up really
well<00:03:20.800> I<00:03:21.070> was<00:03:21.250> able<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.700> lower<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.239> action<00:03:22.690> here

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
well I was able to lower the action here

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.290 
well I was able to lower the action here
and<00:03:23.170> bring<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.280> string<00:03:24.489> ACK<00:03:24.670> string<00:03:25.120> action

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
and bring the string ACK string action

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.900 
and bring the string ACK string action
really<00:03:25.690> low<00:03:25.900> so<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:26.800> plays<00:03:27.070> really<00:03:27.280> easy<00:03:27.610> and

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
really low so it plays really easy and

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.910 
really low so it plays really easy and
the<00:03:28.720> intonation<00:03:28.930> was<00:03:29.380> already<00:03:29.620> pretty<00:03:29.769> much

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
the intonation was already pretty much

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.430 
the intonation was already pretty much
already<00:03:30.370> set<00:03:30.790> I<00:03:30.820> did<00:03:31.030> adjust<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:31.930> think<00:03:32.200> one<00:03:32.410> of

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
already set I did adjust I think one of

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.550 
already set I did adjust I think one of
them<00:03:32.680> slightly<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.420> so<00:03:34.420> great<00:03:35.019> guitar<00:03:35.380> right

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
them slightly and so great guitar right

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.000 
them slightly and so great guitar right

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
this one or the Rickenbacker so I'll go

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.740 
this one or the Rickenbacker so I'll go
connect<00:03:42.370> them<00:03:42.489> up<00:03:42.579> and<00:03:42.790> we'll<00:03:42.940> be<00:03:43.090> right<00:03:43.269> back

you<00:04:08.470> get<00:04:08.620> an<00:04:08.709> idea<00:04:08.980> of<00:04:09.070> what<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.340> guitar

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
you get an idea of what the guitar

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.059 
you get an idea of what the guitar
sounds<00:04:10.090> like<00:04:10.269> so<00:04:11.140> here's<00:04:11.380> an<00:04:11.500> opening

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.920 

and<00:04:15.069> you<00:04:15.340> can<00:04:15.459> adjust<00:04:15.549> the<00:04:15.969> switch<00:04:18.750> here's<00:04:19.750> the

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
and you can adjust the switch here's the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.850 
and you can adjust the switch here's the
trouble<00:04:20.139> position

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.730 

so<00:04:24.699> it<00:04:24.819> sounds<00:04:25.060> real<00:04:25.240> good<00:04:25.270> with<00:04:25.990> open<00:04:26.409> chords

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
so it sounds real good with open chords

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.309 
so it sounds real good with open chords
like<00:04:26.949> here's<00:04:27.159> an<00:04:27.280> a-minor

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:29.319 
like here's an a-minor

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:34.280 
like here's an a-minor

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.100 

so<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.880> intonation<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.540> everything<00:04:36.840> on<00:04:36.960> here

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
so the intonation and everything on here

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.810 
so the intonation and everything on here

this<00:05:11.230> guitar<00:05:11.410> so<00:05:13.350> it's<00:05:14.350> not<00:05:14.470> quite<00:05:14.890> I'm<00:05:15.280> not

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
this guitar so it's not quite I'm not

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.280 
this guitar so it's not quite I'm not
quite<00:05:15.670> used<00:05:15.700> to<00:05:15.970> the<00:05:16.150> fingerboard<00:05:16.510> yet<00:05:16.930> on<00:05:17.110> the

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
quite used to the fingerboard yet on the

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.800 
quite used to the fingerboard yet on the
neck<00:05:17.830> thickness<00:05:18.250> but<00:05:19.240> it's<00:05:19.390> a<00:05:19.480> really<00:05:19.690> great

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
neck thickness but it's a really great

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.510 
neck thickness but it's a really great
guitar<00:05:20.170> and<00:05:20.350> I'd<00:05:20.410> highly<00:05:20.680> recommend<00:05:20.710> it<00:05:21.250> so

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
guitar and I'd highly recommend it so

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.960 
guitar and I'd highly recommend it so
next<00:05:22.000> I'll<00:05:22.240> get<00:05:23.170> out<00:05:23.320> my<00:05:23.350> Rickenbacker<00:05:24.160> 360

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
next I'll get out my Rickenbacker 360

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.670 
next I'll get out my Rickenbacker 360
and<00:05:25.240> we'll<00:05:25.390> see<00:05:25.690> what<00:05:25.870> the<00:05:25.990> sound<00:05:26.230> different

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
and we'll see what the sound different

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.890 
and we'll see what the sound different
sounds<00:05:27.040> like<00:05:27.270> ok<00:05:28.270> so<00:05:28.330> this<00:05:28.660> is<00:05:28.810> the

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
sounds like ok so this is the

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
sounds like ok so this is the
Rickenbacker<00:05:29.260> 360<00:05:30.160> it<00:05:30.910> has<00:05:31.450> a<00:05:31.480> really<00:05:31.780> nice<00:05:32.050> 20

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
Rickenbacker 360 it has a really nice 20

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.920 
Rickenbacker 360 it has a really nice 20
clean<00:05:33.280> sound<00:05:33.640> maybe<00:05:34.120> a<00:05:34.210> little<00:05:34.450> cleaner<00:05:34.690> than

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
clean sound maybe a little cleaner than

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.660 
clean sound maybe a little cleaner than
the<00:05:35.020> Gibson<00:05:36.330> it's<00:05:37.330> really<00:05:37.510> hard<00:05:37.660> to<00:05:37.750> say<00:05:37.960> I

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
the Gibson it's really hard to say I

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.010 
the Gibson it's really hard to say I
personally<00:05:39.670> prefer<00:05:39.970> this<00:05:40.150> guitar<00:05:40.480> a<00:05:40.510> lot<00:05:40.750> but

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
personally prefer this guitar a lot but

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.990 
personally prefer this guitar a lot but
both<00:05:41.200> of<00:05:41.230> them<00:05:41.470> are<00:05:41.530> just<00:05:41.700> superb<00:05:42.700> build

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
both of them are just superb build

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.300 
both of them are just superb build
quality<00:05:43.270> I<00:05:43.690> would<00:05:44.350> highly<00:05:44.740> recommend<00:05:44.770> either

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
quality I would highly recommend either

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.720 
quality I would highly recommend either
one<00:05:45.580> so<00:05:45.880> here's<00:05:46.090> an<00:05:46.210> open<00:05:46.450> e<00:05:46.600> and<00:05:50.280> I'll<00:05:51.280> move

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
one so here's an open e and I'll move

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.620 
one so here's an open e and I'll move
the<00:05:51.940> switch<00:05:52.780> to<00:05:52.990> bass

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.870 

and<00:05:55.870> then<00:05:56.650> the<00:05:56.830> treble<00:05:59.550> and<00:06:00.550> it's<00:06:00.700> got<00:06:00.850> all

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
and then the treble and it's got all

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.580 
and then the treble and it's got all
sorts<00:06:01.240> of<00:06:01.300> weird<00:06:01.480> adjustments<00:06:02.050> on<00:06:02.170> here<00:06:02.410> to

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
sorts of weird adjustments on here to

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.800 
sorts of weird adjustments on here to
try<00:06:02.740> to<00:06:02.770> get<00:06:02.980> it<00:06:03.070> equalized<00:06:03.550> out<00:06:03.760> but<00:06:04.000> you<00:06:04.660> get

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
try to get it equalized out but you get

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.170 
try to get it equalized out but you get
the<00:06:04.930> idea<00:06:04.960> here's<00:06:05.680> an<00:06:05.830> a-minor

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
the idea here's an a-minor

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.260 
the idea here's an a-minor
see

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.830 

so<00:06:14.900> it<00:06:15.590> has<00:06:15.770> a<00:06:15.800> very<00:06:16.130> very<00:06:16.370> nice<00:06:17.120> clean<00:06:17.539> sound

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
so it has a very very nice clean sound

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.770 
so it has a very very nice clean sound
and<00:06:18.349> it<00:06:18.680> sounds<00:06:19.490> really<00:06:19.880> pretty<00:06:20.300> much<00:06:20.509> just

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
and it sounds really pretty much just

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.240 
and it sounds really pretty much just
perfectly<00:06:21.169> in<00:06:21.259> tune<00:06:21.560> as<00:06:21.770> you<00:06:21.860> can<00:06:21.949> get<00:06:22.069> with<00:06:22.220> a

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
perfectly in tune as you can get with a

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.939 
perfectly in tune as you can get with a
tempered<00:06:22.639> scale<00:06:22.960> so<00:06:23.960> I'll<00:06:24.530> try<00:06:24.740> doing<00:06:24.919> a

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:24.949 
tempered scale so I'll try doing a

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:25.990 
tempered scale so I'll try doing a
little<00:06:25.099> bit<00:06:25.250> of<00:06:25.340> a<00:06:25.400> one<00:06:25.580> four<00:06:25.819> five

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
little bit of a one four five

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:46.679 
little bit of a one four five
progression

00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:46.689 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:48.850 

anyway<00:06:47.689> you<00:06:47.750> get<00:06:47.870> the<00:06:47.930> idea<00:06:48.050> what<00:06:48.439> it<00:06:48.560> sounds

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
anyway you get the idea what it sounds

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.450 
anyway you get the idea what it sounds
like

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
like

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.450 
like
I<00:06:49.520> would<00:06:50.120> highly<00:06:50.360> recommend<00:06:50.389> you<00:06:50.870> the<00:06:50.990> guitar

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
I would highly recommend you the guitar

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.240 
I would highly recommend you the guitar
so<00:06:52.460> thanks<00:06:52.759> for<00:06:52.849> watching
