today<00:00:03.909> I'm<00:00:04.060> going<00:00:04.240> to<00:00:04.300> show<00:00:04.390> you<00:00:04.450> a<00:00:04.600> trick

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:04.810 
today I'm going to show you a trick

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.450 
today I'm going to show you a trick
called<00:00:05.020> the<00:00:05.140> twisted<00:00:05.649> sign<00:00:05.890> which<00:00:06.250> is<00:00:06.370> the

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:06.460 
called the twisted sign which is the

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.850 
called the twisted sign which is the
hybrid<00:00:06.790> trick<00:00:07.000> that<00:00:07.290> consists<00:00:08.290> of<00:00:08.320> half<00:00:08.830> a

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860 
hybrid trick that consists of half a

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.000 
hybrid trick that consists of half a
revolution<00:00:09.610> of<00:00:09.940> a<00:00:09.969> charge<00:00:10.500> followed<00:00:11.500> by<00:00:11.679> a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.010 
revolution of a charge followed by a

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.300 
revolution of a charge followed by a
pass<00:00:15.360> this<00:00:16.360> trick<00:00:16.689> is<00:00:16.930> supposed<00:00:17.740> to<00:00:17.980> look<00:00:18.250> like

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
pass this trick is supposed to look like

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.139 
pass this trick is supposed to look like
it's<00:00:18.640> doing<00:00:18.849> to<00:00:19.149> start<00:00:19.390> two<00:00:19.630> revolutions<00:00:21.149> or

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:22.149 
it's doing to start two revolutions or

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:24.569 
it's doing to start two revolutions or
something<00:00:22.480> along<00:00:22.630> those<00:00:22.779> lines<00:00:22.840> but<00:00:23.800> it<00:00:24.399> only

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:24.579 
something along those lines but it only

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.350 
something along those lines but it only
really<00:00:24.849> makes<00:00:25.090> one<00:00:25.329> and<00:00:25.450> a<00:00:25.480> half<00:00:27.149> twists<00:00:28.149> on

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
really makes one and a half twists on

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.839 
really makes one and a half twists on
can<00:00:28.540> we<00:00:28.599> eat<00:00:28.720> it<00:00:28.750> on<00:00:28.930> palm<00:00:29.169> over<00:00:29.290> palm<00:00:29.410> down

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
can we eat it on palm over palm down

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.430 
can we eat it on palm over palm down
pull<00:00:30.849> up<00:00:31.029> it<00:00:31.149> looks<00:00:31.300> like<00:00:31.390> this

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:46.750 

and<00:00:37.730> palm<00:00:38.730> down<00:00:38.940> looks<00:00:39.120> like<00:00:39.210> this

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.680 

when<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.880> want<00:00:48.060> start<00:00:48.330> out

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
when you want start out

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.120 
when you want start out
not<00:00:49.020> like<00:00:49.140> you're<00:00:49.260> doing<00:00:49.290> a<00:00:49.470> regular<00:00:49.590> sonic

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
not like you're doing a regular sonic

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.780 
not like you're doing a regular sonic
which<00:00:50.810> the<00:00:51.810> pen<00:00:52.290> or<00:00:52.380> pencil<00:00:52.500> Center<00:00:53.400> balance

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
which the pen or pencil Center balance

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.110 
which the pen or pencil Center balance
is<00:00:53.940> slightly<00:00:54.630> below<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.320> middle<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.610> MIT

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
is slightly below the middle and the MIT

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.530 
is slightly below the middle and the MIT
ring<00:00:58.050> finger<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:59.520> back<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.970> the<00:01:00.059> pen<00:01:00.239> is

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
ring finger and the back of the pen is

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.670 
ring finger and the back of the pen is
placed<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.290> thumb<00:01:01.470> plot<00:01:02.090> now

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
placed on the thumb plot now

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.600 
placed on the thumb plot now
this<00:01:04.680> differs<00:01:04.979> from<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.190> actual<00:01:05.460> song

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
this differs from the actual song

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.590 
this differs from the actual song
because<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.940> don't<00:01:06.090> actually<00:01:06.180> apart

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
because you don't actually apart

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.080 
because you don't actually apart
pressure<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.110> make<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> pen<00:01:07.470> swing<00:01:07.910> you<00:01:08.910> can

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
pressure to make the pen swing you can

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.090 
pressure to make the pen swing you can
if<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.300> want<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.050> this<00:01:10.440> actually<00:01:10.830> starts

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
if you want to but this actually starts

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.260 
if you want to but this actually starts
out<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> charged<00:01:11.610> motion<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.150> can

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
out like a charged motion so you can

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.240 
out like a charged motion so you can
have<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> pen<00:01:12.750> let<00:01:12.990> go<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.500> then<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.070> need<00:01:14.220> to

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
have the pen let go and then you need to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.300 
have the pen let go and then you need to
have<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.490> fling<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.840> do<00:01:16.320> either<00:01:16.650> way<00:01:16.860> doesn't

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
have it fling I do either way doesn't

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.190 
have it fling I do either way doesn't
really<00:01:17.430> matter<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.910> usually<00:01:18.119> don't<00:01:18.600> hold<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:19.020> to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
really matter I usually don't hold on to

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.710 
really matter I usually don't hold on to
it<00:01:19.400> so<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.820> want<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.270> want<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.540> make<00:01:21.690> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
it so you want to do you want to make a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.260 
it so you want to do you want to make a
charge<00:01:21.990> with<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.320> motion<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.940> then<00:01:23.940> after

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
charge with like motion and then after

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.090 
charge with like motion and then after
the<00:01:24.390> charge<00:01:24.660> motion<00:01:25.050> you<00:01:25.530> want<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.800> carry<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the charge motion you want to carry the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.219 
the charge motion you want to carry the
momentum<00:01:26.220> forward<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.000> actually<00:01:27.479> beep<00:01:27.840> if

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
momentum forward and actually beep if

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.600 
momentum forward and actually beep if
you<00:01:28.500> hold<00:01:28.830> it<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.399> will<00:01:29.430> eventually

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
you hold it like this it will eventually

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.480 
you hold it like this it will eventually
pivot<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.649> then<00:01:31.649> it<00:01:31.950> passes<00:01:32.190> in

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
pivot like that and then it passes in

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.190 
pivot like that and then it passes in
front<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.060> middle<00:01:33.240> finger<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.840> then<00:01:35.000> into

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
front of the middle finger and then into

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.499 
front of the middle finger and then into
the<00:01:37.200> slot<00:01:37.860> between<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.369> index<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.330> middle

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the slot between the index in the middle

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.180 
the slot between the index in the middle
finger<00:01:39.660> and<00:01:39.899> the<00:01:39.990> rest<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.830> men<00:01:40.950> will

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
finger and the rest of the men will

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.580 
finger and the rest of the men will
carry<00:01:41.399> it<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.210> will<00:01:42.300> rest<00:01:42.660> on<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.410> thumb

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
carry it and it will rest on the thumb

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.320 
carry it and it will rest on the thumb
flap<00:01:43.800> like<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:46.369> palm<00:01:47.369> down<00:01:47.580> this<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.060> same

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
flap like so palm down this is the same

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.639 
flap like so palm down this is the same
just<00:01:48.810> showing<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.140> different<00:01:49.410> views

makes half a revolution goes in front of
the<00:01:53.670> middle<00:01:53.789> finger<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:55.099> then<00:01:57.289> it'll<00:01:58.289> swing

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
the middle finger and then it'll swing

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.230 
the middle finger and then it'll swing
into<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.840> thumb<00:02:00.990> flat<00:02:01.429> so<00:02:02.450> again<00:02:03.450> palm<00:02:03.959> up<00:02:04.140> and

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
into the thumb flat so again palm up and

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.710 
into the thumb flat so again palm up and
palm<00:02:06.240> down<00:02:07.190> now<00:02:08.250> when<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.119> do<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.509> with

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
palm down now when you do this with

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.410 
palm down now when you do this with
Sonic<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.950> really<00:02:11.370> use<00:02:11.610> as<00:02:11.849> transition

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
Sonic this really use as transition

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.339 
Sonic this really use as transition

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
not that different of a change so just

getting<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.250> done<00:03:30.430> between<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.940> ring<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.720> the

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
getting it done between the ring and the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.680 
getting it done between the ring and the
pinky<00:03:31.870> fingers<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:33.610> guy's<00:03:33.760> same<00:03:34.240> thing<00:03:34.510> and

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
pinky fingers the guy's same thing and

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.690 
pinky fingers the guy's same thing and
then<00:03:34.810> because<00:03:35.380> it's<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:35.980> only<00:03:36.310> difference<00:03:36.580> is

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
then because it's the only difference is

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.260 
then because it's the only difference is
that<00:03:36.730> I'll<00:03:37.480> fall<00:03:37.870> between<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:39.070> ring<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.180> the

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
that I'll fall between the ring and the

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.150 
that I'll fall between the ring and the
middle<00:03:40.660> finger<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:41.140> can't<00:03:41.800> actually<00:03:41.920> do<00:03:42.130> that

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
middle finger I can't actually do that

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.010 
middle finger I can't actually do that
so<00:03:42.489> I'm<00:03:42.670> not<00:03:42.730> going<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:43.000> try<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.209> slaughter<00:03:43.870> it

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
so I'm not going to try to slaughter it

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.680 
so I'm not going to try to slaughter it
by<00:03:44.290> showing<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.800> but<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:46.060> would<00:03:46.270> look<00:03:46.390> just

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
by showing you but it would look just

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.170 
by showing you but it would look just
the<00:03:47.200> same<00:03:47.230> it'll<00:03:48.130> just<00:03:48.370> end<00:03:48.580> in<00:03:48.850> a<00:03:48.880> different

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180
