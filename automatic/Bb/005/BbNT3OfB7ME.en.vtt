nothing<00:02:15.370> special<00:02:19.920> blow<00:02:20.920> out<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.100> ground

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
nothing special blow out the ground

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.770 
nothing special blow out the ground
underneath<00:02:21.670> out<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:22.030> City<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:24.570> rocks<00:02:25.570> are

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
underneath out of City and rocks are

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.050 
underneath out of City and rocks are
bouncing

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.710 

it's<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.480> nice<00:02:32.630> little<00:02:32.840> gash<00:02:33.110> here<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:35.569> see

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
it's a nice little gash here you see

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.390 
it's a nice little gash here you see
this<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:35.959> like<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.140> general<00:02:36.620> area<00:02:37.040> where<00:02:37.280> there

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
this is like a general area where there

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.550 
this is like a general area where there
was<00:02:37.520> so<00:02:37.730> much<00:02:37.880> tnt<00:02:38.390> it's<00:02:38.660> just<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:39.020> big<00:02:39.200> crater

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
was so much tnt it's just a big crater

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.229 
was so much tnt it's just a big crater
now<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:42.459> don't<00:02:43.459> really<00:02:43.580> know<00:02:43.730> where<00:02:43.819> to<00:02:43.910> go<00:02:44.060> from

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
now I don't really know where to go from

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.620 
now I don't really know where to go from
here<00:02:45.250> okay<00:02:46.250> more<00:02:47.000> over<00:02:47.060> here<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:50.330> think<00:02:50.540> it'd

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
here okay more over here you think it'd

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.089 
here okay more over here you think it'd
be<00:02:50.660> easy<00:02:50.870> just<00:02:50.989> look<00:02:51.290> for<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.500> giant<00:02:51.800> craters

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
be easy just look for the giant craters

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.160 
be easy just look for the giant craters
in<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.250> ground<00:02:52.550> but<00:02:52.819> I<00:02:53.090> don't<00:02:53.569> have<00:02:53.660> any<00:02:53.750> point

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
in the ground but I don't have any point

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.250 
in the ground but I don't have any point
of<00:02:54.260> reference<00:02:54.470> now<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:55.810> guess<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:56.959> went<00:02:57.050> this

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
of reference now I guess it went this

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:06.590 
of reference now I guess it went this
