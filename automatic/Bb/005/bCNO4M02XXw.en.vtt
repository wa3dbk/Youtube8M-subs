hey<00:00:04.799> it's<00:00:04.950> Allison<00:00:05.370> from<00:00:05.520> Mahalo<00:00:05.879> comm<00:00:06.359> and

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
hey it's Allison from Mahalo comm and

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.570 
hey it's Allison from Mahalo comm and
today<00:00:07.049> we're<00:00:07.259> talking<00:00:07.440> about<00:00:07.680> double<00:00:08.220> digit

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
today we're talking about double digit

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.669 
today we're talking about double digit
addition<00:00:08.700> let's<00:00:09.660> say<00:00:09.840> we<00:00:09.990> want<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.260> add<00:00:10.349> two

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
addition let's say we want to add two

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.060 
addition let's say we want to add two
double<00:00:11.010> digit<00:00:11.280> numbers<00:00:11.610> 77<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.630> 29<00:00:13.170> we<00:00:13.889> have<00:00:14.040> a

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
double digit numbers 77 and 29 we have a

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.160 
double digit numbers 77 and 29 we have a
way<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.370> doing<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> specific<00:00:15.509> algorithm

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
way of doing this a specific algorithm

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.560 
way of doing this a specific algorithm
and<00:00:16.680> before<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.520> do<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.060> important<00:00:18.510> to

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
and before you do that it's important to

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.779 
and before you do that it's important to
get<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.840> set<00:00:19.020> up<00:00:19.050> correctly<00:00:19.220> so<00:00:20.220> what<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.609> want

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
get it set up correctly so what you want

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.220 
get it set up correctly so what you want
to<00:00:20.880> do<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.480> want<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> make<00:00:21.810> sure<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.109> you

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
to do is you want to make sure that you

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.070 
to do is you want to make sure that you
line<00:00:22.560> up<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:23.100> ones<00:00:23.609> column<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.420> each<00:00:24.660> number

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
line up the ones column in each number

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.589 
line up the ones column in each number
and<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.470> tens<00:00:25.740> column<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.340> each<00:00:26.519> number<00:00:26.970> so

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
and the tens column in each number so

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.790 
and the tens column in each number so
let's<00:00:27.900> rewrite<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.590> vertically<00:00:29.429> like<00:00:29.820> this

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
let's rewrite this vertically like this

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.530 
let's rewrite this vertically like this
77<00:00:31.800> plus<00:00:32.809> 29<00:00:34.070> now<00:00:35.070> both<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.940> numbers<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.420> my

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
77 plus 29 now both the numbers in my

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.510 
77 plus 29 now both the numbers in my
ones<00:00:36.780> column<00:00:37.140> are<00:00:37.469> lined<00:00:37.710> up<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.129> both<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
ones column are lined up and both the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.549 
ones column are lined up and both the
numbers<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.030> my<00:00:39.059> tens<00:00:39.510> column<00:00:39.719> are<00:00:40.050> lined<00:00:40.379> up

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
numbers in my tens column are lined up

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.290 
numbers in my tens column are lined up
so<00:00:41.250> now<00:00:41.399> let's<00:00:41.730> add<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.860> seven<00:00:44.700> plus<00:00:45.000> nine<00:00:45.030> is

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
so now let's add so seven plus nine is

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.170 
so now let's add so seven plus nine is
equal<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.870> sixteen<00:00:46.440> now<00:00:46.800> 16<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.489> two-digit

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
equal to sixteen now 16 is a two-digit

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.819 
equal to sixteen now 16 is a two-digit
number<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.930> what<00:00:49.079> I'm<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.350> do<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.649> just

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
number so what I'm going to do is just

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.979 
number so what I'm going to do is just
put<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.340> ones<00:00:50.610> part<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.270> number<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.719> six

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
put the ones part of that number the six

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.340 
put the ones part of that number the six
down<00:00:52.530> here<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.160> then<00:00:54.059> carry<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:55.020> tens

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
down here and then carry the tens

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.500 
down here and then carry the tens
position<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.070> number<00:00:56.399> which<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:57.180> up

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
position of that number which is one up

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.590 
position of that number which is one up
here<00:00:58.109> now<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.100> add<00:00:59.489> up<00:00:59.609> everything<00:01:00.449> that's

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
here now I just add up everything that's

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.709 
here now I just add up everything that's
in<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> tens<00:01:01.020> column<00:01:01.170> 1<00:01:02.129> plus<00:01:02.399> 7<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.789> 8<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.270> 8

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
in the tens column 1 plus 7 is 8 and 8

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.539 
in the tens column 1 plus 7 is 8 and 8
plus<00:01:03.870> 2<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.199> 10<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:05.549> get<00:01:05.840> 106<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.340> will

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
plus 2 is 10 and we get 106 so this will

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.090 
plus 2 is 10 and we get 106 so this will
also<00:01:08.760> work<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.450> more<00:01:10.080> than<00:01:10.260> two<00:01:10.439> digits<00:01:10.830> it'll

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
also work on more than two digits it'll

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.130 
also work on more than two digits it'll
work<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.490> three<00:01:11.850> digits<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.450> let's<00:01:12.840> do<00:01:13.020> another

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
work on three digits so let's do another

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.609 
work on three digits so let's do another
example<00:01:13.460> let's<00:01:14.460> say<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.880> want<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.180> add<00:01:15.290> 35<00:01:16.290> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
example let's say we want to add 35 to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.690 
example let's say we want to add 35 to
106<00:01:18.200> now<00:01:19.229> again<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.979> want<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.250> make<00:01:20.310> sure<00:01:20.549> you

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
106 now again you want to make sure you

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.789 
106 now again you want to make sure you
get<00:01:20.850> your<00:01:20.970> numbers<00:01:21.240> lined<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.750> correctly<00:01:21.799> so

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
get your numbers lined up correctly so

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.249 
get your numbers lined up correctly so
if<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.220> want<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.490> add<00:01:23.640> 35<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.600> make<00:01:25.229> sure

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
if we want to add 35 to this make sure

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.340 
if we want to add 35 to this make sure
that<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.770> line<00:01:26.070> up<00:01:26.100> your<00:01:27.030> ones<00:01:27.509> position<00:01:28.110> and

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that you line up your ones position and

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.710 
that you line up your ones position and
your<00:01:29.009> tens<00:01:29.280> position<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.689> a

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
your tens position and if you have a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.999 
your tens position and if you have a
hundredths<00:01:31.079> position<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.560> would<00:01:31.650> line<00:01:31.860> that

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
hundredths position you would line that

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.870 
hundredths position you would line that
up<00:01:32.040> too<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:33.119> let's<00:01:33.360> add<00:01:33.570> these<00:01:33.810> together<00:01:34.880> 6

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
up too so let's add these together 6

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.660 
up too so let's add these together 6
plus<00:01:36.329> 5<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.600> 11<00:01:37.009> again<00:01:38.009> that's<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.310> two<00:01:38.490> digit

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
plus 5 is 11 again that's a two digit

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.640 
plus 5 is 11 again that's a two digit
number<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.119> I'm<00:01:39.420> going<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.630> split<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.079> up<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
number so I'm going to split it up the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.800 
number so I'm going to split it up the
ones<00:01:40.860> position<00:01:41.400> will<00:01:41.579> go<00:01:41.729> down<00:01:41.909> here<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.509> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
ones position will go down here and the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.539 
ones position will go down here and the
number<00:01:43.049> that's<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.380> tens<00:01:43.680> position<00:01:44.189> will

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
number that's in the tens position will

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.389 
number that's in the tens position will
go<00:01:44.670> up<00:01:44.820> here<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.299> that's<00:01:45.689> my<00:01:45.930> 11<00:01:46.380> now<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.040> add<00:01:47.369> up

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
go up here so that's my 11 now I add up

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.179 
go up here so that's my 11 now I add up
everything<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> tenths<00:01:48.420> column<00:01:48.450> 1<00:01:49.350> plus<00:01:49.890> 0

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
everything in the tenths column 1 plus 0

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.710 
everything in the tenths column 1 plus 0
is<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:50.430> 1<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.090> 1<00:01:51.630> plus<00:01:51.869> 3<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.229> 4<00:01:53.299> now<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.329> didn't

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
is just 1 and 1 plus 3 is 4 now I didn't

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.450 
is just 1 and 1 plus 3 is 4 now I didn't
have<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.990> carry<00:01:55.229> anything<00:01:55.649> over<00:01:55.890> here<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.399> I
