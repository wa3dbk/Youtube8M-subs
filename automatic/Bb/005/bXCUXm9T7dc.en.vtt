00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 greetings guardians in this video les 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.520
 I will show how to make the contract 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.710
 they turn on the light more quickly and 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.929
 easy this guy is for the kind of 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.030
 hunter using the acrobat subclasses 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.830
 of the edge you must have bike improvements 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.870
 efectivista selected as plugin 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.359
 you have the exotic armor do not touch me 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.890
 use it since one of its improvements consists 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.720
 in increasing the energy for the super 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.790
 every time we eliminate a member of the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.230
 darkness 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.670
 to make this contract easier for us 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.190
 we direct the darkness to the mission 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.290
 outside this on the moon is important 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.060
 that you put level 9 to come out 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.040
 more senses but neither is it necessary 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.720
 that you select a higher level already 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.110
 that will continue to come out in the same way 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.610
 layoffs that are between 40 and 45 the part 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.559
 of the vision that interests us is the 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.360
 where the fallen guardian is 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.190
 to arrive we must release our spectrum 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.350
 next to the fallen guardian to activate the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.960
 mission but before there will be a cinematic 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.790
 having the exotic arms of not me 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.559
 touches is to not have to wait for 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.839
 the super bar is filled before 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.489
 activate the kinematics we go straight 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.909
 to kill a few detours so that 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.909
 they have 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.360
 we can activate the super and clean the 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.009
 that remain when pressing 92 or the super 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.079
 eliminate that the lackeys that finds me 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.610
 near you easier and faster but 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.590
 taking care not to eliminate the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.259
 gentleman where he shoots since at 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.149
 do it we will activate a tempo 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.920
 the idea is to clean the area without removing 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.560
 the gentleman and when we have eliminated 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.360
 we are missing the enemies or we leave 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.789
 kill to start over from the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.679
 background without having to go to orbit and 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.679
 come back or suddenly pneumatic 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.020
 how 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.649
