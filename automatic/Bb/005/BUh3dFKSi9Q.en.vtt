 that you represent and we will start 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.929
 by the pana clip the clever of a clip 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.759
 hissing the accessory that I use 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:16.150
 almost every day 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.170
 loeb game during the manach I love this 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.359
 axis story because it allows 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.170
 to tie her hair but in 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.170
 retaining volume 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.750
 11 fashion science to display in 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.820
 using a pet like that 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.320
 but keep the deer as much as possible 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.969
 what comes out is necessarily less 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.129
 voluminous two episodes of my nana 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.210
 djimou of entry in china with my nana 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.609
 who serve me in juniors more 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.859
 voluminous ferrand roofer has been 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.089
 observed in big poufs and equip themselves 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.390
 herbaceous mass who can in 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.579
 peace it's my action has receded without 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.280
 dispute the accessories that I would love 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.129
 I also use a lot of tunes 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.149
 stick or stick for hair so that's 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.860
 the accessory there his top 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:09.390
 he will be proud they serve to make 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.640
 bananas or buns 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.330
 but the buns you will hold 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.720
 with bugs but rather with that 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.360
 contrary to what we can think 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.280
 it's really very very handy 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.569
 on I'm going to planned because all 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.069
 simply smooth hair can 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:24.450
 use them or ags read a lot 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.119
 while our hair that has a lot 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.289
 of holding bah they are very boyfriend with 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.670
 this is the side because it is enough to 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.140
 plant and it holds 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.909
 you will not have any hair that goes 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.830
 escape dropped to anything 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.600
 so it's really not liked that 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.560
 nice style and you can really 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.849
 varied wine and varied tastes because 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.580
 that we find that does not work in 

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:45.500
 lose like that so we put one of each 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.149
 side of the bun 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.440
 there is some that works alone like this 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.170
 big guy that I like big could 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.670
 replicate to my sister who does who you 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.940
 make manama the balance in one 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.560
 taken and I often use this pretty 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.319
 little thing here I have four like that 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.069
 with different steps bouquet of 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.209
 pretty patterns 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:08.429
 it's a big pin and that's it 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:10.810
 really accuse bun 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.940
 now I also have the darlings 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.370
 small elastic seizes file therefore 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.720
 like that without having to do that it's 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.880
 important and if it's because we good 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.140
 are is planned the bar to do 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.550
 ring the words that can break the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.110
 horses stupidly bedside 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.520
 cling in and hautmont you 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.830
 will send that moment when it is 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.510
 hung in and often she only has one 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.760
 only thing to do cut out or the 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.500
 then snatch those little elastics 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.120
 largely its outstanding bending method 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.370
 could pull long hair or 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.080
 complaints or the name of the wicks to have 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.030
 hot but god simply have to 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.069
 tie the hair she has you 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.420
 need a rubber band other accessories 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.519
 which makes it rather a tool a 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.560
 besides, like elastics without 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.319
 iron bar these are the people 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.569
 so it's good what serve to hold 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.700
 disbursements on the hair so during 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.049
 weekend sales so mora example 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.670
 I live but will be in four so 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.110
 for the whole duration of lying and I 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.110
 are going to be held by people 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.680
 we 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.420
 if also very useful as is combing for 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.170
 make braids or all kinds of 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.090
 elaborate hairstyles 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.930
 it needs them how it's 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.920
 Hair of the coast is to manage our 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.630
 so it may be that presses like 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.930
 it can be drops of this kind 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.600
 whew 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.920
 flat like that looks like in everything 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.160
 what can you use to compensate your 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.570
 hair on one side date and 10th 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
 accessories that's something I 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.720
 do not have home and I've never 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.710
 found in his shop and I laughed 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.650
 given to see 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.330
 it is a padded cap sat so 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.550
 sent as a different hat a hat 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.430
 in wool have lived and cold but of which 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.240
 the interior would be uncertain that's me 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.790
 would change the life 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.260

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.750
 bonnet very gently by spreading 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.490
 before installing and removing such 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.770
 by lifting the edges to make 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.739
 be careful that my hair does not 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.450
 do not tear yourself apart if he was all 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.400
