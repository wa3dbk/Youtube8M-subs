 Tei was 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:56.480
 I have some attention from the referee from now on , but there is almost no meaning for this program 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.590
 I will tell you without any details, but most of this advice is touching the body 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.720
 It is only 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.260
 It is 3 runs in Aichi round 30 seconds 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.190
 Now that the whistle rang finally this is the first round, and the run law and Yamazaki 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.090
 It is feeling Bach 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.090
 Yamazaki who was a clinical doctor 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.890
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.010

 Kanada Lover

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:49.789
 Since I was in a campsite where I could have a stamp on my hand, I had know-how and size 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:54.050
 We are finished in English, so we have finished the first game . 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:57.560
 The second round was overwhelmingly dominated by Challenger 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.930
 The challenger decided everything from left to right, taking advantage of the long reach 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.830
 It is important that the champion is also having a very difficult fight 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.520
 Let's Pyon also 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.900
 How many rounds do you want to inspire, but your eyes have become quite serious 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.240
 It becomes environment Yone Marika

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.290
 It is a little to a champion in 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.830
 Limes level 4 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:28.290
 I can not go forward 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.980
 If I were to work this time it was a work lamp finally hit cherry 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.819
 So I 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.959
 Angry I gray-chan 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.959
 I did a bra to study 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.670
 Don't get rid of Drucker 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.530
 This is why the target is connected 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.130
 There 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.520
 These rounds are the end of the second round 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.590
 The main house or working there saw the construction of the second half of the air champion 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.590
 Challenger is I was there in the round, such as superiority 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.660
 Now Takeshi Yamazaki And so on 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.470
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.700
 Hey you don't say if I come 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:18.390
 Pyon's expression 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.520
 Our world's yarn calorie lab while hello world 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.010

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.740
 There Han 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.480
 I still confused my words 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.390
 I do not have it 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.360
 Nakata beneath champion has been safely placed 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.360
 I wonder he'll open the properly this time 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.360
 Your great-vehicle video shook tier sky 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.630

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.760
 No, this 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:51.020
 The third round is over 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:54.060
 Challenger was pretty good but let's wait for the call 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.930
 I think that surprising I guess now blue 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.850
 Champyeong Yaho 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.900
 just that 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.430
 The dogmatism and prejudice champion ended up bending the advancing how vendors fight that wins 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.250
 Although we have made only to 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:12.280
 The Challenger will head for Doracius this week 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.550
 The challenger who stood is why it is a punishment sentence 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.660
 You may also get the protection and from government buildings 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.570

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:39.260
 Good evening to be able to think about Aichi bread distance We finished four weeks 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.930
 Lend champion and underneath we are doing in Thailand of two wins and two losses to the Challenger both 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.550
 It is a story so that it does not become what deployment this week 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.550
 Now the referee is in autumn 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.690
 And the place of recruitment is core cg 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:59.100

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:58.480
 Unfortunately the challenger is the first part of the second part, which ended with a graphic blow 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.630
 Could not take round points 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.370
 I ate some grabs with Potter Jean , so I immediately 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:08.740
 The 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:11.979
 It seems like you're carrying a 3 second grab, which is not a good condition . 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.660
 Today I have a grab Challenge naigel seems to be a very sloppy man 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:17.180
