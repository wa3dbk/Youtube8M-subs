 well I think the intro was very clear 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.070
 I just want to give my little opinion about 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.830
 something that I found out recently they will take a 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.290
 sapphire remake pokemon ruby so 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.960
 they will make a remake of the game easier 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.990
 overrated and with worse story of the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.520
 saga in my opinion very well it is obvious that 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.010
 they did this to empty their pockets 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.050
 of the young bieber and may pricklers or 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.240
 these same ones were fuck and fuck with 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.580
 his young confirmed to the point that satoshi 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.980
 Tajiri got really annoyed I do not know 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.590
 matter, I only say that now it has been 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.990
 finished the creativity I mean ruby 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.820
 sapphire and emeralds are great games and 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.710
 I do not say that your auctions will be 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.630
 bad games what I want to get is 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.150
 that now pokemon lives on refritos de 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.040
 ideas that he already did before pokemon x and e 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.440
 be an innovative game and that gave you a 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.510
 fresh air to the saga does not justify this 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.300
 awkward movement first mega char hoist 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.520
 the keys and now this that follows that the 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.310
 fanboys ask for a game like that 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.920
 satoshi fulfill him no sir this was 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.080
 really unnecessary touch fans play 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.300
 your new remake enjoy it and 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.020
 have fun but for me pokemon has already 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.570
 lowered from 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.759
 and I will not see it as always, I do not know, I think 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.399
 that is not liking me a bit 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.610
 but I only say it for me, me, my person 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.259
 personal opinion and I only made this video 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.479
 so they knew what I think about 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.549
 this issue if the remake turns out to be very 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.149
 good please let me know to see if 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:12.970
 I give you an opportunity 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.970
 666 d'aix that's all for now goodbye 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.790
 no no no no no
