00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.049 
day one now I know a lot of you were
really<00:00:07.680> considerate<00:00:08.400> about<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.760> fact<00:00:09.000> that

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
really considerate about the fact that

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.419 
really considerate about the fact that
this<00:00:09.330> is<00:00:09.630> my<00:00:09.809> wedding<00:00:10.110> week<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:11.040> maybe<00:00:11.250> I

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
this is my wedding week and that maybe I

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.620 
this is my wedding week and that maybe I
shouldn't<00:00:11.730> log<00:00:11.880> because<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.300> might<00:00:12.450> be

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
shouldn't log because I might be

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.299 
shouldn't log because I might be
stressed<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.410> busy<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.799> things<00:00:14.099> like<00:00:14.250> that

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
stressed and busy and things like that

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
but what I'm going to do is probably

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.960
