00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.690 

I<00:00:00.179> made<00:00:01.170> a<00:00:01.199> posting<00:00:01.709> a<00:00:01.800> while<00:00:02.010> ago<00:00:02.340> about

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
I made a posting a while ago about

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.059 
I made a posting a while ago about
playing<00:00:03.030> two<00:00:03.629> simultaneous<00:00:04.529> very<00:00:04.859> long

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
playing two simultaneous very long

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:05.780 
playing two simultaneous very long
patterns

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
patterns

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.040 
patterns
I<00:00:06.290> picked<00:00:07.290> 17<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.010> 19<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.820> then<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.750> put<00:00:09.929> them

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
I picked 17 and 19 and then I put them

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.980 
I picked 17 and 19 and then I put them
in<00:00:10.260> another<00:00:10.590> time<00:00:10.980> base<00:00:11.599> to<00:00:12.599> make<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.870> more

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
in another time base to make it more

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.709 
in another time base to make it more
difficult<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:14.460> that<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.670> could<00:00:14.820> work<00:00:15.000> on<00:00:15.240> the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
difficult so that I could work on the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.300 
difficult so that I could work on the
physical<00:00:16.139> things<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.560> was<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.920> was<00:00:17.160> doing

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
physical things I was I was doing

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.590 
physical things I was I was doing
because<00:00:17.550> playing<00:00:17.880> all<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:19.020> stuff<00:00:20.449> keeps<00:00:21.449> me

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
because playing all that stuff keeps me

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.929 
because playing all that stuff keeps me
occupied<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.590> keeps<00:00:22.800> me<00:00:23.010> repeating<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
occupied and it keeps me repeating the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.970 
occupied and it keeps me repeating the
same<00:00:24.150> physical<00:00:24.630> patterns<00:00:25.050> otherwise<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.410> get

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
same physical patterns otherwise I get

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.800 
same physical patterns otherwise I get
bored<00:00:26.279> whether<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.880> sounds<00:00:27.240> good<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.420> not<00:00:27.660> is

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
bored whether it sounds good and not is

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.480 
bored whether it sounds good and not is
irrelevant<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.470> me<00:00:28.590> because<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:28.980> not<00:00:29.070> meant

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
irrelevant to me because it's not meant

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.380 
irrelevant to me because it's not meant
for<00:00:29.750> music<00:00:30.750> at<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.560> point<00:00:31.859> anyway<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.850> just

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
for music at this point anyway so just

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.430 
for music at this point anyway so just
so<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.600> can<00:00:33.750> follow<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:35.340> 19<00:00:35.969> will<00:00:36.570> be<00:00:36.840> a

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
so you can follow it the 19 will be a

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.100 
so you can follow it the 19 will be a
couple<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.010> pairs<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.460> was<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> three<00:00:39.210> I

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.540 

don't<00:00:46.110> always<00:00:46.230> play<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.680> like<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.070> sometimes

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
don't always play it like that sometimes

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.959 
don't always play it like that sometimes
to<00:00:47.730> work<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.000> my<00:00:48.149> feet<00:00:48.420> I'll<00:00:48.660> play<00:00:49.700> double<00:00:50.700> kick

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
to work on my feet I'll play double kick

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.939 
to work on my feet I'll play double kick
and<00:00:51.210> hit<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.960> snare<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> middle<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.860> that

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
and hit the snare in the middle of that

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.939 
and hit the snare in the middle of that
19<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.879> get<00:00:54.030> real<00:00:54.180> foot<00:00:54.449> work<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.350> anyway

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
19 just to get real foot work in anyway

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.580 
19 just to get real foot work in anyway
I<00:00:56.190> won't<00:00:56.520> do<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.789> right<00:00:56.850> now<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:58.109> seventeen

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
I won't do that right now the seventeen

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.160 
I won't do that right now the seventeen
and<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.100> can<00:00:59.340> follow<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.850> I'll<00:01:00.629> use<00:01:00.840> two

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
and so you can follow it I'll use two

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.310 
and so you can follow it I'll use two
sound<00:01:02.100> sources<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.420> Gen<00:01:03.629> 16<00:01:04.080> such<00:01:04.290> a

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
sound sources here on the Gen 16 such a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.230 
sound sources here on the Gen 16 such a
really<00:01:04.589> quiet<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.369> where<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:05.909> doing<00:01:06.119> my

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
really quiet this is where I'm doing my

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:15.100 
really quiet this is where I'm doing my
practicing<00:01:06.930> anyway

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:23.240 

one<00:01:19.070> okay<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:21.200> just<00:01:22.200> those<00:01:22.350> two<00:01:22.620> patterns<00:01:22.860> play

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
one okay so just those two patterns play

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.030 
one okay so just those two patterns play
together<00:01:23.490> with<00:01:23.850> sound<00:01:24.120> like<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.600> I'll<00:01:25.350> slow

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
together with sound like this I'll slow

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:55.150 
together with sound like this I'll slow
it<00:01:26.070> down<00:01:27.619> do<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.650> nineteen<00:01:29.100> first

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.070 

what<00:01:56.160> I'll<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.640> call<00:01:57.450> those<00:01:57.630> sixteenth

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
what I'll do is call those sixteenth

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.920 
what I'll do is call those sixteenth
notes<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.649> throw<00:01:59.340> one<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.060> my<00:02:00.240> feet<00:02:00.539> on<00:02:00.720> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
notes and throw one of my feet on the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.650 
notes and throw one of my feet on the
in-between<00:02:01.440> thirty-second<00:02:02.220> notes<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:03.479> work

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
in-between thirty-second notes to work

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:15.410 
in-between thirty-second notes to work
on<00:02:03.840> balance<00:02:04.080> that<00:02:04.649> sound<00:02:05.039> like<00:02:05.250> this

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.449 

so<00:02:16.050> that's<00:02:16.800> hot<00:02:17.010> enough<00:02:17.040> as<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.820> but<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:19.459> try

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
so that's hot enough as it is but I try

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.000 
so that's hot enough as it is but I try
to<00:02:20.489> in<00:02:20.820> my<00:02:21.000> head<00:02:21.360> count<00:02:22.110> something<00:02:22.560> different

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
to in my head count something different

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.610 
to in my head count something different
because<00:02:23.340> if<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.730> don't<00:02:24.019> what<00:02:25.019> will<00:02:25.170> happen<00:02:25.530> is

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
because if I don't what will happen is

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.259 
because if I don't what will happen is
I'll<00:02:25.739> just<00:02:25.769> keep<00:02:26.070> speeding<00:02:26.519> that<00:02:26.790> up<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.180> I

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
I'll just keep speeding that up and I

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.539 
I'll just keep speeding that up and I
really<00:02:27.570> won't<00:02:27.690> solidify<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.380> physical<00:02:28.980> thing

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
really won't solidify the physical thing

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.920 
really won't solidify the physical thing
I'm<00:02:29.670> trying<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.000> work<00:02:30.120> on<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.540> keep<00:02:30.720> getting

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
I'm trying to work on it keep getting

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.770 
I'm trying to work on it keep getting
faster<00:02:31.170> it's<00:02:31.530> just<00:02:31.739> what<00:02:31.890> what<00:02:32.250> humans<00:02:32.730> do<00:02:33.030> you

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
faster it's just what what humans do you

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.620 
faster it's just what what humans do you
know<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.549> what<00:02:35.549> that<00:02:35.700> might<00:02:35.850> sound<00:02:36.150> like<00:02:36.390> is

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
know so what that might sound like is

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.449 
know so what that might sound like is
this<00:02:36.870> for<00:02:37.110> example<00:02:37.320> in<00:02:37.670> 4/4<00:02:39.380> which<00:02:40.380> is<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.709> base

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
this for example in 4/4 which is a base

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.610 
this for example in 4/4 which is a base
for<00:02:41.790> just<00:02:42.180> stuck<00:02:42.450> into<00:02:42.750> Kentucky<00:02:43.140> like<00:02:43.410> with

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
for just stuck into Kentucky like with

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.400 
for just stuck into Kentucky like with
it<00:02:43.769> that's<00:02:44.040> what<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.310> beat<00:02:44.549> is<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:45.570> 19<00:02:46.200> would

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
it that's what the beat is the 19 would

00:02:46.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
it that's what the beat is the 19 would
sound<00:02:46.650> like<00:02:46.799> this

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.620 

around<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:08.200> 17<00:03:08.980> would<00:03:09.220> sound<00:03:09.490> interface<00:03:10.300> for

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
around the 17 would sound interface for

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.520 
around the 17 would sound interface for
like<00:03:11.410> this<00:03:12.660> say<00:03:13.660> what<00:03:14.080> are<00:03:14.140> we<00:03:14.200> going<00:03:14.380> to<00:03:14.470> hit

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
like this say what are we going to hit
