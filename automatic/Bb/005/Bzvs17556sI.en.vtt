00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.990
 mine to me 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:16.260
 I just want to say that we are all 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.480
 planned as tactics like circus u 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.230
 we did not really guess 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.260
 the result the result is not turned on 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.090
 all our players had a party 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:33.899
 stuck and performed their 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:39.239
 duties just at some point u 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:46.710
 pupils and it is a goal so 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:49.440
 embarrassed a bit like this in our players and gave 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.180
 such a continuation of the psychological pose 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.730
 on g players 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.100
 but the principle is very good 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.680
 the game was very good game syron 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.949
 and and really was like a derby 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.830
 I congratulate and life is p.d. we are not 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.979
 We will let go head we will try to 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.979
 each game best its own actions and 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.240
 its result so i can't even 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:28.510
 nothing more to add from this again 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:31.860
 I repeat that I am pleased and my team is not 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:36.250
 plainly with marcelo for hares too 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.470
 marsala sucking cisterns off bond 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.430
 Apparently these players are very important for ours. 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.680
 the team and apparently he is missing I for 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:49.030
 I believe that we will not let go of the goal 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.890
 we have more reserves have a good 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.710
 team which must 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.000
 evolve I think this is the result 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.400
 what percentage will have some 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.260
 psychological influence on our players 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.390
 because there are young which 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.690
 evolving but still I hope that we 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.330
 quickly 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.980
 we will go out from this situation to play 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.980
 it's good not to score points
