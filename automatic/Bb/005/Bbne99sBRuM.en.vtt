00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.130 
you me doing it is we're gonna go ahead
and<00:02:48.380> swap<00:02:48.620> this<00:02:48.980> head<00:02:49.220> skin<00:02:49.520> onto<00:02:50.060> this<00:02:50.540> body<00:02:50.810> I

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
don't know about the arms I might spike

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.820 
don't know about the arms I might spike
to<00:02:53.060> swap<00:02:53.420> them<00:02:53.600> on<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:53.989> then<00:02:54.350> we're<00:02:54.470> gonna<00:02:54.560> go

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
to swap them on and then we're gonna go

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.620 
to swap them on and then we're gonna go
ahead<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.070> swap<00:02:55.190> this<00:02:55.430> head<00:02:55.670> scan<00:02:55.940> on<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.420> this

ahead and swap this head scan on to this

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.600 
ahead and swap this head scan on to this
body<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:58.370> yeah<00:02:58.670> it's<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.420> long<00:02:59.840> process<00:03:00.140> but

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
body so yeah it's a a long process but

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.490 
body so yeah it's a a long process but
this<00:03:01.610> shall<00:03:01.850> work<00:03:02.090> also<00:03:02.720> I<00:03:02.959> don't<00:03:03.170> even<00:03:03.260> think

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
this shall work also I don't even think

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.229 
this shall work also I don't even think
I've<00:03:03.590> ever<00:03:03.770> touched<00:03:04.040> upon<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.850> lighting

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
I've ever touched upon the lighting

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.620 
I've ever touched upon the lighting
setup<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:06.470> I've<00:03:06.560> got<00:03:06.709> some<00:03:06.980> black<00:03:07.430> boards<00:03:07.910> that

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
setup so I've got some black boards that

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.660 
setup so I've got some black boards that
will<00:03:08.959> reflect<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.620> light<00:03:09.830> directly<00:03:10.340> over

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
will reflect the light directly over

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.660 
will reflect the light directly over
here<00:03:11.110> usually<00:03:12.110> if<00:03:12.200> I'm<00:03:12.320> filming<00:03:12.709> I'll<00:03:13.280> take

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
here usually if I'm filming I'll take

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.940 
here usually if I'm filming I'll take
this<00:03:13.880> little<00:03:13.940> lamp<00:03:14.450> here<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:14.840> I'll<00:03:14.959> lean<00:03:15.769> it

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
this little lamp here and I'll lean it

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.699 
this little lamp here and I'll lean it
over<00:03:16.070> so<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:16.610> light<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:16.820> much<00:03:17.209> better<00:03:17.709> but

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
over so the light is much better but

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.020 
over so the light is much better but
that's<00:03:18.890> basically<00:03:19.070> just<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.610> simple

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
that's basically just the simple

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.120 
that's basically just the simple
lighting<00:03:20.420> setup<00:03:20.660> it's<00:03:20.810> something<00:03:21.140> really

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
lighting setup it's something really

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.800 
lighting setup it's something really
complicated<00:03:22.459> sometimes<00:03:23.060> if<00:03:23.269> I<00:03:23.420> have<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.600> lot<00:03:23.780> of

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
complicated sometimes if I have a lot of

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.810 
complicated sometimes if I have a lot of
shadows<00:03:24.200> I'll<00:03:24.380> take<00:03:24.560> this<00:03:24.680> little<00:03:24.980> handy

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
shadows I'll take this little handy

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.670 
shadows I'll take this little handy
thing<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.420> which<00:03:26.780> is<00:03:26.900> magnetic<00:03:27.049> so<00:03:27.380> I<00:03:27.530> can

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
thing and which is magnetic so I can

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.220 
thing and which is magnetic so I can
stick<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.130> my<00:03:28.250> TV<00:03:28.910> which<00:03:29.239> by<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.480> way<00:03:29.570> is

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
stick it to my TV which by the way is

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.940 
stick it to my TV which by the way is
really<00:03:31.220> cool<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:32.480> moves<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.080> stuff<00:03:33.200> here<00:03:33.530> so

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
really cool it moves and stuff here so

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.590 
really cool it moves and stuff here so
usually<00:03:34.640> if<00:03:34.730> I'm<00:03:34.820> doing<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.120> review<00:03:35.420> in<00:03:35.540> the
