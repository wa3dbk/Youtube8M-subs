on<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.899> side<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.259> me<00:01:37.590> now<00:01:38.340> she's<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
on this side of me now she's in the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.600 
on this side of me now she's in the
wrong<00:01:39.180> spot<00:01:39.659> oh<00:01:39.960> I'm<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> wrong<00:01:41.280> spot

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
wrong spot oh I'm in the wrong spot

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.100 
wrong spot oh I'm in the wrong spot
however<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.119> want<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.299> look<00:01:42.360> at<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.780> so

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
however you want to look at it so

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.959 
however you want to look at it so
ideally<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.950> be<00:01:44.070> offset<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:44.850> each

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
ideally we have to be offset with each

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.139 
ideally we have to be offset with each
other<00:01:45.829> never<00:01:46.829> too<00:01:47.070> far<00:01:47.100> apart<00:01:47.460> we're<00:01:48.000> all

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
other never too far apart we're all

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.240 
other never too far apart we're all
different<00:01:48.360> shapes<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.990> sizes<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.740> how<00:01:49.920> close

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
different shapes and sizes so how close

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.100 
different shapes and sizes so how close
is<00:01:50.460> too<00:01:50.490> close<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:51.180> always<00:01:51.840> going<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.020> be

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
is too close is always going to be

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.010 
is too close is always going to be
relative<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.890> individual<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:53.939> nice<00:01:54.750> and

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
relative to the individual so nice and

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.340 
relative to the individual so nice and
close<00:01:55.590> together<00:01:56.299> keeping<00:01:57.299> your<00:01:57.390> arms<00:01:57.600> level

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
close together keeping your arms level

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.620 
close together keeping your arms level

going to have a single hand hold some of

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.480 
going to have a single hand hold some of
the<00:02:10.410> steps<00:02:10.620> we're<00:02:10.800> going<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.980> do<00:02:11.130> are<00:02:11.280> going<00:02:11.400> to

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
the steps we're going to do are going to

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.030 
the steps we're going to do are going to
use<00:02:11.580> also<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.270> handhold<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.800> you're<00:02:13.950> going

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
to have to be able to move

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.630 
to have to be able to move
and<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.930> will<00:02:16.170> move<00:02:16.410> through<00:02:16.710> all<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.250> these

and you will move through all of these
dance<00:02:18.000> positions<00:02:18.510> as<00:02:18.720> we<00:02:18.930> learn<00:02:19.200> these<00:02:19.860> two

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
dance positions as we learn these two

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.760 
dance positions as we learn these two
step<00:02:20.730> variations<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.290> how<00:02:22.470> your

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
step variations so this is how your

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.340 
step variations so this is how your
dance<00:02:23.069> position<00:02:23.250> works<00:02:23.959> don't<00:02:24.959> forget<00:02:25.200> it

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
dance position works don't forget it
