note no issues at all pretty much a
standard<00:01:12.190> style<00:01:12.700> axle<00:01:13.299> oh<00:01:13.509> I<00:01:14.140> didn't<00:01:14.619> like<00:01:15.009> I

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
standard style axle oh I didn't like I

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.219 
standard style axle oh I didn't like I
said<00:01:15.310> didn't<00:01:15.549> have<00:01:15.670> any<00:01:15.820> problems<00:01:16.000> with<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:16.630> it

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
said didn't have any problems with it it

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.030 
said didn't have any problems with it it
they're<00:01:17.860> very<00:01:18.009> small<00:01:18.549> a<00:01:18.880> widthwise<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:20.380> if

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
they're very small a widthwise and if

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.389 
they're very small a widthwise and if
you<00:01:21.250> can<00:01:21.399> really<00:01:21.729> tell<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:23.680> less<00:01:23.950> than<00:01:24.220> the

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
you can really tell it's less than the

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.880 
you can really tell it's less than the
hand<00:01:26.789> but<00:01:27.789> that's<00:01:28.780> cool<00:01:29.049> no<00:01:29.320> problem<00:01:29.619> just

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
hand but that's cool no problem just

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.559 
hand but that's cool no problem just
just<00:01:30.190> something<00:01:30.520> I<00:01:30.610> know<00:01:30.789> it's<00:01:31.090> different

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
just something I know it's different

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.419 
just something I know it's different
plastic<00:01:34.569> is<00:01:34.659> very<00:01:35.140> stiff<00:01:35.590> I<00:01:35.800> hope<00:01:36.009> it<00:01:36.130> doesn't

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
plastic is very stiff I hope it doesn't

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.510 
plastic is very stiff I hope it doesn't
become<00:01:36.490> brittle<00:01:37.060> want<00:01:37.210> to<00:01:37.270> get<00:01:37.390> in<00:01:37.569> the<00:01:37.750> cold

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
become brittle want to get in the cold

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.219 
become brittle want to get in the cold
it's<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.580> very<00:01:40.679> stiff<00:01:41.679> plastic<00:01:42.840> see<00:01:43.840> how<00:01:43.990> that

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
it's a very stiff plastic see how that

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.760 
it's a very stiff plastic see how that
holds<00:01:44.649> up<00:01:44.830> look<00:01:45.580> fairly<00:01:46.509> easy<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.259> cut

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
holds up look fairly easy to cut

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.809 
holds up look fairly easy to cut
actually<00:01:50.069> being<00:01:51.069> so<00:01:51.340> stiff<00:01:51.729> but<00:01:53.429> it's<00:01:54.429> okay

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
actually being so stiff but it's okay

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.080 
actually being so stiff but it's okay
the<00:01:55.470> plastic<00:01:56.470> on<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.649> other<00:01:56.950> kid<00:01:57.250> is<00:01:57.369> on<00:01:57.729> the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
the plastic on the other kid is on the

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.749 
the plastic on the other kid is on the
r1<00:01:58.600> kit<00:01:58.990> from<00:01:59.229> gma's<00:01:59.679> pretty<00:02:00.069> stiff<00:02:00.340> as<00:02:00.520> well

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
r1 kit from gma's pretty stiff as well

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:07.980 
r1 kit from gma's pretty stiff as well
but<00:02:01.569> that<00:02:01.690> doesn't<00:02:01.869> seem<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.289> be<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.440> problem<00:02:06.990> so

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
but that doesn't seem to be a problem so

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.530 
but that doesn't seem to be a problem so
I'm<00:02:08.170> just<00:02:08.410> putting<00:02:08.709> on<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.970> diff<00:02:13.180> cover

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
I'm just putting on the the diff cover

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.650 
I'm just putting on the the diff cover
to<00:02:14.110> wrap<00:02:14.350> up<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:17.579> ramp<00:02:18.579> up<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.970> rear<00:02:19.150> axle

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
to wrap up the ramp up the rear axle

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.750 
to wrap up the ramp up the rear axle
here<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.670> then<00:02:21.670> it's<00:02:21.880> on<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:23.040> installing<00:02:24.040> the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
here and then it's on to installing the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
here and then it's on to installing the
leaf<00:02:24.970> springs<00:02:28.230> on<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.530> these<00:02:29.709> axles

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.650 

so<00:02:38.040> that'll<00:02:39.040> be<00:02:39.160> about<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:40.470> for<00:02:41.470> these<00:02:41.590> axles

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
so that'll be about it for these axles

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.110 
so that'll be about it for these axles
like<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:43.690> said<00:02:43.950> nothing<00:02:44.950> different<00:02:45.520> nothing

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
like I said nothing different nothing

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.449 
like I said nothing different nothing
substantial<00:02:47.250> substantially<00:02:48.250> different

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
substantial substantially different

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:56.309 
substantial substantially different
about<00:02:48.940> these<00:02:51.120> these<00:02:53.069> Phillips<00:02:54.630> screws<00:02:55.630> are

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
about these these Phillips screws are

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.880 
about these these Phillips screws are
already<00:02:56.920> killing<00:02:57.190> me<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.500> might<00:02:59.680> not

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
already killing me that that might not

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.070 
already killing me that that might not
be<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:00.130> problem<00:03:00.489> with<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.850> Phillips<00:03:01.270> other

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
be a problem with the Phillips other

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.780 
be a problem with the Phillips other
than<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.590> fact<00:03:02.770> that<00:03:02.980> I've<00:03:03.190> got<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.550> in<00:03:03.670> my

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
than the fact that I've got it in my

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.880 
than the fact that I've got it in my
head<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.060> these<00:03:04.569> kids<00:03:04.900> should<00:03:04.989> have<00:03:05.170> hex<00:03:05.620> in

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
head that these kids should have hex in

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.229 
head that these kids should have hex in
them<00:03:06.160> so<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:08.489> can't<00:03:09.489> get<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:09.820> out<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.030> my<00:03:10.150> head

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
them so I can't get that out of my head

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.259 
them so I can't get that out of my head
that<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:13.090> screwdriver<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:15.820> looks<00:03:16.150> like

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
that and this screwdriver it looks like

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.610 
that and this screwdriver it looks like
it<00:03:16.420> might<00:03:16.810> be<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:17.019> little<00:03:17.200> bit<00:03:17.440> more

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
it might be a little bit more

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.370 
it might be a little bit more
comfortable<00:03:18.070> but<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.870> don't<00:03:19.870> find<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:20.350> too

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
comfortable but I don't find it too

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.040 
comfortable but I don't find it too
comfortable<00:03:20.950> at<00:03:21.160> all<00:03:21.310> actually<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:22.780> is<00:03:22.959> the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
comfortable at all actually this is the

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.100 
comfortable at all actually this is the
only<00:03:23.170> small<00:03:23.620> screwdriver<00:03:24.190> i<00:03:24.310> have<00:03:24.900> don't<00:03:25.900> plan
