00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hi girls, how are you? 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.009
 well they see me with the makeup the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.629
 same clothes the same pepa next to it is 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.580
 because I'm optimizing and recording 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.929
 taking advantage of what I can do if you 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.519
 they listen to baby davis because 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.960
 I'm just watching the pepa is 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.940
 watching TV and obviously if I want 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.560
 record I can not wait for the pepa 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.180
 sleep because the pepa sometimes does not sleep 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.609
 well I will talk to you today I accepted 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.720
 try to be known is the mess 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.560
 so I buy it 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.150
 this I bought it is to put it in my 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.590
 makeup kit professionally 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.270
 it's just showing why I find 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.489
 which is wonderful if you like it 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.949
 a lot to take care of your eyebrows this is very good 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.570
 for you it's worth almost 40 thousand pesos 80 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.970
 dollars I think the weight is too excessive 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.610
 but at least I eat here now 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.790
 I depend on this so that's why with this 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.230
 this salt is the kit comes depends on the 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.530
 color of ezeiza that you want I chose 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.260
 this because it is the most common losantos 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.540
 comes with this small cosmetiquera 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.939
 where the whole set comes a 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.949
 indicative of how to get eyebrows like 

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:04.430
 arm the eyebrows of the video you can 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.320
 see this if you want to ask me for a 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.790
 special video I do I tell them how 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:15.380
 do a 2.0 eyebrow already and it comes with everything 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.880
 it's nice it comes with a brush 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.020
 this one itself 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.030
 the powder to make up in the shadows 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.700
 the tweezers that are great and the famous 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.220
 gel the gel I listened to him talking about this 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.220
 in the American tutorials good 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.510
 good is this way 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.620
 here you can see the clips that 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.660
 they are of precision that I have them 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.210
 stored in this way the 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.070
 tweezers actually come with this clamp 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.110
 that I tried her she is very cool is 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.890
 quite pretty accurate but you have to 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.350
 take care 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.180
 the famous gel that is transparent does not 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.080
 has color and the grace it has is that 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.080
 leave your eyebrows 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.729
 fixed is like a little glue of 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.609
 eyebrows will not keep it open because 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.549
 it dries up and it also comes with its small 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:06.549
 brush here 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.769
 to give me your hand here comes the part 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.569
 to comb and here comes the part to 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.450
 make up your eyebrows now you look 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:17.650
 as they make up carolina because 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.049
 comes with your daughter's hand comes with 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.090
 their shadows come in different points 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.090
 of shadows I chose a shade of shade and 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.720
 it is enough 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.060
 quite as a couple already there you 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.400
 can see what it has to leave quite 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.550
 thrown to the blond and a few 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.140
 thrown to black like mine what is the 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.519
 problem 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.319
 you can make a mixture of both 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.209
 I do not recommend using the very 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.569
 coffee because you are going to see her looks very 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.160
 It lasts very hard already but the grace that 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.069
 they come and go after I'm going to show you 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.810
 have with these stencil that the area I know 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.190
 what do you have that comes with some measures and 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.269
 you can see it and you are going 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.120
 placing the arch and eyebrow are assembled and 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.980
 I like it because the quality of the plastic 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.660
 it's pretty good comes with the measurements 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.329
 so that the eyebrows of that pretty 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.250
 symmetrical one of the other and it comes with the 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.290
 forms depending on what you want 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.430
 doing this greatly benefits girls 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.730
 that they do not know they want to arm themselves more 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.159
 the price I already told you, it 's worth it 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.540
 only if you like taking care of 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.609
 eyebrows I have one that is too much 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.790
 excessive because I bought it they ask me 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.790
 your 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.319
 I bought it because I'm makeup 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.270
 professional and I need to love the eyebrow 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.790
 Many of my clients do not have eyebrows 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.560
 then for me it is quite and apart 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.690
 that had scattered all over the 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.870
 shade coffee the dyes then it is 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.459
 you take with leaves so they are from bs 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.170

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.319
 understand is the good order online 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.670

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.950
 that you have liked sorry for the 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.110
