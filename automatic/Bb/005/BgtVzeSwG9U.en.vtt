00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.290 
like my video for the toothpaste one um
if<00:03:42.700> this<00:03:43.180> doesn't<00:03:43.420> work<00:03:44.490> then<00:03:45.490> I<00:03:45.520> suggest<00:03:45.850> just

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
if this doesn't work then I suggest just

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.480 
if this doesn't work then I suggest just
going<00:03:46.630> back<00:03:46.750> to<00:03:46.810> nail<00:03:47.260> glue<00:03:47.560> or<00:03:47.800> even<00:03:48.100> eyelash

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
going back to nail glue or even eyelash

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.140 
going back to nail glue or even eyelash
glue<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:49.950> hopefully<00:03:50.950> that<00:03:51.190> won't<00:03:51.370> hurt<00:03:52.000> your

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
glue and hopefully that won't hurt your

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.250 
glue and hopefully that won't hurt your
stomach<00:03:52.270> um<00:03:53.130> thanks<00:03:54.130> guys<00:03:54.310> for<00:03:54.340> watching<00:03:55.260> see
