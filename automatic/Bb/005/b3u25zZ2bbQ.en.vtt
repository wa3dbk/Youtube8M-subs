has<00:00:58.230> been<00:00:58.489> quality<00:00:59.489> here<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.690> connect<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
has been quality here you connect the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.310 
has been quality here you connect the
plane<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> controller<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.879> charge<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.480> it

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
plane to the controller to charge it it

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.730 
plane to the controller to charge it it
flies<00:01:04.979> up<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.280> 500<00:01:05.909> feet<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:07.580> yeah<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:09.740> level

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
flies up to 500 feet and yeah it's level

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.740 
flies up to 500 feet and yeah it's level
2<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.189> great<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.700> fliers<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:12.420> some

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
2 is great for fliers with some

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.420 
2 is great for fliers with some
experience<00:01:13.020> which<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.880> no<00:01:15.150> experience<00:01:15.540> so

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
experience which I have no experience so

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.249 
experience which I have no experience so
I'm<00:01:17.430> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.790> try<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.570> get<00:01:18.689> used<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
I'm going to try and get used to the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.560 
I'm going to try and get used to the
throttle<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.979> stuff<00:01:20.250> before<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.970> try<00:01:21.299> flying

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
throttle and stuff before I try flying

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.770 
throttle and stuff before I try flying
it<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:25.710> remote<00:01:26.009> here<00:01:26.490> says<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.820> only<00:01:27.299> links

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
it the remote here says that only links

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.109 
it the remote here says that only links
to<00:01:28.080> my<00:01:28.259> aircraft<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.689> if<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:31.259> use<00:01:31.500> two

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
to my aircraft so if you use two

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.810 
to my aircraft so if you use two
transmitters<00:01:33.119> with<00:01:33.680> another<00:01:34.680> plane<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.430> won't

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
transmitters with another plane it won't

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.649 
transmitters with another plane it won't
interfere<00:01:37.159> but<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.579> no<00:01:38.790> idea<00:01:39.150> how<00:01:39.420> big

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
interfere but I have no idea how big

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.330 
interfere but I have no idea how big
this<00:01:39.900> thing<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.200> because<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.770> haven't<00:01:40.950> opened

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
this thing is because I haven't opened

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.539 
this thing is because I haven't opened
it<00:01:41.460> yet<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:42.210> bought<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.560> I'm<00:01:44.220> going

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
it yet and I just bought it so I'm going

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.350 
it yet and I just bought it so I'm going
to<00:01:44.670> get<00:01:45.560> I<00:01:46.560> guess<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.520> use<00:01:47.670> my<00:01:47.880> name<00:01:47.939> on<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
to get I guess I can use my name on the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:02:03.030 
to get I guess I can use my name on the
tape<00:01:54.020> pretty<00:01:55.020> lightweight<00:01:55.200> tape

stuff<00:03:42.049> but<00:03:42.530> I'll<00:03:43.160> get<00:03:43.370> into<00:03:43.610> this<00:03:43.730> later

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
stuff but I'll get into this later

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:55.440 
stuff but I'll get into this later
because<00:03:44.390> you<00:03:44.750> just<00:03:45.530> want<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:47.709> put<00:03:48.709> these

you know you always want to get straight
to<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.420> aircraft<00:03:59.420> or<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.780> vehicle<00:04:00.910> well<00:04:01.910> then

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
to the aircraft or the vehicle well then

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.830 
to the aircraft or the vehicle well then
it's<00:04:02.270> tiny

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
it's tiny

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:32.430

okay<00:05:57.470> here's<00:05:58.470> a<00:05:58.530> transmitter<00:05:59.070> it's<00:05:59.250> pretty

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
okay here's a transmitter it's pretty

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.010 
okay here's a transmitter it's pretty
light<00:05:59.730> and<00:06:00.000> durable<00:06:00.740> plastic<00:06:02.690> here's<00:06:03.690> the

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
light and durable plastic here's the

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.230 
light and durable plastic here's the
trim<00:06:04.890> on<00:06:05.190> it<00:06:05.220> I<00:06:05.550> don't<00:06:05.730> want<00:06:05.850> to<00:06:05.910> mess<00:06:06.060> ahead

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
trim on it I don't want to mess ahead

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.120 
trim on it I don't want to mess ahead
hook<00:06:06.560> but<00:06:07.560> yeah

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
hook but yeah

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.590 
hook but yeah
turning<00:06:08.610> right<00:06:08.760> and<00:06:09.060> then<00:06:09.240> there's<00:06:09.420> the

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
turning right and then there's the

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.640 
turning right and then there's the
throttle<00:06:10.050> I<00:06:10.410> think<00:06:11.250> this<00:06:11.370> takes<00:06:11.640> like<00:06:12.650> six

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
throttle I think this takes like six

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.590 
throttle I think this takes like six
double-a<00:06:14.430> batteries<00:06:15.110> so<00:06:16.110> I<00:06:16.350> don't<00:06:16.620> know<00:06:17.600> where

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
double-a batteries so I don't know where

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.840 
double-a batteries so I don't know where
those<00:06:18.810> go<00:06:21.890> this<00:06:22.890> must<00:06:23.160> be<00:06:23.340> the<00:06:23.430> Harding

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
those go this must be the Harding

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:57.410 
those go this must be the Harding
station<00:06:53.390> but<00:06:54.390> there's<00:06:55.290> the<00:06:56.210> button<00:06:57.210> right

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 
station but there's the button right

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.410 
station but there's the button right
there<00:06:58.400> look<00:06:59.400> into<00:06:59.670> this<00:06:59.790> later

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:00.420 
there look into this later

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:12.550 
there look into this later
oh<00:07:00.450> wait<00:07:02.240> it<00:07:03.240> just<00:07:03.480> goes<00:07:03.690> right<00:07:03.900> in<00:07:04.050> here

extends or anything but I'll get the

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.500 
extends or anything but I'll get the
plane<00:07:16.290> all<00:07:16.500> set<00:07:16.740> up<00:07:16.890> here<00:07:17.250> we<00:07:17.400> have<00:07:17.550> it<00:07:17.700> put<00:07:18.420> it

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:18.510 
plane all set up here we have it put it

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.560 
plane all set up here we have it put it
all<00:07:18.600> together<00:07:18.780> it<00:07:19.110> takes<00:07:19.350> little<00:07:20.190> plugs<00:07:20.570> stick

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:21.570 
all together it takes little plugs stick

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.930 
all together it takes little plugs stick
in<00:07:21.690> to<00:07:22.080> connect<00:07:22.350> to<00:07:22.500> the<00:07:22.590> motors<00:07:22.890> but<00:07:23.820> yeah

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940 
in to connect to the motors but yeah

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.580 
in to connect to the motors but yeah
it's<00:07:24.120> pretty<00:07:24.300> lightweight<00:07:24.540> plane<00:07:24.900> pretty

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.590 
it's pretty lightweight plane pretty

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.360 
it's pretty lightweight plane pretty
adorable<00:07:25.950> actually<00:07:27.170> I'll<00:07:28.170> have<00:07:28.890> to<00:07:29.040> charge<00:07:29.310> it

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:29.370 
adorable actually I'll have to charge it

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.860 
adorable actually I'll have to charge it
up<00:07:29.520> when<00:07:29.730> I<00:07:29.790> get<00:07:29.970> the<00:07:30.060> batteries<00:07:30.420> in<00:07:30.570> there<00:07:30.720> not

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:30.870 
up when I get the batteries in there not

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.360 
up when I get the batteries in there not
but<00:07:31.200> yeah<00:07:31.410> it's<00:07:31.830> styrofoam<00:07:32.120> pretty<00:07:33.120> light<00:07:33.330> and

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:34.370 
but yeah it's styrofoam pretty light and

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.530 
but yeah it's styrofoam pretty light and
here's<00:07:35.370> the<00:07:35.520> off<00:07:35.670> and<00:07:35.940> on<00:07:36.030> button<00:07:36.360> right<00:07:36.510> there

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:36.540 
here's the off and on button right there

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.650 
here's the off and on button right there
and<00:07:37.050> if<00:07:37.170> I<00:07:37.350> turn<00:07:37.590> it<00:07:37.800> on

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:40.660 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.660 

start<00:07:40.960> spinning<00:07:41.290> but<00:07:41.650> I<00:07:41.920> think<00:07:42.490> that's<00:07:42.610> just

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:42.670 
start spinning but I think that's just

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.750 
start spinning but I think that's just
because<00:07:42.880> it's<00:07:43.150> dead<00:07:43.440> so<00:07:44.440> I'll<00:07:45.280> have<00:07:45.490> to<00:07:45.580> learn

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:45.760 
because it's dead so I'll have to learn

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.620 
because it's dead so I'll have to learn
a<00:07:45.790> little<00:07:45.970> bit<00:07:46.120> more<00:07:46.240> about<00:07:46.630> this<00:07:46.870> plane<00:07:47.580> but

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:48.630 
a little bit more about this plane but

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.450 
a little bit more about this plane but
the<00:07:49.630> tables<00:07:50.410> kind<00:07:50.530> of<00:07:50.680> been<00:07:50.800> tell<00:07:51.010> if<00:07:51.130> we<00:07:51.250> fix

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:51.460 
the tables kind of been tell if we fix

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.630 
the tables kind of been tell if we fix
that<00:07:51.690> but<00:07:52.690> it's<00:07:53.350> pretty<00:07:53.680> doral<00:07:54.310> plane

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:54.640 
that but it's pretty doral plane

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.930 
that but it's pretty doral plane
actually<00:07:55.120> got<00:07:55.930> little<00:07:56.250> indents<00:07:57.250> in<00:07:57.400> there<00:07:57.550> to

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:57.940 
actually got little indents in there to

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.780 
actually got little indents in there to
help<00:07:58.060> with<00:07:58.240> cooling<00:07:58.720> and<00:07:59.310> I<00:08:00.310> think<00:08:00.550> I'm<00:08:00.670> gonna

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:00.790 
help with cooling and I think I'm gonna

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.620 
help with cooling and I think I'm gonna
have<00:08:00.940> fun<00:08:01.180> with<00:08:01.330> this<00:08:01.480> thing<00:08:01.750> I<00:08:01.990> really<00:08:02.470> do<00:08:02.650> I
