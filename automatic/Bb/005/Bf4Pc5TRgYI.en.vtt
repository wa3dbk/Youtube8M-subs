00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
what i loved about it was the game mode

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.870 
what i loved about it was the game mode
was<00:01:24.689> actually<00:01:25.200> heavily<00:01:25.710> objective<00:01:26.610> based

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
was actually heavily objective based

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.460 
was actually heavily objective based
which<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.240> something<00:01:27.420> i<00:01:27.750> was<00:01:27.960> really<00:01:28.229> hoping

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470

for<00:01:28.920> with<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.460> destiny<00:01:29.850> because<00:01:30.180> most<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
for with in destiny because most of the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.870 
for with in destiny because most of the
game<00:01:31.079> modes<00:01:31.350> are<00:01:31.530> mostly<00:01:32.220> based<00:01:32.610> around

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
game modes are mostly based around

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.200 
game modes are mostly based around
getting<00:01:33.509> killed<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.590> was<00:01:34.920> good<00:01:35.280> my<00:01:35.939> next

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
getting killed so that was good my next
