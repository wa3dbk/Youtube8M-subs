very very similar area as to where I
spawned<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.670> then<00:01:39.420> you're<00:01:39.509> gonna<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.810> this

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
spawned and then you're gonna have this

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.170 
spawned and then you're gonna have this
large<00:01:40.290> gasp<00:01:40.590> throwing<00:01:41.040> fireballs<00:01:41.549> at<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.850> and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
large gasp throwing fireballs at you and

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.550 
large gasp throwing fireballs at you and
what<00:01:42.360> you're<00:01:42.479> gonna<00:01:42.600> need<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.380> you're

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
what you're gonna need to do is you're

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.499 
what you're gonna need to do is you're
gonna<00:01:43.619> need<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:44.009> time<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.460> fireball<00:01:45.000> as<00:01:45.210> it's

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
gonna need to time the fireball as it's

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.170 
gonna need to time the fireball as it's
about<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.110> hit<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.710> then<00:01:47.340> use<00:01:47.640> your<00:01:47.670> sword

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
about to hit you and then use your sword

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.510 
about to hit you and then use your sword
to<00:01:48.329> hit<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.869> back<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.470> make<00:01:49.860> sure<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.399> you

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
to hit it back and make sure that you

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.850 
to hit it back and make sure that you
you're<00:01:51.030> aiming<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.659> fireball<00:01:52.200> at<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.619> ghast

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
you're aiming that fireball at the ghast

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.069 
you're aiming that fireball at the ghast
and<00:01:53.189> that'll<00:01:53.939> happen<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.540> hopefully<00:01:54.659> it'll

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
and that'll happen and hopefully it'll

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.230 
and that'll happen and hopefully it'll
go<00:01:55.229> down<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.979> closer<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.640> are<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.060> gas

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
go down the closer you are to the gas

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.209 
go down the closer you are to the gas
the<00:01:57.540> better<00:01:57.780> chance<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.009> hitting

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the better chance you have of it hitting

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.429 
the better chance you have of it hitting
it<00:01:59.430> back<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.909> timings<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.810> lot<00:02:00.960> easier<00:02:01.350> if

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
it back and timings a lot easier if

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.679 
it back and timings a lot easier if
you're<00:02:01.560> really<00:02:01.710> really<00:02:01.920> close<00:02:02.479> now<00:02:03.479> if<00:02:03.570> you're

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
you're really really close now if you're

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.240 
you're really really close now if you're
really<00:02:03.810> struggling<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.409> did<00:02:04.560> hear<00:02:04.740> some<00:02:04.950> people

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
really struggling I did hear some people

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.760 
really struggling I did hear some people
have<00:02:05.460> luck<00:02:06.060> using<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.840> bow<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.170> arrow<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.409> hit

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
have luck using the bow and arrow to hit

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.550 
have luck using the bow and arrow to hit
the<00:02:08.300> fireball<00:02:09.300> as<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:09.720> very<00:02:09.780> close<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
the fireball as it's very close to the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.680 
the fireball as it's very close to the
ghast<00:02:10.800> I'm<00:02:11.160> not<00:02:11.550> sure<00:02:11.760> if<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.030> 100%

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
ghast I'm not sure if this is 100%

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.370 
ghast I'm not sure if this is 100%
accurate<00:02:13.080> but<00:02:13.170> you

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
