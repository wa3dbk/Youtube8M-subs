00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Welcome to the ear of see and know today 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.629
 today we are going to make pancakes 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.480
 vegans but I'm not alone I'm with a 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.320
 guest who is blogger youtuber del 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.380
 dolce placard diana and truth 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.380
 and 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.760
 let's make many videos 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:33.340
 but we'll still teach all this 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.340
 kind of life 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.440
 and to make the pancakes we need 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.440
 the next ingredients 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:52.610
 for soy milk oil essence of 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.260
 vanilla and a ripe banana so precocious 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.270
 and cough that has more static nutrients 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
 and it 's better 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.540
 recommended this soy milk that the 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.540
 you can find in organic 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.259
 to prepare the pancakes we grab 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.259
 a bowl and we toss a cup of flour 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.170
 then we put two teaspoons of powder 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.170
 to bake 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.080
 to that we add 2 tablespoons of 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.080
 blond sugar 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.660
 and then what we 're going to do is take out the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.230
 banana on a plate until it looks like 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.230
 a puree 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.270
 and we put it in the bowl 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.550
 and we mix everything 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:10.440
 and we put a cup of soy milk 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.440
 I'm so silly when my life mixes 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.020
 Now we put a spoonful of oil 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.020
 vegetable 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.580
 at 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.150
 and now we put a few spurts of 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.150
 vanilla essence 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.080
 to 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.590
 and what we have to do with that is 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.720
 mix one well well well well and then 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.150
 we're just going to fry and we have the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.350
 Any is without lumps with brand of 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.540
 tabs 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.440
 you do not have to use a lot of oil just 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.440
 we use a little 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.220
 look, I will not go from maleficent anymore 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.370
 effective 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.140
 i 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.640
 I recommend using a soft bucket 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.640
 but to put the mixture in the pan 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.800
 to me 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.700
 he has a son 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:19.170
 and your son has a pepper too 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.170
 because it has cost as we knew 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.370
 I can eat 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.030
 we have to wait for the mixture to 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.990
 that she has several bubbles and that 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.990
 says we can turn it around 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.880
 do not 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.480
 we lost 3 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.480
 sorry 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.940
 two 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.069
 i 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.800
 there you go again putting oil 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.849
 after a couple of pancakes more or 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.849
 less we return to throw 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:19.620
 and it's ready for us to have 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.010
 more than happy 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:07.300
 It would be super weird eating 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.570
 A) Yes 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.020

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.780
