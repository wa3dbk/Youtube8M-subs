a few things this system definitely
works<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.209> slow<00:02:06.649> but<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.799> works<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:08.369> mean<00:02:09.030> this

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
works it's slow but it works I mean this

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.430 
works it's slow but it works I mean this
is<00:02:09.240> like<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.479> sixth<00:02:09.869> time<00:02:09.899> I've<00:02:10.229> done<00:02:10.259> this

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
is like the sixth time I've done this

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.080 
is like the sixth time I've done this
and<00:02:10.819> I<00:02:11.819> think<00:02:12.030> maybe<00:02:12.150> one<00:02:12.510> person<00:02:12.620> one<00:02:14.090> didn't

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and I think maybe one person one didn't

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.270 
and I think maybe one person one didn't
get<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.330> shirt<00:02:15.599> I<00:02:15.840> mean<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.830> know<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:16.980> think

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
get the shirt I mean you know I think

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.190 
get the shirt I mean you know I think
another<00:02:17.430> guide<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.849> get<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.030> right<00:02:18.180> size<00:02:18.450> but

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
another guide and get the right size but

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.110 
another guide and get the right size but
at<00:02:19.319> all<00:02:19.470> though<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.740> mean<00:02:19.890> what's<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> 500

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
at all though I mean what's that a 500

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.530 
at all though I mean what's that a 500
delivery<00:02:21.480> that's<00:02:21.750> pretty<00:02:21.930> good<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:23.700> that's

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
delivery that's pretty good so that's

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.580 
delivery that's pretty good so that's
pretty<00:02:24.780> cool

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
pretty cool

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.589 
pretty cool
so<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.190> think<00:02:26.849> we're<00:02:27.060> going<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.269> just<00:02:27.390> stick

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
so I think we're going to just stick

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.920 
so I think we're going to just stick
with<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:27.900> for<00:02:27.959> now<00:02:28.489> until<00:02:29.840> something<00:02:30.840> else

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
with this for now until something else

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.690 
with this for now until something else
there's<00:02:31.470> something<00:02:31.800> else<00:02:31.920> going<00:02:32.040> on<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.550> once

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
there's something else going on and once

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.600 
there's something else going on and once
that's<00:02:32.879> developed<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.720> up<00:02:34.250> then<00:02:35.250> we'll<00:02:35.370> start
