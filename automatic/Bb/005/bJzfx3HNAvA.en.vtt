00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
the little speeder and um my base is

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.820 
the little speeder and um my base is
kind<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.420> changed<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:07.870> put<00:03:08.050> that<00:03:08.170> turn<00:03:08.410> up<00:03:08.590> there

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
kind of changed I put that turn up there

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
I got Cody and box and then edges right

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.000 
I got Cody and box and then edges right
there<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.660> there's<00:03:19.870> fringe<00:03:20.200> in<00:03:20.410> baqara'<00:03:20.740> and

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
there and there's fringe in baqara' and

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
her down here and there's a green base

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.260 
her down here and there's a green base
plate<00:03:41.980> which<00:03:42.280> I<00:03:42.400> don't<00:03:42.580> know<00:03:42.670> what<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:42.880> do<00:03:43.060> with
