00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.610

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.250
 great and I'm in great shape and 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.689
 especially very happy to find you 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.550
 for this new video finally more 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.690
 precisely for this new commentary 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.339
 we are not on my personal channel 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.930
 today conducted on the chain of 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:40.100
 team rage the garages 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.390
 so first of all you have to 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.850
 ask who am I because this is the 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.230
 first time they hear you down 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.820
 on youtube or in any case on the channel 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.640
 of the rage team you may have seen me 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.600
 in a short video basically I'm 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.860
 present in this video 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.570
 but first of all I will introduce you 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.909
 the gameplay today guys that's 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.430
 crazy gameplay it's a double 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.409
 dna indeed bland or in melee 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.930
 general on the solar map its gameplay 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.640
 of rage cei so you see a lot 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.170
 right now my opinion on 1,13 is 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.909
 intimate rage because it's already tempted 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.110
 a triple dna lane both he has 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.490
 does he put in any case it was a big 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.200
 gameplay today makes us a 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.189
 double dna in general melee it's not 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.930
 every day we see that so the 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.490
 guys if you do not know it is that 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.540
 really invites you to go see this 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.030
 he's doing on his youtube channel 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.109
 it's really big big gameplay 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.240
 and I find that performance players 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:23.810
 today are really not known 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.549
 for what they do 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.020
 because here I am personally 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.149
 introduced me right after but I'm doing 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.770
 fun and it's really easier 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.939
 to be known that in the end to win 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.229
 subscribers in any case because known 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.299
 it's a big word as well as the virtual 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.770
 my brief is really simpler 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.390
 to have subscribers when we're having fun 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.439
 that when we do rock performance 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.939
 for example at the level of the chains 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.009
 community I have a chain of 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.149
 4000 subscribers pretty much and that's it 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.520
 thanks to community channels then 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.689
 what are the chains performance on the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.380
 community website performance did 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.759
 really not much 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.439
 So it's complicated to be 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.609
 to know when we do perf 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.960
 for that really invites you to go 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.520
 see what does it do that he has that two 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.960
 one thousand three hundred subscribers it's already not 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.249
 badly you will not say what 2300 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.319
 badly subscribers to compare to youtube for 

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:02.090
 those of 1300 subscribers are still 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.619
 many more subscribers but 2300 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.389
 people in front of you imagine nothing 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.759
 that that's still a lot of 

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:08.780
 people while I have a lot 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.429
 more subscribers than him while 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.080
 frankly ben here he has a level 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.190
 extraordinary compare to me me I 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.050
 I'm really rotten at call of 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.490
 bah and suddenly I think he deserves 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.960
 many more people on his channel 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.850
 youtube and 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.560
 performance players in overall merit 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.180
 I think more people on his chair 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.560
 of order on their pardon chain so 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.300
 basically if you have a chain 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.950
 performance and if you struggle to be 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.480
 known frankly I invite you to 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.040
 You really persevere persevere the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.660
 you do not have to give up and that's it 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.130
 brief there you could see in the 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.080
 gameplay he already unlocked indiana 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.120
 because I actually accelerated between 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.830
 every kill because sometimes it was 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.270
 enough no and to avoid you to see that 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.680
 as knows the holiday periods etc 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.970
 I think you spend a lot of 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.600
 time with your family and that you 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.550
 eat a lot 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.870
 so bah you may not have 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.790
 enough time to watch videos 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.500
 that's why you did you I 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.790
 have accelerated some moments for you 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.530
 avoid seeing stuff a little 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.180
 uninteresting I left you right and 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.500
 he and then that's it so he already has 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.000
 unlocked his first aces did indeed 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.560
 not and as you could see the 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.120
 technique it was basically I think 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.510
 you know her but he left the 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.820
 part 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.500
 and there he went in recent join he 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.420
 joined the same part is basically there 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.100
 will retry a dna so I do you 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.210
 spoil guidelines to the succeed because 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.320
 this guy is a monster right now 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.340
 whore as I said that the 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.990
 gameplay of sick 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.190
 so here is a kind of foot of 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.690
 tradition actually when we get back into 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.550
 the team storms 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.480
 it is necessary to introduce myself 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.190
 in this video I want you can me 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.680
 present so already to begin I 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.880
 my name is thomas irl i'm 16 years old i'm 17 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.470
 years on January 5th so it's really 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.550
 very soon 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.840
 I am passionate about video games as a 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.530
 little anyone in my opinion 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.300
 that they will watch this video 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.610
 today jeanne channel youtube com 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.230
 Thursday at just over 4000 subscribers and 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.580
 then here I am doing I do not 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.860
 at all performance she you're going to me 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.180
 to tell why you are in the rage team 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.410
 today simply because I 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.060
 I'm doing as a commentator already 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.590
 I'm not going to see you surely no 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.930
 gameplay from me on the channel but 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.850
 that commentary from me and basically 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.170
 I came back because the commentary 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.850
 it was the base of my chain when I 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.140
 started I was not at all a fan or 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.880
 what I did was commentary 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.380
 Comment my little quiet gameplay 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.490
 on my side and I missed it and 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.440
 frankly I missed it 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.640
 long time I had not comment on 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.750
 gameplay because here I am not a 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.040
 extraordinary level like you it's 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.780
 10 so I do not have a lot of gameplay 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.010
 admits commented for example I never 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.720
 managed to make reynats on this game in 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.830
 any case not yet but good short in 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.750
 big I have no gameplay commented 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.550
 I had no commentary en while the 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.230
 thanks to this 7th I have a lot of gameplay 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.489
 commented and it's really good because 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.260
 that it allows me to come back a little 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.430
 little at the base of my chain and why 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.540
 not resume on my youtube channel 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.400
 common terry seriously because in 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.560
 this moment i'm doing that stuff apps 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.270
 best-of stuff like that 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.500
 so here you go if you like fun 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.710

 prefer performance as I understand 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.700
 quite because you're here when 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.900
 even if you are on the chain 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.030

 many more people 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.530

 made them really quickly I 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.120
 accelerated as you estimate otherwise she 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.680
 was still pretty fast not short
