you<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> physical<00:00:47.160> variant<00:00:47.700> because<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.969> do

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
you a physical variant because I do

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.330 
you a physical variant because I do
think<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.840> weaker<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> two

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
think that is the weaker of the two

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.299 
think that is the weaker of the two
variants<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.440> once<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.559> physical<00:00:52.920> variant

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
variants and once a physical variant

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.790 
variants and once a physical variant
gets<00:00:53.460> burnt<00:00:53.789> or<00:00:54.059> Anna<00:00:54.930> Tim<00:00:55.140> date<00:00:55.350> comes<00:00:55.620> off

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
gets burnt or Anna Tim date comes off

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.220 
gets burnt or Anna Tim date comes off
it's<00:00:56.039> essentially<00:00:56.640> useless<00:00:56.879> after<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.629> yes

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
it's essentially useless after that yes

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.950 
it's essentially useless after that yes
you<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.530> uh<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.460> know<00:00:59.609> counter<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.809> can

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
you can uh you know counter that you can

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.319 
you can uh you know counter that you can
go<00:01:01.050> around<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:01.710> he<00:01:01.859> doesn't<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.370> after

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
go around that but he doesn't have after

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.640
