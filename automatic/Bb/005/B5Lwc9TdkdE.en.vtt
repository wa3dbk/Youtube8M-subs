00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
these I think we're both $23 which is a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.799 
these I think we're both $23 which is a
lot<00:00:38.489> for<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.790> drug<00:00:39.000> store<00:00:39.149> which<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> lot<00:00:39.660> for

worse<00:00:42.540> but<00:00:43.020> that's<00:00:43.170> even<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:43.649> more

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
worse but that's even like more

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.560 
worse but that's even like more
expensive<00:00:44.340> has<00:00:44.460> sigma<00:00:44.879> brush<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.329> size

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
expensive has sigma brush this size

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.959

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
weighted means but that's what I keep

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.340 
weighted means but that's what I keep
hearing<00:01:14.820> about<00:01:15.150> these<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.570> they're<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.080> nice

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
hearing about these that they're so nice

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.289

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
because they're weighted I also hear

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.969 
because they're weighted I also hear
that<00:01:18.479> they're<00:01:18.630> really<00:01:18.900> soft<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.650> while<00:01:19.860> they

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
that they're really soft and while they

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.770 
that they're really soft and while they
are<00:01:20.100> really<00:01:20.909> soft<00:01:21.119> it's<00:01:21.390> not<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
are really soft it's not like the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.679 
are really soft it's not like the
softest<00:01:22.320> brush<00:01:22.560> I've<00:01:22.710> ever<00:01:22.860> felt<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.240> got

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
softest brush I've ever felt but I got

softest brush I've ever felt but I got
these<00:01:24.960> two<00:01:25.259> because<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.710> was<00:01:26.100> really<00:01:26.369> drawn<00:01:26.670> to

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
these two because I was really drawn to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.700 
these two because I was really drawn to
the<00:01:27.030> shapes<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.600> these<00:01:27.780> two<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.290> one<00:01:28.439> reminds

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the shapes of these two this one reminds

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.340 
the shapes of these two this one reminds
me<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.250> NARS<00:01:29.490> eat<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.240> brush<00:01:30.570> which<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.990> way

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
too expensive and I will I can't ever

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.569 
too expensive and I will I can't ever

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.120 

this<00:04:30.510> brush<00:04:30.750> would<00:04:30.960> be<00:04:31.080> ideal<00:04:31.290> for<00:04:31.530> doing<00:04:32.040> that

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
this brush would be ideal for doing that

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.070 
this brush would be ideal for doing that
really<00:04:32.490> heavy<00:04:32.820> contour<00:04:33.420> that<00:04:33.450> I<00:04:33.600> really

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
really heavy contour that I really

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.380 
really heavy contour that I really
honestly<00:04:34.320> never<00:04:34.770> do<00:04:35.220> because<00:04:35.880> it's<00:04:36.210> that

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
honestly never do because it's that

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.700 
honestly never do because it's that
right<00:04:36.600> angle<00:04:36.930> to<00:04:37.050> get<00:04:37.140> right<00:04:37.350> in<00:04:37.470> underneath

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
right angle to get right in underneath

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.370 
right angle to get right in underneath
your<00:04:38.010> cheekbones<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.810> kind<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:39.870> carve<00:04:40.140> it<00:04:40.290> out

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
your cheekbones and kind of carve it out

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.960 
your cheekbones and kind of carve it out
so<00:04:40.650> this<00:04:40.770> is<00:04:40.890> also<00:04:41.010> be<00:04:41.220> great<00:04:41.490> for<00:04:41.640> underneath

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970
