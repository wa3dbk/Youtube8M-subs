00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.700 
and mini john but they have its new
attire<00:03:16.460> so<00:03:16.940> it<00:03:17.690> should<00:03:17.900> be<00:03:17.930> easier<00:03:18.320> to<00:03:18.350> switch

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
attire so it should be easier to switch

the<00:03:18.950> videos<00:03:19.280> then<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.940> make<00:03:20.060> that<00:03:20.300> harder<00:03:20.570> so<00:03:21.410> i

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
the videos then to make that harder so i

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.350 
the videos then to make that harder so i
don't<00:03:21.710> really<00:03:21.770> get<00:03:22.070> it<00:03:22.130> and<00:03:22.910> i<00:03:23.000> think<00:03:23.240> the

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
don't really get it and i think the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.360 
don't really get it and i think the
switching<00:03:23.780> music<00:03:24.140> was<00:03:24.290> interesting<00:03:24.980> m<00:03:25.160> and

switching music was interesting m and

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.840 
switching music was interesting m and

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.170 
stars where you could throw them in the
air<00:03:31.130> and<00:03:31.340> then<00:03:31.610> do<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.820> finisher<00:03:32.590> then<00:03:33.590> we<00:03:33.710> saw

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
air and then do a finisher then we saw
