on my rowing pad you want to start in
the<00:01:37.090> center<00:01:37.330> and<00:01:37.750> just<00:01:38.100> roll<00:01:39.100> it<00:01:39.130> out<00:01:41.100> trying

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
the center and just roll it out trying

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.450

to maintain the shape of your disc and

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.180 
to maintain the shape of your disc and
if<00:01:45.640> you<00:01:45.729> feel<00:01:45.940> like<00:01:46.060> it's<00:01:46.240> starting<00:01:46.479> to<00:01:46.750> stick

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
if you feel like it's starting to stick

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.410 
if you feel like it's starting to stick
bring<00:01:48.190> a<00:01:48.280> little<00:01:48.490> bit<00:01:48.610> more<00:01:48.759> powdered<00:01:49.180> sugar

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
bring a little bit more powdered sugar

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.889 
bring a little bit more powdered sugar
into<00:01:49.660> it<00:01:53.399> if<00:01:54.399> you<00:01:54.910> have<00:01:55.090> an<00:01:55.210> air<00:01:55.390> bubble<00:01:55.600> just

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
into it if you have an air bubble just

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.690 
into it if you have an air bubble just
take<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.200> straight<00:01:57.009> pin<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.890> go<00:02:00.159> in<00:02:00.310> at<00:02:00.429> a<00:02:00.520> 45

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
take a straight pin and go in at a 45

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:16.620 
take a straight pin and go in at a 45
degree<00:02:01.149> angle<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.590> pop<00:02:03.460> it

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.240 

so<00:02:17.630> it's<00:02:17.750> getting<00:02:17.990> pretty<00:02:18.290> thin<00:02:18.620> we<00:02:18.830> have<00:02:19.040> some

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
so it's getting pretty thin we have some

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.000 
so it's getting pretty thin we have some
areas<00:02:19.460> where<00:02:19.820> it's<00:02:19.970> not<00:02:20.150> real<00:02:20.390> even<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.620> you

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
areas where it's not real even and you

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.250 
areas where it's not real even and you
can<00:02:22.160> tell<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.670> by<00:02:23.570> just<00:02:23.780> kind<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:24.020> rubbing

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
can tell that by just kind of rubbing

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.470 
can tell that by just kind of rubbing
your<00:02:24.470> hand<00:02:24.770> over<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:25.970> can<00:02:26.120> see<00:02:26.330> the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
your hand over it and you can see the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.250 
your hand over it and you can see the
thickness<00:02:27.070> here<00:02:28.660> versus<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.810> thickness<00:02:30.230> here

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
thickness here versus the thickness here

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.770 
thickness here versus the thickness here
so<00:02:30.830> it's<00:02:30.950> thicker<00:02:31.250> on<00:02:31.370> this<00:02:31.580> side<00:02:31.850> so<00:02:32.540> at<00:02:32.630> this

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
so it's thicker on this side so at this

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.480 
so it's thicker on this side so at this
point<00:02:33.050> what<00:02:33.230> I'm<00:02:33.380> going<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.590> do<00:02:33.800> is<00:02:34.100> just<00:02:34.310> take

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
point what I'm going to do is just take

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.230 
point what I'm going to do is just take
my<00:02:34.640> rolling<00:02:35.030> pin<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:35.570> very<00:02:35.780> lightly<00:02:37.120> kind<00:02:38.120> of

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
my rolling pin and very lightly kind of

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.699 
my rolling pin and very lightly kind of
push<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.690> out<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:43.990> don't<00:02:44.990> want<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.290> use<00:02:45.440> really

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
push it out you don't want to use really

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.260 
push it out you don't want to use really
