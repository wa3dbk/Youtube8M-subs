00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
levels bass levels are I would say

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.870 
levels bass levels are I would say
medium<00:05:41.360> level<00:05:42.040> but<00:05:43.040> still<00:05:43.340> I<00:05:43.370> would<00:05:43.550> say<00:05:43.700> it's

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
medium level but still I would say it's

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.270 
medium level but still I would say it's
pretty<00:05:44.090> good<00:05:44.330> though<00:05:44.810> I<00:05:45.170> don't<00:05:46.100> know<00:05:46.190> about

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
pretty good though I don't know about

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.570 
pretty good though I don't know about
the<00:05:46.430> base<00:05:46.610> actually<00:05:47.230> base<00:05:48.230> is<00:05:48.380> also<00:05:48.710> pretty

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
the base actually base is also pretty

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.750 
the base actually base is also pretty
good<00:05:49.850> i<00:05:49.970> didn't<00:05:50.210> play<00:05:50.720> songs<00:05:51.200> with<00:05:51.560> high<00:05:52.490> waist

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
so can't comment on that but i guess the

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.890 
so can't comment on that but i guess the
base<00:05:55.190> would<00:05:55.370> be<00:05:55.430> pretty<00:05:55.850> good<00:05:55.970> as<00:05:56.120> well<00:05:56.150> now

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
base would be pretty good as well now

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.960 
base would be pretty good as well now
