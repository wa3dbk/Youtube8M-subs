as<00:02:10.619> they<00:02:10.740> say<00:02:11.720> powerful<00:02:12.830> weapons<00:02:13.830> how<00:02:14.010> do<00:02:14.070> you

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
as they say powerful weapons how do you

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.810 
as they say powerful weapons how do you
kind<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.550> make<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.850> game<00:02:15.030> fair<00:02:16.310> well<00:02:17.310> that's<00:02:17.730> a

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
kind of make the game fair well that's a

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.330 
kind of make the game fair well that's a
very<00:02:17.850> good<00:02:18.090> question<00:02:18.800> it's<00:02:19.800> it's<00:02:20.100> got<00:02:20.310> a

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
very good question it's it's got a

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.010 
very good question it's it's got a
constant<00:02:20.970> balance<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.540> we<00:02:21.660> have<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.900> do

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
constant balance that we have to do

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.840 
constant balance that we have to do
we're<00:02:22.590> trying<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.830> make<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.010> very<00:02:23.160> grounded

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
we're trying to make this very grounded

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.790 
we're trying to make this very grounded
game<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.660> yet<00:02:25.020> we<00:02:25.110> have<00:02:25.230> all<00:02:25.380> these<00:02:25.500> exotic

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
game and yet we have all these exotic

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.290 
game and yet we have all these exotic
weapons<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.580> think<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.880> main<00:02:27.030> thing<00:02:27.090> is

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
weapons and I think the main thing is

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.390 
weapons and I think the main thing is
for<00:02:27.870> us<00:02:27.990> it's<00:02:28.200> player<00:02:28.380> choice<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:29.010> decide

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
for us it's player choice you decide

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.010 
for us it's player choice you decide
when<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.670> want<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.970> be<00:02:30.030> able<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.270> choose<00:02:30.480> user

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
when you want to be able to choose user

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.590 
when you want to be able to choose user
weapons<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:32.190> don't<00:02:32.370> have<00:02:32.520> infinite<00:02:32.940> ammo<00:02:33.090> so

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
weapons you don't have infinite ammo so

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.180 
weapons you don't have infinite ammo so
you<00:02:33.690> really<00:02:34.080> need<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.320> decide<00:02:34.590> how<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:34.860> when

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
you really need to decide how and when

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.640 
you really need to decide how and when
you<00:02:35.340> want<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.580> use<00:02:35.700> each<00:02:35.910> weapon<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:37.530> know

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
you want to use each weapon and you know

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.890 
you want to use each weapon and you know
again<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.220> idea<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:38.970> have<00:02:39.240> access<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.690> all

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
again the idea is you have access to all

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.150 
again the idea is you have access to all
the<00:02:40.020> weapons<00:02:40.290> at<00:02:40.410> all<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.590> time<00:02:40.770> with<00:02:40.950> quick

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
the weapons at all the time with quick

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.670 
the weapons at all the time with quick
select<00:02:41.460> so<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:42.270> can<00:02:42.660> make<00:02:42.750> short<00:02:43.050> work<00:02:43.080> or<00:02:43.470> you

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
select so you can make short work or you

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.320 
select so you can make short work or you
can<00:02:43.710> really<00:02:44.070> try<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.280> experiment<00:02:44.730> figure<00:02:45.210> out

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
can really try to experiment figure out

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.090 
can really try to experiment figure out
weapons<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.930> combinations<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.770> like

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
weapons and combinations I like

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.440 
weapons and combinations I like
experimentation<00:02:47.850> personally<00:02:48.240> but<00:02:48.360> I've

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
experimentation personally but I've

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.910 
experimentation personally but I've
heard<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:48.720> about<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:49.050> yes<00:02:49.260> you're<00:02:49.740> correct

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
heard that about you yes you're correct

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.470 
heard that about you yes you're correct
everything<00:02:50.400> you've<00:02:50.490> heard<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.880> deep<00:02:51.210> bowels

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
everything you've heard and deep bowels

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.360 
everything you've heard and deep bowels
of<00:02:51.690> comic-con<00:02:52.050> are<00:02:52.350> all<00:02:52.470> true<00:02:52.710> and<00:02:53.160> speak<00:02:53.340> of

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
of comic-con are all true and speak of

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.500 
of comic-con are all true and speak of
the<00:02:53.460> player<00:02:53.670> choice<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:54.090> think<00:02:54.240> one<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.390> the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
the player choice I think one of the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.970 
the player choice I think one of the
things<00:02:54.570> that<00:02:54.720> player<00:02:55.080> gives<00:02:55.530> players<00:02:55.739> the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
things that player gives players the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.949 
things that player gives players the
most<00:02:56.130> choice<00:02:56.400> multiplayer<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.510> co-op<00:02:57.570> it

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
most choice multiplayer and co-op it

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.090 
most choice multiplayer and co-op it
lets<00:02:58.110> them<00:02:58.200> do<00:02:58.320> it<00:02:58.440> really<00:02:58.650> their<00:02:58.770> own<00:02:58.890> thing

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
lets them do it really their own thing

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.280 
lets them do it really their own thing
so<00:02:59.250> what<00:02:59.370> can<00:02:59.520> people<00:02:59.610> expect<00:02:59.820> from<00:03:00.720> in<00:03:00.989> those

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
so what can people expect from in those

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.140 
so what can people expect from in those
types<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.620> things<00:03:01.680> in<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:02.010> game<00:03:02.220> well<00:03:02.820> we
