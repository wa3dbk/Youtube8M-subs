coil<00:00:09.170> pot<00:00:09.530> as<00:00:09.860> I<00:00:10.099> had<00:00:10.190> mentioned<00:00:10.550> in<00:00:10.610> earlier

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
coil pot as I had mentioned in earlier

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.090 
coil pot as I had mentioned in earlier
segments<00:00:11.480> and<00:00:11.630> at<00:00:12.200> this<00:00:12.350> moment<00:00:12.620> what<00:00:12.950> we're

segments and at this moment what we're
going<00:00:13.340> to<00:00:13.400> do<00:00:13.610> is<00:00:13.790> build<00:00:14.030> some<00:00:14.180> coils<00:00:14.750> there

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
going to do is build some coils there

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.830 
going to do is build some coils there
are<00:00:15.590> a<00:00:15.650> couple<00:00:15.800> ways<00:00:16.100> to<00:00:16.340> build<00:00:16.490> coils<00:00:17.029> first

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
are a couple ways to build coils first

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.700 
are a couple ways to build coils first
is<00:00:18.050> by<00:00:18.650> hand<00:00:19.039> actually<00:00:19.880> manually<00:00:20.539> by<00:00:20.840> hand<00:00:21.110> so

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
is by hand actually manually by hand so

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.430 
is by hand actually manually by hand so
you<00:00:21.770> take<00:00:22.070> a<00:00:22.340> ball<00:00:22.730> of<00:00:22.940> clay<00:00:23.090> pull<00:00:23.990> a<00:00:24.020> piece<00:00:24.289> of

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
you take a ball of clay pull a piece of

you take a ball of clay pull a piece of
the<00:00:24.530> play<00:00:24.770> off<00:00:25.010> and<00:00:25.600> begin<00:00:26.600> by<00:00:26.840> rubbing<00:00:27.230> the

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350 
the play off and begin by rubbing the

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.560 
the play off and begin by rubbing the
clay<00:00:27.619> between<00:00:27.680> your<00:00:28.190> two<00:00:28.340> hands<00:00:28.820> something

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
like this and you begin getting the form

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.189 
like this and you begin getting the form
of<00:00:33.199> maybe<00:00:34.100> a<00:00:34.250> clay<00:00:34.969> rope<00:00:35.269> kind<00:00:35.989> of<00:00:36.079> look<00:00:36.170> like

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
of maybe a clay rope kind of look like

that what I like to do is because my
hands<00:00:39.170> aren't<00:00:39.319> quite<00:00:39.559> as<00:00:39.739> wide<00:00:39.949> as<00:00:40.159> the<00:00:40.190> clay

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
hands aren't quite as wide as the clay

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.520 
hands aren't quite as wide as the clay
I'm<00:00:40.639> going<00:00:40.879> to<00:00:40.969> have<00:00:41.149> goings<00:00:41.629> put<00:00:42.229> it<00:00:42.350> on<00:00:42.499> a

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
I'm going to have goings put it on a

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.520 
I'm going to have goings put it on a
flat<00:00:42.829> surface<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:43.550> then<00:00:43.729> very<00:00:44.059> gently<00:00:44.530> begin

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
flat surface and then very gently begin

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.599 
flat surface and then very gently begin
to<00:00:46.399> roll<00:00:46.639> the<00:00:46.940> clay<00:00:47.239> out<00:00:48.129> and<00:00:49.129> you<00:00:49.280> can<00:00:49.429> do<00:00:49.549> it

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
to roll the clay out and you can do it

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.520 
to roll the clay out and you can do it
with<00:00:49.729> all<00:00:49.879> kinds<00:00:49.909> of<00:00:50.299> speed<00:00:50.600> if<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.139> you<00:00:51.440> know

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:55.819 
the thing to do is remember you have a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:58.020 
the thing to do is remember you have a
length<00:00:56.420> of<00:00:56.600> clay<00:00:56.899> that<00:00:57.170> you<00:00:57.319> want<00:00:57.499> to<00:00:57.649> have

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
length of clay that you want to have

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.309 
length of clay that you want to have
bring<00:00:59.030> out<00:00:59.239> here<00:00:59.449> so<00:00:59.629> if<00:00:59.690> you<00:00:59.780> keep<00:00:59.929> your<00:01:00.079> hands

bring out here so if you keep your hands

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:02.109 
bring out here so if you keep your hands
in<00:01:00.499> one<00:01:00.679> position<00:01:01.190> you're<00:01:01.729> going<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:01.909> have<00:01:02.059> a

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:02.119 
in one position you're going to have a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:03.759 
in one position you're going to have a
critter<00:01:02.420> that<00:01:02.659> comes<00:01:02.869> out<00:01:03.049> of<00:01:03.229> this<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:03.589> what<00:01:03.739> I

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
critter that comes out of this so what I

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.399 
critter that comes out of this so what I
do<00:01:03.920> is<00:01:04.220> kind<00:01:04.489> of<00:01:04.699> roll<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.659> clay<00:01:05.869> paying

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
do is kind of roll the clay paying

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.350 
do is kind of roll the clay paying
attention<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:07.010> both<00:01:07.160> ends<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:07.850> then<00:01:08.120> move<00:01:08.330> my

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
attention to both ends and then move my

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.020 
attention to both ends and then move my
hands<00:01:08.930> out<00:01:09.080> with<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:09.620> clay<00:01:09.890> so<00:01:10.670> that<00:01:10.880> it

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
hands out with the clay so that it

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.570 
hands out with the clay so that it
doesn't<00:01:11.390> split<00:01:11.690> or<00:01:11.870> fall<00:01:12.080> apart<00:01:12.440> and<00:01:13.370> then<00:01:13.550> you

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
doesn't split or fall apart and then you

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.310 
doesn't split or fall apart and then you
notice<00:01:13.850> that<00:01:14.030> you<00:01:14.510> can<00:01:14.630> get<00:01:14.780> longer<00:01:15.050> and

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
notice that you can get longer and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.670 
notice that you can get longer and
longer<00:01:15.380> pieces<00:01:16.130> of<00:01:16.340> clay<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.420> coil<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.560> then

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
longer pieces of clay and coil and then

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.290 
longer pieces of clay and coil and then
you<00:01:18.770> have<00:01:18.920> to<00:01:19.040> pay<00:01:19.190> attention<00:01:19.220> like<00:01:20.090> this

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
you have to pay attention like this

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.120 
you have to pay attention like this
place<00:01:20.570> here<00:01:20.870> is<00:01:20.960> becoming<00:01:21.290> a<00:01:21.470> little<00:01:21.620> too<00:01:21.740> thin

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
place here is becoming a little too thin

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.490 
place here is becoming a little too thin
so<00:01:22.160> I'll<00:01:22.400> try<00:01:22.610> not<00:01:22.790> to<00:01:22.910> get<00:01:23.060> that<00:01:23.120> one<00:01:23.480> too<00:01:24.290> much

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
so I'll try not to get that one too much

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.650 
so I'll try not to get that one too much
with<00:01:24.680> my<00:01:24.830> hands<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:25.460> I<00:01:25.550> slowly<00:01:26.210> roll<00:01:26.630> over

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
with my hands and I slowly roll over

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.200 
with my hands and I slowly roll over
this<00:01:27.140> clay<00:01:27.500> and<00:01:27.770> then<00:01:28.400> make<00:01:28.640> it<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.850> length

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
this clay and then make it the length

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.210 
this clay and then make it the length
that<00:01:29.600> I<00:01:29.630> think<00:01:29.960> I'm<00:01:30.140> going<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.500> be<00:01:30.710> able<00:01:30.860> to

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
that I think I'm going to be able to

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.640 
that I think I'm going to be able to
work<00:01:31.760> with<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.570> thickness<00:01:32.840> that<00:01:33.500> I'm

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
work with and the thickness that I'm

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.850 
work with and the thickness that I'm
going<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.160> want<00:01:34.580> on<00:01:34.760> my<00:01:34.970> clay<00:01:35.240> pot<00:01:35.540> now<00:01:36.530> as<00:01:36.710> we

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
going to want on my clay pot now as we

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.830 
going to want on my clay pot now as we
roll<00:01:37.070> this<00:01:37.100> clay<00:01:37.610> out<00:01:37.640> you'll<00:01:38.210> notice<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:38.660> gets

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
roll this clay out you'll notice it gets

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.550 
roll this clay out you'll notice it gets
longer<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.410> longer<00:01:40.120> sometimes<00:01:41.410> you're<00:01:42.410> going

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
longer and longer sometimes you're going

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.290 
longer and longer sometimes you're going
to<00:01:42.650> have<00:01:42.800> this<00:01:42.920> thin<00:01:43.190> spot<00:01:43.520> that's<00:01:43.760> eventually

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
to have this thin spot that's eventually

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.149 
to have this thin spot that's eventually
going<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.510> break<00:01:44.660> off<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.260> what<00:01:45.440> I<00:01:45.470> do<00:01:45.590> is<00:01:45.860> I<00:01:45.980> say

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
going to break off so what I do is I say

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.250 
going to break off so what I do is I say
well<00:01:46.190> let's<00:01:46.909> cut<00:01:47.120> our<00:01:47.240> losses<00:01:47.420> move<00:01:47.930> that<00:01:48.110> over

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
well let's cut our losses move that over

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.050 
well let's cut our losses move that over
there<00:01:48.380> not<00:01:48.860> like<00:01:49.010> that<00:01:49.280> now<00:01:49.520> I've<00:01:49.610> got<00:01:49.760> a<00:01:49.790> piece

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
there not like that now I've got a piece

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.090 
there not like that now I've got a piece
of<00:01:50.210> clay<00:01:50.390> that's<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.720> little<00:01:50.930> bit<00:01:51.110> more

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
of clay that's a little bit more

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.970 
of clay that's a little bit more
workable<00:01:52.550> and<00:01:52.909> I<00:01:53.720> will<00:01:53.930> move<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.620> out<00:01:54.740> like

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
workable and I will move it out like

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.850 
workable and I will move it out like
that<00:01:55.330> now<00:01:56.330> you<00:01:56.390> can<00:01:56.630> tell<00:01:56.870> by<00:01:57.080> working<00:01:57.590> the

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
that now you can tell by working the

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.190 
that now you can tell by working the
clay<00:01:58.100> with<00:01:58.340> your<00:01:58.490> hands<00:01:58.820> this<00:01:59.000> way<00:01:59.270> you're

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
clay with your hands this way you're

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.930 
clay with your hands this way you're
going<00:02:00.409> to<00:02:00.560> have<00:02:00.770> eventually<00:02:01.250> some<00:02:01.729> long

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
going to have eventually some long

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.880 
going to have eventually some long
pieces<00:02:02.270> that<00:02:02.600> are<00:02:02.840> going<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:03.290> be<00:02:03.440> a<00:02:03.470> little<00:02:03.680> bit

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
pieces that are going to be a little bit

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.940 
pieces that are going to be a little bit
unmanageable<00:02:05.229> so<00:02:06.229> this<00:02:06.380> is<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:06.590> more<00:02:06.800> difficult

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
unmanageable so this is a more difficult

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.699 
unmanageable so this is a more difficult
although<00:02:07.580> as<00:02:07.880> as<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.209> accepted<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:09.110> accepted

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
although as as the accepted and accepted

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.970 
although as as the accepted and accepted
way<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:10.310> making<00:02:10.729> coils<00:02:11.269> for<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:11.989> coil<00:02:12.319> pot<00:02:12.590> we

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
way of making coils for a coil pot we

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.589 
way of making coils for a coil pot we
didn't<00:02:13.189> lose<00:02:13.370> this<00:02:13.579> piece<00:02:13.849> we're<00:02:14.090> just<00:02:14.239> simply

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
didn't lose this piece we're just simply

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.270 
didn't lose this piece we're just simply
going<00:02:14.629> to<00:02:14.840> bring<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.409> over<00:02:15.499> here

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
going to bring it over here

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.220 
going to bring it over here
and<00:02:16.370> make<00:02:16.850> it<00:02:16.880> or<00:02:17.270> attempt<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.750> make<00:02:17.960> it<00:02:18.110> the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
and make it or attempt to make it the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.370 
and make it or attempt to make it the
same<00:02:18.440> size<00:02:18.700> for<00:02:19.700> my<00:02:19.850> idea<00:02:20.720> is<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.200> want

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
same size for my idea is that you want

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.440 
same size for my idea is that you want
your<00:02:21.530> coils<00:02:21.980> about<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.460> same<00:02:22.700> thickness<00:02:23.060> and

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
your coils about the same thickness and

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.630 
your coils about the same thickness and
diameter<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.290> you'll<00:02:24.740> see<00:02:24.950> as<00:02:25.130> we<00:02:25.310> put<00:02:25.520> them

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
diameter and you'll see as we put them

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.240 
diameter and you'll see as we put them
on<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.820> form<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.780> pot<00:02:26.990> why<00:02:27.410> we<00:02:27.710> we<00:02:28.040> want

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
on a form and a pot why we we want

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.520 
on a form and a pot why we we want
something<00:02:28.550> like<00:02:28.730> that<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:30.140> other<00:02:30.260> way<00:02:30.470> to

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
something like that the other way to

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.040 
something like that the other way to
make<00:02:30.650> coils<00:02:31.100> is<00:02:31.490> with<00:02:31.700> an<00:02:31.880> extruder<00:02:32.570> and<00:02:32.750> we'll

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
make coils is with an extruder and we'll

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.700 
make coils is with an extruder and we'll
talk<00:02:33.230> about<00:02:33.380> that<00:02:33.709> in<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.040> next<00:02:34.310> segment
