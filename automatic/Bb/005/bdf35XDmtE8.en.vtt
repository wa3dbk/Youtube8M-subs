00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
being a nurse is we had a patient who

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.900 
being a nurse is we had a patient who
had<00:02:25.140> been<00:02:25.320> coming<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.709> us<00:02:25.980> on<00:02:26.220> an<00:02:26.340> offer<00:02:26.489> unit

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
had been coming to us on an offer unit

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.490 
had been coming to us on an offer unit
for<00:02:27.120> quite<00:02:27.300> some<00:02:27.540> time<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:27.750> we<00:02:28.080> had<00:02:28.260> all

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
for quite some time and we had all

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.630 
for quite some time and we had all
developed<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.100> really<00:02:29.250> good<00:02:29.489> relationship

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
developed a really good relationship

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.740 
developed a really good relationship
with<00:02:30.239> him<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:31.070> he<00:02:32.070> knew<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.400> he<00:02:33.330> was

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
with him and he knew that he was

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.110 
with him and he knew that he was
probably<00:02:34.440> not<00:02:35.010> going<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.489> live<00:02:35.670> much<00:02:35.850> longer

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
probably not going to live much longer

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.330 
probably not going to live much longer
and<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.200> make-a-wish<00:02:37.380> Foundation<00:02:38.190> was
