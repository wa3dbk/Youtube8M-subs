00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:04.350
 and he told me the assistant of the national team of Puerto Rico and 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.719
 commentator of 10 good sport Mr. Carlos Morales greeted Carlos after giving 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.320
 for ass minutes I have thrown we know that one of the issues now more 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.239
 controversial in professional sport precisely states 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:15.909
 United 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:20.109
 is that the lockout the famous caused it delare see me as a commentator 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.650
 of 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.039
 etesa league standing percent 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.460
 etc as you see the panorama now that we are stuck a few months of what 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.690
 usually from the beginning of the 13 in the preseason 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.020
 it really does not look very good at the moment I do not know very well why the 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.270
 conversation between the players will continue origin in the league sung by 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:41.290
 against austria 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.050
 on that occasion of danger and lately there have been a couple of 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.950
 meetings more apparently every time they meet despite the call each 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.390
 which is fine to see your points 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.210
 and there does not seem to be a 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.480
 the solution 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.950
 to this conflict 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.140
 and predicted that no 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.090
 what one can say at this moment no percent 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.850
 possibly the season does not start when equally planned ends of 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.160
 October or early November that does not pass someone similar only 99 98 99 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.420
 where the season began in February 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.030
 after having lost everything that gives 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.540
 summer tournaments for example first of the five stars clear 50 matches 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.820
 we can only be close to that because your player is very 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.340
 clear at the point of not wanting to do not want to give away rights that think 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.040
 that is an acquired right and that is when they really begin to feel what 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.770
 possible when you speculate in your pocket and what is betting the 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.320
 more news 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.300
 in the second week of November let players enter the schengen 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.820
 tosello ask your representative despite they come to sweep the league if 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.200
 that happens tremolando perhaps of a transaction in December 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.180
 then the league center maria the image make possibly they added 99 they 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.009
 they would avoid two months paramÃ©s had to start so unfortunately it seems 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:01:59.920
 that everything is worth 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.650
 and in the case of 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.460
 there are many clubs in Europe there are in Asia the frame rate 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.640
 seven players of big names of the nbc afa efe 3 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:15.709
 what to give this panorama is clear perfect this prediction that presents us 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.099
 that a season may start in February 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.819
 I think we can start I think we can little 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.609
 perestelo last months of 2010 with many renowned players the mbda 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.829
 playing in professional leagues 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.829
 from Europe and Asia I can say much more than what they have already begun to comment 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.180
 some players after a year claimed in their subsidiary kia clear spoken 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.849
 of 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.909
 with ibra since they have a contract 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.369
 an argentina 

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:45.189
 a contract for three strikeouts was a Turkish airline recharging points 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.329
 sense maybe for him john cross and even though he has not yet committed to 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.879
 nothing I do not know how many players there would be because a very few census the teams that 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.749
 can pay the salaries of a player of the nbdl yesterday before the great caribbean 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:03:00.069
 are demanding if we know that pau gasol for example would be thinking about 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.819
 return to your country to play in Spain 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.030
 in 1999 and reached the third place with reason in one way or another thing that 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.799
 there are players that could be 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.669
 if they were trying in europe in asia they advanced as leaders socially 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.999
 in the league of china korea and japan 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:17.859
 but I do not think it's going to be very much, I think it's going to be bad 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.389
 They were waiting for that memory 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.679
 how is the city going to Carlos Morales 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:25.489
 and success with the Puerto Rico national team thank you very much
