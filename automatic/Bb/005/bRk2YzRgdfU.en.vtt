00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.379
 Hello 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.299
 welcome back today I want you to see how 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.189
 finish our placemat that one 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.380
 great idea for a Christmas gift 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.259
 for a friend of ours because it can be 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.880
 used as a centerpiece with above 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.860
 a Christmas star and if we want 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.210
 we can also make it in one color 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.779
 Christmas like red 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.009
 we started with a first phase 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.200
 perforated that allows us to create a 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.840
 these tips is in the previous phase 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.790
 we saw how to work then 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.460
 that the body part with the shirt 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.120
 shaved and a small openwork border 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.010
 side finished our 16 repetitions 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.969
 of these two irons 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.460
 we are at this point when 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.620
 we are here we must resume what 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.359
 the openwork we did 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.879
 in the first phase 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.159
 so what we do we take i 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.750
 our project is our project e 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:09.780
 let's start with two straight knits that are 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.420
 those of the then associated piping 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.330
 we make a thrown and 2 mesh together with 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.310
 straight but we don't just repeat this 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.130
 more for twice as we did for 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.030
 the body but we continue to repeat it for 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.140
 seven times 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.600
 as we did at the beginning 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.610
 then we work 8 straight and at the end 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.070
 let the pass pass straight on 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.680
 thrown and we repeat it seven times 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.430
 so we create what is a part 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:44.190
 final symmetrical the initial part of the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:48.990
 its the 123456 check we have to make 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:02:01.230
 still 17 when I'm here working 8 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:02:04.250
 straight shirt then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 e 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:07.830
 so I make my dough straight pass 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.019
 with the thrown that I must repeat then 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.310
 seven times as I had done in the part 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.650
 initial 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.799
 this will then allow us when we 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.910
 we close the meshes to create those that 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.290
 are the symmetrical tips 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.140
 when we do the return iron 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.660
 we always work it straight because 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.880
 we create that movement you remember a 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.480
 tie of the central part and of the 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.130
 part perforated so we continue e 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.190
 we do it pass right past 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.290
 thrown up to the last two meshes that 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.740
 then we work straight and in the iron of 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.600
 return we work all the stitches straight 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.550
 when we repeated these two irons 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.100
 seven times as he had done for the 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.980
 initial part we design our 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.260
 we are ready to close it 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.970
 so we arrived here and on the back 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.310
 of our work 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.110
 then in the part of the stockinette stitch 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.750
 we must have the reverse towards di 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.420
 we and ours work our own 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.580
 last two rows on the front and on the last one 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.060
 to create again with binding edge 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.280
 we begin to close our shirts 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.400
 so neither do we work 2 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.710
 and here, we must remember to remember 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.780
 be very soft because we want to 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.750
 see how I'm keeping mine wide 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.150
 jerseys because I want mine 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.130
 placemat once ironed can 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.010
 take this form with these two 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.350
 tips when I got to the end 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.260
 I take lake and so I can start a 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.540
 hide my two tails and prepare 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.730
 what are my placemats from 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.830
 give to my friends for Christmas and ne 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.810
 I'm doing so many different colors 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.390
 because then everyone has his own color 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.200
 favorite and when here that I hide the 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.450
 my little tail awaits you at the next 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.989
 bet with new projects for gifts of 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.500
 Christmas 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.500
 good job
