00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the bottom there at least the plastic

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.920 
the bottom there at least the plastic
goes<00:01:12.630> around<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> corners<00:01:13.320> that's<00:01:13.530> nice<00:01:14.090> I<00:01:15.090> be

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
goes around the corners that's nice I be

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.230 
goes around the corners that's nice I be
hesitant<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.560> now<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.920> know<00:01:17.340> I'm<00:01:17.520> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> go

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
hesitant is now I know I'm going to go

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.510 
hesitant is now I know I'm going to go
there<00:01:18.540> yeah<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.170> actually<00:01:20.009> be<00:01:20.250> able<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.430> say

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
there yeah I actually be able to say

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.740 
there yeah I actually be able to say
it's<00:01:20.640> safe<00:01:20.820> probably<00:01:21.150> putting<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.570> top

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
it's safe probably putting this on top

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.450 
it's safe probably putting this on top
of<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.990> table<00:01:22.110> as<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.220> there<00:01:23.369> there's

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
of a table as you can see there there's

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.520 
of a table as you can see there there's
a<00:01:23.610> very<00:01:24.090> very<00:01:24.420> tiny<00:01:25.140> lip<00:01:25.650> there<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:27.530> yeah

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
a very very tiny lip there on it yeah

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.319 
a very very tiny lip there on it yeah
I'd<00:01:28.680> say<00:01:28.740> it's<00:01:28.979> safe<00:01:29.130> enough<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.490> do<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
I'd say it's safe enough to do that on a

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.219 
I'd say it's safe enough to do that on a
card<00:01:30.900> table<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.409> not<00:01:31.500> worried<00:01:31.860> too<00:01:32.070> much<00:01:32.250> so

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
card table and not worried too much so

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.780 
card table and not worried too much so
anyway<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:34.890> see<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> corners<00:01:35.579> is

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
anyway so you can see the corners is

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.980 
anyway so you can see the corners is
kind<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.060> showing<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> case<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:36.810> very

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
kind of showing you the case it's very

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.569 
kind of showing you the case it's very
minimalistic<00:01:37.409> case<00:01:37.799> that's<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.130> point<00:01:38.340> it's

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
minimalistic case that's the point it's

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.370
