we're<00:00:12.059> working<00:00:12.179> with<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.599> alternative

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
we're working with the alternative

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.870 
we're working with the alternative
energy<00:00:13.349> horse<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.309> they<00:00:14.460> wanted<00:00:14.759> some

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
energy horse and they wanted some

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.279 
energy horse and they wanted some
different<00:00:15.150> routes<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:15.420> we<00:00:15.540> have<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.719> fiberglass

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
different routes so we have a fiberglass

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.800 
different routes so we have a fiberglass

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
collectors on and they can end up you

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.029 
collectors on and they can end up you
know<00:00:21.600> using<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.109> for<00:00:22.410> their<00:00:22.560> students<00:00:22.949> to

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
know using that for their students to

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.189 
know using that for their students to
train<00:00:23.279> them<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:23.580> realistic<00:00:23.970> route<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.840> skids

deconstructing<00:01:50.840> houses<00:01:51.350> rather<00:01:51.590> than

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
deconstructing houses rather than

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.499

that<00:01:53.539> are<00:01:53.659> left<00:01:53.780> over<00:01:54.080> we<00:01:54.440> have<00:01:54.590> the

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
that are left over we have the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.170 
that are left over we have the
opportunity<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:55.250> obtain<00:01:55.460> them<00:01:55.729> here<00:01:55.909> from<00:01:56.030> the

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
opportunity to obtain them here from the

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.510 
opportunity to obtain them here from the
college<00:01:56.570> which<00:01:57.110> saves<00:01:57.350> us<00:01:57.500> money<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:58.039> makes

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
college which saves us money and makes
