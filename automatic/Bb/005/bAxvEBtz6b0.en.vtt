00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.790
 hello everyone and welcome on force 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.160
 he tbilisi him for the presentation 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.349
 rice works 2 0 that happened this morning 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.639
 on the baby does not dream of blabla on 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.680
 start right away we get into the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.510
 lively of the subject with the passive so the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.070
 passive 2 0 who now does not give him 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.400
 more bonus armor depending on 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.250
 his ap but who gives him an amount 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.310
 growing magic penetration including 4 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.019
 % at level 1 up to 26% at level 18 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.460
 so a character who is really 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.070
 able to inflict enough riders 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.070
 monstrous and he also has a second 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.360
 passive that a little in the way of 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.629
 lisandro will do that every ten 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.120
 seconds 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.850
 the next high to xerox attacks 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.140
 it will remain 4% of his need for a 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.570
 maximum if this attack all 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.160
 mushrooms but otherwise if they hit a 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.170
 champion with this auto attack that will be 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.629
 12% of his man and aximum who will be 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.879
 restored so very friendly to the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.699
 swiss timeline so here if they have 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.250
 then we go on with the so 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.229
 the arcane pulse does not change except that 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.840
 so the arcane more in itself has changed 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.670
 so nahd is now in fact you 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.320
 can the charge is exactly like 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.030
 an arrow of varus you can you 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.960
 move while loading and 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.270
 while charging 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.439
 she wins the range but cons 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.400
 she does not gain any damage 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.369
 additional 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.860
 so by cons so at level 1 she's going 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.470
 inflict 70 magic damage plus 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.049
 85% of the peace of Auxerre was up to 230 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.110
 magic damage at level 5 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.100
 plus 85% of the p2 and spleen 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.600
 as usual it affects all 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.960
 enemies without damage reduction by and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.670
 half they come to touch and I believe 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.829
 that is all on their calculations in 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.210
 therefore follows the z by cons obviously of 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.220
 z that has completely changed since seen 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.899
 that we can charge the pulsating arcane win 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.210
 the red with the broom position in 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.439
 that has become completely useless so 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.290
 there is a new spell called 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.520
 cosmic strike that makes them have 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.210
 rade is going 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.899
 inflict a bit of a kind of dance 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.479
 old alumni multi actually 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.750
 which is a kind of blast 2 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.819
 arkanic energy you know all this and who 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.720
 therefore displays 50 points of damage 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.040
 magic plus 60% of the p2 and spleen 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.049
 up to 190 magic damage 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.379
 plus 60% of the federation xsara in this 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.690
 zone to that according to enemy touched by 10% 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.069
 and if you really touch you the 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.310
 nobody exactly in the center of the 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.799
 zoned 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.069
 they will take 60% more damage 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:32.340
 and be this lot of 35 % so always 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.940
 for three seconds so this is a 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.310
 frankly it's a spell that puts 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.230
 really a lot of damage I could 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.280
 see them step higher than their 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.239
 cam pulse so it's really 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.630
 very very good fate with a very good 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.910
 then put away the e so now 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.799
 there are more combos ea for stone 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.769
 the opponent has become a skillshot 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:57.720
 and if you touch the opponent with this 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.560
 the site shot it sounds so there 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.100
 the school aspect calls them that as 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.200
 it therefore involves 100 points of damage 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.030
 Magic Level 1 + 60% of the 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.060
 federal up to 260 points becomes 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.980
 magic plus 60% to ferhat and when it gets 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.739
 give it stones for a second at 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.760
 level 1 to 2 seconds at level 5 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:21.040
 so also nice and then the r 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.560
 then too slow in order the game 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.150
 sensitive souls refrain 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.130
 then desires puts himself in a position of ba 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.450
 the vanquished but then there is really 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:36.440
 became the long barn mage we could 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.180
 see what could have been expected of him 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.400
 since at the base it was him the goal 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.220
 to be a kind of catapult from afar 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.660
 which will inflict great damage of very 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.280
 very very very long and then that's 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.910
 really very very very very far 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.840
 so his arches dams that makes it 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.150
 gets in the broom position in the ass 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.390
 when he is in position of strolls in 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:01.580
 that takes 10% less damage up to 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:04.430
 30% less damage at level 3 it 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.620
 can not move while the effect is 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.920
 kong is running 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.050
 and so when 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.190
 it activates and that can attract four 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.900
 time a kind of bombing that goes 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.519
 inflict 150 level damage 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.769
 1 + 45 years between what we did up 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.510
 250 points of damage since 45% of san 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.460
 mateo level 3 still in damage 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.270
 magic and the range is high level 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.570
 1 stand well 2900 and at level 3 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.919
 these 4500 to give you an idea if 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.580
 for example you are at the top line 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:41.290
 you can ch'ti blue votes 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:44.780
 here is nothing else to say 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.729
 in any case, I'll let you admire 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.200
 the little clips always behind 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.410
 since frankly when I saw that 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.389
 I have the wada fuck 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.550
 good frankly it's just killshot 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.930
 and you have to succeed in placing them between 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.810
 they collect but it goes very fast 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.360
 so it's not too difficult 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.630
 frankly frankly I think it 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.120
 torn up 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.560
 short, so here I leave you there 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.360
 above if you liked it 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.380
 if you enjoyed this life do not hesitate to 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.550
 let go a little live it helps us 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.530
 really much more than what you 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.570
 think to bring back the videos 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.300
 to introduce us to others 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.860
 people so really so if you have 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.010
 the time these mechanics so go ahead 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.030
 do it and if not, if you're not 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.490
 still not subscribers by force who the 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.169
 do it if you are still not 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.169
 obviously i can tell you subscribe 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.030
 you but that's so if you have if you 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.450
 are interested in updates 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.520
 two of the pbd tutorials on league of 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.530

 go ahead it's free it's bibi god 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.419
 in short, here I leave you there 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.229
 I make you many kisses kisses 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.229
