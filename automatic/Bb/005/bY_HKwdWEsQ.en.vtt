00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.460
 in this section we are going to talk about the advice of form until we are going to 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.529
 help when we are working with mind for action in a way 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.189
 to better define the trajectory as the transformation of one object to another 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.569
 for example 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.569
 I have a rectangle scola sale rectangle 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.509
 more or less 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.340
 and with the free transformation tool the other 45 degrees 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.570
 he placed it in the center 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.780
 right button i separate 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.260
 nobody so that otherwise simple way 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.300
 on frame number 30 right button insert keyframe in this 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.300
 case you inserted key since I'm going to use the same figure 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.850
 right button in the middle of the timeline and create inter for moe action 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.040
 in that way 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.270
 - an interpellation of form we placed ourselves in the first frame we were going 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.770
 to modify 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.770
 form and spain of the council said 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.740
 it's not that we create a red dot with a letter 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.320
 he dragged her to that corner 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.359
 i in the last frame the no point dragged it to the other corner 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.080
 we see that they are born of the color to see if he squeezed control intro 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.810
 let's see how on the one hand it moves to the other 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.910
 ok but still we do the training a bit 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.940
 how do we avoid this 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.220
 we go back to the first frame 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.640
 Modify 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.640
 form and add the advice so 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.820
 we place it 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.120
 at the tip 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.540
 superior the letter b 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.390
 we repeat the steps modify form 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.270
 ana of the form council 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.730
 the letter c 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.530
 the lower 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.830
 let's go to the last frame 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.030
 let's change the ce in the lower 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.120
 and key in the superior 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.120
 if you already squeezed control intro 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.989
 we see how it affects us like a rotation 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.639
 of an object as if we were winning in 3d and were two laps 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.139
 about himself 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.929
 through the use of advice in a massive way has allowed to define 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:27.519
 a hundred much better in a way very well much more accurately everything that is said 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.169
 the transformation 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:35.389
 and up to here I'm dorian I'll remember that on our website www 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.719
 point connects point tutorials with 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:42.549
 in the forums section and this one has already registered the country convulso name 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.199
 of user and password 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.969
 you can read exercises that will help us to perfect much more 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.919
 tutorials we explain here on youtube 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.249
 thank you very much for the attention and until the next
