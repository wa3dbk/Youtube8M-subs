00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.910

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.439
 pigments than ordinary gloss due 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.849
 what color is incredible 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.710
 saturated and deep matte powder 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.619
 give lips a luxurious effect 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.870
 velvety lips these gloss resistant but 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.520
 completely dry lips they contain 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.059
 hyaluronic acid that moisturizes 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.579
 lips and oil which is not even 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:45.120
 comfort this was official information 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.300
 From the official site I want to add 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.640
 from himself close he was much brighter 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.710
 what is it in a tube because i 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.930
 I wanted to buy a more muffled such 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.750
 crimson shade but it turned out 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.090
 much richer much brighter therefore 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.680
 keep in mind that shades will be much 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.240
 brighter than they are in the tube and 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.479
 This is how a sweeper looks like this 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.210
 brilliance and now I'll show you 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.600
 how bright is it when applying it on 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.600
 lips 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:47.220
 shine this in principle resistant but still 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.460
 he leaves prints on the dishes exactly 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.950
 on the mug but he keeps well even 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.640
 having dinner you have a shade on your lips 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.820
 well maybe a little bit in the middle of the lips 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.600
 and 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.090
 lose your lips with this gloss moistened 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.910
 he even had my lips like that 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.399
 wound with cracks it is not 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.600
 emphasizes no flaking on the lips 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.910
 very good moisturizes them hope this 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.280
