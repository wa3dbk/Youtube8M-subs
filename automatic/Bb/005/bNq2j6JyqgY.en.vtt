there on the side I agree and want to

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.740 
there on the side I agree and want to
make<00:03:09.220> my<00:03:09.370> next<00:03:09.430> one<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:09.970> guess<00:03:10.150> that<00:03:10.180> will<00:03:10.570> be

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
make my next one I guess that will be

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.400 
make my next one I guess that will be
part<00:03:11.380> of<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.560> changes<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.220> will<00:03:12.489> include

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
part of the changes that I will include

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.729 
part of the changes that I will include
but<00:03:14.410> we<00:03:15.340> still<00:03:15.700> have<00:03:15.910> a<00:03:15.940> little<00:03:16.180> bit<00:03:16.299> of

but we still have a little bit of

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.080 
but we still have a little bit of
routing<00:03:17.739> action<00:03:18.130> going<00:03:18.430> on<00:03:18.519> with<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.820> tomato

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090

starting to get an algae layer on the on
the<00:04:01.440> actual<00:04:01.950> tank<00:04:02.190> itself<00:04:03.140> no<00:04:04.140> more<00:04:04.320> pleco<00:04:04.770> I

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
the actual tank itself no more pleco I

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.910 
the actual tank itself no more pleco I
found<00:04:05.610> that<00:04:05.850> he<00:04:06.360> was<00:04:06.630> in<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.170> bottom<00:04:07.350> there<00:04:07.710> I
