there<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.460> lot<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.390> get<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.630> good<00:01:27.810> color<00:01:28.340> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
there a lot to get the good color the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.999 
there a lot to get the good color the
mascara<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.299> didn't<00:01:31.049> length<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.439> mascara

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
mascara I didn't length of this mascara

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.380 
mascara I didn't length of this mascara
very<00:01:32.400> much<00:01:32.610> it

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
very much it

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.890 
very much it
and<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:36.250> very<00:01:36.550> hard<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:37.030> use<00:01:37.300> because<00:01:37.570> of<00:01:37.840> the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
and it's very hard to use because of the

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.690 
and it's very hard to use because of the
pond<00:01:38.200> it's<00:01:38.560> so<00:01:38.860> little<00:01:39.100> because<00:01:39.490> they<00:01:39.580> gave

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
pond it's so little because they gave

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.160 
pond it's so little because they gave
you<00:01:39.790> them<00:01:39.940> anyone<00:01:40.300> oh<00:01:40.510> I<00:01:40.570> think<00:01:40.780> it<00:01:40.960> would<00:01:41.050> be<00:01:41.140> a

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
you them anyone oh I think it would be a

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.290 
you them anyone oh I think it would be a
lot<00:01:41.320> easier<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.740> use<00:01:41.920> if<00:01:42.159> I<00:01:42.340> had<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.820> big<00:01:43.000> wand

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
lot easier to use if I had the big wand

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.140 
lot easier to use if I had the big wand
but<00:01:44.110> I<00:01:45.240> mean<00:01:46.240> it's<00:01:46.479> all<00:01:46.630> right<00:01:47.100> but<00:01:48.100> it<00:01:48.970> did

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
but I mean it's all right but it did

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.100 
but I mean it's all right but it did
clump<00:01:49.479> up<00:01:49.659> I<00:01:49.869> used<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:51.640> bronzer<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:52.960> was

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
clump up I used this bronzer and it was

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.660 
clump up I used this bronzer and it was
pretty<00:01:53.530> good<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.040> I<00:01:54.130> use<00:01:54.280> this<00:01:54.460> as<00:01:54.640> the

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
pretty good and I use this as the

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.249 
pretty good and I use this as the
highlight<00:01:55.150> this<00:01:55.330> is<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.630> all<00:01:55.720> local<00:01:56.050> powder
