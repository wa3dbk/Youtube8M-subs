00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.830 

well<00:00:00.599> I<00:00:00.659> think<00:00:00.750> the<00:00:00.989> row<00:00:01.140> of<00:00:01.170> cio<00:00:01.680> is<00:00:02.510> in<00:00:03.510> the

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
well I think the row of cio is in the

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.559 
well I think the row of cio is in the
middle<00:00:04.110> of<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.380> huge<00:00:04.620> change<00:00:05.100> now<00:00:06.089> we're

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
middle of a huge change now we're

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.720 
middle of a huge change now we're
connecting<00:00:07.080> we're<00:00:07.740> connecting<00:00:08.250> our<00:00:08.370> devices

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
connecting we're connecting our devices

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.330 
connecting we're connecting our devices
we're<00:00:09.179> connecting<00:00:09.630> our<00:00:09.750> customers<00:00:10.340> and

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
we're connecting our customers and

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.910 
we're connecting our customers and
suddenly<00:00:11.840> the<00:00:12.840> playgrounds<00:00:13.650> has

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
suddenly the playgrounds has

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.430 
suddenly the playgrounds has
dramatically<00:00:14.730> expanded<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.750> impact<00:00:16.170> you

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
dramatically expanded and the impact you

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.620 
dramatically expanded and the impact you
potentially<00:00:17.160> have<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:17.670> much<00:00:17.850> bigger<00:00:18.150> than<00:00:18.480> it

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
potentially have so much bigger than it

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.109 
potentially have so much bigger than it
was<00:00:18.660> before<00:00:18.810> our<00:00:19.470> ambition<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.640> be

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
was before our ambition is to be

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.000 
was before our ambition is to be
entirely<00:00:21.510> driven<00:00:21.930> by<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.350> needs<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.830> our

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
entirely driven by the needs of our

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.340 
entirely driven by the needs of our
customers<00:00:23.250> we<00:00:23.910> believe<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:25.019> way<00:00:25.140> we're

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
customers we believe that the way we're

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.910 
customers we believe that the way we're
going<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.619> sell<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.609> not<00:00:26.880> by<00:00:27.060> selling

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
going to sell is not by selling

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.460 
going to sell is not by selling
something<00:00:28.920> directly<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.359> by<00:00:30.599> first

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
something directly to you is by first

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.950 
something directly to you is by first
engaging<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.969> basically<00:00:33.239> we're<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.630> back

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
engaging so basically we're going back

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.810 
engaging so basically we're going back
to<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.350> one-on-one<00:00:34.860> relationship<00:00:35.610> where

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
to that one-on-one relationship where

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.569 
to that one-on-one relationship where
where<00:00:36.660> people<00:00:36.809> knew<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:38.280> now<00:00:38.399> we're

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
where people knew you but now we're

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.660 
where people knew you but now we're
doing<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.879> on<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> scale<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.450> 100<00:00:39.660> million<00:00:40.140> and

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
doing it on a scale of 100 million and

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.920 
doing it on a scale of 100 million and
that's<00:00:41.670> where<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.120> believe<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.629> big

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
that's where I believe the big

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.040 
that's where I believe the big
opportunity

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.350 
Salesforce is very much into the core of
our<00:02:06.360> value<00:02:06.750> chain<00:02:07.050> every<00:02:07.860> MRI<00:02:08.280> every<00:02:08.850> x-ray

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
our value chain every MRI every x-ray

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.719 
our value chain every MRI every x-ray
machines<00:02:09.840> we<00:02:09.990> have<00:02:10.020> out<00:02:10.319> there

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
machines we have out there

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.640 
machines we have out there
is<00:02:10.789> connected<00:02:11.300> so<00:02:11.870> we<00:02:11.989> collect<00:02:12.319> a<00:02:12.470> lot<00:02:12.500> of

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
is connected so we collect a lot of

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.520 
is connected so we collect a lot of
information<00:02:13.519> about<00:02:13.640> how<00:02:14.480> these<00:02:14.659> devices<00:02:15.349> are

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
information about how these devices are

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.339 
information about how these devices are
being<00:02:15.769> used<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:16.519> we<00:02:16.670> can<00:02:16.849> have<00:02:17.090> an<00:02:17.209> MRI<00:02:17.569> you

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
being used so we can have an MRI you

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.490 
being used so we can have an MRI you
know<00:02:18.470> given<00:02:18.799> as<00:02:19.010> an<00:02:19.519> early<00:02:19.819> warning<00:02:20.000> sign

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
know given as an early warning sign

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.949 
know given as an early warning sign
initiated<00:02:21.500> by<00:02:22.129> a<00:02:22.159> message<00:02:22.670> from<00:02:22.879> the<00:02:23.030> MRI<00:02:23.420> into

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
initiated by a message from the MRI into

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.440 
initiated by a message from the MRI into
our<00:02:24.290> surface<00:02:24.980> center<00:02:25.370> which<00:02:25.640> is<00:02:25.879> powered<00:02:26.420> by

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
our surface center which is powered by

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.720 
our surface center which is powered by
the<00:02:27.319> surface<00:02:27.650> clock<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.129> then<00:02:28.459> through

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
the surface clock and then through

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.850 
the surface clock and then through
chatter<00:02:29.030> we<00:02:29.330> can<00:02:29.569> engage<00:02:29.870> with<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.349> hospital

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
chatter we can engage with the hospital

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.369 
chatter we can engage with the hospital
so<00:02:31.250> if<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:31.730> can<00:02:31.970> watch<00:02:32.360> screens<00:02:32.870> together

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
so if you can watch screens together

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.339 
so if you can watch screens together
talk<00:02:33.799> to<00:02:34.040> each<00:02:34.190> other<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:34.870> ultimately<00:02:35.870> also

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
talk to each other and ultimately also

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.140 
talk to each other and ultimately also
look<00:02:36.680> at<00:02:36.829> each<00:02:36.950> other<00:02:37.160> while<00:02:37.430> you're<00:02:37.610> talking

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
is really for us the next stage of how

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.210 
is really for us the next stage of how

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
can only do that by being very close to

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.400

exploring how you can take it to the
next<00:02:53.629> level<00:02:53.720> we've<00:02:54.620> set<00:02:54.920> up<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.160> digital

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
next level we've set up the digital

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.520 
next level we've set up the digital
accelerator<00:02:56.150> lab<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.660> Salesforce<00:02:57.140> is
