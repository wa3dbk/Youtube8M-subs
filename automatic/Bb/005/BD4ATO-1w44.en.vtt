00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.690 
oily or stringy or whatever which kind
of<00:02:39.019> tends<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.470> be<00:02:39.590> on<00:02:39.709> this<00:02:39.890> side<00:02:40.160> ever<00:02:40.370> since<00:02:40.459> I

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
of tends to be on this side ever since I

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.890 
of tends to be on this side ever since I
got<00:02:40.790> my<00:02:40.940> resilience

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
got my resilience

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.559 
got my resilience
but<00:02:42.230> also<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:42.739> just<00:02:42.769> adds<00:02:43.239> texture<00:02:44.239> all<00:02:44.540> over

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
but also it just adds texture all over

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.660 
but also it just adds texture all over
so<00:02:45.170> if<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:45.470> put<00:02:45.650> in<00:02:45.769> your<00:02:45.830> hairs<00:02:46.069> kind<00:02:46.310> of<00:02:46.400> flat

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
so if you put in your hairs kind of flat

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.430 
so if you put in your hairs kind of flat
and<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:47.299> go<00:02:47.450> like<00:02:47.600> this<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:48.080> will<00:02:48.140> give<00:02:48.319> you

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
and you go like this it will give you

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.440 
and you go like this it will give you
kind<00:02:48.680> of<00:02:48.739> instant<00:02:49.220> volume<00:02:49.370> which<00:02:49.819> i<00:02:49.970> think<00:02:50.030> is

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
kind of instant volume which i think is

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.170 
kind of instant volume which i think is
amazing<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.799> then<00:02:52.310> I'm<00:02:52.489> sort<00:02:52.760> of<00:02:52.790> into<00:02:53.090> the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
amazing and then I'm sort of into the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.670 
amazing and then I'm sort of into the
messy<00:02:53.510> bedhead<00:02:53.720> look<00:02:54.080> so<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.319> added<00:02:54.530> some

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680

random<00:02:55.250> messy<00:02:55.549> curls<00:02:55.910> went<00:02:56.269> over<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.599> with<00:02:56.720> the

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
random messy curls went over it with the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.839 
random messy curls went over it with the
oil<00:02:56.959> of<00:02:57.200> Morocco<00:02:57.290> Marc<00:02:57.950> Anthony<00:02:58.310> hairspray
