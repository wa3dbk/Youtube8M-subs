00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
have to mail away 96 times with 44 cent

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.440 
have to mail away 96 times with 44 cent
stamps<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.930> then<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.470> hundred<00:03:20.120> envelopes<00:03:21.120> it

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
stamps and then a hundred envelopes it

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.820 
stamps and then a hundred envelopes it
would<00:03:21.570> come<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.840> total<00:03:22.410> of<00:03:22.500> forty-eight

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
would come to a total of forty-eight

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.620 
would come to a total of forty-eight
dollars<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.370> eighteen<00:03:23.730> cents<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.450> while

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
dollars in eighteen cents so while

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.540 
dollars in eighteen cents so while
technically<00:03:25.200> this<00:03:25.710> is<00:03:25.890> actually<00:03:26.400> the

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
technically this is actually the

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.540 
technically this is actually the
cheapest<00:03:27.000> option<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.720> think<00:03:28.410> in<00:03:28.500> reality<00:03:28.680> the

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
cheapest option I think in reality the

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.790 
cheapest option I think in reality the
17<00:03:29.970> ounce<00:03:30.150> bag<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.630> Doritos<00:03:31.050> is<00:03:31.170> a<00:03:31.200> better<00:03:31.530> deal

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
17 ounce bag of Doritos is a better deal

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.380 
17 ounce bag of Doritos is a better deal
because<00:03:32.100> for<00:03:32.430> only<00:03:32.550> an<00:03:32.730> additional<00:03:33.150> seven

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
because for only an additional seven

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.380 
because for only an additional seven
dollars<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.380> get<00:03:34.560> all<00:03:34.710> a<00:03:35.030> lifetime<00:03:36.030> supply

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
dollars you get all a lifetime supply
