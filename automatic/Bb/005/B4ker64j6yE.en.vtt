00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
thinking is once they get the contract

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.710 
thinking is once they get the contract
and<00:02:46.709> everything<00:02:46.769> signed<00:02:47.220> with<00:02:47.610> Xbox<00:02:48.420> one

which they are going to get a contract
on<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.209> if<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.600> go<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.049> Astro<00:02:53.630> forms<00:02:54.630> and

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
an all brand new headset or my guess is

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.520 
an all brand new headset or my guess is
is<00:03:12.180> they're<00:03:12.360> going<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.569> make<00:03:12.750> an<00:03:12.900> out<00:03:13.350> an

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
is they're going to make an out an

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.220 
is they're going to make an out an
optical<00:03:14.040> cord<00:03:14.310> or<00:03:14.459> some<00:03:15.360> kind<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.630> cord<00:03:15.930> that

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
optical cord or some kind of cord that

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.160 
optical cord or some kind of cord that
will<00:03:16.850> connect<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:18.000> your<00:03:18.180> canoe<00:03:18.780> controller

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
will connect to your canoe controller

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.870 
will connect to your canoe controller
because<00:03:19.350> xbox<00:03:19.799> one<00:03:19.920> controllers<00:03:20.340> input

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
because xbox one controllers input

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.120 
because xbox one controllers input
system<00:03:21.200> for<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.230> headset<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.590> completely

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
system for the headset is completely

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.560 
system for the headset is completely
different<00:03:23.340> from<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:24.090> xbox<00:03:25.079> 360's<00:03:26.329> so<00:03:27.329> my

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
different from the xbox 360's so my

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.210 
different from the xbox 360's so my
guess<00:03:27.630> is<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:28.410> cord<00:03:28.829> they<00:03:29.010> used<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.489> like<00:03:30.420> the

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
guess is the cord they used to like the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.319 
guess is the cord they used to like the
stream<00:03:32.220> court<00:03:32.519> or<00:03:32.609> whatever<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.880> cord<00:03:33.180> is

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
that that should be a noticed on there

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.800

alright<00:04:28.810> let's<00:04:29.020> see<00:04:30.660> now<00:04:31.660> Mike<00:04:32.140> like<00:04:32.920> I<00:04:33.040> said

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
alright let's see now Mike like I said

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.360 
alright let's see now Mike like I said
my<00:04:33.460> guess<00:04:33.670> was<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.240> be<00:04:34.330> early<00:04:34.720> December<00:04:35.380> might

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
my guess was to be early December might

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.650 
my guess was to be early December might
the<00:04:36.610> reason<00:04:36.700> why<00:04:36.910> i'm<00:04:37.090> guessing<00:04:37.480> thats

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
the reason why i'm guessing thats

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.540 
the reason why i'm guessing thats
because<00:04:37.840> it<00:04:38.560> probably<00:04:38.740> won't<00:04:38.980> take<00:04:39.130> too<00:04:39.160> long

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
because it probably won't take too long

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.920 
because it probably won't take too long
probably<00:04:39.700> take<00:04:39.970> about<00:04:40.060> a<00:04:40.180> month<00:04:40.420> for<00:04:40.630> them<00:04:40.750> to

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
probably take about a month for them to

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.260 
probably take about a month for them to
get<00:04:41.110> a<00:04:41.170> contract<00:04:41.770> deal<00:04:42.010> working<00:04:42.550> for<00:04:43.150> the

saying<00:04:57.700> and<00:04:58.330> they<00:04:58.540> probably<00:04:58.980> want<00:04:59.980> to<00:05:00.040> do

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
before christmas that probably makes

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.880 
before christmas that probably makes

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
something that'll be a perfect

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.770 
something that'll be a perfect
opportunity<00:05:23.640> to<00:05:24.640> buy<00:05:25.060> something<00:05:25.330> for<00:05:25.570> someone

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
opportunity to buy something for someone

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.940 
opportunity to buy something for someone
which<00:05:26.050> would<00:05:26.200> be<00:05:27.360> before<00:05:28.360> december<00:05:29.350> or<00:05:29.530> on

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
which would be before december or on

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.570 
which would be before december or on
december<00:05:30.580> so<00:05:31.510> that<00:05:31.690> that's<00:05:31.840> my<00:05:32.170> guess<00:05:32.580> i'm

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
december so that that's my guess i'm

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.250 
december so that that's my guess i'm
pretty<00:05:33.850> sure<00:05:34.150> i'm<00:05:34.300> right<00:05:34.570> about<00:05:34.720> that<00:05:35.020> during

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
pretty sure i'm right about that during

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.870 
pretty sure i'm right about that during
that<00:05:35.500> have<00:05:35.710> something<00:05:36.010> like<00:05:36.430> in<00:05:36.640> the<00:05:36.730> early

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
that have something like in the early

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.490 
that have something like in the early
december<00:05:37.420> maybe<00:05:37.600> late<00:05:37.960> november<00:05:38.380> the

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
december maybe late november the

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.590 
december maybe late november the
earliest<00:05:38.980> biol<00:05:39.310> things<00:05:39.610> by<00:05:39.850> i'm<00:05:40.300> pretty<00:05:40.510> sure

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
earliest biol things by i'm pretty sure

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.450 
earliest biol things by i'm pretty sure
around<00:05:40.810> early<00:05:41.080> December<00:05:41.620> around<00:05:41.680> the<00:05:41.950> tent<00:05:42.340> of

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
around early December around the tent of

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.130 
around early December around the tent of
December<00:05:42.880> that's<00:05:43.090> that's<00:05:43.570> my<00:05:43.720> guess<00:05:43.840> right

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
December that's that's my guess right

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.120 
December that's that's my guess right
now<00:05:44.170> tends<00:05:45.160> to<00:05:45.250> December<00:05:45.760> marking<00:05:46.600> that<00:05:46.720> down

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
now tends to December marking that down

guess<00:07:03.780> these<00:07:03.960> are<00:07:04.020> all<00:07:04.229> guesses<00:07:04.680> but<00:07:04.889> these

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:05.789 
guess these are all guesses but these

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:07.040 
guess these are all guesses but these
are<00:07:05.910> educated<00:07:06.510> guess<00:07:06.630> these<00:07:06.750> aren't<00:07:06.960> just

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
are educated guess these aren't just

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.719 
are educated guess these aren't just
random<00:07:07.229> guesses<00:07:07.710> so<00:07:07.830> I<00:07:07.889> have<00:07:08.160> some<00:07:08.400> evidence

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:08.729 
random guesses so I have some evidence

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:13.520 
random guesses so I have some evidence
and<00:07:09.330> craft<00:07:09.539> to<00:07:09.690> back<00:07:09.870> it<00:07:10.020> up<00:07:10.400> my<00:07:11.400> guess<00:07:11.639> is<00:07:12.530> for

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530 
and craft to back it up my guess is for

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.540 
and craft to back it up my guess is for
Xbox<00:07:13.949> one<00:07:14.130> scuffs<00:07:15.349> around<00:07:16.349> March<00:07:16.770> I'm<00:07:17.190> going
