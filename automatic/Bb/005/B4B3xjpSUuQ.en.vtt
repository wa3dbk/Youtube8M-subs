that<00:03:17.709> once<00:03:18.040> an<00:03:18.340> organization<00:03:19.150> like<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.389> NSA

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
that once an organization like the NSA

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.870 
that once an organization like the NSA
gets<00:03:19.989> their<00:03:20.260> nose<00:03:20.530> under<00:03:20.859> the<00:03:21.010> tent<00:03:21.130> they<00:03:21.760> can

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
gets their nose under the tent they can

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.580 
gets their nose under the tent they can
go<00:03:21.970> anywhere<00:03:22.000> they<00:03:22.660> want<00:03:22.930> is<00:03:23.139> that<00:03:23.200> true<00:03:23.560> or

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
go anywhere they want is that true or

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.650 
go anywhere they want is that true or
not<00:03:23.739> I<00:03:24.099> can't<00:03:24.700> speak<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:24.940> specifics<00:03:25.540> in<00:03:25.630> that

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
not I can't speak to specifics in that

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.440 
not I can't speak to specifics in that
issue<00:03:25.900> but<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:26.739> know<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:27.400> Facebook<00:03:28.090> and

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
issue but I know that Facebook and

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.759 
issue but I know that Facebook and
Google<00:03:28.720> will<00:03:28.810> they<00:03:29.019> they<00:03:29.260> certainly<00:03:29.500> care<00:03:29.739> a

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
Google will they they certainly care a

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.370 
Google will they they certainly care a
lot<00:03:29.919> about<00:03:29.980> privacy<00:03:30.579> and<00:03:30.849> I<00:03:31.720> think<00:03:31.959> it's<00:03:32.079> good

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
lot about privacy and I think it's good

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.530 
lot about privacy and I think it's good
that<00:03:32.530> there's<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.799> public<00:03:33.549> discussion<00:03:33.849> over
