00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.080
 two bags of barcel runners that 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.330
 thanks to one of you to one of my 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.170
 subscribers I found out about this new 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.900
 promotion that tells me to be inside 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.940

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.550
 to find the care 200 of the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.070
 colony I went to 810 super sevens and not 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.849
 there was at last another of the little shops in 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.800
 the colony if they had this promotion the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.050
 identify by the strip and so I bought a 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.180
 couple of bags as I usually do for 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.570

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.690

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.810
 it goes repeating only van 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.570
 changing the monitos 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.940
 that are different and not good because 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.370
 this some we're going to take away the strip 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.790
 to see 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:16.380
 as they are up 30 the barcel logo 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:22.900
 here I have a speedometer up and you see 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:25.180
 180 of diversity says monsters runners 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.560
 they come like that for what I see that they are like 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.600
 greaves 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.049
 flour fritters I do not know how they say 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.399
 in their cities and the readings come 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.800
 simulating that they are the wheels of a 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.230
 big truck a big foot 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.490
 he is very design father yes yes I liked 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.799
 and the truth if you are rich 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.799
 these corn readings are group 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.549
 bimbo and on the official facebook and the 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.200
 twitter that is runners barcel and has no 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.799
 much more to show here back comes 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.299
 again with the speedometer and we're going to 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.890
 open it to see how the prints are 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.320
 and after how I tell them what I 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.900
 I saw on the page that I mentioned right now 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.270
 In Internet 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.050
 there is 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.050
 the screams 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.270
 they look like this in chilito 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.540
 red are still seeing rich will that 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.020
 try them and the first point in favor 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.849
 they bring two pictures maybe it was luck 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.020
 but you see that it was not opening 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.630
 many of 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.080
 sabritas avengers and planes do not 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.200
 they bring stamp then barcel they are not 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.930
 from my favorites I think this is very 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.040
 good and I like they are very parents the 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.910
 I'm going to have to open so that 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.910
 can see in detail 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.420
 come with a plastic which is very 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.820
 well so they do not have to do what 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.910
 we make with the blankets take out the stamp 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.530
 and you have to be busy doing it 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.440
 many or cleaning fact that I have a 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.380
 couple that just came out and there they are 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.290
 filled frying and polvito of 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.560
 michelito then these come with a 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.440
 plastic which is a point in his favor 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.800
 look I'll try to focus 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.800
 list 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.420
 is this a plastic 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.080
 firm 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.320
 a little more 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.420
 It is a firm plastic not as firm as 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.930
 the one with these prints of the good ones and 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.830
 they are similar in similar thick 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.480
 nothing but these are realized what 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.610
 I'll put aside to see if the song 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.560
 to appreciate 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.230
 I think you can not appreciate much 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.840
 the good highlight I did a little bit but 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.680
 All these figures are made 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.680
 according to very bad 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.439
 what is very good this on the part of 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.359
 Marshall back must therefore 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:03.629
 contrary true a district towards 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:07.709
 in more outside so in this way 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:12.000
 they are not stickers, they are not stamps 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:14.780
 it only came out to that one that came out another 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.780
 more I'm going to show you 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.710
 here are five tweets some up to 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.449
 the right 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.449
 and here are the runners 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:33.070
 what do you think? 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.530
 I do not know if there is any caricature of this 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.970
 right now or just promoting 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.270
 I have not seen the hot wheels 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.270
 true 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.940
 but well, I'm sorry 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.430
 showing let's open the other bag 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.289
 sometimes it also brings double and double try 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.839
 as well 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.779
 They will be very well these promotions 

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:57.419
 of barcel because it was not luck here nothing 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:05:02.580
 more comes an airs I'm showing how 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:06.240
 are the structures of the wheels 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:10.099
 and we're going to show the other one as then 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.099
 we were lucky today they add us 2 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.220
 give me this 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.810
 it's a cart 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.620
 is very father chapter taste but this 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.620
 it comes off 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.060
 surely later I'm going to 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.979
 give away with some dynamics then 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.350
 I'm just going to leave it like that but for 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.560
 let them know that this puppy breaks off 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.710
 and it's the same plastic 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.380
 and now I 'm going to talk 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.300
 this on the website tells you 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.220
 that you can participate and that there are 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.100
 awards was entering I was 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:52.120
 investigating you have to register and 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:54.730
 the awards are 10 wallpapers and 7 videos 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.010
 or backwards this 7 blow and see if 10 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.040
 videos which the truth then no no no 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:02.889
 it attracts a lot of attention does not motivate me 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.889
 buy some chips only so that 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:08.950
 so they give me a mengual paper that are 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:11.139
 free on the internet and many things that 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.240
 I did not like the big difference at all 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.550
 for example doritos that right now 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.320
 the world is buying doritos looking for 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.080
 get the strips to earn a 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.680
 prize or other of the sabritas potatoes 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.820
 to try to complete the collection of 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.990
 prints I think that's much more 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:31.270
 motivating you just try to win 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.920
 a code that are the ones that come by 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.070
 here back 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:38.200
 for this then download a video or 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:41.920
 have a wallpaper that's what I do not 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.990
 liked the pictures are well I liked 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.490
 the presentation and the quality with what 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:51.120
 presents them barcel but this one I say 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.830
 the page does not stop convincing me 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.680
 Well, it will be a matter of each 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:07:00.040
 who if they want to continue buying from 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.650
