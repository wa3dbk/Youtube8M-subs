Steve Danny now we seem to have the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.299

power play seemly working much better

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.370 
power play seemly working much better
than<00:00:11.700> we<00:00:11.820> had<00:00:12.000> earlier<00:00:12.179> on<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.630> season<00:00:12.960> what's

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
than we had earlier on the season what's

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.910 
than we had earlier on the season what's
some<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.070> reasons<00:00:14.309> for<00:00:14.780> the<00:00:15.780> success<00:00:15.920> well

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
some of the reasons for the success well

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.410 
some of the reasons for the success well
I<00:00:16.949> think<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.400> combination<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.029> lot<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.180> things

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
I think a combination of a lot of things

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.970 
I think a combination of a lot of things
I<00:00:18.630> think<00:00:18.660> we're<00:00:18.990> right<00:00:19.439> now<00:00:19.590> we're<00:00:19.770> playing

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
I think we're right now we're playing

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.130 
I think we're right now we're playing
with<00:00:20.070> confidence<00:00:20.250> which<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.210> probably<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
with confidence which is probably the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.540 
with confidence which is probably the
most<00:00:22.199> important<00:00:22.769> thing<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.100> we're<00:00:23.460> moving

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
most important thing and we're moving

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.150 
most important thing and we're moving
the<00:00:23.730> puck<00:00:23.880> around<00:00:24.060> very<00:00:24.420> well<00:00:24.800> you<00:00:25.800> know<00:00:25.920> we're

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
the puck around very well you know we're

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.550 
the puck around very well you know we're
getting<00:00:26.460> some<00:00:27.000> point<00:00:27.269> shots<00:00:27.539> from<00:00:28.230> front<00:00:28.500> of

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
getting some point shots from front of

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.960 
getting some point shots from front of
our<00:00:28.650> defensemen<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> net<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
our defensemen that it in the net and

our defensemen that it in the net and
just<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.810> little<00:00:31.050> thing<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.470> things<00:00:32.099> will<00:00:32.219> seem

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
just a little thing so things will seem

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.610 
just a little thing so things will seem
to<00:00:32.520> go<00:00:32.640> well<00:00:32.669> as<00:00:33.120> far<00:00:33.360> as<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:34.380> working

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620

to go well as far as you know working
together<00:00:34.860> we<00:00:35.219> have<00:00:35.340> two<00:00:35.489> units<00:00:35.820> now<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.180> have

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
together we have two units now that have

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.600 
together we have two units now that have
stuck<00:00:36.630> together<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:37.410> about<00:00:37.500> just<00:00:38.370> about<00:00:38.550> a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
stuck together for about just about a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.850 
stuck together for about just about a
month<00:00:38.820> or<00:00:39.030> two<00:00:39.059> months<00:00:39.180> almost<00:00:39.540> now<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.290> you

with<00:01:58.770> my<00:01:58.890> two<00:01:58.950> ears<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.969> other<00:02:00.119> one<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.360> lot<00:02:00.540> of

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
with my two ears the other one a lot of

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.120 
with my two ears the other one a lot of
times<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.049> happens<00:02:01.409> if<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> defenseman<00:02:02.040> is

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
times it happens if the defenseman is

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.160 
times it happens if the defenseman is
going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.310> cheat<00:02:02.520> towards<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.570> pass<00:02:03.780> down<00:02:04.140> low

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
going to cheat towards the pass down low

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.289 
going to cheat towards the pass down low
so<00:02:04.619> what<00:02:04.920> I'm<00:02:04.979> going<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.130> try<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.280> do<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.670> fake

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
so what I'm going to try to do is fake

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.389 
so what I'm going to try to do is fake
the<00:02:06.450> pass<00:02:06.659> down<00:02:06.899> low<00:02:06.930> come<00:02:07.380> around<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.860> then

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the pass down low come around and then

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.279 
the pass down low come around and then
take<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.670> shot<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.179> feel<00:02:09.750> from<00:02:09.959> here<00:02:10.110> it's<00:02:10.229> a

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
take a shot I feel from here it's a

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.750 
take a shot I feel from here it's a
low-percentage<00:02:10.619> shot<00:02:10.709> it's<00:02:11.250> not<00:02:11.400> very<00:02:11.550> good

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
low-percentage shot it's not very good

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.890 
low-percentage shot it's not very good
to<00:02:11.849> shoot<00:02:12.000> from<00:02:12.150> here<00:02:12.270> but<00:02:12.450> if<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.629> can<00:02:12.720> get<00:02:12.840> in

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
to shoot from here but if you can get in

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.320 
to shoot from here but if you can get in
the<00:02:12.959> middle

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
come across and shoot it then it's a

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.710 
come across and shoot it then it's a
good<00:02:15.070> scoring<00:02:15.340> chance<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:15.820> there<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.180> this

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
good scoring chance so there it is this

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.170 
good scoring chance so there it is this
one<00:02:16.900> here<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:21.340> can<00:02:21.550> see<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:21.790> there's<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.030> lot

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.300 
one here you can see that there's a lot
more<00:02:22.240> thought<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:23.440> goes<00:02:23.620> into<00:02:23.860> these<00:02:24.040> plays

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
more thought that goes into these plays

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.000
