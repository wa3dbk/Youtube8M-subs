Playstation will include 1.8 from the pc

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.220 
Playstation will include 1.8 from the pc
so<00:00:47.070> 1.8<00:00:47.789> if<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.969> don't<00:00:48.270> know<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.660> probably<00:00:49.079> one

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
so 1.8 if you don't know is probably one

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.299 
so 1.8 if you don't know is probably one
of<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> biggest<00:00:49.590> updates<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:50.190> have

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
of the biggest updates they have

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.040 
of the biggest updates they have
released<00:00:50.610> for<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.789> pc<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.750> one<00:00:51.899> that

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
released for the pc and is the one that

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.380 
released for the pc and is the one that
the<00:00:52.170> pc<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.710> currently<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.309> right<00:00:53.610> now<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
the pc is currently on right now so the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.610 
the pc is currently on right now so the
reason<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.690> room<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.930> going<00:00:55.140> around<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.469> lot

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
reason this room is going around a lot

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.110 
reason this room is going around a lot
is<00:00:55.739> because<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.250> would<00:00:56.430> bring<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> console

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
is because this would bring the console

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.520 
is because this would bring the console
up<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.390> date<00:00:57.539> with<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.750> pc<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.440> is

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
up to date with the pc and that is

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.750 
up to date with the pc and that is
something<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.920> course<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.250> lot<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.579> people

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
something of course a lot of people

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.160 
something of course a lot of people
would<00:00:59.850> want<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.449> there<00:01:00.600> any<00:01:00.750> truth<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.109> it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
would want but is there any truth to it

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.810 
would want but is there any truth to it
so<00:01:01.379> i<00:01:01.410> think<00:01:01.559> there<00:01:01.920> actually<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> very<00:01:02.730> good

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
so i think there actually is a very good

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.579 
so i think there actually is a very good
chance<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.600> true<00:01:03.809> because<00:01:04.019> now<00:01:04.530> we

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
chance of this is true because now we

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.260 
chance of this is true because now we
are<00:01:04.799> four<00:01:05.100> months<00:01:05.430> into<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> development<00:01:06.180> of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
are four months into the development of

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.880 
are four months into the development of

in<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.799> similar<00:01:14.130> amount<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.490> time<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.210> still

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
in a similar amount of time and we still

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.789 
in a similar amount of time and we still
haven't<00:01:15.630> heard<00:01:15.750> anything<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.500> looks<00:01:16.740> like

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
haven't heard anything so it looks like

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.440 
haven't heard anything so it looks like
this<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.159> going<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> five<00:01:17.759> or<00:01:17.790> six<00:01:18.000> month

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
this is going to be a five or six month

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.420 
this is going to be a five or six month
development<00:01:18.900> cycle<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.830> said<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.310> is

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
development cycle with that said this is

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.460 
development cycle with that said this is
a<00:01:20.460> reasonably<00:01:21.030> slightly<00:01:21.689> bigger<00:01:21.840> update<00:01:22.290> but

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
a reasonably slightly bigger update but

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.020 
a reasonably slightly bigger update but
it<00:01:22.560> also<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.130> going<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.610> developed<00:01:23.909> by<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
it also is going to be developed by a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.969 
it also is going to be developed by a
much<00:01:24.450> much<00:01:24.750> bigger<00:01:24.810> team<00:01:25.350> than<00:01:25.530> develop<00:01:25.860> these

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
much much bigger team than develop these

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.490 
much much bigger team than develop these
smaller<00:01:26.280> updates<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.000> think<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.600> 1.7

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
smaller updates so I think that just 1.7

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.200 
smaller updates so I think that just 1.7
is<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> very<00:01:29.159> unlikely<00:01:29.490> thing<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.000> going<00:01:30.150> to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
is a very unlikely thing it's going to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.580 
is a very unlikely thing it's going to
include<00:01:30.329> something<00:01:30.810> else<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.290> that

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
include something else and that

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.080 
include something else and that
something<00:01:31.799> could<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.130> realms<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:32.880> thing

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
something could be realms but one thing

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.640 
something could be realms but one thing
that<00:01:33.119> would<00:01:33.299> make<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.570> lot<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> set<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.500> that

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
that would make a lot of set is it that

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.859 
that would make a lot of set is it that
something<00:01:35.100> was<00:01:35.400> 1.8<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.180> reason<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.689> would

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
something was 1.8 the reason this would

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.810 
something was 1.8 the reason this would
make<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> lot<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.320> sense<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.770> because<00:01:37.829> microsoft

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
make a lot of sense is because microsoft

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.969 
make a lot of sense is because microsoft
to<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.030> course<00:01:39.299> own<00:01:39.509> mojang<00:01:40.079> are<00:01:40.619> really

and the thing about Alex that makes an

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.420 
and the thing about Alex that makes an
interesting<00:02:33.690> feature<00:02:34.050> is<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.380> alex<00:02:34.920> skin<00:02:35.220> was

interesting feature is the alex skin was

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.640 
interesting feature is the alex skin was
actually<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.880> 1.8<00:02:36.540> features<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.320> would

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
actually a 1.8 features so that would

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.750 
actually a 1.8 features so that would
mean<00:02:37.800> that<00:02:37.860> this<00:02:38.070> update<00:02:38.400> would<00:02:38.490> at<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.730> very

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
mean that this update would at the very

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.360 
mean that this update would at the very
least<00:02:39.300> be<00:02:39.480> bringing<00:02:39.870> forward<00:02:40.080> 1.8<00:02:40.650> 11.8

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
least be bringing forward 1.8 11.8

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.890 
least be bringing forward 1.8 11.8
feature<00:02:41.610> i<00:02:41.730> should<00:02:41.880> say<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.240> it<00:02:42.660> could<00:02:42.870> be

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
feature i should say and it could be

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.270 
feature i should say and it could be
bringing<00:02:43.260> forwards<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.100> could<00:02:44.250> be

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
bringing forwards a like it could be

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.670 
bringing forwards a like it could be
including<00:02:44.670> most<00:02:44.850> of<00:02:45.000> 1.8<00:02:45.450> or<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:46.230> know<00:02:46.350> again

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
including most of 1.8 or you know again

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.620 
including most of 1.8 or you know again
like<00:02:46.920> rather<00:02:47.220> than<00:02:47.370> being<00:02:47.550> half<00:02:48.150> an<00:02:48.330> update

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
like rather than being half an update

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.390 
like rather than being half an update
behind<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.990> pc<00:02:49.380> what<00:02:49.770> i<00:02:49.800> think<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.370> very

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
behind the pc what i think is very

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.730 
behind the pc what i think is very
likely<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.390> means<00:02:51.870> it's<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.290> hint<00:02:52.530> that

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
likely is that means it's a hint that

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.620 
likely is that means it's a hint that
there<00:02:52.860> including<00:02:53.280> 1.8<00:02:53.730> features<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.300> they

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
there including 1.8 features and they

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.090 
there including 1.8 features and they
might<00:02:54.810> be<00:02:54.900> working<00:02:55.230> all<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.470> them<00:02:55.680> right<00:02:55.920> now

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
might be working all of them right now

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.650 
might be working all of them right now
the<00:02:56.160> reason<00:02:56.580> that<00:02:56.820> would<00:02:57.120> take<00:02:57.330> them<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:57.630> long

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
the reason that would take them so long

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.150 
the reason that would take them so long
and<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.080> reason<00:02:58.350> we<00:02:58.410> haven't<00:02:58.560> heard<00:02:58.710> anything

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
and the reason we haven't heard anything

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.860 
and the reason we haven't heard anything
yet<00:02:59.280> would<00:02:59.790> make<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.000> lot<00:03:00.240> of<00:03:00.300> sense<00:03:00.420> if<00:03:00.750> the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
yet would make a lot of sense if the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.420 
yet would make a lot of sense if the
next<00:03:01.020> updates<00:03:01.440> gonna<00:03:01.590> take<00:03:01.770> six<00:03:01.980> or<00:03:02.160> seven

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
next updates gonna take six or seven

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.280 
next updates gonna take six or seven
months<00:03:02.520> because<00:03:02.880> 1.8<00:03:03.450> was<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.810> longest<00:03:04.230> time

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
months because 1.8 was the longest time

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.410 
months because 1.8 was the longest time
it<00:03:04.560> took<00:03:04.650> for<00:03:04.710> a<00:03:04.860> pc<00:03:05.130> update<00:03:05.430> at<00:03:05.640> nine<00:03:06.060> months

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
it took for a pc update at nine months

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.030 
it took for a pc update at nine months
and<00:03:06.570> even<00:03:06.720> though<00:03:06.990> for<00:03:07.230> jay<00:03:07.410> has<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.620> massive

and even though for jay has a massive

and even though for jay has a massive

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
massive changes the game that have to be

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.050 
massive changes the game that have to be
made<00:03:31.680> present<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.250> once<00:03:32.610> you<00:03:32.730> include<00:03:33.030> that

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
made present and once you include that

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.150 
made present and once you include that
the<00:03:33.300> 1.7<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.020> new<00:03:34.200> biomes<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:34.830> all<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.070> new

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
the 1.7 the new biomes that all the new

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.920 
the 1.7 the new biomes that all the new
things<00:03:35.190> going<00:03:35.580> on<00:03:35.670> there<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:36.240> is<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.540> massive

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
things going on there this is a massive

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.170 
things going on there this is a massive
public<00:03:37.350> this<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.770> whole<00:03:38.100> ton<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.490> work<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:38.880> I

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
public this is a whole ton of work and I

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.180 
public this is a whole ton of work and I
think<00:03:39.480> if<00:03:39.630> this<00:03:40.050> was<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.560> update<00:03:40.830> some<00:03:41.010> want

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
think if this was to update some want

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.710 
think if this was to update some want
this<00:03:41.310> would<00:03:41.490> totally<00:03:41.940> just<00:03:42.180> by<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.420> amount<00:03:42.630> of

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
this would totally just by the amount of

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.330 
this would totally just by the amount of
time<00:03:42.900> they<00:03:43.050> spent<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.410> think<00:03:43.890> it<00:03:44.010> would<00:03:44.130> you

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
time they spent I think it would you

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.180 
time they spent I think it would you
know<00:03:44.459> make<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:44.700> lot<00:03:44.910> of<00:03:44.940> sense<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:46.290> that's<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.890> one

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
know make a lot of sense so that's a one

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.740 
know make a lot of sense so that's a one
possible<00:03:47.610> Township<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.240> what's<00:03:48.420> going<00:03:48.510> on

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
possible Township to what's going on

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.300 
possible Township to what's going on
here<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.020> I<00:03:49.080> think<00:03:49.320> it's<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.500> most<00:03:49.680> likely<00:03:50.130> if

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
here and I think it's the most likely if

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.820 
here and I think it's the most likely if
you<00:03:50.850> know<00:03:50.940> 1.7<00:03:51.570> is<00:03:51.660> ninety-nine<00:03:52.260> point<00:03:52.590> like

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
you know 1.7 is ninety-nine point like

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.130 
you know 1.7 is ninety-nine point like
five<00:03:53.400> or<00:03:53.610> point<00:03:53.820> nine<00:03:53.970> percent<00:03:54.360> but<00:03:54.510> no<00:03:54.930> sure

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
five or point nine percent but no sure

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.960 
five or point nine percent but no sure
we're<00:03:55.290> coming<00:03:55.530> I'd<00:03:55.830> say<00:03:56.070> where<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.280> I'm<00:03:56.760> about

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
we're coming I'd say where I I'm about

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.850 
we're coming I'd say where I I'm about
90%<00:03:57.720> sure<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:58.050> next<00:03:58.320> up<00:03:58.410> they<00:03:58.560> will<00:03:58.680> include

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
90% sure the next up they will include

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.890 
90% sure the next up they will include
1.8<00:03:59.430> now<00:03:59.580> or<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.120> very<00:04:00.360> least<00:04:00.570> it<00:04:00.810> will

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
1.8 now or the very least it will

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.840 
1.8 now or the very least it will
include<00:04:01.170> features<00:04:01.470> from<00:04:01.920> 1.8<00:04:02.400> because<00:04:02.700> it's

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
include features from 1.8 because it's

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.340 
include features from 1.8 because it's
at<00:04:02.940> least<00:04:03.150> got<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.420> axe<00:04:03.570> again<00:04:03.870> one<00:04:04.050> point<00:04:04.230> hey

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
at least got the axe again one point hey

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.870 
at least got the axe again one point hey
I<00:04:04.500> wouldn't<00:04:04.860> be<00:04:04.920> surprised<00:04:05.280> if<00:04:05.459> they<00:04:05.610> take<00:04:05.820> a

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
I wouldn't be surprised if they take a

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.340 
I wouldn't be surprised if they take a
few<00:04:06.150> like<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:06.510> rabbits<00:04:06.840> from<00:04:06.930> point<00:04:07.230> A<00:04:07.290> so

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
few like the rabbits from point A so

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.810 
few like the rabbits from point A so
there's<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.680> few<00:04:07.709> features<00:04:07.980> like<00:04:08.280> that<00:04:08.490> because

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
there's a few features like that because

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.979 
there's a few features like that because
that<00:04:09.000> would<00:04:09.240> be<00:04:09.270> something<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.750> lot<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:09.930> people

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
that would be something a lot of people

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.110 
that would be something a lot of people
want<00:04:10.380> but<00:04:10.590> uh<00:04:10.620> yeah<00:04:11.100> going<00:04:11.489> off<00:04:11.580> from<00:04:11.730> that<00:04:11.880> if

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
want but uh yeah going off from that if

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.120 
want but uh yeah going off from that if
we<00:04:12.330> assume<00:04:12.570> it's<00:04:12.750> not<00:04:13.020> 1.8<00:04:13.590> just<00:04:13.800> so<00:04:13.890> you<00:04:13.950> look

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
we assume it's not 1.8 just so you look

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.010 
we assume it's not 1.8 just so you look
like<00:04:14.250> okay<00:04:14.670> so<00:04:14.730> one<00:04:15.360> point<00:04:15.570> it's<00:04:15.780> not

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
like okay so one point it's not

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.720 
like okay so one point it's not
guaranteed<00:04:16.230> what's<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.100> other<00:04:17.220> temp<00:04:17.489> sent

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
guaranteed what's the other temp sent

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.250 
guaranteed what's the other temp sent
then<00:04:17.850> toy<00:04:18.000> cats<00:04:18.270> so<00:04:18.450> there's<00:04:18.810> a<00:04:18.870> tiny<00:04:19.140> chance

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
then toy cats so there's a tiny chance

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260 
then toy cats so there's a tiny chance
that<00:04:19.709> they<00:04:19.770> will<00:04:19.950> just<00:04:20.160> release<00:04:20.400> 1.7<00:04:21.060> by

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
that they will just release 1.7 by

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.630 
that they will just release 1.7 by
itself<00:04:21.720> alongside<00:04:22.169> a<00:04:22.470> lot<00:04:22.710> of<00:04:22.770> optimizations

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
itself alongside a lot of optimizations

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.880 
itself alongside a lot of optimizations
and<00:04:23.760> small<00:04:24.419> stuff<00:04:24.600> like<00:04:24.780> that<00:04:24.810> but<00:04:25.320> i<00:04:25.380> think<00:04:25.500> is

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
and small stuff like that but i think is

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.470 
and small stuff like that but i think is
more<00:04:26.070> life<00:04:26.280> is<00:04:26.460> that<00:04:26.640> they're<00:04:26.790> working<00:04:26.970> on

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
more life is that they're working on

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.910 
more life is that they're working on
think<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.810> might<00:04:27.960> be<00:04:28.140> the<00:04:28.350> first<00:04:28.650> minecraft

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
think it might be the first minecraft

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.320 
think it might be the first minecraft
console<00:04:29.460> mods<00:04:29.700> maybe<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.090> ping<00:04:30.240> the

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
console mods maybe the ping the

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.790 
console mods maybe the ping the
infrastructure<00:04:30.840> in<00:04:30.990> there<00:04:31.170> so<00:04:31.500> they<00:04:31.650> can

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
infrastructure in there so they can

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.380 
infrastructure in there so they can
start<00:04:32.010> adding<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.370> mods<00:04:32.640> in<00:04:32.790> between<00:04:33.060> updates

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
start adding the mods in between updates

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.880 
start adding the mods in between updates
like<00:04:33.600> just<00:04:33.750> have<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.870> dedicated<00:04:34.110> team<00:04:34.590> for<00:04:34.800> that

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
like just have a dedicated team for that

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.500 
like just have a dedicated team for that
because<00:04:35.220> of<00:04:35.490> course<00:04:35.700> if<00:04:35.820> they<00:04:35.910> do<00:04:35.970> have<00:04:36.180> model

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
because of course if they do have model

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
because of course if they do have model
it's<00:04:36.600> not<00:04:36.810> gonna<00:04:36.900> be<00:04:36.990> in<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.110> traditional

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
it's not gonna be in the traditional

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.960 
it's not gonna be in the traditional
sense<00:04:37.590> way<00:04:37.920> you<00:04:38.130> can<00:04:38.310> mod<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.580> but<00:04:38.760> they'll

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
sense way you can mod it but they'll

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.430 
sense way you can mod it but they'll
download<00:04:39.390> like<00:04:39.810> give<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.050> downloadable

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
download like give you downloadable

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.290 
download like give you downloadable
patches<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:40.980> think<00:04:41.400> that's<00:04:41.520> a<00:04:41.670> possibility<00:04:41.820> but

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
patches I think that's a possibility but

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.910 
patches I think that's a possibility but
I<00:04:42.390> think<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.660> more<00:04:42.840> likely<00:04:43.200> thing<00:04:43.410> is<00:04:43.560> that

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
I think the more likely thing is that

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.860 
I think the more likely thing is that
it's<00:04:44.130> either<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.730> know<00:04:44.760> 1.8<00:04:45.360> or<00:04:45.480> there's<00:04:45.780> a

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
it's either you know 1.8 or there's a

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.420 
it's either you know 1.8 or there's a
small<00:04:46.080> chance<00:04:46.140> that<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:46.650> is<00:04:46.770> rounds<00:04:47.220> because

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
small chance that it is rounds because

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.610 
small chance that it is rounds because

realms<00:04:51.930> is<00:04:52.230> um<00:04:52.500> a<00:04:52.680> feature<00:04:53.610> for<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:53.850> PC<00:04:54.240> which

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
realms is um a feature for the PC which

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.930 
realms is um a feature for the PC which
came<00:04:54.840> in<00:04:54.990> with<00:04:55.110> 1.7<00:04:55.800> point<00:04:56.040> four<00:04:56.400> or<00:04:56.640> one<00:04:56.730> point

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
came in with 1.7 point four or one point

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.490 
came in with 1.7 point four or one point
ten<00:04:57.060> point<00:04:57.240> six<00:04:57.360> i<00:04:57.510> think<00:04:57.690> it<00:04:57.780> was<00:04:57.900> basically

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
ten point six i think it was basically

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.650 
ten point six i think it was basically
it<00:04:58.740> came<00:04:58.860> one<00:04:59.040> for<00:04:59.220> 1.7<00:04:59.850> updates<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:00.330> it

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
it came one for 1.7 updates and it

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.910 
it came one for 1.7 updates and it
brought<00:05:00.870> in<00:05:01.020> like<00:05:01.200> all<00:05:01.350> the<00:05:01.470> feature<00:05:01.680> the

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
brought in like all the feature the

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.800 
brought in like all the feature the
ability<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:02.310> play<00:05:02.490> online<00:05:02.670> with<00:05:02.910> friends<00:05:03.540> and

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
ability to play online with friends and

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.030 
ability to play online with friends and
like<00:05:03.930> have<00:05:04.110> servers<00:05:04.470> and<00:05:04.590> stuff<00:05:04.770> but<00:05:04.980> like

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
like have servers and stuff but like

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.980 
like have servers and stuff but like
locally<00:05:05.610> and<00:05:05.850> it's<00:05:06.090> something<00:05:06.270> that<00:05:06.390> makes<00:05:06.600> so

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
locally and it's something that makes so

hair<00:05:29.520> 1.8<00:05:30.450> is<00:05:30.660> quite<00:05:31.140> likely<00:05:31.440> I'd<00:05:31.740> say<00:05:31.920> very

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
hair 1.8 is quite likely I'd say very

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.130 
hair 1.8 is quite likely I'd say very

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
very likely at this point becoming a

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.530 
very likely at this point becoming a
long<00:05:34.350> side<00:05:34.620> 1.7<00:05:35.310> however<00:05:35.880> there<00:05:36.090> is<00:05:36.180> a<00:05:36.210> small

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
long side 1.7 however there is a small

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.940 
long side 1.7 however there is a small
chance<00:05:36.600> they're<00:05:37.050> working<00:05:37.350> on<00:05:37.380> something<00:05:37.650> else

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
chance they're working on something else

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.860 
chance they're working on something else
I'd<00:05:38.130> say<00:05:38.340> realms<00:05:38.790> is<00:05:38.910> the<00:05:39.060> second<00:05:39.450> most<00:05:39.570> likely

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
I'd say realms is the second most likely

I'd say realms is the second most likely
alternative<00:05:40.380> we<00:05:40.680> could<00:05:40.920> be<00:05:41.070> getting<00:05:41.190> old
