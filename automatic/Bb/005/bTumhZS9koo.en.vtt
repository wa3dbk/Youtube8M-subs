00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.700

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.860
 I also choose 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.860
 It is assumed that you select these 3 cards . 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:24.620
 Next, make a gray piece under the top and don't look at this Yamauchi 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.620
 Don't show it, just bring it on 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.240
 top card 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.240
 I will show you first 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:42.070

 3 hands in the middle 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.120
 Four days

 I'll show it back 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.020
 Three from the top 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.020
 When 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.940
 If the bottom is obtained 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.080
 It seems that the top three cards are dummy cards 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.270
 Take the 47 ace 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.480
 Make a break as the top bottom 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.110

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.570
 And more 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.570
 Make a play after pop card 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.909
 It takes on the Yeongjo one by one left of Tech 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.990
 It was the time I took it 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.170
 It is a clay this building to s diamond face is the 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.320
 And 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.890
 I dyed 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.890
 Now 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.110

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.620
 Bring to the bottom 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:22.130
 I was asked to choose the bottom 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:25.150
 Keep the break on the card reported with your thumb 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.150
 Next 3 battles 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.120
 Giving the appearance of saying that is the s of the club 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:45.190
 As it is, I would like to say Break 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.190
 I will show the third one in the same way I maintained 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.280
 And here is the time to align 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.540
 The card below Blake 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.540
 You will drop it 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.110
 And 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.110
 These three 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.290
 Pop as before today 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.150
 Five times before is doubled 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.690
 check 1 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.040
 The card king who also chose from Dopp 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.040
 Ostensibly ace waiting 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:31.370
 Next , I will put one piece from the top into one piece . 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.239
 Because it is a dummy 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.239
 It is good to put 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:44.220
 Even if I wanted to make it into Ella , this is true 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:47.510
 Make a gray mouth under the second piece from the top 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.510
 You are waiting for you 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.930
 Hmm 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.930
 I can say 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.800
 How did you wait for Ella by doing so? 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.800
 is 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.370
 It has become the order of Pick got the cards in the right of ace 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.100
 Take Imayamachi 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.100

 As you and Nemata card gap 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.980
 Next hex out second card

 At the time of my mother's war this card Senjo commentary so please take a look from here 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.150
 Then it looks like Ace has come up and 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.360
 Between face-to-face aces 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.480
 Two face-down cards are assimilated 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.110
 Because there are these two cards 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.110
 I wanted
