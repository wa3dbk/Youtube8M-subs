00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.310
 farmer practice test 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.260
 with the presentation of his great 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.750
 lilly has caused a stir 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.880
 the hydraulically swiveling headband 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.310
 was an absolute novelty and was 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.500
 There were also many discussions here 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.680
 curious so we have the smallest 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.610
 model the tv pr 50d in practice 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.390
 tested the tv pr there are three in the 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.750
 sizes between 31 and 41 cubic meters in 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.310
 the execution also with dosed 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.110
 Unfortunately, our test candidate was only with 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.600
 the standard suspension above 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.309
 we have equipped at the corn harvest 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.829
 both the permissible total weight of 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.670
 20 tons as well as the drawbar load of 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.320
 two tons crossed again and again 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.329
 with the optional ball-head coupling 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.250
 you can load two tons more 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.199
 So who the entire volume with 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.390
 wants to take advantage of heavy feed the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.460
 should the timo necessarily down with 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.949
 order hanging 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.270
 lily has the 710 on our test car 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.580
 Raised wide tires 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.800
 on the wake steered boogie tandem 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.750
 Chassis we can not expose anything 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.570
 When loading grass, the tea co 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.090
 a good figure the uncontrolled tines 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.950
 the 1 meter 90 wide pickup take that 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.770
 Feed clean even on faster 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.810
 drive and in curves the standard 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.410
 start role and the short distance to 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.330
 Rotor support the photo +2 tracking 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.350
 steered tasting wheels guide the pick up 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.780
 over the ground 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.940
 our test car was in addition to a 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.710
 gastrono equipped she runs 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.390
 between the tractor tracks and 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.920
 ensures even under moist 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.420
 conditions a good soil adaptation 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.930
 even with the engine, there is not much to 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.150
 gripe 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.130
 He will use a maintenance-free oil bath 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.880
 gears and big star wheels 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.700
 driven 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.800
 the spirally arranged sink with 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.770
 wide pads ensure high 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.610
 throughput the cutting unit works with 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.320
 40 knives 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.140
 With that the tigo reaches one 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.210
 theoretical cutting length of 37 mm 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.880
 if necessary , you can only with the 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.800
 Half knife set work every knife 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.960
 is individually about a kink feather against 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.300
 foreign bodies secured the cutting unit 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.400
 can be removed laterally without tools 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.739
 then you can swing the knives in 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.870
 take comfortable position 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.629
 To save power, Lily has the karts 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.720
 ground in the front area around 25 cm 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.890
 lowered four stable chains slide 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.049
 the lining to the rear 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.010
 the speed is infinitely variable 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:40.560
 set technical highlight is the 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.670
 moving front wall while loading pans 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.830
 she's all the way back 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.760
 the two-stage charging automatic makes 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.010
 good work 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.500
 It governs the position of the wall 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.690
 automatically the compression will be the 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.239
 dagen voll gives the wall all the way to the front 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.910
 and gives more over the voerder channel 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.129
 six cubic meters of cargo space free this 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.049
 Volume could be saved in the back 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.810
 therefore the tiger is comparatively 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:07.670
 compact the tail does not adorn 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.670
 big advantage on narrow courtyards 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.450
 The front wall also helps with unloading 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.490
 with you presses the lining stock 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.910
 behind and supports the circle 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.460
 ground 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.310
 this relieves the drive and guarantees 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.380
 a quick complete emptying unfortunately 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.720
 The knicks are too weak to be heavy 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.040
 drove up to stalk 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.570
 When using the hex you can work the 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.910
 front wall very forward 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.170
 the construction is actually open above 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.540
 So do not have to rebuild 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.670
 on the beveled frame profiles 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.030
 and fenders hardly lay lining 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.810
 that the street could pollute 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.400
 As standard, the loader can be 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.709
 control over isobus 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.200
 we have with the terminal of lily 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.840
 our test drivers worked well 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.000
 coping with the pricing 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.910
 shows lily confident in 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.580
 basic equipment costs the tv pr 50d 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.830
 a good 109,000 euros included 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.140
 value added tax for those we tested 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.650
 execution are again 9000 euros more 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.650
 due 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.060
 more videos about tractors and 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.890
 you will find agricultural machinery 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.600

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.880
