00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.130
 one can 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.130
 again 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.590
 and all are ready to need to breathe 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.900
 a 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.719
 on 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.780
 very good in a bad bank with 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.300
 Of course you have to do that 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.770
 connective tissue especially for you 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.950
 you have to remove interesting 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.260
 the cabaret fans important or watch 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.660

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.680
 get contract by insisting that 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.280
 I also look at the cheese as it is called 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.280
 you do that again 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.260
 That's what you call blanching 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.200
 But I have to say a classic one 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:20.020
 not slaughtered me too little 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:23.600
 work too little sure of him 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.340
 sitting all my time making hour 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.570
