Queen to c7 not only defending pawn on

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.610 
Queen to c7 not only defending pawn on
f7<00:03:31.040> but<00:03:31.790> black<00:03:32.090> is<00:03:32.120> threatening<00:03:32.989> a<00:03:33.109> checkmate

f7 but black is threatening a checkmate

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.319 
f7 but black is threatening a checkmate
and<00:03:34.660> then<00:03:35.660> we<00:03:35.780> would<00:03:35.870> have<00:03:35.930> this<00:03:36.200> variation

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
and then we would have this variation

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.380 
and then we would have this variation
Queen<00:03:38.329> takes<00:03:38.540> on<00:03:38.870> h6<00:03:39.410> check<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:40.010> after<00:03:40.970> King

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.220 
to g8 white has nothing better but to
repeat<00:03:45.230> position<00:03:46.180> because<00:03:47.180> if<00:03:47.390> he<00:03:47.540> tries<00:03:47.840> this

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
repeat position because if he tries this

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.729
