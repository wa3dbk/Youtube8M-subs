back into the rd we're gonna be more

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.660 
back into the rd we're gonna be more
likely<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.930> access<00:02:04.680> an<00:02:04.829> agenda<00:02:05.250> when<00:02:05.549> we

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
likely to access an agenda when we

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.479 
likely to access an agenda when we
access<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.390> R&amp;D<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.229> other<00:02:07.799> words<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.160> makes<00:02:08.340> a

access on R&amp;D in other words it makes a

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.609 
access on R&amp;D in other words it makes a
lot<00:02:08.670> more<00:02:08.700> sense<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.390> force<00:02:09.840> your<00:02:10.020> opponent<00:02:10.080> to

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
lot more sense to force your opponent to

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.580 
lot more sense to force your opponent to
reshuffle<00:02:11.370> with<00:02:11.730> Jackson<00:02:12.300> first<00:02:12.690> but

reshuffle with Jackson first but

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
or accessing R&amp;D then it does to run R&amp;D

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.589 
or accessing R&amp;D then it does to run R&amp;D
and<00:02:16.709> then<00:02:17.010> force<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.550> shuffle<00:02:17.940> with<00:02:18.060> Jackson

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
and then force a shuffle with Jackson

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.500 
and then force a shuffle with Jackson
forcing<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.650> use<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:20.099> a<00:02:20.190> Jackson<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:21.030> early

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
relate to specific card effects Jackson

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.729 
relate to specific card effects Jackson
Howard's<00:03:59.880> removed<00:04:00.419> from<00:04:00.630> game<00:04:00.959> ability<00:04:01.530> is

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
Howard's removed from game ability is

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.970 
Howard's removed from game ability is
not<00:04:02.250> just<00:04:02.450> recursion<00:04:03.450> it's<00:04:03.900> also<00:04:04.169> a<00:04:04.349> shuffle

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
not just recursion it's also a shuffle

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.069 
not just recursion it's also a shuffle
effect<00:04:05.370> so<00:04:06.060> keep<00:04:06.299> that<00:04:06.450> in<00:04:06.510> mind<00:04:06.630> when<00:04:06.989> you're

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
effect so keep that in mind when you're

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.650 
effect so keep that in mind when you're
playing<00:04:07.410> a<00:04:07.590> card<00:04:07.859> like<00:04:07.980> indexing<00:04:08.880> you<00:04:09.450> don't

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
playing a card like indexing you don't

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.050 
playing a card like indexing you don't
want<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:09.930> stack<00:04:10.349> your<00:04:10.889> opponent's<00:04:11.519> deck<00:04:11.549> and

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
want to stack your opponent's deck and

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.900 
want to stack your opponent's deck and
have<00:04:12.269> their<00:04:12.450> juicy<00:04:12.930> agendas<00:04:13.470> on<00:04:13.590> top<00:04:13.859> only<00:04:14.430> to

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310

Howard<00:04:17.519> once<00:04:17.910> we<00:04:18.090> run<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.599> second<00:04:18.989> time<00:04:19.260> it

Howard once we run the second time it

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.500 
Howard once we run the second time it
would<00:04:20.130> be<00:04:20.160> better<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.729> try<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.060> find<00:04:21.329> the

Jackson<00:04:21.959> Howard<00:04:22.140> in<00:04:22.530> play<00:04:22.890> get<00:04:23.669> rid<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:23.909> him

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
Jackson Howard in play get rid of him

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.280 
Jackson Howard in play get rid of him
and<00:04:24.330> then<00:04:24.960> play<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.409> indexing

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
and then play the indexing

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.850 
and then play the indexing
conversely<00:04:27.250> this<00:04:27.550> could<00:04:27.790> work<00:04:28.030> in<00:04:28.270> our<00:04:28.450> favor

Jackson Howard this is accomplished by

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.220 
Jackson Howard this is accomplished by
installing<00:05:57.550> the<00:05:57.880> shady<00:05:58.180> shard<00:05:58.630> and<00:05:58.840> then

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
installing the shady shard and then

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.830 
installing the shady shard and then
immediately<00:05:59.560> using<00:06:00.280> it<00:06:00.460> our<00:06:00.940> opponent<00:06:01.510> isn't

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
immediately using it our opponent isn't

immediately using it our opponent isn't
going<00:06:02.110> to<00:06:02.230> get<00:06:02.350> an<00:06:02.500> opportunity<00:06:03.430> to<00:06:03.940> use<00:06:04.240> his

Jackson Howard before we access the
archives<00:06:07.240> this<00:06:07.930> can<00:06:08.140> be<00:06:08.260> really<00:06:08.620> mean<00:06:08.860> because

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
archives this can be really mean because

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.220 
archives this can be really mean because
our<00:06:09.520> opponent<00:06:10.060> won't<00:06:10.360> be<00:06:10.540> able<00:06:10.690> to<00:06:10.960> shuffle

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.230 
our opponent won't be able to shuffle

our opponent won't be able to shuffle
agendas<00:06:11.920> back<00:06:12.130> and<00:06:12.400> this<00:06:12.850> can<00:06:13.060> potentially

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
agendas back and this can potentially

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.390 
agendas back and this can potentially
win<00:06:13.840> us<00:06:13.960> the<00:06:14.140> game<00:06:14.410> if<00:06:14.650> we're<00:06:14.800> really<00:06:15.040> smart

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
win us the game if we're really smart

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.330 
win us the game if we're really smart
about<00:06:15.640> the<00:06:15.790> timing<00:06:16.710> well<00:06:17.710> I<00:06:17.770> hope<00:06:17.980> that<00:06:18.190> this

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
about the timing well I hope that this
