00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.480
 in the watchmaking world the beginning that this film goes for a scholar and she signs 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.229
 of design 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:18.859
 after studying philosophy and ancient history and astronomy at 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.300
 university of basel and berne he turned to watchmaker front 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.230
 in the workshop of the international museum of watchmaking élodie de kline I 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.470
 verifies the authenticity of certain parts that do not engage dating the 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.470
 Renaissance 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.390
 he is an exceptional personality who lives in a world well 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.390
 world makes calculators science and elaboration 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.650
 even if in terms of watchmaking the main discoveries have been 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.950
 already make an idea of ​​the axes mine the staff that everything can be done 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.740
 differently 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.740
 self yes bram 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.820
 fascinating he is amazing 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.090
 large astronomical instruments made in the Middle Ages 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.520
 he talked about extraordinary measures that determined the 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.880
 position of the sun of the moon and stars it also served 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.880
 of navigation devices 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.550
 we do not follow what is more we must solve the right lawyers 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.200
 it is successful the mini updated to the astrolabe to integrate it into a 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.200
 wristwatch 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.819
 the most populated block is my thing that served as my prototype 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.409
 more with his show before a final exam 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:22.569
 referee m I will also wear the day of the hexagon of June 24 you see 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.839
 that he is a little thick 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.749
 but it's still like that in the early stages of design 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.510
 it takes the prototypes to suspend the construction in a very supportive way 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:32.679
 to be sure that she resists 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:35.679
 the mutual barbara suffrages our hostile responses 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.149
 the micra strollad has a gear of a precision but never equaled 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:50.359
 144 thousand years will pass before the astronomical data but 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.359
 obviously day 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:03:00.089
 can he afford himself when there is no more precisely the ultimate goal 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:03.839
 turned this precision is to push such a paroxysm and that it is not 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:05.719
 perceptible 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.010
 we will not pass and personally 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.360
 it leaves me a little puzzled 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.929
 apart from an act to the other side this precision makes sense 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:17.039
 the father this inner beauty achieved through mathematics 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:22.009
 as show off outside communal what is understandable is this 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:25.009
 not so precise mentality that he would not be so beautiful 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.340
 more and more finely even more at the creative level it's a great moment 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.930
 when we come to build in the simplest possible way that a 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.650
 very complicated watch that where the perfume part of the keys this is where 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.159
 all the difficulty 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.469
 when the barca came back on the famous mans then when I built his 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:47.909
 astronomical watches 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.209
 I imagined it contained something the couple is posted a 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.939
 message to convey and m a relevant representation of our 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.199
 time swimming pools auchel the study does not stop and in fact this message it's 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.969
 that we must relativize the daily with their good conscience because here it is 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:09.409
 question of the pad where 22 cosmos stands and big one single little beast 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.329
 who shakes the same audience if these watches helps to spark reflection 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.519
 for him this misfortune is a good thing without any doubt 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:19.150
 these models without fuel only 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.040
 the scene was imposed the whirlwind indicating the time by the same rotation 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.630
 of his movement two superimposed bypass hadzic respectively the 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.630
 hours and minutes 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:36.569
 he forgot celine with his magazine and a new exhaust with big 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:48.430
 in silicon a material never used until then in Algeria ap but that one 

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:52.729
 be a clear gold creator thibout still a brilliant scientist any 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.729
 so much a jennifer of places is limited 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.939
 ap it was a plus 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.560
 when I immerse myself in the construction of these objects of worship when I go there 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.219
 lose somehow 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:12.860
 so these are moments of exceptional happiness to push a little further 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.159
 more than under the same theme 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:17.960
 a better goal but when I look at my agenda 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.630
 and that I see that I have three things to do at the same time mickelson can 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.330
 be as important as each other so I'm facing a 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.919
 problem a real dilemma the smaller the shot the weather is more pleasant the 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.089
 all 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:34.389
 competition even though the medium 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.449
 the moments of stress eight of which are times when I should even say the 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:39.220
 emotions 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.220
 myself which can be very cumbersome and we try to avoid 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.520
 more the public at the same time I can m 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.370
 as well as despite that I think the best times it's a 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.670
 canton where he tries
