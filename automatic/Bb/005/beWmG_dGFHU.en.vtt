00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
you can see but what this may imply that

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.700 
you can see but what this may imply that
is<00:00:51.949> maybe<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.399> characters<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.710> create

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
is maybe the characters on like create

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.410 
is maybe the characters on like create
you<00:00:55.949> don't<00:00:56.160> create<00:00:56.399> your<00:00:56.520> own<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.120> pick

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
you don't create your own you like pick

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.270 
you don't create your own you like pick
from<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.690> selection<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.289> characters<00:00:58.710> as<00:00:58.890> you

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
from a selection of characters as you

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.709 
from a selection of characters as you
can<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.609> around<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.969> map<00:01:00.120> as<00:01:00.300> well<00:01:00.480> that

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
can see around the map as well that

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.090 
can see around the map as well that
there<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> few<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.500> characters<00:01:01.649> as<00:01:02.070> well

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
there is a few of the characters as well

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.600 
there is a few of the characters as well
which<00:01:02.430> are<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.850> assume<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.019> playable<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.710> this

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
which are I assume so playable and this

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.670 
which are I assume so playable and this
kind<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.090> makes<00:01:06.360> me<00:01:06.540> think<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:07.200> might<00:01:07.500> be

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
kind of makes me think that it might be

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.920 
kind of makes me think that it might be
like<00:01:08.030> character<00:01:09.030> selection<00:01:09.360> based<00:01:09.659> rather

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
like character selection based rather

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.219 
like character selection based rather
than<00:01:10.170> creation<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.630> don't<00:01:13.170> know

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
than creation and and I don't know

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.210 
than creation and and I don't know
because<00:01:13.380> they're<00:01:13.740> gonna<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> do

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
because they're gonna have to do

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.280 
because they're gonna have to do
something<00:01:14.460> different<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:15.060> terraria<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.689> I

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
something different to terraria and I

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.929 
something different to terraria and I
think<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.590> might<00:01:16.650> how<00:01:17.040> they<00:01:17.340> they're<00:01:17.759> going

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
think this might how they they're going

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.789 
think this might how they they're going
to<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.210> they<00:01:18.299> make<00:01:18.990> different<00:01:19.200> characters

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
to do it they make different characters

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.200 
to do it they make different characters
and<00:01:19.950> stuff<00:01:20.070> which<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.340> can<00:01:20.460> select<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.060> stuff

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
and stuff which you can select and stuff

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.660 
and stuff which you can select and stuff
and<00:01:21.360> all<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.229> good<00:01:22.619> stuff<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:23.640> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
and all that good stuff and so if you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.719 
and all that good stuff and so if you
take<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.880> look<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.180> top<00:01:24.360> right<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.729> it

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
take a look on top right we have a it

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.910 
take a look on top right we have a it
looks<00:01:27.090> like<00:01:27.360> left<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.110> right<00:01:28.290> I'm<00:01:28.530> assuming

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
looks like left and right I'm assuming

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.560 
looks like left and right I'm assuming
that's<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.189> mouse<00:01:29.400> unless<00:01:29.939> they're<00:01:30.180> planning

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
that's a mouse unless they're planning

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.690 
that's a mouse unless they're planning
to<00:01:30.600> make<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.170> xbox<00:01:31.710> or<00:01:31.979> something<00:01:32.310> which

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
to make it for xbox or something which

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.219 
to make it for xbox or something which
would<00:01:32.820> be<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> brilliant<00:01:33.180> idea<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.900> mean<00:01:34.079> don't

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
would be a brilliant idea I mean don't

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.510 
would be a brilliant idea I mean don't
get<00:01:34.350> me<00:01:34.409> wrong<00:01:34.500> last<00:01:34.770> that's<00:01:35.040> pretty<00:01:35.310> good

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
get me wrong last that's pretty good

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
idea because they could just make it to

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
implies that there's going to be quite a

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.540 
implies that there's going to be quite a
lot<00:02:21.110> including<00:02:22.110> potions<00:02:22.530> bombs<00:02:22.830> health<00:02:23.160> and

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
lot including potions bombs health and

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.080 
lot including potions bombs health and
all<00:02:23.700> sorts<00:02:24.150> food<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.720> guess<00:02:25.430> if<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.850> is<00:02:27.000> the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
all sorts food I guess if that is the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.670 
all sorts food I guess if that is the
inventory<00:02:27.510> screen<00:02:27.750> it's<00:02:27.959> not<00:02:28.140> too<00:02:28.380> big

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
inventory screen it's not too big

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.380 
inventory screen it's not too big
compared<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.280> terraria<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.030> inventory

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
compared to terraria and the inventory

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.970 
compared to terraria and the inventory
management<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.930> Terraria<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.410> kind<00:02:31.739> not<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
management in Terraria is kind not the

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.830 
management in Terraria is kind not the
best<00:02:32.280> thing<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.790> maybe<00:02:33.209> they'll<00:02:33.420> sort<00:02:33.660> out

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
best thing and maybe they'll sort out

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.900 
best thing and maybe they'll sort out
that<00:02:34.050> by<00:02:34.260> root<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.770> don't<00:02:35.069> know<00:02:35.190> we've<00:02:35.760> got<00:02:35.880> to

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
moving on to the next picture okay so

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.420 
moving on to the next picture okay so
take<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.870> look<00:03:28.049> at<00:03:28.200> this<00:03:28.320> is<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:28.860> much<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.280> look

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
take a look at this is so much to look

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.479 
take a look at this is so much to look
at<00:03:29.610> hopefully<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.510> can<00:03:30.810> see<00:03:31.230> all<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:32.220> maybe

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
at hopefully you can see all of it maybe

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.860 
at hopefully you can see all of it maybe
you<00:03:32.610> need<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.820> full<00:03:33.060> screen<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.480> hopefully<00:03:33.690> the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
you need to full screen it hopefully the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.650 
you need to full screen it hopefully the
quality<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:34.530> ok<00:03:34.920> ok<00:03:35.640> so<00:03:35.700> there's<00:03:36.180> quite<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.480> lot

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
quality is ok ok so there's quite a lot

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.509 
quality is ok ok so there's quite a lot
to<00:03:36.870> look<00:03:36.959> at<00:03:37.140> and<00:03:37.380> as<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.680> can<00:03:37.829> see<00:03:37.860> these<00:03:38.459> are

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
to look at and as you can see these are

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.759 
to look at and as you can see these are
the<00:03:39.269> characters<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:40.049> you<00:03:40.170> can<00:03:40.290> choose<00:03:40.500> and

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
the characters that you can choose and

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.949 
the characters that you can choose and
well<00:03:40.890> I<00:03:40.920> assume<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:41.820> there<00:03:42.600> seems<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.870> be<00:03:42.930> a

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
well I assume so and there seems to be a

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.180 
well I assume so and there seems to be a
lot<00:03:43.140> of<00:03:43.200> them<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.530> this<00:03:43.620> is<00:03:43.739> why<00:03:43.859> I<00:03:43.890> think

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
lot of them and this is why I think

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.410 
lot of them and this is why I think
there's<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.370> character<00:03:44.640> selection<00:03:45.180> screen

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
there's a character selection screen

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.500 
there's a character selection screen
mainly<00:03:46.109> because<00:03:46.430> there's<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:48.150> all<00:03:48.299> these

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
mainly because there's the all these

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.780 
mainly because there's the all these
characters<00:03:48.959> are<00:03:48.989> kind<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.799> really<00:03:50.130> unique<00:03:50.519> and

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
characters are kind of really unique and

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.449 
characters are kind of really unique and
they<00:03:51.030> all<00:03:51.180> have<00:03:51.329> like<00:03:51.890> really<00:03:52.890> nice<00:03:53.100> art

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
they all have like really nice art

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.280 
they all have like really nice art
styles<00:03:54.030> like<00:03:54.239> unique<00:03:54.600> for<00:03:54.810> themselves<00:03:55.109> and

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
styles like unique for themselves and

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.930 
styles like unique for themselves and
they<00:03:55.380> look<00:03:55.769> really<00:03:55.950> nice<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:56.820> I'm<00:03:56.910> thinking

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
they look really nice and I'm thinking

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.569 
they look really nice and I'm thinking
maybe<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:58.170> sort<00:03:58.440> of<00:03:58.500> classes<00:03:59.010> as<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.280> can

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
maybe this sort of classes as you can

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.310 
maybe this sort of classes as you can
see<00:03:59.730> there's<00:03:59.880> that<00:03:59.910> a<00:04:00.030> superhero<00:04:00.750> woman<00:04:01.140> and

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
see there's that a superhero woman and

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.560 
see there's that a superhero woman and
I'll<00:04:01.950> show<00:04:02.130> you<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.250> gift<00:04:02.489> later<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:03.000> another

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
I'll show you a gift later of another

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.910 
I'll show you a gift later of another
superhero<00:04:03.959> guy<00:04:04.290> so<00:04:04.500> maybe<00:04:04.650> there's<00:04:04.829> a

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
superhero guy so maybe there's a

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.560 
superhero guy so maybe there's a
superhero<00:04:05.340> class<00:04:05.640> where<00:04:05.880> you<00:04:05.940> can<00:04:06.150> choose<00:04:06.390> all

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790

stated<00:04:48.510> that<00:04:48.660> one<00:04:48.960> of<00:04:49.020> his<00:04:49.140> team<00:04:49.410> members<00:04:49.800> did

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
stated that one of his team members did

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.340 
stated that one of his team members did
this<00:04:50.100> so<00:04:50.610> a<00:04:51.090> lot<00:04:51.390> of<00:04:51.420> people<00:04:51.510> thought<00:04:51.870> that<00:04:51.930> ty

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
this so a lot of people thought that ty

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.860 
this so a lot of people thought that ty
was<00:04:52.380> working<00:04:52.980> on<00:04:53.100> on<00:04:53.250> this<00:04:54.240> project<00:04:54.510> himself

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
was working on on this project himself

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.230 
was working on on this project himself
so<00:04:55.320> it<00:04:55.560> seems<00:04:55.860> that<00:04:56.100> he's<00:04:56.250> not<00:04:56.490> and<00:04:56.790> he's<00:04:57.030> got<00:04:57.210> a

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
so it seems that he's not and he's got a

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.880 
so it seems that he's not and he's got a
few<00:04:57.420> colleagues<00:04:57.630> to<00:04:57.960> hell<00:04:58.080> from<00:04:58.230> out<00:04:58.380> so

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
few colleagues to hell from out so

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.790 
few colleagues to hell from out so
that's<00:04:59.010> pretty<00:04:59.220> good<00:04:59.430> and<00:05:00.620> basting<00:05:01.620> what<00:05:01.770> I

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
that's pretty good and basting what I

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.070 
that's pretty good and basting what I
went<00:05:02.040> on<00:05:02.190> before<00:05:02.400> is<00:05:02.850> that<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:03.360> superior

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
went on before is that the superior

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.680 
went on before is that the superior
class<00:05:04.290> this<00:05:04.650> is<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:05.010> other<00:05:05.270> sprite<00:05:06.270> version

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
class this is the other sprite version

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.210 
class this is the other sprite version
of<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:06.840> superior<00:05:07.290> class<00:05:07.470> enna<00:05:07.710> I<00:05:07.800> think<00:05:08.130> I

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
of the superior class enna I think I

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.130 
of the superior class enna I think I
might<00:05:08.430> actually<00:05:08.730> do<00:05:09.180> that<00:05:09.360> like<00:05:09.510> base<00:05:09.900> it<00:05:10.110> on

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
might actually do that like base it on

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
might actually do that like base it on
classes<00:05:10.590> and<00:05:10.770> stuff<00:05:10.950> rather<00:05:11.520> than<00:05:11.670> completely

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
classes and stuff rather than completely

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.950 
classes and stuff rather than completely
custom<00:05:14.160> creation<00:05:14.640> from<00:05:14.760> the<00:05:14.940> beginning<00:05:15.270> I'm

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
custom creation from the beginning I'm

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.420 
custom creation from the beginning I'm
not<00:05:16.170> sure<00:05:16.350> how<00:05:16.500> low<00:05:16.560> do<00:05:16.830> it<00:05:16.890> but<00:05:17.100> we'll<00:05:17.190> see<00:05:17.340> in

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
not sure how low do it but we'll see in

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.770 
not sure how low do it but we'll see in
the<00:05:17.520> future<00:05:17.670> and<00:05:17.940> hopefully<00:05:18.120> we'll<00:05:18.330> get<00:05:18.390> some
