00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
like ok here we go we've got this

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.080 
like ok here we go we've got this
subwoofer<00:01:48.430> out<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:50.140> with<00:01:51.070> any<00:01:51.250> car<00:01:51.790> audio

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
subwoofer out and as with any car audio

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
subwoofer out and as with any car audio
project<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:52.720> appears<00:01:53.140> there<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.659> 10<00:01:55.960> inch

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
project it appears there the 10 inch

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.990 
project it appears there the 10 inch
subwoofer<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:56.590> was<00:01:56.890> in<00:01:57.130> here<00:01:57.490> is<00:01:57.670> not

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
subwoofer that was in here is not

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.789 
subwoofer that was in here is not
exactly<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:59.409> 10<00:01:59.829> inch<00:02:00.009> subwoofer<00:02:00.549> so<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:02.380> can't

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
exactly a 10 inch subwoofer so you can't

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.240 
exactly a 10 inch subwoofer so you can't
really<00:02:02.950> tell<00:02:03.040> by<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.430> back<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:04.240> actually

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
really tell by the back and actually

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.920 
really tell by the back and actually
this<00:02:06.250> little<00:02:06.430> EFX<00:02:06.970> sub<00:02:07.390> that<00:02:07.630> came<00:02:07.780> out<00:02:07.899> of

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
this little EFX sub that came out of

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:08.969 
this little EFX sub that came out of
here<00:02:08.110> is<00:02:08.229> actually<00:02:08.559> little<00:02:08.709> bit<00:02:08.799> more

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
here is actually little bit more

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.199 
here is actually little bit more
impressive<00:02:09.159> than<00:02:09.489> I<00:02:09.579> thought<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:09.909> would<00:02:10.059> be

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
impressive than I thought it would be

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.849 
impressive than I thought it would be
it's<00:02:10.689> not<00:02:10.840> too<00:02:10.989> bad<00:02:11.169> it's<00:02:11.319> got<00:02:11.469> a<00:02:11.499> pretty<00:02:11.650> big

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:11.859 
it's not too bad it's got a pretty big

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:12.720 
it's not too bad it's got a pretty big
magnet<00:02:12.219> on<00:02:12.340> it

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
magnet on it

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.820 
magnet on it
definitely<00:02:13.690> has<00:02:13.810> some<00:02:13.990> throw<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.530> because

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
definitely has some throw to it because

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.480 
definitely has some throw to it because
like<00:02:15.520> I<00:02:15.610> said<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.910> kicks<00:02:16.120> pretty<00:02:16.330> good<00:02:16.800> but<00:02:17.800> the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
like I said it kicks pretty good but the

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.410 
like I said it kicks pretty good but the
difference<00:02:18.850> is<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:21.130> kicker<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.790> guess<00:02:22.180> it's

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
difference is the kicker I guess it's

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.630 
difference is the kicker I guess it's
just<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.750> surround<00:02:23.110> part<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.310> little<00:02:24.520> bit

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
just a surround part is a little bit

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.940 
just a surround part is a little bit
larger<00:02:25.240> so<00:02:25.420> what<00:02:25.750> I've<00:02:25.870> done<00:02:26.020> is<00:02:26.080> I've<00:02:26.590> marked

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
larger so what I've done is I've marked

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.710 
larger so what I've done is I've marked
here<00:02:27.990> on<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.080> box<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.740> can<00:02:29.890> probably<00:02:30.190> see

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
here on the box you can probably see

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.170 
here on the box you can probably see
I've<00:02:31.720> scored<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.320> where<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:32.740> needs<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:32.980> be

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
I've scored it where it needs to be

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
oh yeah real quick also I replace the

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.080 
oh yeah real quick also I replace the
cheesy<00:03:22.709> 16<00:03:23.709> gauge<00:03:23.950> wiring<00:03:24.519> that<00:03:24.640> was<00:03:24.760> inside

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
cheesy 16 gauge wiring that was inside

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.600 
cheesy 16 gauge wiring that was inside
with<00:03:25.330> some<00:03:25.450> 10<00:03:25.720> gauge<00:03:25.989> wiring<00:03:26.769> for<00:03:27.040> their<00:03:27.190> flux

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
with some 10 gauge wiring for their flux

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.800 
with some 10 gauge wiring for their flux
-<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:29.470> there<00:03:30.370> should<00:03:30.610> not<00:03:30.730> be<00:03:30.790> any<00:03:31.150> current

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
- so there should not be any current

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.300 
- so there should not be any current
issues<00:03:32.380> as<00:03:32.650> far<00:03:32.680> as<00:03:34.410> going<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.920> speaker

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
from inside the box

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.790 
from inside the box
obviously<00:03:38.670> most<00:03:39.670> installers<00:03:40.150> do<00:03:40.660> not<00:03:40.870> prefer

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
obviously most installers do not prefer

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.180 
obviously most installers do not prefer
to<00:03:42.070> use<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.730> terminal<00:03:43.510> cups<00:03:43.920> but<00:03:44.920> in<00:03:45.040> this

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
to use the terminal cups but in this

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.320 
to use the terminal cups but in this
case<00:03:45.489> since<00:03:46.420> it<00:03:46.540> is<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:48.760> know<00:03:48.850> kind<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.209> a

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
case since it is you know kind of a

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.110 
case since it is you know kind of a
factory<00:03:49.840> type<00:03:50.410> box<00:03:50.739> in<00:03:51.430> order<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:51.730> keep<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.030> as

way here so you can see it there is the
original<00:04:16.570> grille<00:04:16.900> I<00:04:17.169> think<00:04:17.440> what<00:04:17.560> I'm<00:04:17.650> going

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799

scion logo to match the vehicle and let

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
scion logo to match the vehicle and let
me<00:04:25.479> take<00:04:25.720> the

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
the sub here's my anti vibration pad in

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.020 
the sub here's my anti vibration pad in
high-tech<00:04:35.100> so<00:04:36.100> there's<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.400> sub<00:04:36.670> and<00:04:36.820> as<00:04:36.940> you

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
high-tech so there's a sub and as you

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.720 
high-tech so there's a sub and as you
can<00:04:37.180> see<00:04:37.360> it's<00:04:37.510> kind<00:04:37.720> of<00:04:37.750> mounted<00:04:38.080> in<00:04:38.200> sideways

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
can see it's kind of mounted in sideways

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.230 
can see it's kind of mounted in sideways
because<00:04:39.870> dummy<00:04:40.870> me<00:04:41.200> did<00:04:41.800> that<00:04:42.040> I<00:04:42.610> can<00:04:43.030> change

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
because dummy me did that I can change

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.490 
because dummy me did that I can change
it<00:04:43.420> later<00:04:43.510> but<00:04:43.780> it's<00:04:43.900> not<00:04:43.990> a<00:04:44.050> big<00:04:44.200> deal<00:04:44.380> right

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500
