00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hi dear friends and today we are in 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.919
 once again we will understand why in Spartak 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.240
 everything is very bad 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.269
 the legendary striker Spartak Sergei 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.900
 Rodionov believes that Alexander Bubnov with 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.760
 and books 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.070
 distorted fact well thinks well and thinks 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.880
 but he claims with the book 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.880
 Bubnova familiarized not and not going 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.310
 but Sergey Rodionov sure in the book 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.840
 Bubnova half fiction but to 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.669
 it is necessary to assert this at least 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.770
 read half the book 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.290
 but Sergey Rodionov is an incumbent 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.530
 Spartacus CEO 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.079
 gives such judgments that in the book of bubnov 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.989
 half fiction but not yet read and 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.469
 the worst is not going to something not 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.370
 I'm even going out of curiosity 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.030
 going to read that is 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.129
 okay, I suppose I didn't read it 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.079
 the rest but make a judgment 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.530
 only some scraps 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.660
 knowledge 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.909
 some passage caught my eye in 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.680
 the Internet heard something on the radio then 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.000
 Well, by and large, this person 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:15.080
 can no longer be a good director not 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.420
 maybe because the director is such a post 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.750
 where you need to keep track of everything and do it 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.950
 carefully that is imagine yes here 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.190
 Sergey Rodionov 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.060
 will judge the player by on the sharp on 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.920
 youtube for example he will blindly trust 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.160
 all that you tell him what he 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.110
 like that is he already 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.740
 what he doesn't like is no longer 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.700
 considers it no it was not 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.119
 it is naturally visible that at the person 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.250
 just banged the people gossip because 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.140
 Spartak broke the regime in the apartment 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.979
 will succeed him hanging out the players including 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.140
 Rodion without anyone shook this nonsense that is 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.420
 Well, so pretty primitive is 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.500
 excuse every subsequent interview 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.720
 veteran Spartacus 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.739
 she know more convincing in the right 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.530
 Alexander Viktorovich 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:07.399
 no one can bring any here 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.940
 of facts 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.410
 that was not this all the way around as if 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.270
 excuse them as if they were caught on 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.080
 the crime scene is the same rodiums 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.849
 which is not the facts on the shelves laid out 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.340
 would say here this could not be 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.510
 because so and so here could not 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.730
 be because so and so but 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.110
 instead says the book did not read a 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.879
 tambourines was wrong after reading but you can 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.170
 think that this happened regularly 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:38.629
 says Sergey Rodionov but judging because 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.660
 that Sergey Rodionov says such 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:44.000
 really happened to be honest 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.150
 it is very frustrating and it seems that 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.160
 Spartacus will not be trophies for a long time 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.160
 because such people are at the head 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
 teams
