00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.680 

so<00:00:12.330> for<00:00:12.750> me<00:00:13.280> it's<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.429> question<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.030> remarkable

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
so for me it's a question of remarkable

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.420 
so for me it's a question of remarkable
to<00:00:15.839> jump<00:00:16.080> into<00:00:16.290> something<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.680> already<00:00:16.950> has

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
to jump into something that already has

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.530 
to jump into something that already has
a<00:00:17.720> legacy<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:20.029> family<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.300> has<00:00:21.390> been

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:21.540 
a legacy and a family that has been

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.780 
a legacy and a family that has been
passed<00:00:21.750> down<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.439> i<00:00:22.649> guess<00:00:23.189> it's<00:00:23.369> starting

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:23.790 
passed down so i guess it's starting

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.310 
passed down so i guess it's starting
this<00:00:23.910> kind<00:00:24.329> of<00:00:24.360> William<00:00:24.630> Hartnell<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.140> then

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
this kind of William Hartnell and then

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.860 
this kind of William Hartnell and then
and<00:00:25.619> then<00:00:25.770> router<00:00:26.730> them<00:00:27.090> on<00:00:27.809> Baker<00:00:31.700> but<00:00:32.870> being

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
and then router them on Baker but being

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.750 
and then router them on Baker but being
in<00:00:34.079> now<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.410> kind<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.890> seeing<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.700> a

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
in now and kind of seeing this as a

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.009 
in now and kind of seeing this as a
response<00:00:36.359> is<00:00:36.859> overwhelming<00:00:37.859> and<00:00:38.210> so<00:00:39.210> now<00:00:39.660> this

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
response is overwhelming and so now this

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.959 
response is overwhelming and so now this
as<00:00:40.230> good<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> time<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.739> any<00:00:40.980> available<00:00:41.699> I

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
as good a time as any available I

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:58.630 
as good a time as any available I
realize<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.109> it's<00:00:43.710> true<00:00:44.249> T<00:00:44.370> popping

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.869 

I<00:01:01.450> what<00:01:02.450> well<00:01:03.110> as<00:01:03.379> if<00:01:03.770> it<00:01:04.040> was<00:01:04.309> dissolved

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879
