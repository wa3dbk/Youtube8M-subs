00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.730
 only going to have a review for not

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.940
 description 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.200
 the first and last review of this house and 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.730
 before starting the civilian number 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.240
 I were helping the 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.250
 subscribers 10 are called joseph and danny 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.390
 so thank you very much to both of you 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.070
 they were airplanes and giving me 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.690
 lots of ideas for the house so I do not 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.879
 I'm going to start with the review of the house 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.620
 as I always do is in each of 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.059
 the parties that have the house and how 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.810
 can see the biome changes a little bit 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.310
 It would be the jungle this time the house is 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.630
 modern gives the same as the others and 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.970
 comments can you put me if you want 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.890
 that is of another style although I have already 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.670
 I've been working in a house that changes 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.560
 a little bit of the style of 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.240
 of the other houses that I have made if you 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.400
 The same is different from the rest 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.930
 this study would be like to pass a 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.670
 little the mountain that we would have here 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.500
 well I will teach the house a little bit 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.300
 this would be the house would be a little 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.880
 far to be seen 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.460
 As I said the house is modern I already had 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.130
 good and here they do the others that they have 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.470
 another style and it has a lot of things 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.870
 different from the previous ones that I have done 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.020
 so I'm not going to teach a review me what 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.030
 I'm going to give the quick of what the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.280
 home 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.500
 the house is quite big has 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.060
 enough things around here I will teach 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.250
 the number the outside that would be the 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.659
 crops and those mainly the 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.670
 pool I have it in other places and that 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.060
 Well now below right now is the 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.069
 taught is this mechanism says 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.140
 of the crops I already did in the first 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.960
 house and in the previous house but I do not know 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.880
 I liked 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.250
 as was here so I've put 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.120
 in the end 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.870
 and I do not know I think it looks good very well 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.989
 here we would have a 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.260
 but of cocoa that is similar to this one that 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:30.230
 this was done by the danny subscriber who 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.120
 he came up with the idea and we put it 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.980
 they are very very 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.019
 very well here in this house so what 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.440
 we have put the same because we are in the 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.360
 jungle biome that suits me very well 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.790
 and here we would have the cabin that 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.200
 was in the previous house the advance of 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.790
 a little that would have a couple of chests 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.740
 this is a decoration problem because 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.500
 I do not think they can fit all the crops 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.440
 that as you know the house is to put the 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.410
 crops that we collect here 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.560
 in this little cabin is for that 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.420
 mainly 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.800
 I put it in the previous house and I think 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.660
 it's pretty much in the here as well 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.060
 that can teach now inside of 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.970
 the house that as I said is quite big 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.310
 It has floors and roof here 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.720
 we will have a small place where 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.930
 they divide in all rooms of the house 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.480
 I'm going to teach this side first 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.650
 following this corridor we would have in the 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.750
 Enchantment room that is pretty 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.760
 simple and you can decorate it more 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.439
 your taste me only bracelets 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.319
 shelves and that 's the main thing 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:32.439
 who has this 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.719
 go to charms and as I always say 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:37.750
 grab would be good to make the house and 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:41.550
 I found a step from here 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.550
 inside good under the house 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.560
 I have not left there is not reviewed one of the 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.180
 that has the good chest I have not caught 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.140
 nothing what you have in chest around here is 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.300
 what it has 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.740
 already when you unload the house 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.640
 can you catch it 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.620
 and well I have put it as a 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.380
 an experience farm or something for the 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.120
 style over here on the right we would have 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.980
 the work room which is quite 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.870
 similar to the others I've done 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.150
 in the other houses and in the houses 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.270
 previous and here a couple of pillars 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.970
 that communicate the outside of the gas to 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.230
 crops and if you can clog 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.579
 they want to play survival 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.760
 much more comfortable for the investment that 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.180
 is no monster some move or what 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.870
 be 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.750
 and here we would have the 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.990
 potions room and the portal to read what 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.550
 good the room or the roof is pretty 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.090
 similar to that of the house the mountain that 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.760
 one had a similar roof and I think 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.710
 that makes it look pretty good 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.660
 and I'm going to tell you that in the house there is a 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.360
 secret place that if you want 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.790
 but when they unload the house for 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.080
 who find it can now save 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.470
 anything when playing with 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.460
 friends brothers or whatever for ya 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.970
 you know where the place is 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.430
 secret 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.130
 come with tablets is here in the house 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.080
 and on the second floor we would have both 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.790
 ports that I always do two that would be 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.160
 may be the first secondary that 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.480
 it would be this that is pretty white or 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.140
 square 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.660
 quite simpler than the main one and 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.070
 here we would have a small lookout and 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.110
 Now I'm going to teach you the principal 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.740
 it would be this that is already a little bit more 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.650
 worked with a couple of windows for 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:28.700
 here and the balcony that I also brought it from 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:32.380
 the average of the house on the mountain 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.740
 that had this style of balcony and a 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.590
 Park 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.000
 I'm going to show you now the roof that is 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.300
 where I said 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.390
 where 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.220
 we have the pools 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.529
 and a small garden with a couple of 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.299
 jungle trees around here on the sides 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.660
 and I do not know I think it was very good and 

00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:54.330
 it seems that the house was like 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.400
 built under the mountain that 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:00.000
 is what I wanted to make contact with the 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.610
 house wanted it to look like that and 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.470
 I left it that way so well I think that 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.030
 I have finished teaching him all the 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.260
 home to everything that has the link of 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.880
