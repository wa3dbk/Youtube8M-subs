00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.839
 from ronald tutorials pc 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.770
 well before starting this new video 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.259
 tutorial I leave what are my networks 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.259
 social on screen to visit me 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.989
 more gray and everything else 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.359
 ok in this new video tutorial les 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.870
 I will show you how you can do to 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:43.130
 accelerate the start of windows 7 to 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.140
 accelerate the start 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.320
 what it says to us initiating then to 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.810
 sometimes it takes about 30 seconds 20 and 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.350
 Well that is exhausting then 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.540
 let's start if you have any questions or any 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.200
 question you just comment that 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.380
 I answer it 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.030
 ok we go to our home here 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.409
 we write execute 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.119
 here is this program or simply 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.560
 we use the key combination that 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:17.549
 started yesterday and will come out then here 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.280
 in this text box we write ms 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.540
 conflict 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.540
 and we give an enter 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.659
 and it will not open a window that is the 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:33.979
 system configuration here we go 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:37.610
 to the tab called ranking we give 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:41.060
 one click from here and so this option the 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.970
 we are going to have unmarked the mark and 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.820
 well here we put 15 15 seconds here 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.700
 there will be 30 this option only 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.550
 to remove the welcome and that of 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.880
 Start of windows when there is already May 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.680
 that we are going to advanced actions 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.649
 we select this option that the number 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.180
 of processors for example I eat 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.830
 I have other processors placed three 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.789
 but if you have more than three 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.310
 processors like say 68 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.190
 if you have 8 place 8 if you have 6 place 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.290
 6 place the highest number of this by 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.480
 example I put the 3 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.430
 here we select this option and 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.670
 we place the maximum amount that 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.950
 let's have ram in memory now I 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.519
 I have my memory of 2 GB and the amount 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:33.200
 maximum of these 2048 now as it 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:35.540
 how much ram memory do I have how many 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.720
 arrives at ram memory I have then we go 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.790
 To start as a team we give you a click 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.799
 right and we go to properties 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.500
 when we have given you properties 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.689
 we can see here in the system option 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.969
 we can see where it says installed memory 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.859
 and in parentheses will tell us run and here 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.840
 they will tell us how much ram we have 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.580
 for example I have 2 gigs of memory 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.460
 RAM 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.760
 and then I will leave you a list to 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.490
 that they know for example 2 gigas of 2048 is 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.240
 the maximum amount of memory 4 gigas of 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.610
 4096 it says is 61 48 and so 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.110
 successively then they have to 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.280
 place this depending on the quantity 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:21.550
 of bigliga memory hits that 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.790
 have ok when you have done all this 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:29.020
 we give him to accept here they give him in 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.360
 apply and accept we will get a picture 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.540
 who will tell us that for this to change 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.790
 effect and circulate well we will have 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.440
 to restart the system 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.140
 I do not restart it because I'm 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.170
 recording 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.520
 ok friends this has been all I hope that 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.040
