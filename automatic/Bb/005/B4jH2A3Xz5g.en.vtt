00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
involved in this project and then decide

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.300 
involved in this project and then decide
where<00:02:34.629> those<00:02:34.840> attractions<00:02:35.170> should<00:02:35.709> go<00:02:36.010> and

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
where those attractions should go and

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.929 
where those attractions should go and
then<00:02:37.239> let<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.780> attractions<00:02:38.700> determine<00:02:39.700> what

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
then let the attractions determine what

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.440 
then let the attractions determine what
the<00:02:40.650> park<00:02:41.650> itself<00:02:42.280> will<00:02:42.819> actually<00:02:43.239> look<00:02:43.390> like

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
the park itself will actually look like

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.569 
the park itself will actually look like
so<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.989> end<00:02:44.200> result<00:02:44.530> will<00:02:44.950> be<00:02:45.010> like<00:02:45.400> the

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
so the end result will be like the

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.220 
so the end result will be like the
disneyland<00:02:46.060> project<00:02:46.209> where<00:02:46.750> there<00:02:46.930> will<00:02:46.989> be<00:02:47.049> a

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
disneyland project where there will be a
