I<00:00:01.909> was<00:00:02.909> always<00:00:03.090> very<00:00:03.320> very<00:00:04.320> afraid<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.770> dental

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
I was always very very afraid of dental

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.460 
I was always very very afraid of dental
work<00:00:05.250> and<00:00:05.460> I<00:00:06.000> had<00:00:06.150> put<00:00:06.330> off<00:00:06.480> dental<00:00:06.780> work<00:00:06.930> quite

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
work and I had put off dental work quite

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.299 
work and I had put off dental work quite
literally<00:00:07.920> for<00:00:07.950> years<00:00:09.740> it<00:00:10.740> was<00:00:10.799> something

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
literally for years it was something

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.360 
literally for years it was something
that<00:00:11.459> just<00:00:11.610> really<00:00:11.730> really<00:00:12.660> bothered<00:00:13.049> me<00:00:13.079> I<00:00:13.440> as

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
that just really really bothered me I as

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.129 
that just really really bothered me I as
soon<00:00:14.519> as<00:00:14.669> I<00:00:14.789> would<00:00:14.940> sit<00:00:15.119> down<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.539> chair<00:00:15.809> I

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
soon as I would sit down in the chair I

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.800 
soon as I would sit down in the chair I
could<00:00:16.770> just<00:00:16.920> feel<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.250> sweat<00:00:17.520> begin<00:00:18.450> to<00:00:18.600> grow

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
could just feel the sweat begin to grow

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.620 
could just feel the sweat begin to grow
on<00:00:18.990> me<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.400> I<00:00:20.400> just<00:00:20.850> could<00:00:21.030> not<00:00:21.180> tolerate

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
on me and I just could not tolerate

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.900 
on me and I just could not tolerate
people<00:00:22.080> working<00:00:22.620> inside<00:00:22.890> my<00:00:23.340> mouth<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.850> would

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
people working inside my mouth I would

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.500 
people working inside my mouth I would
gag<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.660> would<00:00:24.840> choke<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.890> was<00:00:26.130> very<00:00:26.970> very

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
gag I would choke it was very very

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.690 
gag I would choke it was very very
difficult<00:00:27.780> for<00:00:28.080> me<00:00:28.290> what<00:00:29.040> it<00:00:29.160> does<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
difficult for me what it does is the

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.760 
difficult for me what it does is the
sedation<00:00:30.060> allows<00:00:30.960> them<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.380> be<00:00:31.500> comfortable

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
sedation allows them to be comfortable

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.369 
sedation allows them to be comfortable
and<00:00:32.369> spend<00:00:32.879> a<00:00:32.969> much<00:00:33.210> greater<00:00:33.780> amount<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.140> time

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
and spend a much greater amount of time

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.290 
and spend a much greater amount of time
in<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> chair<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.519> very<00:00:35.760> comfortably<00:00:36.210> and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
in the chair but very comfortably and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.090 
in the chair but very comfortably and
without<00:00:36.570> any<00:00:36.749> memory<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.199> the<00:00:37.320> experience<00:00:37.859> so

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
without any memory of the experience so

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.099 
without any memory of the experience so
they<00:00:38.579> wake<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.969> next<00:00:39.149> day<00:00:39.239> they<00:00:39.809> feel

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:40.109 
they wake up the next day they feel

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:42.139 
they wake up the next day they feel
great<00:00:40.499> they're<00:00:40.980> less<00:00:41.190> traumatized<00:00:41.760> because

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
great they're less traumatized because

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.970 
great they're less traumatized because
they're<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.449> such<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.659> relaxed<00:00:43.230> state<00:00:43.620> when

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
they're in such a relaxed state when

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.790 
they're in such a relaxed state when
they<00:00:44.070> were<00:00:44.129> treated<00:00:44.609> and<00:00:45.230> it's<00:00:46.230> much<00:00:46.409> easier

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
they were treated and it's much easier

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.590 
they were treated and it's much easier
on<00:00:47.039> us<00:00:47.309> as<00:00:47.699> a<00:00:47.730> matter<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.969> fact<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.329> treat<00:00:48.569> a

it's a specific training set so we had

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.789 
it's a specific training set so we had
to<00:01:33.030> go<00:01:33.090> down<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.270> New<00:01:33.390> York<00:01:33.600> City<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.140> spend

to go down to New York City and spend

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.679 
to go down to New York City and spend
quite<00:01:35.219> a<00:01:35.250> bit<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.490> time<00:01:35.609> down<00:01:35.820> there<00:01:35.969> honing

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
quite a bit of time down there honing

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.709 
quite a bit of time down there honing
our<00:01:36.869> skills<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.439> particular<00:01:38.250> area<00:01:39.240> of

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
our skills in this particular area of

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.880 
our skills in this particular area of
sedation<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:41.929> among<00:01:42.929> being<00:01:43.140> first<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.710> just

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
sedation and among being first we just

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.560 
sedation and among being first we just
built<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.670> up<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.850> such<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> way<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.299> we'll

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
built it up in such a way that we'll

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.149 
built it up in such a way that we'll
probably<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:46.259> more<00:01:46.289> experience<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:47.009> that

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
probably have more experience in that

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.209 
probably have more experience in that
