so this one's also known the scorpion so
you<00:01:23.240> actually<00:01:23.509> it's<00:01:23.960> similar<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:24.740> one<00:01:24.829> on

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950

your back but you're on your stomach
this<00:01:26.329> time<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:26.780> it's<00:01:26.899> opposite<00:01:27.409> arm<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.710> leg

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
this time so it's opposite arm to leg

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.779 
this time so it's opposite arm to leg
arms<00:01:28.909> nice<00:01:29.149> and<00:01:29.180> straight<00:01:30.049> out<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.250> you're

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
arms nice and straight out and you're

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.819 
arms nice and straight out and you're
crossing<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:32.390> back<00:01:32.600> leg<00:01:32.869> over<00:01:33.229> to<00:01:33.380> this<00:01:33.500> hand

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
crossing the back leg over to this hand

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:48.850 
crossing the back leg over to this hand
so<00:01:46.210> I'm<00:01:47.210> going<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.390> get<00:01:47.509> on<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:47.780> move<00:01:47.990> with

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
so I'm going to get on the move with

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.859 
so I'm going to get on the move with
some<00:01:49.159> a<00:01:49.369> couple<00:01:49.789> of<00:01:49.880> dynamic<00:01:50.360> stretches<00:01:50.720> this

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
some a couple of dynamic stretches this

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:51.999 
some a couple of dynamic stretches this
is<00:01:50.960> going<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.170> obviously<00:01:51.259> increase<00:01:51.829> your

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
is going to obviously increase your

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.710 
is going to obviously increase your
range<00:01:52.159> of<00:01:52.340> movement<00:01:52.850> in<00:01:52.970> those<00:01:53.119> muscles<00:01:53.569> and

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
range of movement in those muscles and

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.820 
range of movement in those muscles and
joints<00:01:53.869> so<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.259> first<00:01:54.440> thing<00:01:54.590> we're<00:01:54.679> going<00:01:54.770> to

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
joints so the first thing we're going to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.190 
joints so the first thing we're going to
start<00:01:54.950> off<00:01:55.220> with<00:01:55.399> is<00:01:55.580> a<00:01:55.880> knee<00:01:56.149> hug<00:01:56.420> so<00:01:56.750> this

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
start off with is a knee hug so this

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.870 
start off with is a knee hug so this
obviously<00:01:57.440> helps<00:01:57.979> with<00:01:58.130> your<00:01:58.280> glutes<00:01:58.520> as<00:01:58.670> well

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
obviously helps with your glutes as well

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.480 
obviously helps with your glutes as well
so<00:01:59.209> it's<00:01:59.390> just<00:01:59.479> one<00:02:00.110> step<00:02:00.350> forward<00:02:00.679> bring<00:02:01.459> your

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
so it's just one step forward bring your

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.370 
so it's just one step forward bring your
knee<00:02:01.789> as<00:02:01.970> close<00:02:02.000> as<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.720> can<00:02:02.869> up<00:02:03.080> to<00:02:03.259> your

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
knee as close as you can up to your

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.559 
knee as close as you can up to your
chest<00:02:03.649> making<00:02:04.280> sure<00:02:04.610> that<00:02:04.759> it's<00:02:04.939> possibly

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
chest making sure that it's possibly

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.499 
chest making sure that it's possibly
parallel<00:02:06.020> with<00:02:06.170> your<00:02:06.369> shoulder<00:02:07.369> but<00:02:07.970> taking

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
parallel with your shoulder but taking

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.000 
parallel with your shoulder but taking
on<00:02:08.569> step<00:02:09.789> ended<00:02:10.789> up<00:02:10.940> making<00:02:11.690> sure<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:12.769> balance

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
on step ended up making sure you balance

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:21.670 
on step ended up making sure you balance
your<00:02:13.610> cost<00:02:13.880> abilities<00:02:14.450> on<00:02:14.660> this<00:02:14.840> level<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:21.560> if

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
your cost abilities on this level and if

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.930 
your cost abilities on this level and if
you<00:02:21.739> really<00:02:22.069> want<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.280> increase<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.730> glute

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
you really want to increase the glute

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.090 
you really want to increase the glute
stretch<00:02:23.299> try<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:23.959> force<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:24.410> knee<00:02:24.650> over<00:02:24.859> to

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
stretch try and force this knee over to

that we're nice and tall and the one key

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.990 
that we're nice and tall and the one key
thing<00:02:45.650> is<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:45.980> make<00:02:46.100> sure<00:02:46.370> your<00:02:46.519> arms<00:02:46.730> are

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
moving a lot of times people have their

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.949 
moving a lot of times people have their
answer<00:02:49.430> side<00:02:49.639> beside<00:02:50.450> them<00:02:50.600> but<00:02:50.720> it's<00:02:50.810> better

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
answer side beside them but it's better

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.660 
answer side beside them but it's better
to<00:02:51.079> keep<00:02:51.319> them<00:02:51.500> moving<00:02:51.650> so<00:02:52.069> trying<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.400> kick

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
to keep them moving so trying to kick

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.849 
to keep them moving so trying to kick
your<00:02:53.180> heel<00:02:53.569> up<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.290> your<00:02:54.440> butt

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
your heel up to your butt

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.430 
your heel up to your butt
keeping<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:55.489> nice<00:02:55.639> and<00:02:55.700> straight<00:02:56.269> and<00:02:56.510> start

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
keeping it nice and straight and start

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.960 
keeping it nice and straight and start
off<00:02:57.560> slow<00:02:57.769> and<00:02:57.799> then<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.160> can<00:02:58.370> generate<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.760> bit

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
off slow and then you can generate a bit

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.610 
off slow and then you can generate a bit
of<00:02:59.060> speed

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.170 

so<00:03:07.620> now<00:03:07.770> we're<00:03:07.890> going<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.070> go<00:03:08.190> on<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.940> leg

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
so now we're going to go on to the leg

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.090 
so now we're going to go on to the leg
swing<00:03:09.510> something<00:03:10.050> that<00:03:10.230> is<00:03:10.470> really<00:03:10.920> simple

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
swing something that is really simple

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.250 
swing something that is really simple
all<00:03:11.490> you<00:03:12.090> need<00:03:12.240> is<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.390> wall<00:03:12.630> or<00:03:12.840> something<00:03:12.990> to

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
all you need is a wall or something to

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.080 
all you need is a wall or something to
be<00:03:13.350> able<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.530> lean<00:03:13.740> on<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:14.130> tend<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.700> use<00:03:14.910> the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
be able to lean on I tend to use the

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.240 
be able to lean on I tend to use the
inside<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.690> leg<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.560> this<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.800> obviously<00:03:17.100> to

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
inside the leg and this is obviously to

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.400 
inside the leg and this is obviously to
you<00:03:17.730> know<00:03:17.820> generate<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.210> bit<00:03:18.390> more<00:03:18.540> hip<00:03:18.780> range

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
you know generate a bit more hip range

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.400 
you know generate a bit more hip range
movement<00:03:19.710> so<00:03:20.310> usually<00:03:21.150> I'm<00:03:21.300> out<00:03:21.600> beside<00:03:22.080> one

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
movement so usually I'm out beside one

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.560 
movement so usually I'm out beside one
on<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.650> wall<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.190> inside<00:03:23.700> legs<00:03:23.940> are<00:03:24.120> swinging

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
on the wall and inside legs are swinging

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.920 
on the wall and inside legs are swinging
up<00:03:25.910> trying<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.030> increase<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.630> range<00:03:27.810> of

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
up trying to increase the range of

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.870 
up trying to increase the range of
movement<00:03:28.020> in<00:03:28.320> your<00:03:28.440> hip<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:29.340> can<00:03:29.490> also<00:03:29.640> get<00:03:29.820> a

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
movement in your hip you can also get a

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.280 
movement in your hip you can also get a
pretty<00:03:30.060> good<00:03:30.210> hamstring<00:03:30.450> stretch<00:03:30.960> out<00:03:31.170> of

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
pretty good hamstring stretch out of

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.410 
pretty good hamstring stretch out of
this<00:03:31.410> as<00:03:31.590> well<00:03:34.430> back<00:03:35.430> up<00:03:35.490> nice<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:35.970> straight

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
this as well back up nice and straight

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.980 
this as well back up nice and straight
as<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:38.760> other<00:03:39.000> slight<00:03:39.300> variation<00:03:39.840> is

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
as the other slight variation is

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.570 
as the other slight variation is
obviously<00:03:40.320> two<00:03:40.620> hands<00:03:40.920> on<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.130> wall<00:03:41.340> and

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
obviously two hands on the wall and

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.430 
obviously two hands on the wall and
swinging<00:03:42.240> your<00:03:42.360> leg<00:03:42.390> across<00:03:42.870> in<00:03:43.020> front<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.320> you

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
swinging your leg across in front of you

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.990 
swinging your leg across in front of you
just<00:03:43.620> make<00:03:43.890> sure<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.070> you<00:03:44.250> do<00:03:44.400> left<00:03:44.700> and

so<00:03:52.380> these<00:03:52.650> next<00:03:52.950> exercises<00:03:53.160> are<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.240> increase

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
so these next exercises are to increase

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.830 
so these next exercises are to increase
the<00:03:55.440> speed<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.100> intensity<00:03:56.550> so<00:03:56.880> usually<00:03:57.630> done

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
the speed and intensity so usually done

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.630 
the speed and intensity so usually done
just<00:03:58.170> before<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.530> about<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.860> hit<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.190> court

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.189 

okay<00:04:47.250> so<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.490> last<00:04:47.729> one<00:04:48.030> in<00:04:48.210> this<00:04:48.419> said<00:04:48.690> to

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
okay so the last one in this said to

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.740 
okay so the last one in this said to
increase<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.800> intensity<00:04:50.250> is<00:04:50.550> Carioca<00:04:51.449> so

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
increase the intensity is Carioca so

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.750 
increase the intensity is Carioca so
sometimes<00:04:52.620> can<00:04:52.889> get<00:04:52.979> a<00:04:53.040> little<00:04:53.220> bit<00:04:53.400> foot
