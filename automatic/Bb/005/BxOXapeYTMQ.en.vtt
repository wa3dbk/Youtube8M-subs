external propane tank now you'll know

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.089 
external propane tank now you'll know
that<00:00:11.250> our<00:00:12.110> preparations<00:00:13.110> were<00:00:13.620> for<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.860> good

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
that our preparations were for a good

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.369 
that our preparations were for a good
reason<00:00:14.360> we've<00:00:15.360> got<00:00:15.509> about<00:00:15.690> two<00:00:15.960> feet<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.350> snow

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
reason we've got about two feet of snow

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.890 
reason we've got about two feet of snow
down<00:00:16.740> right<00:00:17.039> now<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.550> we're<00:00:18.029> expecting<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.750> to

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
down right now and we're expecting it to

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.640 
down right now and we're expecting it to
continue<00:00:19.230> over<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> next<00:00:19.949> two<00:00:20.430> or<00:00:20.580> three<00:00:20.609> days

but luckily with all the precautions we

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.019 
but luckily with all the precautions we
took<00:00:27.420> all<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.109> preparations<00:00:28.710> we<00:00:28.830> made<00:00:29.070> we're

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
took all the preparations we made we're

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.999 
took all the preparations we made we're
in<00:00:30.119> good<00:00:30.300> shape

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
in good shape

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.090 
in good shape
we're<00:00:32.009> nice<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.189> warm<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.059> comfortable<00:00:34.100> and

we're nice and warm and comfortable and

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.350 
we're nice and warm and comfortable and
we're<00:00:35.190> gonna<00:00:35.280> try<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.550> dig<00:00:35.730> ourselves<00:00:35.910> out<00:00:36.300> of

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
we're gonna try to dig ourselves out of

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.979 
we're gonna try to dig ourselves out of
here<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.820> not<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.360> bad<00:00:39.570> by<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> time

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
here so that it's not so bad by the time

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.619 
here so that it's not so bad by the time
it's<00:00:40.350> over<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.070> becomes<00:00:41.629> really

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
it's over that it becomes really

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.490 
it's over that it becomes really
difficult<00:00:43.170> but<00:00:43.950> now<00:00:44.160> we<00:00:44.219> know<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:45.350> even<00:00:46.350> in

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
difficult but now we know that even in

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.250 
difficult but now we know that even in
the<00:00:46.649> Lower<00:00:46.829> Mainland<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.489> British<00:00:47.550> Columbia

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
the Lower Mainland of British Columbia

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.470 
the Lower Mainland of British Columbia
they<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.469> get<00:00:49.649> some<00:00:49.829> pretty<00:00:50.010> heavy<00:00:50.250> snow<00:00:53.480> but

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
they can get some pretty heavy snow but

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.189 
they can get some pretty heavy snow but
our<00:00:54.780> preparation<00:00:57.770> did<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.920> job<00:00:59.719> we<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.930> our

yeah you can see the antenna sticking

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.260 
yeah you can see the antenna sticking
out<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.820> back<00:01:43.640> since<00:01:44.640> there<00:01:44.820> was<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.119> much

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
out of the back since there was so much

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.749 
out of the back since there was so much
snow<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> roof<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.680> decided<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.280> carefully

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
snow on the roof we decided to carefully

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.850 
snow on the roof we decided to carefully
clean<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.149> off<00:01:48.270> being<00:01:48.869> sure<00:01:49.229> not<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.680> damage

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
clean it off being sure not to damage

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.090 
clean it off being sure not to damage
anything<00:01:50.310> with<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.850> shovel<00:01:51.950> we<00:01:52.950> were

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
anything with the shovel we were

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.039 
anything with the shovel we were
concerned<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.000> snow<00:01:54.210> was<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.420> deep<00:01:54.840> that

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
concerned that the snow was so deep that

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.380 
concerned that the snow was so deep that
when<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.770> began<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.340> melt<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:57.119> could

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
when it began to melt it could

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.609 
when it began to melt it could
potentially<00:01:58.020> cause<00:01:58.320> leaking<00:01:58.799> into<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.430> RV<00:02:00.619> we

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
potentially cause leaking into the RV we

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.929 
potentially cause leaking into the RV we
weren't<00:02:01.860> really<00:02:02.040> planning<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.490> shovel<00:02:02.850> the

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
weren't really planning to shovel the

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.260 
weren't really planning to shovel the
roof<00:02:03.119> off<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.509> winter<00:02:04.310> but<00:02:05.310> before<00:02:05.969> we<00:02:06.060> get

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
roof off this winter but before we get

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.839 
roof off this winter but before we get
more<00:02:07.020> snow<00:02:07.110> we<00:02:07.979> figured<00:02:08.280> we<00:02:08.369> better<00:02:08.399> get<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
more snow we figured we better get the

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.339 
more snow we figured we better get the
two<00:02:09.030> feet<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.989> was<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.319> here<00:02:10.619> off

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
two feet it was on here off

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.709 
two feet it was on here off
in<00:02:12.860> case<00:02:13.129> it<00:02:13.310> turned<00:02:13.519> out<00:02:13.670> that<00:02:13.939> it<00:02:14.569> was<00:02:14.689> a

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:14.719 
in case it turned out that it was a

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:18.099 
in case it turned out that it was a
problem<00:02:15.310> if<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.459> get<00:02:16.609> up<00:02:16.700> on<00:02:16.849> the<00:02:16.879> roof<00:02:17.120> be

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:18.109 
problem if you get up on the roof be

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:19.780 
problem if you get up on the roof be
super<00:02:18.500> careful<00:02:18.680> about<00:02:19.040> how<00:02:19.159> slippery<00:02:19.459> goes<00:02:19.670> up

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
super careful about how slippery goes up

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.989 
super careful about how slippery goes up
here<00:02:20.000> because<00:02:20.359> it<00:02:20.750> is
