really interesting feature right here

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.020 
really interesting feature right here
it's<00:00:51.110> called<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:51.440> filter<00:00:51.680> control<00:00:52.190> actually

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
it's called the filter control actually

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.020 
it's called the filter control actually
what<00:00:53.150> the<00:00:53.270> filter<00:00:53.450> control<00:00:54.230> does<00:00:54.500> is<00:00:55.030> creates

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
what the filter control does is creates

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.299 
what the filter control does is creates
either<00:00:56.300> a<00:00:56.390> low<00:00:56.630> pass<00:00:56.900> or<00:00:57.200> a<00:00:57.260> peak<00:00:57.710> kind<00:00:58.160> of

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
either a low pass or a peak kind of

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.340 
either a low pass or a peak kind of
sound<00:00:58.610> in<00:00:58.880> fact<00:00:59.150> let's<00:00:59.510> like<00:00:59.690> give<00:01:00.140> that<00:01:00.320> a

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
sound in fact let's like give that a

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.229 
sound in fact let's like give that a
quick<00:01:00.530> listen<00:01:00.980> we'll<00:01:01.850> start<00:01:02.089> with<00:01:02.210> our

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
quick listen we'll start with our

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.570 
quick listen we'll start with our
unaffected<00:01:02.989> reference<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:03.470> you<00:01:03.500> can<00:01:03.710> compare

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
unaffected reference so you can compare

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:17.570 
unaffected reference so you can compare
I've<00:01:04.850> got<00:01:05.480> a<00:01:05.510> PRS<00:01:06.020> 5<00:01:06.230> 13<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:06.980> an<00:01:07.520> evh<00:01:08.020> 5150<00:01:09.020> 3

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.180 

that's<00:01:18.510> with<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.870> MF<00:01:19.290> Drive<00:01:19.530> disengaged

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
that's with the MF Drive disengaged

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.920 
that's with the MF Drive disengaged
which<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:21.120> here<00:01:21.270> there's<00:01:21.480> a<00:01:21.540> little<00:01:21.660> bit<00:01:21.840> of

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
which in here there's a little bit of

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.360 
which in here there's a little bit of
hair<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.380> but<00:01:22.530> frankly<00:01:22.890> that's<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> way

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
hair on it but frankly that's the way

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.790 
hair on it but frankly that's the way
the<00:01:23.490> Sam<00:01:23.670> sounds<00:01:23.970> best<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.720> we're<00:01:25.620> going<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
the Sam sounds best so we're going to

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.110 
the Sam sounds best so we're going to
let's<00:01:25.920> do<00:01:26.010> it<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.130> way<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.550> here<00:01:26.730> it<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.880> with

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
let's do it that way and here it is with

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:39.180 
let's do it that way and here it is with
the<00:01:27.150> MF<00:01:27.630> Drive<00:01:27.930> engaged

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.920 

okay<00:01:40.190> so<00:01:40.250> again<00:01:40.970> let's<00:01:41.150> check<00:01:41.210> out<00:01:41.480> the<00:01:41.600> filter

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
okay so again let's check out the filter

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.950 
okay so again let's check out the filter
control

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.890 

you

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.590 

you

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.970 

you<00:01:59.600> can<00:01:59.780> hear<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:00.080> has<00:02:00.230> qualities<00:02:00.740> almost

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
you can hear it has qualities almost

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.980 
you can hear it has qualities almost
like<00:02:01.100> a<00:02:01.130> wah-wah<00:02:01.400> pedal<00:02:01.610> as<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.330> matter<00:02:02.570> of<00:02:02.630> fact

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
like a wah-wah pedal as a matter of fact

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.440 
like a wah-wah pedal as a matter of fact
there's<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:03.950> CV<00:02:04.460> input<00:02:04.850> on<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.060> front<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.330> it

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
there's a CV input on the front of it

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.360 
there's a CV input on the front of it
you<00:02:05.480> can<00:02:05.690> plug<00:02:05.900> in<00:02:06.050> a<00:02:06.170> CV<00:02:06.440> pedal<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:06.860> control

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
you can plug in a CV pedal and control

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.219 
you can plug in a CV pedal and control
it<00:02:07.520> like<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.700> wah-wah<00:02:07.970> pedal<00:02:08.149> kind<00:02:09.050> of<00:02:09.140> an

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
it like a wah-wah pedal kind of an

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.550 
it like a wah-wah pedal kind of an
interesting<00:02:09.440> thing<00:02:10.690> but<00:02:11.690> what<00:02:12.320> it<00:02:12.410> mainly

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
interesting thing but what it mainly

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.140 
interesting thing but what it mainly
does<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:13.010> allows<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.430> kind<00:02:13.550> of<00:02:13.670> dial<00:02:13.940> in

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
does is allows you to kind of dial in

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.510 
does is allows you to kind of dial in
the<00:02:14.750> peak<00:02:15.020> exactly<00:02:15.710> where<00:02:15.860> ever<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.160> want<00:02:16.340> it

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
the peak exactly where ever you want it

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.020 
the peak exactly where ever you want it
and<00:02:17.050> if<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.710> peak<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.130> not<00:02:19.280> necessarily<00:02:19.880> what

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
and if the peak is not necessarily what

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.210 
and if the peak is not necessarily what
you<00:02:20.120> need<00:02:20.360> there's<00:02:20.990> a<00:02:21.080> low-pass<00:02:21.530> version<00:02:22.070> as

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
you need there's a low-pass version as

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.590 
you need there's a low-pass version as
well

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.210 

you

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.839 

you

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.860 

which<00:02:38.849> that's<00:02:38.970> really<00:02:39.270> interesting<00:02:39.480> that

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
which that's really interesting that

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.500 
which that's really interesting that
creates<00:02:40.380> a<00:02:40.530> low-pass<00:02:40.860> filter<00:02:41.030> again<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.390> can

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
creates a low-pass filter again you can

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.120 
creates a low-pass filter again you can
shave<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.959> highs<00:02:43.110> wherever<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.709> want<00:02:43.920> and

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
shave the highs wherever you want and

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.130 
shave the highs wherever you want and
that<00:02:44.790> sounds<00:02:45.330> different<00:02:45.660> from<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.930> tone

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
that sounds different from the tone

00:02:46.140 --> 00:03:04.500 
that sounds different from the tone
control<00:02:46.560> which<00:02:46.920> operates<00:02:47.520> more<00:02:47.700> like<00:02:47.910> this

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.700 

which<00:03:05.510> sounds<00:03:05.840> more<00:03:05.990> like<00:03:06.020> a<00:03:06.170> standard<00:03:06.500> tone

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
which sounds more like a standard tone

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.470 
which sounds more like a standard tone
control<00:03:07.100> we've<00:03:07.700> been<00:03:07.880> listening<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.360> the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
control we've been listening to the

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.120 
control we've been listening to the
higher<00:03:08.780> gain<00:03:09.080> side<00:03:09.320> of<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.530> pedal<00:03:09.800> so<00:03:09.920> let's

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
higher gain side of the pedal so let's
