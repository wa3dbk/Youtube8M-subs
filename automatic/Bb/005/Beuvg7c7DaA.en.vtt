00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
into town and get the Brock's I need and

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.210 
into town and get the Brock's I need and
I<00:04:31.820> still<00:04:32.060> have<00:04:32.180> to<00:04:32.270> cut<00:04:32.450> a<00:04:32.800> board<00:04:33.800> to<00:04:33.980> go<00:04:34.070> down

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
I still have to cut a board to go down

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:41.770 
I still have to cut a board to go down
here<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:36.250> -<00:04:37.250> if<00:04:37.400> you<00:04:37.580> got<00:04:37.760> that<00:04:37.910> little<00:04:40.780> that

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
here to - if you got that little that

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.040 
here to - if you got that little that
little<00:04:41.990> gap<00:04:42.410> right<00:04:42.680> here<00:04:43.630> so<00:04:44.630> I<00:04:44.660> put<00:04:44.870> a<00:04:44.900> board

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
little gap right here so I put a board

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.300 
little gap right here so I put a board
underneath<00:04:45.290> to<00:04:45.500> kind<00:04:45.710> of<00:04:45.770> give<00:04:46.070> it<00:04:46.160> some

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
underneath to kind of give it some

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.340 
underneath to kind of give it some
support<00:04:46.400> right<00:04:46.820> now<00:04:47.060> it<00:04:47.360> would<00:04:47.540> just<00:04:47.570> step

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
support right now it would just step

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.810 
support right now it would just step
forward

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
forward

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.300 
forward
so<00:04:49.820> I<00:04:49.880> mounted<00:04:50.210> together<00:04:50.300> get<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:50.870> bracket<00:04:51.260> in

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:07.480 

should<00:04:55.310> be<00:04:55.340> good<00:04:55.640> that<00:04:55.880> way

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.550
