00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.210
 heading personal experience hello everyone 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.160
 happens 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.980
 once happened to everyone and to me 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.780
 accidentally formatted flash 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.910
 personal photo card 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.560
 videotapes 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.279
 photos I forgot to copy 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.980
 on computer 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.260
 small loss but for the sake of experiment 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.960
 decided to recover data and find 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.670
 working way to solve the problem I want 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.939
 note that the formatting process itself 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.640
 this is just the creation of access structures 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.950
 to the data and it does not delete files like 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.690
 I don't think I want to go deep into 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.239
 Just read this topic. 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.460
 Wikipedia information on the forums in 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.070
 Internet a huge number of programs 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.710
 for data recovery and every 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.950
 manufacturer praises its product reviews 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.910
 I tried all kinds of recover my files 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.010
 restore 2000r studio on none format 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.629
 of these, 100 patients have not recovered 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.449
 data and only 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.649
 handy recovery worked for my case 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.070
 all 100 percent 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.770
 the program costs only 950 rubles 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.750
 I think you can afford to buy if 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.150
 You have such an emergency situation in 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.770
 trial version can be installed by 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.500
 one file per day 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.900
 I want to emphasize that the program worked 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.630
 better than the others only in my case 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.670
 maybe you are using another and this 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.500
 ok so easy we open 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.500
 she immediately offers us a program 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.009
 choose disk we choose our flash disk 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.770
 me sandisk extreme 16 gigabyte 37 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.200
 megabits per second reading speed 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.659
 click it lois and the program starts 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.810
 analyze card card now 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.509
 completely empty she analyzes it 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.490
 very long process I'm not going 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.799
 now show it all to you somehow 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.110
 accelerate because basically on the screen 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.290
 nothing happens here like this 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.750
 appears i wanted a green timer and he 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.270
 measures time i will click on stop and just 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.969
 I will show that there are some files that 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.430
 already appeared we can choose 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.350
 what we want to find on the camera then 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.399
 I have chosen media files 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.970
 videotapes 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.220
 and there are also files 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.630
 container file from the camera in principle 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.930
 I wasnâ€™t here anymore 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.210
 interesting on this ok you look at us 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.690
 there were media files here these videos 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.100
 which I so wanted to get back 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.830
 choose a video you can choose immediately 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.870
 all just holding shift 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.630
 select the video file and click recovery 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.390
 click recover select the folder where they are 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.330
 will be restored and everything that is 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.910
 look further the record folder and here u 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.730
 us all these video files it's just 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.040
 shooting a group with a bone breaker and they are for 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.320
 i was very expensive so i am all 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.590
 could get back in general in principle 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.350
 everything is such a simple program is very 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.480
 good interface nice and intuitive in 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.850
 other programs interface is difficult 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.370
 there you break into a real head there and 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.370
 what is there to do here in total there are two three 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.560
 buttons and ready if you use 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.300
 another program write the name in 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.610
