00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.260
 good morning friends in family we 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.389
 we found in the university 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.580
 Polytechnic Salesian we are with one of 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.099
 the students in this case street louis 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.439
 who is who follows the career of 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.759
 electronic engineering and it's going to 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.189
 comment a little about the acquisition 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.320
 on one side robot is not true 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.670
 good morning our why is it here 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.960
 it is simply very high technology and 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.570
 simply focused for the 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.220
 universities in this case people from 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.780
 common type that is they can not acquire their 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.980
 this robot just because it is 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.659
 focused on research and 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.920
 development in our university is 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:40.940
 very concerned by students 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.979
 special that career in engineering 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.540
 electronic and just gives us 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.390
 this of these tools to improve 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.190
 technology the robot does not always have 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.290
 all the characteristics of the moment 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.180
 but it is simply focused on what 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.440
 let's go in this case as 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.690
 we are in the presentation is for the 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.850
 schools what we have done is to provide 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.309
 something very simple does not rise that 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.799
 You can walk and do a dance too 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.330
 simple that where a taxi then he 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.860
 is endowed with this feature is 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.150
 just to inspire young people 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.560
 to come together to study here in 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.320
 our university and in our career 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.030
 the mission of our university is yes 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.800
 is the engineering of the benefit of the 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.630
 humanity is just not focused 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.250
 just to create engineers so that 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.660
 work in companies but also for 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.460
 bet some science and make it the 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.320
 benefit of humanity just one 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.729
 of the applications of the robot is to help 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.409
 to children with autism they can not 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.640
 communicate with people but you can 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.800
 communicate through a tool 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.509
 for example, give them a computer 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.490
 a tablet is just you can 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.680
 interact then just there 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.390
 we are with a child of this problem and 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.220
 is just saw the robot and stuck to 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.710
 he is not with people he could not 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.259
 talk but he gave him one he left 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.000
 with him then those applications already 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.590
 are giving in the world and this our 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.630
 Duty our work as engineers 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.460
 also equip them and be able to bet on that 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.990
 way to help teachers who 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.220
 teach children with autism to 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.220
 listen to what is simpler 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.090
 h 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.819
 good and after seeing that wonderful 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.230
 robot how he moved and things 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.420
 wonderful also what can you do 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.220
 also with the creativity of the 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.290
 students now we find ourselves with 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.240
 fernando giles who is the director of 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.910
 mechatronics career that also has 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.920
 news in this case a new machine 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.420
 that they have also acquired for the 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.970
 student development in this 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.610
 good case this machine is a plant 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.000
 complete of an industrial process like 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.640
 you could see in the video 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.460
 does not take the material from its first 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.820
 moment select the material what 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:05.180
 transports what is analyzed in the next 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.330
 phase and at the end it stores it in a 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.610
 winery like najar is identical 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.380
 Factory does not ask the student anything 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.820
 do in the factory that can be 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.860
 any of the industrial park 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.780
 that come to remaining programs 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.100
 thank you very much there are friends 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.110
 viewers you can come here to 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.580
 the polytechnic university selects and 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.380
 see all the wonders that you feel 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.480
 are being made and also see the 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.220
 work them and value it 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.870
 this is all we meet and we go 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.870
 with more information in studies
