who already have a lot of experience in
solving<00:00:15.299> cubes<00:00:15.599> which<00:00:15.929> means<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.560> they<00:00:17.460> know

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
solving cubes which means that they know

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.599 
solving cubes which means that they know
how<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.090> solve<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:19.080> look<00:00:19.260> oil<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.859> Peele<00:00:20.160> you

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
how to solve to look oil and Peele you

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.939 
how to solve to look oil and Peele you
do<00:00:20.850> not<00:00:21.060> know<00:00:21.300> then<00:00:21.869> click<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.260> click<00:00:22.830> on

this<00:00:23.039> cube<00:00:24.019> fold<00:00:25.019> PLL<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.400> method<00:00:26.849> of

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
this cube fold PLL is the method of

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.609 
this cube fold PLL is the method of
solving<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:28.019> last<00:00:28.949> layer<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.730> only<00:00:30.570> one<00:00:31.260> look

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
solving the last layer and only one look

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.500 
solving the last layer and only one look
as<00:00:31.830> opposed<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.579> two<00:00:32.730> look<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.120> which<00:00:33.270> means

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
as opposed to two look so which means

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.540 
as opposed to two look so which means
you'll<00:00:34.020> need<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.410> solve<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.920> one<00:00:35.219> algorithm

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
you'll need to solve it in one algorithm

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.130 
you'll need to solve it in one algorithm
so<00:00:36.239> for<00:00:36.420> example<00:00:36.450> i<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:38.149> an<00:00:39.149> unsolved<00:00:39.840> cube

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
so for example i have an unsolved cube

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.520 
so for example i have an unsolved cube
here<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.590> ol<00:00:41.160> l<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.640> XL<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.329> done<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:43.170> all<00:00:43.500> i

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
here and ol l and XL is done so all i

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.720 
here and ol l and XL is done so all i
have<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.770> do<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.280> use<00:00:44.760> one<00:00:44.940> algorithm<00:00:49.610> to<00:00:50.610> solve

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
have to do is use one algorithm to solve

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.160 
have to do is use one algorithm to solve
the<00:00:50.910> cube<00:00:51.920> there<00:00:52.920> are<00:00:53.129> 21<00:00:53.760> algorithms<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.539> full

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
the cube there are 21 algorithms in full

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.520 
the cube there are 21 algorithms in full
PLL<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.000> i'll<00:00:57.000> be<00:00:57.210> covering<00:00:57.480> seven<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.320> them

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530
