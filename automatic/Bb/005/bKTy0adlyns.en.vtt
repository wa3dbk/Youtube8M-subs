the felling wedge is another item that's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.829 
the felling wedge is another item that's
very<00:01:02.399> important<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.909> use<00:01:03.089> we<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.420> use<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.719> for

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
very important to use we can use it for

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.320 
very important to use we can use it for
felling<00:01:04.199> trees<00:01:04.230> or<00:01:05.159> even<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.030> when<00:01:06.210> you're

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
felling trees or even and when you're

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.480 
felling trees or even and when you're
cutting<00:01:06.509> logs<00:01:06.840> later<00:01:07.259> but<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.009> plastic

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
cutting logs later but it's a plastic

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.039 
cutting logs later but it's a plastic
wedge<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.390> hit<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.659> with<00:01:09.899> your

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
wedge so if you do hit it with your

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.660 
wedge so if you do hit it with your
chain<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.350> don't<00:01:10.740> destroy<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.130> if<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.549> use<00:01:11.640> a

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
chain you don't destroy it if you use a

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.609 
chain you don't destroy it if you use a
metal<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.270> hit<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> chain<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.380> could

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
metal one hit the chain you could

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.679 
metal one hit the chain you could
destroy<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.220> chain<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.700> could<00:01:14.820> Jam<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.329> it

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
destroy the chain it could Jam it it

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.510 
destroy the chain it could Jam it it
could<00:01:15.899> really<00:01:16.229> cause<00:01:16.500> serious<00:01:16.950> injury<00:01:17.280> so

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
could really cause serious injury so

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.630 
could really cause serious injury so
plastic<00:01:18.060> ones<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.630> deal<00:01:18.899> with<00:01:19.399> the<00:01:20.399> come-along

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
plastic ones I deal with the come-along

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.060 
plastic ones I deal with the come-along
we<00:01:21.149> attach<00:01:21.479> one<00:01:21.840> end<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.229> something<00:01:22.799> solid

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
we attach one end to something solid

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.719 
we attach one end to something solid
like<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> tree<00:01:23.820> trunk<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.829> tow<00:01:25.829> hitch<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> on<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
like a tree trunk a tow hitch on a on a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.920 
like a tree trunk a tow hitch on a on a
vehicle<00:01:27.329> so<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.740> pull<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.930> so

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
vehicle so that we can pull on it and so

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.289 
vehicle so that we can pull on it and so
we<00:01:31.380> put<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.590> rope<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.219> the<00:01:32.369> other<00:01:32.520> end<00:01:32.670> we

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
we put a rope on one on the other end we

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.749 
we put a rope on one on the other end we
extend<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.079> then<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.289> put<00:01:34.500> up<00:01:34.590> long<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:35.579> is

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
extend and then we put up long this is

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.830 
extend and then we put up long this is
only<00:01:35.909> twelve<00:01:37.219> worth<00:01:38.219> of<00:01:38.430> cable<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.360> from<00:01:39.630> there

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
only twelve worth of cable so from there

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.389 
only twelve worth of cable so from there
we<00:01:40.079> go<00:01:40.289> to<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:41.689> a<00:01:42.689> rope<00:01:43.320> that's<00:01:43.680> around<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.100> tree

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
we go to a a rope that's around the tree

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.539 
we go to a a rope that's around the tree
now<00:01:45.119> how<00:01:45.359> this<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.630> operates<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.829> there's<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
now how this is operates is there's a

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.719 
now how this is operates is there's a
ratchet<00:01:48.090> here<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.509> then<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:48.780> push<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.729> this

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
ratchet here so then we push it this

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.179 
ratchet here so then we push it this
this<00:01:51.630> clips<00:01:51.960> over<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.700> notches<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.890> up<00:01:55.890> so

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
this clips over and in notches it up so

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.219 
this clips over and in notches it up so
yeah<00:01:56.340> really<00:01:56.670> good<00:01:56.939> mechanical<00:01:57.630> advantage

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
yeah really good mechanical advantage

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.639 
yeah really good mechanical advantage
and<00:01:58.530> that's<00:01:59.490> why<00:01:59.729> we<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.210> as<00:02:00.359> short<00:02:01.259> throw

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
and that's why we just as short throw

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.260 
and that's why we just as short throw
you<00:02:02.340> can<00:02:02.520> pull<00:02:02.789> off<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:04.500> ton<00:02:05.039> a<00:02:05.280> 2,000<00:02:06.030> pound

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
you can pull off a ton a 2,000 pound

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.640 
you can pull off a ton a 2,000 pound
force<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.679> cable<00:02:08.070> itself<00:02:08.490> and<00:02:09.650> then

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
force on the cable itself and then

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.860 
force on the cable itself and then
there's<00:02:10.920> there's<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.370> release<00:02:11.760> on<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.180> top<00:02:12.420> for

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
there's there's a release on the top for

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.750 
there's there's a release on the top for
unwinding<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.800> cable

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
unwinding the cable

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.699 
unwinding the cable
so<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.599> can<00:02:16.750> pull<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.050> out<00:02:17.140> all<00:02:17.560> those

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
so you can pull it out all those

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.649 
so you can pull it out all those
instructions<00:02:18.489> are<00:02:18.550> usually<00:02:18.909> on<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.150> side<00:02:19.390> of

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
instructions are usually on the side of

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.770 
instructions are usually on the side of
the<00:02:20.370> come-along<00:02:21.370> or<00:02:21.940> on<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.209> Box<00:02:22.450> in<00:02:22.720> which

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
the come-along or on the Box in which

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.020 
the come-along or on the Box in which
you<00:02:23.080> purchase<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.799> but<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.310> look<00:02:24.700> at<00:02:24.790> this<00:02:24.909> as

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
you purchase that but I look at this as

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:35.910 
you purchase that but I look at this as
a<00:02:25.060> central<00:02:25.720> part<00:02:25.989> of<00:02:26.200> cutting<00:02:26.560> down<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.709> tree

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.980
