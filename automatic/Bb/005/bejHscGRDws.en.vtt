00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello everyone I hope you are super good 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.189
 Today I'm going to show you how to do this 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.839
 makeup and also a mini hairstyle like that 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.480
 that we are going to start with this base of 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:15.269
 makeup that is the one of male bening the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.160
 skin makeup and really that is great 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.270
 what yes to me rust a little bit 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.270
 but nothing relevant 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.040
 what I always do is always apply 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.830
 first with a brush and then 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.390
 blend well with a sponge 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.850
 makeup and this gives a finish 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.250
 much more natural to the skin and then 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.010
 I'm applying the corrector this firm 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.989
 of maybelline in the shape of a triangle and 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.580
 I'm going to blur with the same sponge 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.580
 that I used previously 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.470
 Look 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.860
 Now what we are going to do to seal 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.350
 our makeup with a wide brush 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.900
 I'm going to use loose powders these are 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.540
 of the line brown and find the cut gray 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.630
 and I really like it does not contribute 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.340
 no type of color but lately what 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.650
 that you can not be missing is 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.020
 bronzer because now that we're in 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.140
 winter here in chile I'm too 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.950
 too white therefore I try to 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.950
 give a bit of color to the rumor 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.200
 bronzer outline everything a little bit to 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.810
 be able to have color on the face and not 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.180
 To be too much country for my eyes I'm going to 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.259
 be using this tattoo color in the 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.640
 pretty bronze tone and I love it because 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.130
 the shadows came out pretty well 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.920
 over powder so it acts like a 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.560
 pre base pretty good then that 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.869
 blur that very very well I took a 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.600
 copper-colored umbrella is in this 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.020
 case was of the brand anastasia should 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.020
 to choose 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.560
 and then the sigma palette with a 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.110
 brush to blur take the same 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.480
 color but this does not have brightness or 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.610
 which is matt finish and this helps me 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.790
 blur much better the rest of 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.040
 the colors 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.079
 I many times in my day to day 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.790
 used the same brush for all 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.340
 colors since I'm taking another color 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.680
 from the sigma palette that is a matte beige 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.810
 super clear and I use it under my 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.670
 eyebrows and then in the same brochita 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.609
 apply a taupe color a little more 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.189
 dark in the corner of my eye to 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.170
 to be able to form the basin and I was 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.420
 little more contrast between a color 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.580
 and other 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.400
 and to make the application a lot more 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.620
 easy I'm going to take the same taupe tone and 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.830
 I'm going to apply it down on the eyelid 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.770
 I also received from cleaning my 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.050
 lower and upper water line with the 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.000
 pencil that is that that is pretty 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.130
 well I do not delineate much 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.170
 I find this pencil quite creamy and 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.900
 super rich the application and I'm also going to 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.790
 apply up on the upper eyelid and 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.360
 I will blur it with a brush that is 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.360
 To delineate 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.860
 as always I will comb my eyebrows and 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.440
 then I will fill them with this set of 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.090
 Milan or Milan kits and how are you? 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.520
 want to call you with the darkest tone 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.010
 that the one that most resembles my tone 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.850
 of hair so I'm going to outline and 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.850
 then I will fill 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.060
 and as always always in my routine 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.180
 daily I have to look happy because 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.540
 they tend to go down so for that 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.849
 I use this brand gel which is 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.569
 transparent and he leaves me his crimes in his 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:56.209
 place then I'm going to take my curling iron 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.430
 eyelashes with curling or as they say 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.170
 you in china door and I will use 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.790
 my window and then I'm going to apply my 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.329
 favorite mascara that in this 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.260
 moment as you know is the colossal 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.260
 of mailing 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.049
 and to finish I'll use this the 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:24.770
 skin of the petricio brand that is in the 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.510
 tone 150 and serious and I love it because of 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.090
 truth is so intense and this brand is 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.920
 so good to be so economical that in 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.160

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.930

 it works super super well and I am 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.570
 using one that is the basis is more 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.450
 wide and on the tip of a little more 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:21.129
 narrow to make a pretty curl 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.259
 fine and the tips 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.449
 I must admit that when I recorded the video 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:27.999
 it's the second time I tried this 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:30.639
 machine and I really loved that I was 

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:32.259
 fascinated is heated very fast not 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.869
 I have the feeling that I burn the 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:36.279
 hair so I left but was assigned 

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:37.479
 true that it is a great product 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:40.719
 being he would not even be 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:42.999
 naming and the finishing that I got me 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:44.679
 really liked very much that really 

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:46.330
 stay but fascinated with the curls that 

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:48.729
 he left me because I do not usually do 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.879
 this kind of thing and I also wanted to do 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:54.459
 by the top in the part where 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:56.229
 I have in the hair split but 

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:58.779
 in the thick part I wanted to make a guy 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:07:00.399
 little braid because I either 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:02.830
 He usually does this kind of thing but 

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:04.419
 I loved the result between the braid 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.119
 the curls and makeup I find that 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:09.399
 it goes super super well and really makes a 

00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:12.279
 favorite thing that used throughout 

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:13.899
 this time because I found it bro 

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:15.939
 wonderful super practical and 

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:18.159
 relatively did not change much 

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:20.319
 nozzles but it's super good and I 

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:21.779
 loved it fascinated me fascinated me so 

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:24.099
