00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.400
 Y 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.760
 chromotherapy is a method of 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.129
 treatment where the 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.070
 violation of light where the 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.810
 light to improve diseases the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.349
 as therapy is a technique that works 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.810
 with the energetic part of the individual 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.919
 based on traditional Chinese medicine 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.919
 where there are other fundamental principles 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.100
 are the dryness the humidity the cold and the 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.660
 hot 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.430
 each of these principles 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.410
 correspond with those we work with 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.310
 these colors depending on the pathology 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.310
 that is presented 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.730
 plus 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.800
 chromotherapy treatment is 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.230
 done using color filters and it 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.140
 normally applied on the skin if it 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.059
 want to do a localized treatment or 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.339
 can be applied to the eyes if 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.740
 wants to do a generalized treatment 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:09.690
 it's a way to give a vibration a 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.690
 vibration in the form of light to 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.750
 in trauma 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.970
 what we do is put a cold color 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.619
 so that the body generates a heat that 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.619
 auto regulate that area 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.880
 chromotherapy can improve a lot 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.130
 diseases can be useful for example 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.990
 for the nails has is served to treat 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.270
 ailments such as a 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.130
 traumatism 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.619
 a burn where there has been an excess 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.320
 of heat and we put more heat so that the 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.909
 body becomes cold and covers that too 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.750
 for example my themes where there are also 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.750
 excess heat 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.460
 chromotherapy and is part of the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.100
 biological medicine because it's a therapy 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.370
 Non-aggressive is a therapy without effects 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.590
 side effects is an effective therapy in 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.510
 that few treatments are performed 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.510
 4 or 5 days or weeks 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.890
 um
