00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.200
 Are you walking one day on a street? 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.379
 when she heard the screams of a woman 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.059
 asking for help and with the situation you think 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.790
 that someone would be more likely to help 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.849
 in a place with people or 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.160
 place to other people what years of 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.560
 psychology studies has shown is that 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.449
 people tend to help - in a situation 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.740
 emergency room where several people are 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.320
 gifts 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.500
 this is the so-called viewer effect 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.300
 But why will this happen? 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.170
 when you are alone before a 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.090
 emergency 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.489
 the tendency is that you realize that the 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.170
 responsibility is all your 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.219
 because there is no one for you to do something 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.500
 besides you 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.360
 but the more people are present 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.219
 the tendency is for each person to feel 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.410
 less responsible for acting 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.899
 Could you think that someone lives? 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.940
 do something else and if people are 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.039
 thinking the same thing as you 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.449
 we call this phenomenon of diffusion of 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.550
 responsibility 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.289
 we also observe this phenomenon when 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.869
 a group of people need to perform a 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:09.759
 task that will be the subject of another video here 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.979
 in large cities the diffusion of 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.930
 liability triggers the effect of 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.400
 viewer with more frequency 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.530
 The result of this is that people 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.960
 tend to help - a person who is 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.909
 illustration extreme danger but what 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.689
 we can do to avoid the effect of 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.610
 viewer 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.740
 research in psychology indicates 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.930
 when people observe someone acting 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.909
 proactively the trend is that the effect 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.220
 of the viewer decreases as an emergency 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.470
 are ambiguous situations and large cities 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.740
 people depend on each other to 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.720
 know how to interpret something as emergency 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.520
 so if nobody does anything the 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.920
 people on the premises can find friends with 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.960
 situation and not knowing what to do 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.420
 therefore against attacking our tendency 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.290
 to spread the responsibility can 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.290
 save someone's life 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.549
