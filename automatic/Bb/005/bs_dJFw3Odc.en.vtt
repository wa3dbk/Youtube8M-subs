00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.889
 saved space users the beginning are 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.660
 Dr. White we are here today with one 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.760
 new review of a footballer on 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.549
 thread 15 last teams 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.720
 we remain in series to remain with the 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.550
 central midfielders 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.050
 we have seen mati fernandez la 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.660
 florentine there is no view that is me 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.990
 really liked both how cc and how 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.300
 cerci and today it is the turn of planes spiani 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.859
 always of this team of the weekly al 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.720
 center in pisa la roma awarded after the 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.750
 one-two against inter a goal up 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.420
 fantastic punishment and a goal on action 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.460
 the version of pjanic base is one of the 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.230
 my favorites escapes even more from heaven 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.300
 or less the first week of play la 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.280
 I prefer the value for money a 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.739
 many other standard players a 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.710
 in any case let's see how the 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:54.129
 field starting as always from the 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.469
 speed speed which is great for a 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.750
 playmaker because we consider that 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.120
 plans there may be layer or like coc 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.340
 or like cc like some also in Rome a 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.960
 second of maybe if garcia decides to 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.140
 use a 4 2 3 1 that uses 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.340
 rarely or more often a 4 3 3 in which 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.119
 plans are there between the three midfielders 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.830
 stations 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.990
 in any case the speed in these two 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.630
 roles as you know is not essential 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.369
 so even having 73 does not penalize him 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.380
 then you see he manages to get away 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.000
 however I don't say with an extreme 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.939
 ease however on the first step can 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.680
 burn some defender certainly not 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.810
 you can do all the field but yes you do 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.460
 please in this game 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.979
 in any case, speed is not bad 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.570
 the physical is not particularly a 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.369
 problem is not a very physical player 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.670
 but he has good dribbling as we will see 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.290
 then then you can to donate this 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.320
 non-absurd physical so it is not is a 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.530
 player with the physique of tevez 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.560
 ibrahimovic 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.079
 etcetera etc. passing to the shooting 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.360
 the first problems arise the version 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.920
 based on plans I noticed that he had 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.259
 some finalization problems 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.540
 because despite going to insert 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.950
 very often he had some 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.649
 little problem in front of goal 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.060
 this version here is more or less the 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.990
 same thing you have seen that not 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.570
 I did lots of goals with pjanic è 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.580
 because because he often arrived in front of the 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.500
 goalkeeper and wrong we do a 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.240
 miracle even on a shot from outside 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.720
 I must say that anyway centuries ago 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.300
 why have you seen 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.280
 matches 4 goals is not bad and they are 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.680
 also beautiful goals because you saw in 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.320
 both occasions he jumped 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.960
 several men and went to accomplish 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.700
 so the end of the ball though 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.640
 we must take into consideration that 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.860
 it's not a tip so you can't tell 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.750
 promote pro postpone ie is not a 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.790
 very serious rejection also because then 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.040
 he cries avoiding taking out these pearls 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.900
 here with these shots on the fly 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.460
 I recommend it if of right which of 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.800
 left from unique garments with four stables 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.000
 for weak so you can pull 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.300
 quietly be with his strong foot 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.760
 both with his weak foot I never have not 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.500
 they wanted to put 5 stars however on the 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.270
 paper does not feel nanda this failure 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.400
 present rare quietly sinister 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.900
 if you have to choose traits or 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.400
 precision and power pull vi 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.420
 I recommend the precision shooting that 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.190
 in my opinion 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.320
 slightly more effective because of a 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.930
 nice effect pjanic his point of 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.140
 force what are the steps the steps 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.180
 they are fantastic and a player like 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.340
 pirlo it in the reality that it takes 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.810
 so many sorting balls is not a 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.190
 player who maybe makes the axis of 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.510
 decisions fact I have made many 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.550
 assist with this player try a 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.350
 move the team so maybe make a 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.030
 passage to change that band for 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.220
 create numerical superiority for maybe 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.810
 attackers and then download for the other 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.250
 player who arrives who then scores 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.570
 they are not assigned to many 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.519
 however, assist is able to create 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.800
 numerical superiority for the team with 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.959
 passages but also with dribbles 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.530
 because it has great dribbling plans for 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.000
 a midfielder has no details 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.370
 in fact, only three star ski skills 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.470
 it is his little problem though if there is 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.750
 quarry in agility dribbling 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.459
 we close with punishments that punishments 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.410
 as you know I am not particularly 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.350
 good to put but you have seen one 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.910
 cross here a miracle of the defender 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.040
 on the line but probably I entered 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.840
 anyway he took up the floors then 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.780
 there is no evil even in punishment 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.000
 I point out that this is not in defense 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.250
 absurd phenomenon, however, is not even a 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.540
 player who does not take care of the phase 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.220
 defensive having an average better than 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.310
 world so it is important to have gods 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.840
 quite high defensive values ​​sure 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.650
 they are not very high like those of de 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.810
 red though if 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.020
 to an opponent near his Teckell the 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.940
 does and recovers the ball that gets distracted 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.610
 recommended for this player for 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.320
 pjanic in shape you can choose o 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.690
 both gladiator hunter 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.699
 increase the shot is the first increases the 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.990
 speed the second defense then a 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.150
 second thing you wanted to deploy or 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.139
 playmaker or central midfielder 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.639
 cdc bar choose one or the other 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.850
 they use this player 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.590
 4 2 3 1 standard I put you plans 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.260
 as a median in front of the defense together 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.090
 a de rossi median attention with a 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.800
 another player therefore not median 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.300
 single but in a two-man midfield 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:06.000
 a bit like a xabi alonso khedira in a 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.789
 real old fashioned then someone better 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.280
 to break the me de rossi and one rhythm 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.080
 better to set as xabi alonso than 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.470
 in spite of everything he also had a little 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.120
 help in defense and hooks can do it 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.949
 alternatives in a 3 5 2 like 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.870
 playmaker in this case I put it 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.430
 with behind pogba because because plan in 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.139
 cement less medium times it will happen that 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.990
 then return to lend a hand back 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.449
 in that case but can go up and give one 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.860
 hand him to the two tevez though if 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.710
 this name is one of the pairs 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.449
 best for a series a 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.830
 tevez has an absurd body sooner or later 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.380
 I will bring you the review because second 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.909
 me a fantastic player 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.260
 I don't say to the levels of his etymology bs with 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.190
 last year but really really 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.320
 strong 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.330
 in conclusion pyunik I liked but 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.949
 it still has some reservations because it is 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.380
 definitely able to play in various 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.360
 modules the steps are ok the wall cruz is 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.010
 good medium to large police has it 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.690
 quite cheap because within the 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.000
 end of the week should come down 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.070
 under 30 thousand credits quietly 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.599
 of against three stars skill that a little 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.240
 penalize especially if used 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:08.490
 how you are looking for the finalization is not 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.340
 this is much preferred in mati 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.139
 fernandez for example is above all the 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.139
 what to always consider is not a 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:17.760
 very big update compared to 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.229
 basic version that still led to 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.190
 home with a thousand credit then mine 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.810
 council 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.539
 if you are looking for a fit player 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.789
 take mati fernandez between the two se's 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:29.090
 you want to use as you certainly seek for 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:30.470
 the cc pjanic is probably better 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.360
 fernandes however I would recommend you to 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.000
 wait or its secondin version 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.020
 phone or a probable second upgrade 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.310
 in February or even if you want 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.020
 wait even more for a moment 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.590
 season at the end of the year which I think if there 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.090
 deserves it all 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.710
 so to say in a while you know that he has 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.389
 tried this player what you think 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.389
 we will see each other soon
