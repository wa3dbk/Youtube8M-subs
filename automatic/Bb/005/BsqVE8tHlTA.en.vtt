00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.949
 2 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.860
 Hello 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.510
 It seems that Omi of nga 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:40.570
 I will talk about the approach around green this time 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.600
 Puringu when I often go on the course 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.810
 Many I want to go and go 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.500
 It is often seen if you do 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.500
 We will make a few recommendations on such people 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.109
 a Right 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.109
 Proud to have the same stance as usual 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.800
 3 servers too large 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.810
 And if the ball is far from the body 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.170
 Swing is cheap enough size 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.690
 With that 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.820
 There is a movement to choose by the fact that apart from just 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:24.470
 It becomes easy to become inside-in 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.960
 Near the grab until about near-normal state 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.530
 I will prepare 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.670
 It also gives to narrow the Stars of the foot at that time 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.460
 By doing this 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.520
 It becomes easy to make a small swing 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.820
 this 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:44.490
 Said and would try to raise significantly from here the body was a regular 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.810
 Or 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.810
 I will shift my body 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.080
 Because I am 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.560
 Small attitude 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.560
 As much as possible 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.640
 It is important to move close to a straight line 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.670
 Then let's say 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:20.680
 The normal shot for refund is the best 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:24.190
 In this way, but in the case of the approach to swear the Green River 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.710
 Make the club as vertical as possible 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.580
 I will raise the heel a little 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.580
 Then the ball is 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.060
 I will go a bit head 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.770
 Let's give it up like this 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:44.600
 Your green by giving such an address 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:50.800
 I will go less often 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.800
 It will be an approach especially by all means Let's try it by all means
