back it's the outline has another layer
on<00:04:27.130> top<00:04:27.250> of<00:04:27.580> it<00:04:27.610> being<00:04:27.880> grouped<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:29.220> I<00:04:30.360> colored

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
on top of it being grouped and I colored

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.320 
on top of it being grouped and I colored
it<00:04:31.599> like<00:04:31.919> literally<00:04:32.919> colored<00:04:33.400> i<00:04:33.639> align<00:04:33.940> itself

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
it like literally colored i align itself

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.740 
it like literally colored i align itself
so<00:04:34.660> that<00:04:34.690> all<00:04:34.960> time<00:04:35.229> is<00:04:35.410> like<00:04:35.789> darkish<00:04:36.789> peaches

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
so that all time is like darkish peaches

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.770 
so that all time is like darkish peaches
for<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:38.050> skin<00:04:38.380> is<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:39.330> found<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.479> clothes

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
for the skin is and found the clothes

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.320 
for the skin is and found the clothes
would<00:04:41.349> be<00:04:41.380> like<00:04:41.710> purple<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.550> hair<00:04:42.820> was<00:04:43.090> I

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
would be like purple and the hair was I

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.120 
would be like purple and the hair was I
think<00:04:43.840> I<00:04:43.960> don't<00:04:44.139> even<00:04:44.229> know<00:04:44.409> if<00:04:44.440> I<00:04:44.620> changed<00:04:45.039> it

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
think I don't even know if I changed it

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.990 
think I don't even know if I changed it
here<00:04:45.310> I<00:04:45.520> should<00:04:45.909> have<00:04:45.970> made<00:04:46.120> it<00:04:46.240> round<00:04:48.000> here

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
here I should have made it round here

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.589 
here I should have made it round here
I'm<00:04:49.120> looking<00:04:49.449> for<00:04:49.630> more<00:04:49.840> layers<00:04:50.080> because<00:04:51.599> ok

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
I'm looking for more layers because ok

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.050 
I'm looking for more layers because ok
this<00:04:53.440> is<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.650> last<00:04:53.800> layer<00:04:54.280> I<00:04:54.550> think<00:04:54.849> I'm<00:04:54.940> going

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
this is the last layer I think I'm going

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.170 
this is the last layer I think I'm going
to<00:04:55.120> be<00:04:55.240> down<00:04:55.449> about<00:04:55.570> around<00:04:56.380> now<00:04:57.000> go<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.060> the

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
to be down about around now go to the

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.850 
to be down about around now go to the
clouds<00:04:58.539> ok<00:04:58.990> now<00:04:59.199> the<00:04:59.740> back<00:05:00.010> one<00:05:00.400> was<00:05:01.030> just<00:05:01.860> four

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
clouds ok now the back one was just four

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.620 
clouds ok now the back one was just four
colors<00:05:03.280> I<00:05:03.490> think<00:05:03.639> we're<00:05:03.729> just<00:05:03.849> purple<00:05:04.270> yellow

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
colors I think we're just purple yellow

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.140 
colors I think we're just purple yellow
and<00:05:04.810> orange<00:05:05.110> and<00:05:05.770> I<00:05:05.830> just<00:05:06.039> blurted<00:05:06.820> it<00:05:07.000> all

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
and orange and I just blurted it all

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.909 
and orange and I just blurted it all
together<00:05:07.300> and<00:05:07.510> then<00:05:07.750> I<00:05:07.780> another<00:05:08.380> layer<00:05:08.620> on<00:05:08.650> the

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
together and then I another layer on the

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.040 
together and then I another layer on the
clouds<00:05:09.159> i<00:05:09.340> just<00:05:09.520> took<00:05:09.669> the<00:05:09.970> paintbrush<00:05:10.810> tool

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
clouds i just took the paintbrush tool

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.589 
clouds i just took the paintbrush tool
and<00:05:11.169> i<00:05:11.229> just<00:05:11.380> pooped<00:05:11.680> everywhere<00:05:12.360> it's<00:05:13.360> gray

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
and i just pooped everywhere it's gray

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.629 
and i just pooped everywhere it's gray
and<00:05:13.630> it's<00:05:14.229> more<00:05:14.680> like<00:05:14.800> a<00:05:14.830> sunset<00:05:15.159> on

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
and it's more like a sunset on

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.480 
and it's more like a sunset on
