00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 in a row five by battlefield 3 08 15 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.379
 I tried to explain how to 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.980
 a user config in battlefield 3 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.080
 created 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.460
 there are probably still some questions 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.099
 I did not come up with that 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.250
 I'm in the video and that's why 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.410
 because here is a quick click guide like what 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.740
 works and what you pay attention to 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.130
 need what I had forgotten so the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.710
 user cfg where does she belong 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.560
 simply in origin so where you 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.870
 olic installed games and then in 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.719
 folder battlefield 3 speaks the folder 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.120
 where the bf dreieck also in there is 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.410
 must also the user cfg rhhein at the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.930
 Names are very special now 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.059
 pay attention it must be in any case user point 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.340
 cfg are called and we still have something completely 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.550
 take another note because there are many 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.899
 people with whom that looks more like that 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.980
 that you do not even have a file 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.510
 have endings 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.570
 So would you like this file cfg 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.580
 If so, call it one before 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.070
 text file was before so many of them 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.710
 if you have a text document the new text 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.159
 document so that no seizure if 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.470
 I write now cfg point here 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.000
 then the files do not change 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.400
 so now pressed for example the old 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.840
 button on windows 7 then opens 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.810
 up here this bar there you click 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.850
 on extras and folder options there goes 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.590
 then you look and have to 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.790
 checkmark with extensions in known 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.159
 Remove file types Hide 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.850
 Now take on ok and have already 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.040
 you here 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.590
 the file ending now you see directly on 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.130
 example the file is now called new 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.170
 text document point cfdt xt as long as the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.640
 file extensions are not displayed 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.890
 I can not do that over this way 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.810
 change if I now the points behind 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.310
 chs the delete 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.140
 then comes a message she could 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.149
 may be unusable in 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.180
 but not the case is in the case 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:04.400
 case not the case like that 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.730
 confirm and now it's a cfg 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.930
 We have to have it here and there 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.580
 to see the eye as well as just plain 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.680
 times written now is called user 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.170
 point cfg cfg also that will not 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.710
 work that way you can sometimes 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.030
 Clear 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.710
 so in the cfg then comes the whole 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.430
 dictate purely to which I am now going 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.510
 not further 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.840
 I have that in the other video for 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.030
 otherwise I will be in the 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.160
 scripts link post where everything explains 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:37.070
 is important to test for you is that 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.200
 give it the supervisor country points fps 1 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.320
 clean because if you battlefield 3 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.090
 starts and right top no apps 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.350
 be displayed though this user 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.709
 config was created 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.050
 then you know it does not work 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.209
 whoever viewed the apps then go 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.830
 do you know okay again the cfg 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:00.200
 everything works great it should not 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.660
 work then please really pay attention 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.320
 whether the file ending is true 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.050
 You can also recognize the icon and 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.910
 to test you can either simply 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.330
 times in this folder also user to 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.180
 This is local local copy 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.580
 c data media so your c plate 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.120
 then use your username in the 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.130
 case coro then own documents 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.230
 Battlefield 3 and then there are settings there 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.880
 is the user cfg a little once 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.230
 wanted to test with me it went to 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.380
 Example only if this file is here 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.640
 was also in it 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.200
 rcs there are exactly the same mistakes in it 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.600
 So it does not change anything 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.920
 Now there can be one thing left 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.400
 maybe make a bit of a problem 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.930
 could and that is in origin itself and 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.570
 though you start battlefield 3 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.630
 then you want it to happen 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.670
 you want to be asked the local 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.660
 use files or do you want the 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.630
 use cloud saves 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.890
 cloud sales is the online variant for 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.990
 from storing data on this 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.810
 Of course, saving is not yours 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.960
 user cfg with it say you must then 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.960
 select that you have the local data 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.520
 if you only wanted to use now 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.420
 Battlefield installed yours 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.280
 original account 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.660
 then you can do it all too 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.220
 stop by putting in yours 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.220
 attitude is in English but 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.630
 I think you will find and enter 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.380
 Scroll down a bit and then here 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.150
 In addition to cloud storage advance support games 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.430
 if you make out the tick then then 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.810
 Cloud saving is completely deactivated 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.130
 and that question does not seem to be there anymore 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.590
 and the user in any case the user 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.380
 cfg in sofia done everything right 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.760
 I 've activated it from the 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.790
 simple reason because you see I have 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.640
 now the four games on it and mythos 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.890
 such as cloud saving 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.150
 otherwise it works in the game 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.440
 not me then every time at 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.250
 start a controller just a star 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.430
 et cetera pp 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.480
 it of course I have no desire 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.200
 that's why there should definitely rom 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.510
 test 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.270
 maybe this cfg works too 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.390
 otherwise I think that's it 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.630
 if continue to ask questions then 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:14.280
 write in the comments or come 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.540
 to us in the platoon and ask for it or 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.220
 write us the question on facebook or 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.770
 on youtube as pm 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.320
 There are enough possibilities for us 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.030
 Use it when you need it 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.540
 Thanks for watching and on 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.540
 meet again
