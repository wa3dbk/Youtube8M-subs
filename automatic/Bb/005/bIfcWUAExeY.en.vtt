00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
734 of a the cali call panda which

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.240 
734 of a the cali call panda which
happens<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.630> be<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.809> friction<00:00:13.500> which<00:00:13.830> goes<00:00:14.040> back

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
happens to be a friction which goes back

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.910 
happens to be a friction which goes back
to<00:00:14.719> double<00:00:15.719> vision<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.199> full<00:00:16.350> throttle<00:00:16.800> on

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
to double vision and full throttle on

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.880 
to double vision and full throttle on
the<00:00:16.949> grand-am<00:00:17.670> side<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.560> so<00:00:19.560> there's<00:00:19.710> quite<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
the grand-am side so so there's quite a

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.230 
the grand-am side so so there's quite a
bit<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.039> power<00:00:20.250> built<00:00:20.550> into<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:20.850> will<00:00:21.060> have

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
bit of power built into this will have

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.660 
bit of power built into this will have
admire<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.779> top<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.320> then<00:00:22.470> friction<00:00:23.189> and

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
admire on the top and then friction and

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.849 
admire on the top and then friction and
double<00:00:24.029> vision<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.750> mean<00:00:24.990> just<00:00:25.199> who's<00:00:25.680> who

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
one that actually came up with the name

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.620 
one that actually came up with the name
we<00:00:30.779> had<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.740> know<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.160> long<00:00:32.969> time<00:00:33.239> coming

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
we had you know the long time coming

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.940 
we had you know the long time coming
because<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:33.930> molded<00:00:34.230> by<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.440> bulls<00:00:34.770> that

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
because it's molded by the bulls that

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.190 
because it's molded by the bulls that
kind<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.280> started<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.210> club<00:00:36.570> calf<00:00:36.809> bizim

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
kind of started the club calf bizim

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.750 
kind of started the club calf bizim
admire<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.739> double<00:00:38.040> vision<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.489> obviously

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
admire and double vision and obviously

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.299 
admire and double vision and obviously
full<00:00:39.030> throttle<00:00:39.480> started<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.989> line<00:00:40.890> going

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
full throttle started the line going

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.860 
full throttle started the line going
back<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.610> flush<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.090> friction<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.690> we

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
back to flush and friction so we

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.350 
back to flush and friction so we
combined<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.920> all<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.730> we<00:00:45.090> were<00:00:45.180> lucky

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
combined it all and and we were lucky

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.090 
combined it all and and we were lucky
enough<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.079> panda<00:00:46.410> cow<00:00:46.559> has<00:00:46.770> done<00:00:46.920> it's

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
enough that the panda cow has done it's

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.250

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
one so there's quite a bit of power not

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.840 
one so there's quite a bit of power not
only<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> top<00:01:05.040> at<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> bottom<00:01:05.640> side<00:01:05.790> of

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.950 
this that the Panda cow is just I guess
pretty<00:01:29.310> special<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.759> me<00:01:29.820> because<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.750> goes

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
pretty special to me because it goes

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.569 
pretty special to me because it goes
back<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.439> bull<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.710> here<00:01:31.860> called<00:01:32.100> bud<00:01:32.340> and

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
back to this bull up here called bud and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.249 
back to this bull up here called bud and
this<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.880> these<00:01:33.030> double<00:01:33.360> vision<00:01:33.540> cattle<00:01:34.140> I

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
this in these double vision cattle I

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.469 
this in these double vision cattle I
created<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.920> line<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.130> cattle<00:01:35.579> which<00:01:35.700> came

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
created that line of cattle which came

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.690 
created that line of cattle which came
back<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:37.350> know<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.920> stumbled<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.490> some

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
back you know I just I stumbled on some

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.760 
back you know I just I stumbled on some
good<00:01:38.850> old<00:01:38.970> red<00:01:39.150> shorten<00:01:39.600> cows<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.170> build

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
good old red shorten cows and and build

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.760 
good old red shorten cows and and build
it<00:01:40.860> up<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.250> cow<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.490> th<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.479> PHA<00:01:43.470> clean

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
it up and this cow is th and PHA clean

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.609 
it up and this cow is th and PHA clean
which<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.100> surprising<00:01:44.700> because<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:45.619> person

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
which is surprising because in person

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.550 
which is surprising because in person
she's<00:01:46.890> probably<00:01:47.310> one<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.750> two<00:01:49.229> or<00:01:49.380> three

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
in my life and she is th and PHA

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.530 
in my life and she is th and PHA
negative<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.399> when<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.430> when<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.820> saw<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.299> you

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
know that was a test came back I'm like

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.160 
know that was a test came back I'm like
I<00:01:59.340> want<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.610> make<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> meijer<00:02:00.180> because<00:02:00.960> I'm<00:02:01.140> a
