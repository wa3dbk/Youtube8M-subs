of crazy because it's just a lens but

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.230 
of crazy because it's just a lens but
then<00:01:36.869> again<00:01:37.140> now<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.590> VR<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.400> all<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.060> rest

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
then again now with VR and all the rest

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.550 
then again now with VR and all the rest
of<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.600> suppose<00:01:39.659> they're<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> little<00:01:40.380> bit

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
of it I suppose they're a little bit

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.510 
of it I suppose they're a little bit
more<00:01:41.150> technical<00:01:42.150> than<00:01:42.570> they<00:01:42.720> once<00:01:43.110> were<00:01:43.520> or

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
more technical than they once were or

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.800 
more technical than they once were or
maybe<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:44.970> depending<00:01:45.450> on<00:01:45.540> how<00:01:45.630> you're

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
maybe not depending on how you're

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.270 
maybe not depending on how you're
looking<00:01:45.840> at<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.380> manual<00:01:46.920> lenses<00:01:47.159> were

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
looking at it because manual lenses were

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.499 
looking at it because manual lenses were
tough<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.640> use<00:01:47.790> anyways

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
tough to use anyways

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.179 
tough to use anyways
