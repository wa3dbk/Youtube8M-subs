that<00:03:38.900> foul<00:03:39.200> because<00:03:40.130> he<00:03:40.610> felt<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:41.090> Higgins

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
that foul because he felt that Higgins

00:03:41.570 --> 00:04:03.020 
that foul because he felt that Higgins
had<00:03:41.990> touched<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.470> red<00:03:42.650> with<00:03:42.830> his<00:03:42.950> cue

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
was leading 59 to 27 and looking like he

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.910 
was leading 59 to 27 and looking like he
might<00:04:09.030> well<00:04:09.420> not<00:04:09.450> go<00:04:09.990> through<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.650> final

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920

television slow motion replay so no what
do<00:06:16.240> you<00:06:16.300> think<00:06:16.440> I<00:06:17.490> think<00:06:18.490> that<00:06:18.880> the<00:06:19.150> referees

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
do you think I think that the referees

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.010 
do you think I think that the referees
completely<00:06:20.290> rate<00:06:20.850> equally<00:06:21.850> though<00:06:22.090> haven't

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
completely rate equally though haven't

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.650 
completely rate equally though haven't
watched<00:06:23.230> it<00:06:23.560> on<00:06:23.740> the<00:06:23.950> replay<00:06:24.370> in<00:06:24.940> the<00:06:25.120> van<00:06:25.330> I

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
watched it on the replay in the van I

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.660 
watched it on the replay in the van I
think<00:06:26.590> that<00:06:27.810> John<00:06:28.810> I<00:06:29.200> have<00:06:29.860> admitted<00:06:30.220> that<00:06:30.370> he

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:30.670 
think that John I have admitted that he

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.360 
think that John I have admitted that he
was<00:06:30.820> right<00:06:31.120> but<00:06:31.330> I<00:06:31.360> think<00:06:31.480> John<00:06:31.960> in<00:06:32.590> retrospect

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
was right but I think John in retrospect

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.260 
was right but I think John in retrospect
I<00:06:34.120> think<00:06:34.870> he<00:06:35.260> heard<00:06:35.440> the<00:06:35.650> Farrell<00:06:36.010> so<00:06:36.880> actually

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
I think he heard the Farrell so actually

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.200 
I think he heard the Farrell so actually
touching<00:06:38.170> the<00:06:38.710> white<00:06:39.280> ball<00:06:39.580> I<00:06:39.610> think<00:06:40.030> it<00:06:40.090> was

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
touching the white ball I think it was

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.140 
touching the white ball I think it was
more<00:06:40.390> the<00:06:40.510> same<00:06:40.780> than<00:06:41.170> anything<00:06:41.500> that<00:06:42.340> led<00:06:43.000> him

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
more the same than anything that led him

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.570 
more the same than anything that led him
to<00:06:43.300> believe<00:06:43.450> was<00:06:43.720> a<00:06:43.750> Farrell<00:06:44.140> shot<00:06:44.380> and<00:06:45.340> his

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
to believe was a Farrell shot and his

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.210 
to believe was a Farrell shot and his
favorite<00:06:46.030> was<00:06:46.240> a<00:06:46.270> foul<00:06:46.570> shot<00:06:46.900> but<00:06:47.290> I<00:06:47.320> mean<00:06:47.560> I

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
favorite was a foul shot but I mean I

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.640 
favorite was a foul shot but I mean I
don't<00:06:48.790> think<00:06:49.210> the<00:06:49.780> human<00:06:50.140> eye<00:06:50.230> could<00:06:50.530> have

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 
don't think the human eye could have

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.100 
don't think the human eye could have
actually<00:06:50.860> seen<00:06:51.310> the<00:06:51.370> red<00:06:52.150> ball<00:06:52.420> move<00:06:52.690> because

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110 
actually seen the red ball move because

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.280 
actually seen the red ball move because
I've<00:06:53.290> watched<00:06:53.620> it<00:06:53.800> in<00:06:53.980> replay<00:06:54.340> and<00:06:54.640> and
