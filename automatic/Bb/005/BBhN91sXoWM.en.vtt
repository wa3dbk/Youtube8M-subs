00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.360
 hello very good of all friends what's up 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.029
 you are today mixed 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.480
 we are here in a new video we are 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.270
 in champions the fight for the title 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.259
 in pairs in which stardust the goal 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.940
 they challenge them to the champions the uses 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.890
 for this simulation I'm going to do the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.040
 uses one more time because 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.910
 I love it and you can see me 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.070
 can the 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.570
 and fanaticism when choosing 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.940
 I 'm not going to lie, I'd like him to win 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.579
 the backs because 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.579
 I love being the ones that are by and logical 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.630
 go movement 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.710
 how are you dominating that you have a 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.320
 problem this goal is the 98 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.670
 and it's going to cost a lot to weaken him in 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.670
 top super g 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.750
 take this 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.750
 outside 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.650
 close the light 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.030
 ah 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.970
 I believe that they will win with the tables 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.490
 why 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.020
 I would like to see if we are champions by 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.630
 couple but really the bears are my 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.719
 favorites 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.790
 I like the uses more than the code 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:50.540
 currently the divisions couples 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.530
 but I'm really sorry they knew about this 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.890
 reality went wrong 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.180
 the golden ones 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.180
 although I think it's going to be like that 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.229
 son of a bitch, what good is the 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.229
 plus 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.770
 I better say 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.810
 the spirit in us the truth is that 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:23.780
 I have loved me and the 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.330
 skype are the ones that play david derby 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.090
 for example, we are always supporting 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.800
 the uses to the maximum 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.800
 or stardust talk 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.810
 the turn around 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.810
 header 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.690
 and campion 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.660
 top line 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.660
 and he grabs me 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.640
 I 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.270
 of this this combat already carries a 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.580
 rivalry 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.920
 very good now 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.740
 a rivalry that has been done is gone 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.750
 posing for a while now and it's 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.610
 that has got along well and is that everything 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.440
 started because being the fat ones in a 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.230
 fight for the title and in pairs 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.450
 they won but by disqualification and 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.270
 they wanted a rematch which those did not 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.870
 they gave him then they wanted that 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:33.730
 combat and they have not stopped winning until 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.730
 get this fight for the title 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:44.440
 then the multiple uses attacks the 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:49.140
 now the golden ones are not facebook anymore 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.640
 they are more you can say that winner 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.890
 12 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.600
 we go 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.600
 a tornado waste 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.430

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.099
 now let's say that he has thrown the 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.250
 another one is now bursting me out of the 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:33.250

 and there you have it there you have it 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.099
 simulation by couple 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.720
