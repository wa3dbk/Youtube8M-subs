00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
like you can see here for us we have the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.610 
like you can see here for us we have the
baseboards<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.120> here<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.230> then<00:00:40.320> up<00:00:40.410> here

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
baseboards on here so and then up here

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.170 
baseboards on here so and then up here
is<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> wall<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.640> buy<00:00:41.760> one<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:42.030> those

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
is the wall so if you buy one of those

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.790 
is the wall so if you buy one of those
cheaper<00:00:42.600> ones<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> wooden<00:00:43.379> ones<00:00:43.590> that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
cheaper ones just the wooden ones that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.740 
cheaper ones just the wooden ones that
click<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.340> they're<00:00:44.820> not<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.239> fit

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
click in they're not going to fit

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.410 
click in they're not going to fit
properly<00:00:46.039> so<00:00:47.039> with<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.520> gate<00:00:47.820> what<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.239> do

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
properly so with this gate what you do

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.260 
properly so with this gate what you do
is<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.079> there's<00:00:49.410> these<00:00:49.730> those<00:00:50.730> four<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.180> these

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
is you there's these those four of these

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.630 
is you there's these those four of these
on<00:00:51.750> each<00:00:51.960> corner<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:53.070> goes<00:00:53.219> up<00:00:53.399> against

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
on each corner and it goes up against

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.610 
on each corner and it goes up against
and<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.850> turn<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.390> thing<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> tighten<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.289> so

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
and you turn this thing to tighten it so

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.930 
and you turn this thing to tighten it so
it<00:00:55.710> doesn't<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:56.039> matter<00:00:56.280> whether<00:00:56.640> you're

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
it doesn't really matter whether you're

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.330 
it doesn't really matter whether you're
whatever<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:58.109> here<00:00:58.379> if<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:58.590> uneven<00:00:58.770> if

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
whatever you have here if it's uneven if

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.430 
whatever you have here if it's uneven if
you<00:00:59.579> get<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.300> I'm<00:01:00.359> trying<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.570> say<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.289> it

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
you get what I'm trying to say so it

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.680 
you get what I'm trying to say so it
just<00:01:01.620> kind<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.129> pushes<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.820> against<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
just kind of it pushes in against the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.750 
just kind of it pushes in against the
four<00:01:04.080> sides<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.580> our

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
four sides so we have it here on our

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.880 
four sides so we have it here on our
steps<00:01:07.159> down<00:01:08.159> there<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:09.560> then<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.680> gets<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
steps down there and then it gets a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.770 
steps down there and then it gets a
really<00:01:11.070> tight<00:01:11.460> fit<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.850> then<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> open<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.659> you

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
really tight fit and then to open it you

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.640 
really tight fit and then to open it you
just<00:01:12.810> push<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.229> up<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.960> pull<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.200> out<00:01:16.409> like

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
just push it up and you pull it out like

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.149 
just push it up and you pull it out like
that<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.070> then<00:01:17.780> it<00:01:18.780> swings<00:01:19.110> shut<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.740> its<00:01:19.979> own

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
that and then it swings shut on its own

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.679 
that and then it swings shut on its own
which<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.759> really<00:01:21.000> nice<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.360> if<00:01:21.450> you're<00:01:21.570> going

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
which is really nice so if you're going

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.210 
which is really nice so if you're going
up<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.020> down<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.259> steps<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.860> you're<00:01:23.009> just

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
up and down the steps and you're just

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.320 
up and down the steps and you're just
you<00:01:23.369> open<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.700> up<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.909> walk<00:01:24.060> through<00:01:24.299> it

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
you open it up and you walk through it

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.580 
you open it up and you walk through it
or<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.659> swing<00:01:24.840> shots<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.229> don't<00:01:25.380> have<00:01:25.470> to
