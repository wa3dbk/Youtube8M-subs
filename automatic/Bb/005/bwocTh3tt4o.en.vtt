went to the shop this morning I bore not
one<00:04:09.630> extra<00:04:10.050> I<00:04:10.260> bought<00:04:10.950> two

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940

flipping<00:04:12.540> extra<00:04:12.959> boost<00:04:13.170> packs<00:04:13.410> in<00:04:13.620> hopes<00:04:13.950> that

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
flipping extra boost packs in hopes that

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.760 
flipping extra boost packs in hopes that
we<00:04:14.760> can<00:04:14.910> pull<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.810> Thunder<00:04:16.109> is<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.230> x4<00:04:16.650> watt

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
we can pull the Thunder is the x4 watt

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.020 
we can pull the Thunder is the x4 watt
because<00:04:17.010> this<00:04:17.130> will<00:04:17.280> straight<00:04:17.459> out<00:04:17.580> boost<00:04:17.820> box

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
because this will straight out boost box

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.340 
because this will straight out boost box
so<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.270> chances<00:04:18.660> are<00:04:18.750> pretty<00:04:18.840> good<00:04:19.140> in<00:04:19.290> this

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
so the chances are pretty good in this

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.289 
so the chances are pretty good in this
one<00:04:19.520> okay<00:04:20.549> we've<00:04:20.760> got<00:04:20.910> our<00:04:21.030> fingers<00:04:21.270> crossed
