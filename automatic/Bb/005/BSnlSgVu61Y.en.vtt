 humanities the newest 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.260
 development in technology 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.850
 that is what appeals to you and that is why 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.640
 art and technology to the saxion 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.919

 ambitious and want to go your own way 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:20.970
 then the teachers take care of it together with you 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.099
 to make this possible 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.410
 so you can opt for a containment 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.410
 broadcasting advertising and web 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.800
 art technique is therefore a very broad one 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.810
 training and hence the professional field 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.970
 Have 4 different graduation my 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.790
 described and so are the four 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.920
 domains advertising bread box web and e2 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.940
 must be under any domain you can do all kinds of 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.710
 specializations 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.240
 places that are also in the various 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.970
 mines can be the same 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.250
 for example, animation animation conway 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.060
 web and then three brute something with bottle 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.100
 nations cup 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.080
 animation but also in bread cabinet 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.390
 that is must go loosely the professions that 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.160
 then come out that are for example 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.390
 with bread cupboard 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.100
 went to make camera sound or documentary 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.509
 yes so you can always go through my very much 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.890
 invoking it is even possible 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.939
 for new professions 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.490
 starting when I started training 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.530
 I started that is in which direction we are 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.049
 offered booths then I want to go flat with 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.729
 games and entertainment red when I'm done 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.710
 I want to get involved with the training 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.569
 with concept art and 3d modeling and 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.009
 you're probably in the studio we're going to 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:27.960
 work yes maud has several lessons 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.289
 went broadcasting was very pleased 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.840
 very interesting for our students 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.729
 make the final choice of one of 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.619
 the graduation domains come all they 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.319
 have learned in the first 10 years 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.479
 a project this is the central project 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.940
 of the training called the temptation 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.680
 the temptations 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.750
 sophomore students and art students 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.540
 making technique 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.910
 interactive installation that cooperation 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.040
 with desk and 2 in the last due 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.740
 work 10 life on the project and the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.820
 there has been an exhibition in recent weeks and 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.680
 there can people who will be the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.080
 come and test the installation 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.920
 then also 10 teachers come along and me 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.179
 go to assess in the first 2 years 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.410
 get to know the various 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.640
 specialisms from the different 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.950
 graduation domains 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.930
 these are tested in fun projects 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.680
 how to be alone or in a group 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.050
 makes success 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.520
 we have had two projects in which the 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.209
 broadcasting side very forward 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.470
 came 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.470
 First we went over it 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.070
 had to make a video about what we do 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.850
 in their daily life 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.010
 In addition, we have the project 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.709
 we had a cold case in it 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.160
 coming up with a new form for detection 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.320
 requested 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.540
 so that more people would respond 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.370
 more people would look oh there i am 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.440
 so in itself satisfied about how that 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.130
 gone and how the end result looked 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.130
 van has become 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.120
 cushion technique is a broad education 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.280
 and that is out of two by students 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.209
 ways very similar to those with us 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.680
