00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.200 
it's important to remember that every
part<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.829> different<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.730> don't<00:00:44.940> know<00:00:45.030> what

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
part is different so you don't know what

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.940 
part is different so you don't know what
specific<00:00:45.660> type<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.870> personality<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.710> could

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
specific type of personality you could

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.580 
specific type of personality you could
end<00:00:47.070> up<00:00:47.219> with<00:00:47.489> males<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.360> females<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:49.289> tend<00:00:49.530> to

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
end up with males and females do tend to

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.290 
end up with males and females do tend to
have<00:00:49.739> different<00:00:50.129> personality<00:00:50.760> traits<00:00:50.879> though

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
have different personality traits though

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.689 
have different personality traits though
but<00:00:51.750> again<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.320> does<00:00:52.440> not<00:00:52.620> mean<00:00:52.890> all<00:00:53.129> males

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
but again that does not mean all males

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.670 
but again that does not mean all males
and<00:00:54.000> females<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:54.809> behave<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.440> certain

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
and females but behave in that certain

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.680 
and females but behave in that certain
way<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.460> let's<00:00:56.610> start<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:56.940> characteristics

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
way so let's start with characteristics

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.020 
way so let's start with characteristics
typically<00:00:58.320> speaking<00:00:58.890> males<00:00:59.489> tend<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.850> more

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
typically speaking males tend to be more

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.560 
typically speaking males tend to be more
laid-back

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
laid-back

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.110 
laid-back
Kharma<00:01:01.199> are<00:01:01.379> more<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> cuddly<00:01:02.370> type<00:01:02.640> so

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
Kharma are more of the cuddly type so

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.880 
Kharma are more of the cuddly type so
for<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.390> reason<00:01:03.449> they'd<00:01:04.199> be<00:01:04.320> more<00:01:04.500> suited

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
for that reason they'd be more suited

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.830 
for that reason they'd be more suited
for<00:01:04.920> beginners<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:05.970> also<00:01:06.210> tend<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.570> sleep

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
for beginners they also tend to sleep

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.899 
for beginners they also tend to sleep
more<00:01:07.080> than<00:01:07.229> females<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:08.130> they<00:01:08.220> may<00:01:08.430> need<00:01:08.490> more

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
more than females so they may need more

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.149 
more than females so they may need more
sleeping<00:01:09.450> snuggle<00:01:09.960> cosy<00:01:10.439> areas<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.979> their

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
cage females on the other hand tend to

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.969 
cage females on the other hand tend to
be<00:01:14.040> more<00:01:14.189> active<00:01:14.460> more<00:01:15.170> wanting<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.380> play<00:01:16.770> and

run around and sit down and cuddle with

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.630 
run around and sit down and cuddle with
you<00:01:18.900> they<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.439> more<00:01:19.590> energetic<00:01:20.280> side<00:01:20.460> of

you they are the more energetic side of

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
rats the more go-go-go type but again

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.700 
rats the more go-go-go type but again
every<00:01:23.850> rap<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.210> different<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.170> may<00:01:25.439> end<00:01:25.560> up

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
every rap is different so you may end up

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.580 
every rap is different so you may end up
with<00:01:25.890> some<00:01:26.159> really<00:01:26.659> active<00:01:27.659> males<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.290> some

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
so now I'm just going to go through a

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.120 
so now I'm just going to go through a
couple<00:02:10.600> of<00:02:10.810> differences<00:02:11.140> in<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.710> genders

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
couple of differences in the genders

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.410 
couple of differences in the genders
just<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.760> give<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.000> bit<00:02:13.120> more<00:02:13.150> information

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
just to give you a bit more information

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.740 
just to give you a bit more information
about<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.440> two<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:15.340> males<00:02:15.790> are<00:02:16.000> larger<00:02:16.390> in

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
about the two so males are larger in

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.860 
about the two so males are larger in
size<00:02:16.990> they<00:02:17.740> usually<00:02:17.920> weigh<00:02:18.220> up<00:02:18.370> from<00:02:18.790> 500<00:02:19.600> to

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
size they usually weigh up from 500 to

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.590 
size they usually weigh up from 500 to
700<00:02:20.560> grams<00:02:20.770> in<00:02:21.070> weight<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.640> females<00:02:22.330> are<00:02:22.570> a

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
700 grams in weight and females are a

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.540 
700 grams in weight and females are a
little<00:02:22.720> bit<00:02:22.930> smaller<00:02:23.290> in<00:02:23.380> size<00:02:23.740> and<00:02:24.340> that

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
little bit smaller in size and that

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.120 
little bit smaller in size and that
usually<00:02:24.850> weigh<00:02:24.970> up<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.150> children<00:02:26.140> 50<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.770> 400

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
usually weigh up to children 50 to 400

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.460 
usually weigh up to children 50 to 400
grams<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:27.970> weight<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:28.840> there<00:02:28.990> is<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.110> difference

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
grams in weight so there is a difference

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.860 
grams in weight so there is a difference
between<00:02:29.620> size<00:02:30.070> so<00:02:30.610> males<00:02:30.970> are<00:02:31.180> larger<00:02:31.540> and

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
between size so males are larger and

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.320 
between size so males are larger and
females<00:02:32.500> tend<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:32.890> be<00:02:33.010> smaller<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:34.000> let's<00:02:34.150> talk

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
females tend to be smaller so let's talk

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.490 
females tend to be smaller so let's talk
about<00:02:34.390> their<00:02:34.720> fur<00:02:34.900> coat

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
about their fur coat

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.400 
about their fur coat
so<00:02:36.250> male<00:02:36.490> fur<00:02:36.790> has<00:02:37.090> been<00:02:37.360> a<00:02:37.390> bit<00:02:37.600> more<00:02:37.810> coarser

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
so male fur has been a bit more coarser

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.100 
so male fur has been a bit more coarser
than<00:02:38.440> female<00:02:39.100> fur<00:02:39.400> not<00:02:39.940> very<00:02:40.209> much<00:02:40.390> coarser<00:02:40.720> a

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
than female fur not very much coarser a

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.750 
than female fur not very much coarser a
little<00:02:41.470> bit<00:02:41.590> coarser<00:02:42.070> though<00:02:42.220> they<00:02:42.520> also

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
little bit coarser though they also

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.540 
little bit coarser though they also
produce<00:02:43.000> an<00:02:43.450> odor<00:02:43.750> called<00:02:44.050> buck<00:02:44.320> grease<00:02:44.709> which

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
produce an odor called buck grease which

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.820 
produce an odor called buck grease which
is<00:02:45.670> produced<00:02:46.209> by<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.510> male<00:02:46.810> hormones<00:02:47.320> now

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
is produced by the male hormones now

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.500 
is produced by the male hormones now

furs going to be really greasy and oily

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.440 
furs going to be really greasy and oily
and<00:02:58.690> it's<00:02:59.320> gonna<00:02:59.410> smell<00:02:59.740> horrible<00:03:00.330> honestly<00:03:01.330> I

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
and it's gonna smell horrible honestly I

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.940 
and it's gonna smell horrible honestly I
don't<00:03:01.540> know<00:03:01.780> why<00:03:01.959> they<00:03:02.110> call<00:03:02.320> it<00:03:02.440> but<00:03:02.620> crease

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
don't know why they call it but crease

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.310 
don't know why they call it but crease
because<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.730> really<00:03:04.060> doesn't<00:03:04.209> describe<00:03:04.720> how

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
because it really doesn't describe how

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.410 
because it really doesn't describe how
it<00:03:05.500> actually<00:03:05.650> is<00:03:06.070> I<00:03:06.580> think<00:03:06.880> they<00:03:07.180> should<00:03:07.390> have

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
it actually is I think they should have

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.030 
it actually is I think they should have
called<00:03:07.630> it<00:03:07.720> something<00:03:07.959> else<00:03:08.260> like<00:03:08.560> buck

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
called it something else like buck

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.340 
called it something else like buck
marking<00:03:09.700> or<00:03:09.880> orange<00:03:10.269> buck<00:03:10.570> or<00:03:10.900> something<00:03:11.230> like

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
marking or orange buck or something like

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.530 
marking or orange buck or something like
that<00:03:11.410> because<00:03:11.769> it<00:03:12.340> really<00:03:12.820> isn't<00:03:13.030> how<00:03:13.390> it

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
that because it really isn't how it

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.280 
that because it really isn't how it
sounds

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
sounds

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.979

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.640 
described it to smell like a sweet fizzy
drink<00:03:28.090> so<00:03:28.600> that's<00:03:28.870> obviously<00:03:29.050> quite<00:03:29.380> a<00:03:29.440> nice

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
smell not very bad at all so there's no

male<00:03:35.980> rats<00:03:36.250> female<00:03:37.060> fur<00:03:37.300> tends<00:03:37.630> to<00:03:37.750> be<00:03:37.900> a

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
male rats female fur tends to be a

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.800 
male rats female fur tends to be a
little<00:03:38.050> bit<00:03:38.200> soft<00:03:38.590> more<00:03:39.160> silky<00:03:39.760> shiny<00:03:40.510> glossy

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
little bit soft more silky shiny glossy

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.140 
little bit soft more silky shiny glossy
looking<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:41.620> more<00:03:41.920> fine<00:03:42.220> as<00:03:42.489> well<00:03:42.700> although

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
looking and more fine as well although

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.420 
looking and more fine as well although
both<00:03:43.420> rats<00:03:43.750> fur<00:03:44.080> are<00:03:44.320> very<00:03:44.800> different<00:03:45.250> it

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
both rats fur are very different it

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.949 
both rats fur are very different it
really<00:03:45.790> doesn't<00:03:46.060> matter<00:03:46.150> when<00:03:46.450> it<00:03:46.540> comes<00:03:46.570> to

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
really doesn't matter when it comes to

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.020 
really doesn't matter when it comes to
picking<00:03:47.140> genders<00:03:47.769> now<00:03:48.250> in<00:03:48.430> health<00:03:48.670> terms

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
picking genders now in health terms

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.420 
picking genders now in health terms
there<00:03:49.540> are<00:03:49.570> a<00:03:49.750> couple<00:03:49.959> of<00:03:50.290> differences<00:03:50.769> but

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
there are a couple of differences but

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.039 
there are a couple of differences but
not<00:03:51.640> really<00:03:51.850> ones<00:03:52.090> that<00:03:52.299> could<00:03:52.420> affect<00:03:52.720> your

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
not really ones that could affect your

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.050 
not really ones that could affect your
decision<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:54.070> males<00:03:54.310> are<00:03:54.640> more<00:03:54.790> prone<00:03:55.030> to

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
decision so males are more prone to

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.509 
decision so males are more prone to
getting<00:03:55.239> testicular<00:03:55.870> tumors<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:56.980> females

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
getting testicular tumors and females

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.009 
getting testicular tumors and females
and<00:03:57.790> will<00:03:57.880> prone<00:03:58.060> to<00:03:58.209> getting<00:03:58.420> tumors<00:03:58.720> in

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
and will prone to getting tumors in

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.630 
and will prone to getting tumors in
general<00:03:59.560> so<00:03:59.920> one<00:04:00.100> of<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.280> common<00:04:00.430> ones

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
general so one of the common ones

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.850 
general so one of the common ones
females<00:04:01.209> get<00:04:01.510> is<00:04:01.750> called<00:04:01.989> a<00:04:02.080> pincer<00:04:02.410> a<00:04:02.440> gland

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
females get is called a pincer a gland

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.610 
females get is called a pincer a gland
tumor<00:04:03.459> now<00:04:04.000> neutering<00:04:04.690> can<00:04:04.989> help<00:04:05.320> decrease

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
tumor now neutering can help decrease

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.330 
tumor now neutering can help decrease
the<00:04:06.610> tumors<00:04:07.239> of<00:04:07.510> rats<00:04:07.900> but<00:04:08.620> it<00:04:08.709> can<00:04:08.950> have<00:04:09.190> its

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
the tumors of rats but it can have its

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.970 
the tumors of rats but it can have its
risks<00:04:09.549> as<00:04:09.910> well

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
risks as well

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.890 
risks as well
the<00:04:11.040> operation<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:11.790> also<00:04:12.060> some<00:04:12.269> side<00:04:12.450> effects

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
the operation and also some side effects

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.990 
the operation and also some side effects
after<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.379> operation<00:04:13.950> so<00:04:14.489> that's<00:04:14.790> something

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
after the operation so that's something

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.789 
after the operation so that's something
you<00:04:15.090> need<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.299> consider<00:04:15.629> as<00:04:15.900> well<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:16.620> do<00:04:16.739> have

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
you need to consider as well you do have

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.069 
you need to consider as well you do have
to<00:04:17.010> remember<00:04:17.250> rats<00:04:17.970> are<00:04:18.299> quite<00:04:18.750> small

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
to remember rats are quite small

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.650 
to remember rats are quite small
compared<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:19.620> operating<00:04:20.070> on<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.400> dog<00:04:20.669> or<00:04:20.880> cat<00:04:20.910> so

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
compared to operating on a dog or cat so

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.330 
compared to operating on a dog or cat so
there<00:04:21.810> can<00:04:22.019> be<00:04:22.049> some<00:04:22.350> risks<00:04:22.770> due<00:04:23.040> to<00:04:23.190> their

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
there can be some risks due to their

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.129 
there can be some risks due to their
size<00:04:23.580> as<00:04:23.850> well<00:04:24.060> whether<00:04:24.600> you<00:04:24.780> want<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:24.990> put

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
size as well whether you want to put

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.390 
size as well whether you want to put
your<00:04:25.229> rats<00:04:25.410> through<00:04:25.620> that<00:04:25.770> or<00:04:25.919> not<00:04:26.070> that's

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
your rats through that or not that's

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.129 
your rats through that or not that's
completely<00:04:26.940> your<00:04:27.150> decision<00:04:27.180> it<00:04:27.810> really

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
completely your decision it really

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.180 
completely your decision it really
depends<00:04:28.500> whether<00:04:28.650> they<00:04:28.740> want<00:04:28.889> to<00:04:28.919> put<00:04:29.100> your

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
depends whether they want to put your

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.100 
depends whether they want to put your
rats<00:04:29.430> through<00:04:29.729> that<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.330> also<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:30.720> can<00:04:30.960> be

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
rats through that and also it can be

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.110 
rats through that and also it can be
quite<00:04:31.320> costly<00:04:31.800> as<00:04:32.010> well<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.639> also

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
quite costly as well and also

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.450 
quite costly as well and also
considering<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.810> risks<00:04:34.290> so<00:04:34.620> it<00:04:35.070> really<00:04:35.370> is

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
considering the risks so it really is

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.490 
considering the risks so it really is
completely<00:04:35.669> up<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.449> on<00:04:36.479> that<00:04:36.750> now<00:04:37.229> when<00:04:37.410> it

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
completely up to you on that now when it

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.860 
completely up to you on that now when it
comes<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.800> bonding<00:04:38.250> males<00:04:38.760> have<00:04:39.180> been<00:04:39.510> known

comes to bonding males have been known

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.480 
comes to bonding males have been known
to<00:04:40.139> be<00:04:40.229> a<00:04:40.260> little<00:04:40.380> bit<00:04:40.650> harder<00:04:40.979> to<00:04:41.010> bond<00:04:41.340> with

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
to be a little bit harder to bond with

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.189 
to be a little bit harder to bond with
the<00:04:41.699> other<00:04:41.850> rats<00:04:42.090> because<00:04:42.449> they<00:04:42.720> do<00:04:42.780> have

saying all I'm scared to get males

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.719 
saying all I'm scared to get males
because<00:04:49.740> they're<00:04:49.860> not<00:04:49.979> going<00:04:50.160> to<00:04:50.220> bond<00:04:50.460> well

other rats this is not the case for all
males<00:04:53.220> there<00:04:53.729> can<00:04:53.940> be<00:04:53.970> some<00:04:54.449> males<00:04:54.750> which<00:04:54.990> are

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
males there can be some males which are

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.200 
males there can be some males which are
easier<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:55.770> bond<00:04:55.949> with<00:04:55.979> than<00:04:56.580> others<00:04:56.970> that

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
easier to bond with than others that

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.510 
easier to bond with than others that
doesn't<00:04:57.870> apply<00:04:58.050> for<00:04:58.139> all<00:04:58.470> males<00:04:58.740> so<00:04:59.340> don't

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
doesn't apply for all males so don't

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.040 
doesn't apply for all males so don't
just<00:04:59.669> think<00:04:59.729> all<00:05:00.000> males<00:05:00.300> are<00:05:00.570> aggressive

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
just think all males are aggressive

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.409 
just think all males are aggressive
because<00:05:01.229> they're<00:05:01.470> not<00:05:01.970> some<00:05:02.970> can<00:05:03.120> be<00:05:03.210> really

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
because they're not some can be really

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.240 
because they're not some can be really
easier<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:03.930> bond<00:05:04.110> with<00:05:04.229> than<00:05:04.650> others<00:05:04.680> because

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
easier to bond with than others because

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.909 
easier to bond with than others because
again<00:05:05.490> every<00:05:05.789> map<00:05:05.940> is<00:05:06.150> different<00:05:06.419> males<00:05:07.380> also

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
again every map is different males also

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.250 
again every map is different males also
tend<00:05:08.220> to<00:05:08.310> mark<00:05:08.550> their<00:05:08.760> territory<00:05:09.080> more<00:05:10.080> than

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
tend to mark their territory more than

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.000 
tend to mark their territory more than
the<00:05:10.350> females

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
the females

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.010 
the females
so<00:05:11.400> they'll<00:05:11.520> tend<00:05:11.789> to<00:05:11.910> urinate<00:05:12.330> on<00:05:12.360> things<00:05:12.840> a

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
so they'll tend to urinate on things a

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.589 
so they'll tend to urinate on things a
lot<00:05:13.169> more<00:05:13.199> in<00:05:13.710> different<00:05:14.220> places<00:05:14.460> but<00:05:14.970> if<00:05:15.450> you

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
lot more in different places but if you

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.620 
lot more in different places but if you
new<00:05:15.810> to<00:05:15.990> them<00:05:16.169> this<00:05:16.380> can<00:05:16.620> help<00:05:16.860> decrease<00:05:17.220> the

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
new to them this can help decrease the

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.420 
new to them this can help decrease the
territory<00:05:18.630> and<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.169> dominance<00:05:19.770> side<00:05:20.099> of<00:05:20.280> them

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
territory and the dominance side of them

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.460 
territory and the dominance side of them
and<00:05:20.789> it<00:05:20.880> can<00:05:20.970> also<00:05:21.090> help<00:05:21.450> them<00:05:21.720> become<00:05:21.930> easier

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
and it can also help them become easier

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.320 
and it can also help them become easier
to<00:05:22.710> you<00:05:22.860> bond<00:05:23.160> with<00:05:23.280> other<00:05:23.520> rounds<00:05:23.910> so<00:05:24.240> if

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
to you bond with other rounds so if

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.580 
to you bond with other rounds so if
you've<00:05:24.450> got<00:05:24.570> quite<00:05:24.780> an<00:05:24.900> aggressive<00:05:25.349> male

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
you've got quite an aggressive male

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.050 
you've got quite an aggressive male
that's<00:05:25.889> quite<00:05:26.280> hard<00:05:26.520> to<00:05:26.610> bond<00:05:26.789> with<00:05:26.820> other

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
that's quite hard to bond with other

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.850 
that's quite hard to bond with other
rats<00:05:27.300> then<00:05:27.900> neutering<00:05:28.530> could<00:05:28.680> definitely

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
rats then neutering could definitely

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.680 
rats then neutering could definitely
help<00:05:29.250> decrease<00:05:29.700> the<00:05:30.000> dominance<00:05:30.419> in<00:05:30.599> the

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
help decrease the dominance in the

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.810 
help decrease the dominance in the
territory<00:05:31.200> side<00:05:31.530> and<00:05:31.860> help<00:05:32.400> them<00:05:32.550> become<00:05:32.639> a

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
territory side and help them become a

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.029 
territory side and help them become a
little<00:05:33.030> bit<00:05:33.180> more<00:05:33.289> easier<00:05:34.289> to<00:05:34.530> get<00:05:34.710> on<00:05:34.830> with

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
little bit more easier to get on with

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.070 
little bit more easier to get on with
and<00:05:35.280> to<00:05:36.030> bond<00:05:36.240> with<00:05:36.360> other<00:05:36.570> rats

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
and to bond with other rats

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.200 
and to bond with other rats
so<00:05:37.289> neutering<00:05:38.190> can<00:05:38.340> help<00:05:38.550> but<00:05:38.729> again<00:05:38.970> as<00:05:39.120> I

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
so neutering can help but again as I

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.120 
so neutering can help but again as I
said<00:05:39.419> earlier<00:05:39.780> it<00:05:40.050> can<00:05:40.229> have<00:05:40.470> its<00:05:40.590> risks<00:05:40.800> as

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
said earlier it can have its risks as

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.830 
said earlier it can have its risks as
well<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.669> females<00:05:42.150> have<00:05:42.300> been<00:05:42.360> known<00:05:42.599> to<00:05:42.630> be

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
well and females have been known to be

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.770 
well and females have been known to be
easier<00:05:43.289> to<00:05:43.470> bond<00:05:43.680> with<00:05:43.800> but<00:05:44.340> that<00:05:44.490> being<00:05:44.669> said

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
easier to bond with but that being said

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
easier to bond with but that being said
everyone<00:05:45.780> is<00:05:45.900> different<00:05:46.320> so<00:05:46.440> you<00:05:46.530> may<00:05:46.650> get

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
everyone is different so you may get

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.080 
everyone is different so you may get
some<00:05:47.039> females<00:05:47.430> which<00:05:47.610> are<00:05:47.760> a<00:05:47.789> little<00:05:47.880> bit<00:05:48.060> more

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
some females which are a little bit more

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.600 
some females which are a little bit more
hard<00:05:48.510> to<00:05:48.750> bond<00:05:48.900> with<00:05:48.930> than<00:05:49.410> others<00:05:49.710> so<00:05:50.460> in

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
hard to bond with than others so in

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.089 
hard to bond with than others so in
total<00:05:50.760> both<00:05:51.389> are<00:05:51.660> amazing<00:05:51.990> and<00:05:52.770> should<00:05:52.950> make
