whatsoever<00:04:09.650> so<00:04:10.160> at<00:04:10.250> this<00:04:10.370> point<00:04:10.610> we<00:04:11.090> can<00:04:11.270> gun

whatsoever so at this point we can gun
it<00:04:11.570> and<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.780> car<00:04:11.959> won't<00:04:12.170> be<00:04:12.260> holding<00:04:12.410> itself

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
it and the car won't be holding itself

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.449 
it and the car won't be holding itself
back

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.580 

and<00:04:17.459> then<00:04:17.579> for<00:04:17.820> our<00:04:17.850> stage<00:04:18.269> get<00:04:19.109> into<00:04:19.440> the

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
and then for our stage get into the

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.009 
and then for our stage get into the
middle<00:04:20.070> at<00:04:20.549> this<00:04:20.730> point<00:04:21.030> full<00:04:21.239> throttle<00:04:21.660> and

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
middle at this point full throttle and

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.170 
middle at this point full throttle and
you<00:04:22.109> get<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.290> nice<00:04:22.500> slow<00:04:22.980> staging<00:04:23.639> effect<00:04:23.970> they

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
you get a nice slow staging effect they

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.450 
you get a nice slow staging effect they
bring<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.720> car<00:04:24.900> right<00:04:25.110> up<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.410> line<00:04:25.590> and

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
bring the car right up to the line and

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.860 
bring the car right up to the line and
then<00:04:26.760> we're<00:04:26.910> going<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.150> activate<00:04:27.389> the<00:04:27.660> launch

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
then we're going to activate the launch

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.280 
then we're going to activate the launch
controls<00:04:28.350> by<00:04:28.620> taking<00:04:29.150> some<00:04:30.150> triggers<00:04:30.600> moving

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
controls by taking some triggers moving

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.860 
controls by taking some triggers moving
it<00:04:31.380> up<00:04:34.370> great<00:04:35.370> this<00:04:36.120> point<00:04:36.389> I<00:04:36.450> can<00:04:36.600> give<00:04:36.750> the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
it up great this point I can give the

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:46.010 
it up great this point I can give the
