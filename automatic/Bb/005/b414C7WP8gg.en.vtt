00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
is bat you know that's when he was in

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.970 
is bat you know that's when he was in
double-a<00:02:04.750> that's<00:02:05.050> kind<00:02:05.350> of<00:02:05.410> what<00:02:05.590> you<00:02:05.710> see

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
double-a that's kind of what you see

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.790 
double-a that's kind of what you see
from<00:02:06.310> you<00:02:06.700> know<00:02:06.820> what<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.120> would<00:02:07.480> comp<00:02:07.990> Nicky<00:02:08.560> to

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
from you know what I would comp Nicky to

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.999 
from you know what I would comp Nicky to
at<00:02:09.099> this<00:02:09.280> point<00:02:09.519> in<00:02:09.640> his<00:02:09.759> career

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
at this point in his career

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.220 
at this point in his career
obviously<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.760> hope<00:02:11.939> he<00:02:12.150> ends<00:02:12.780> up<00:02:12.870> being<00:02:13.080> the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
obviously I hope he ends up being the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.539 
obviously I hope he ends up being the
same<00:02:13.439> with<00:02:13.769> a<00:02:13.799> higher<00:02:14.010> on-base<00:02:14.340> percentage

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
same with a higher on-base percentage

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.390 
same with a higher on-base percentage
but<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:16.170> know<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.439> that's<00:02:16.980> probably<00:02:17.189> the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
but you know that that's probably the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.339 
but you know that that's probably the
best<00:02:17.579> comp<00:02:17.849> I<00:02:18.000> can<00:02:18.180> give<00:02:18.329> you<00:02:18.780> know<00:02:18.900> from<00:02:19.290> a

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
best comp I can give you know from a

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.500 
best comp I can give you know from a
double-a<00:02:19.709> high<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.950> perspective<00:02:20.670> now<00:02:21.150> nikki<00:02:21.480> is

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
double-a high a perspective now nikki is

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.000 
double-a high a perspective now nikki is
making<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.870> transition<00:02:22.079> over<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.650> third<00:02:22.980> base

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010
