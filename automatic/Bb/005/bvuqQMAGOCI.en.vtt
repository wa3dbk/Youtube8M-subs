00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.790
 need sufficient water pressure at the time 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.240
 creates a difference in the levels of the upper part

 rivers 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.240
 upper reach and lower lower left 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.230
 the greater the water drop between the top and 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.200
 lower eyelid 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.520
 the higher is the energy of water in the Zhiguli hydroelectric station 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.310
 at the moment as a rule is 21 meter 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.650
 how does water give its energy water from 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.880
 reservoir through the conduit served 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.560
 ruby hydrate 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.610
 falls on the turbine blades and rotates it 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.500
 potential energy of river water 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.260
 converted to kinetic energy 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.540
 turbine rotation using 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.230
 hydro generator connected to the turbine 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.280
 converted to electrical energy 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.890
 electricity is supplied to 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.640
 transformer groups and 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.390
 switchgear 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:46.400
 and from there along the power lines in 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.400
 united energy system of the country 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.140
 the power system cannot exist without 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.799
 hydropower stations as soon as 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.640
 hydroelectric power ability for 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.640
 A couple of minutes 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.590
 dramatically increase or decrease the power of any 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.349
 one other type of power station 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.180
 whether it is thermal or nuclear power station 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.040
 can so promptly respond to 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.409
 peak consumption loads 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.269

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.420
 every year Zhigulevskaya hydroelectric power station 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.290
 produces more than ten and a half 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.419
 billion kilowatt-hours 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.510

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.400
 consumers in the region is carried out 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.360
 through power lines 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.300

 Zhigulevskaya GES is the main 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.120
 stations combining several 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.310

 Zhiguli hydroelectric station 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.289
 depends on the stability of the functioning 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.820
