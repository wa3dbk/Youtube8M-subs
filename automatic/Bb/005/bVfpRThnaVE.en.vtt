could be a more critical area of the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.120 
could be a more critical area of the
cello<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.180> which<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.510> use<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.930> than<00:00:25.350> going

course<00:00:34.020> very<00:00:34.200> comfortable<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.920> know<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.190> all

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
course very comfortable you know we all

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.400 
course very comfortable you know we all
know<00:00:35.550> where<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.030> even<00:00:36.450> remember<00:00:36.989> thumb<00:00:37.260> in

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
know where it is even remember thumb in

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.940 
know where it is even remember thumb in
the<00:00:37.500> crook<00:00:37.770> but<00:00:38.280> as<00:00:38.399> soon<00:00:38.579> as<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:38.760> go<00:00:38.910> above

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the crook but as soon as we go above

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.369 
the crook but as soon as we go above
the<00:00:41.550> arm<00:00:41.820> has<00:00:42.240> to<00:00:42.300> start<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.780> come<00:00:43.020> up

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
the arm has to start to come up

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.810 
the arm has to start to come up
this<00:00:45.379> is<00:00:45.559> between<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:46.010> first<00:00:46.219> finger<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:46.730> the

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
this is between the first finger and the

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.330 
this is between the first finger and the
thumb<00:00:47.059> will<00:00:47.329> spread<00:00:47.769> the<00:00:48.769> difference<00:00:49.219> between

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
thumb will spread the difference between

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.860 
thumb will spread the difference between
here<00:00:50.890> it's<00:00:51.890> pretty<00:00:52.190> drastic<00:00:52.850> change<00:00:53.540> in

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
here it's pretty drastic change in

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.770 
here it's pretty drastic change in
position<00:00:54.710> of<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.160> body<00:00:55.489> much<00:00:56.300> more<00:00:56.510> drastic

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
position of the body much more drastic

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.209 
position of the body much more drastic
than<00:00:57.050> safe<00:00:57.469> down<00:00:57.800> here

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
than safe down here

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.000 
than safe down here
so<00:00:58.820> in<00:00:59.210> order<00:00:59.420> to<00:00:59.510> practice<00:00:59.719> this<00:01:00.079> it's<00:01:00.769> very

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
so in order to practice this it's very

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.639 
so in order to practice this it's very
helpful<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:01.670> use<00:01:02.059> this<00:01:02.540> visualization<00:01:03.110> and

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
helpful to use this visualization and

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.609 
helpful to use this visualization and
the<00:01:04.070> whipping<00:01:04.550> motion<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.659> I<00:01:06.080> would<00:01:06.290> start

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
the whipping motion and I would start

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.649 
the whipping motion and I would start
with<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.860> very<00:01:07.100> simplest<00:01:07.520> intervals<00:01:08.450> for

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
with the very simplest intervals for

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:17.490 
with the very simplest intervals for
example<00:01:09.080> if<00:01:09.290> you<00:01:09.409> just<00:01:09.590> just<00:01:10.040> go<00:01:10.190> from<00:01:10.399> G<00:01:10.759> here

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.570 

see<00:01:18.500> a<00:01:18.530> lot<00:01:18.680> of<00:01:18.740> things<00:01:18.979> can<00:01:19.130> come<00:01:19.310> into<00:01:19.490> play

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
see a lot of things can come into play

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.320 
see a lot of things can come into play
one<00:01:19.970> of<00:01:20.000> them<00:01:20.180> you'll<00:01:20.360> notice<00:01:20.659> I<00:01:20.840> anticipate

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
one of them you'll notice I anticipate

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.290 
one of them you'll notice I anticipate
where<00:01:24.200> my<00:01:24.770> arm<00:01:25.100> is<00:01:25.280> going<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.580> be<00:01:25.670> when<00:01:25.910> I'm<00:01:25.940> in

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
where my arm is going to be when I'm in

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.510 
where my arm is going to be when I'm in
this<00:01:26.510> position<00:01:26.750> so<00:01:27.590> by<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:27.890> time<00:01:28.130> I<00:01:28.190> actually

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
this position so by the time I actually

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.209 
this position so by the time I actually
shift<00:01:30.400> it's<00:01:31.400> done

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:40.770 

gradually<00:01:36.219> you<00:01:36.340> can<00:01:36.369> widen

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.280 

always<00:01:41.780> Committee

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
always Committee

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.760 
always Committee
Oh

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.370 

letting<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.890> hand<00:01:49.160> whip<00:01:50.120> in<00:01:50.360> to<00:01:51.230> that

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
letting the hand whip in to that

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.360 
letting the hand whip in to that
predetermine<00:01:52.160> spot<00:01:52.400> after<00:01:52.820> your<00:01:53.570> arm<00:01:53.870> has

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
predetermine spot after your arm has

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.040 
predetermine spot after your arm has
moved<00:01:55.370> there<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.090> into<00:01:56.480> the<00:01:56.600> right<00:01:56.810> direction

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
moved there and into the right direction

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:05.080 
moved there and into the right direction
it<00:01:57.530> also<00:01:57.680> works<00:01:58.040> coming<00:01:58.310> down

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.090 

so<00:02:05.660> get<00:02:05.870> used<00:02:06.050> to<00:02:06.230> that<00:02:06.350> it's<00:02:06.620> very<00:02:06.830> very

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
so get used to that it's very very

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.720 
so get used to that it's very very
comfortable

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
comfortable

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.530 
comfortable
and<00:02:08.530> eventually<00:02:09.940> you'll<00:02:10.940> always<00:02:11.180> have<00:02:11.450> an

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
and eventually you'll always have an

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.080 
and eventually you'll always have an
idea<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:11.990> where<00:02:12.380> you're<00:02:12.590> going<00:02:12.950> over<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.850> hump

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
idea of where you're going over the hump

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.690 
idea of where you're going over the hump
will<00:02:14.300> always<00:02:14.720> involve<00:02:15.430> preparation<00:02:16.430> of<00:02:16.550> the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
will always involve preparation of the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.950 
will always involve preparation of the
arm<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:18.130> at<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.280> last<00:02:19.490> moment<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:20.570> fingers

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
arm and at the last moment the fingers

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.880 
arm and at the last moment the fingers
will<00:02:21.170> land<00:02:21.440> exactly<00:02:21.770> where<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.370> want<00:02:22.580> them<00:02:22.730> to
