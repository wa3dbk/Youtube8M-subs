00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
left hand then from Marlo much behind it

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:26.590 
left hand then from Marlo much behind it
though

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.180 

once<00:04:27.600> again<00:04:27.810> Teddy<00:04:28.350> Marlow<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.860> aggressor

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
once again Teddy Marlow the aggressor

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.490 
once again Teddy Marlow the aggressor
but<00:04:29.760> possibly<00:04:31.190> wait<00:04:32.190> is<00:04:32.670> now<00:04:33.140> getting<00:04:34.140> the<00:04:34.350> age

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
but possibly wait is now getting the age

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.590 
but possibly wait is now getting the age
I<00:04:34.800> think<00:04:37.490> so<00:04:38.490> wait<00:04:38.730> looks<00:04:39.090> like<00:04:39.240> he's<00:04:39.390> nicked

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
I think so wait looks like he's nicked

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:52.170 
I think so wait looks like he's nicked
the<00:04:39.750> second<00:04:40.110> but<00:04:40.200> not<00:04:40.380> by<00:04:40.530> much
