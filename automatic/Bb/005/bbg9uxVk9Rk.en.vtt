00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:12.790
 to show you what has advanced in the game 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.740
 and let's start good, I wanted to advise 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.779

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.110
 upload videos on what I'm doing has 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.640
 been working in the game focusing 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.220
 in alexis good sitting 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.550
 exclusively working on alex the 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.550
 field 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.140
 here we have the selection of characters 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:40.180
 as we will remember we have no check 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.820
 milicua good-natured and aleix 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.950
 I will show you the abilities of álex that 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.950
 they are up to the chicha of the authorization 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.840
 first the passive of alex 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.840
 he has not created him 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:01:00.430
 basically because it's something that goes 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:03.010
 related to the multiplayer and 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.449
 still multiplayer I can not I have not 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.200
 could do 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:12.670
 let's go with the first skill I have 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.360
 on the 1 key and it's called lucky that 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.930
 has as passive 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.720
 has a small percentage of doubling the 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.460
 won with a the ones that when we killed 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.460
 enemies is basically 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:32.550
 jump and a jester 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.730
 that would indicate to us that we have won gold 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.890
 and as active 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.490
 It is a skillsoft 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.490
 which 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.860
 throw peaks 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.619
 well let's move on to the second skill 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.440
 god mini craft no longer alex unleashes the 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.119
 power of the god for a brief period 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.520
 of time and its attack speed in 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.110
 movement are increased they set 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.900
 very good in speed the one that walks 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.179
 now 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.709
 and the speed at which they stick 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.709
 I'm going to activate the skill zone 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.510
 rich jester now I will explain the third 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.630
 city ​​that will help me to get out of this 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.460
 jam is called jumps to be capo 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.980
 Show your gifts in parkour 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.410
 jumping forward if this jump 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.870
 impact on some enemy can return to 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.400
 jump up two more times with a total 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.220
 three times 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.810
 but this jump will not hurt like 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:51.349
 we have here as we see here 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.349
 I have here the area where I can jump 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.050
 I leave one this inside 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.050
 santángelo 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.130
 they serve me 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.260
 to jump walls 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.099
 obviously good obviously 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.379
 this skill is very very varied 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:15.690
 because what I could not do is that if 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:20.240
 there is a solid object with jumps 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.240
 can jump inside the walls and soto 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.709
 and we go with the ultimate crown 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.390
 the base to show it 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.570
 descriptions I'll leave once 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.740
 one link at a time to download the 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.069
 I play the current version of the game and 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.969
 good 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.969
 we'll see 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.069
 the last one is the capo is called the name 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.560
 of stability is creative 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.180
 and says so alexis the capo gets the 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.819
 creative during a short period of 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.579
 time will be invulnerable to all kinds of 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.290
 sc and will not take damage after finishing the 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.420
 effect ares the capo will be returned 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.709
 vulnerable we lower their resistances 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.709
 for a short period of time 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.480
 this is the strong skill 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:24.030
 as long as we have this kind of blow 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.030
 pink aura we will be immortal 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.430
 and that have been all 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.730
 an attack 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.560
 and some mobility 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.810
 and that has been all we have here 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.750
 the button to open the game I've 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.910
 added voices and a little music to 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.820
 I play the music that is in the background 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.310
 Summoner's Rift 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.860
 it is not very close but good 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.289
 chosen and has made her do a little 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.139
 test 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.610
 and that has been all before nothing before 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.469
 nothing to remind you that down in the 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.719
 description I will leave my account in 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:11.610
 twitter and the link to download the 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:14.009
 current version of the game I hope that you 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.990
 I really liked the video and see you 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:17.990
