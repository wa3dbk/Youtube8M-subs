00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.580
 Hello everyone and welcome to the second 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.910
 video tutorial on this today 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.910
 we will see the precise to go up and down 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.910
 here we go 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.000
 finding myself physically impossible 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.510
 I will leave you in the expert hands of nicolas 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.400
 indeed in the foot experts as a premise 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.440
 obviously you will have to go to concern 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.970
 the first video on the precise to see 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.040
 how to land on the stack all oo 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.400
 you will have to have it memorized 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.620
 what you did true let's start 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.090
 so with the precision to go up there 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.280
 I recommend starting from the ground looking 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.110
 an obstacle that gradually rises like 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.480
 you see in the video so you can 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.760
 make higher and higher jumps up to 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.649
 where do you feel the important thing either 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.719
 precision to rise and the explosiveness of the 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.610
 arms obviously have to push 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.860
 even more than on a precise abnormal 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.780
 before passing accuracy down 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.880
 I advise you to warm yourself well on those 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.850
 to rise and to prepare the ankles ad 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.560
 a heavier landing 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.060
 as for those to climb also for 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.909
 those to get off of board of 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.340
 start the earth 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.200
 the best solution as you see in 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.240
 video would place an object on one 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.920
 distance to you and try to 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.670
 land on your side trying to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.770
 keep landing 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.500
 I recommend you always land with the 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.450
 tips as in the first video removed 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.880
 then gradually the obstacle trying to 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.590
 make longer and more difficult jumps 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.240
 always pay attention to your ankles because 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.290
 going further afield 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.290
 the landing will be heavier 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.080
 when you feel you are masters of 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.670
 landings movement you can 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.500
 move to separate obstacles 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.689
 I recommend a key part of the 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.680
 accuracy to come down and not jump into 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.330
 high 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.310
 it might seem silly but many do 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.090
 this error to go down 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.920
 they jump high just stick out vi 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.119
 always towards the obstacle without leaving 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.119
 the weight of the shoulders back 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.990
 now he's the sborone 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.790
 with the excuse that he must show you how 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.189
 the precise all are made 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.439
 see you then at the next video with 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:29.530
 the inaccurate ranks and series precision 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.530
 never said spiders specify trani precise 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:35.049
 I know ugly 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:46.240
 this is the first outdoor tutorial 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.240
 this appeal closed
