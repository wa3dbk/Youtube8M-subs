00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.480
 This exercise is done first. 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:15.030
 stages also within 5 minutes in 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:18.990
 further brought to 30 40 minutes 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.900
 as we learn to manage our 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.470
 energy potential 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:29.060
 we remove muscle clamps as well 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.840
 pump over the muscle tendon system and 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:38.399
 energy of our body 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.809
 and now we take a deep breath and 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.300
 breath hold 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.260
 let's try now to pack this energy and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.270
 hold up about the times guys tense up 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.370
 what about his stop and tense about three 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.770
 strengthen the calf muscles about 4 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.359
 tense hips 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:03.960
 about 5 tighten your buttocks about 6 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.930
 tense underbelly about everyone 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.409
 tense back muscles 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:14.070
 about 8 tighten the shoulders hands on the bill 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.750
 9 straining neck maximum 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:22.189
 concentration and solid image 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:25.520
 present a tree log 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.850
 to get the image to the maximum 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.409
 we drive on a modality a task to see 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:36.219
 maybe this 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:38.390
 maybe it's birch maybe it's pine 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.460
 the next moment besides what we 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.539
 saw the picture of the visual channel 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.509
 task 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.049
 hear a certain sound maybe this 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.750
 woodpecker 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.450
 maybe this lumberjack is knocking maybe 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.000
 this is a certain show that goes this 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.829
 here is a tree 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:02.810
 next we forget the corresponding 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:07.539
 maybe it's yours maybe it's your own 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:11.329
 mixture of fun given body and now 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:15.440
 touch feel 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:18.319
 this item is probably tar 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.959
 and maybe it's a birch leaf 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.959
 oak as much as possible to get rid of these 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.530
 sensations and the next 5 and so 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:30.519
 statically it is a kind of roughness image 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:37.130
 solid state 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:40.450
 catalepsy and now about 10 happen 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:44.510
 a deep breath and a state of relaxation 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.329
 relaxation may be a matter of wool 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.959
 be something that horns air 10 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:53.440
 deep exhale relaxation and deep 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.440
 inhale 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:06.290
 there is the first we start to listen to 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.210
 the way breathing happens in our village 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:14.040
 so we are doing now started deep 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:18.180
 inhale and deep exhale deep inhale and 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.580
 deep were also a state of absence 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.150
 internal dialogue as we looked at 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.220
 a little bit 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.110
 and now we started ourselves 8 on give up 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.930
 the team 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.910
 start with your left leg and before 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.360
 how to start this movement we will observe 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.880
 what will happen in our body 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:43.160
 but most likely body weight will shift to 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:47.340
 right leg and left relax and 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.870
 there will be a step with the left foot and 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.750
 next step on the right 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:56.400
 but now we will connect in stages 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:01.940
 breath we will start now take a step inhale 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.940
 exhale inhale do through the land you
