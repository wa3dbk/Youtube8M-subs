I<00:03:34.510> love<00:03:35.049> the<00:03:35.139> color<00:03:35.380> I<00:03:35.799> love<00:03:35.859> the<00:03:36.160> coverage<00:03:36.720> I'm

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
I love the color I love the coverage I'm

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.270 
I love the color I love the coverage I'm
gonna<00:03:37.900> do<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.049> flash<00:03:38.260> test<00:03:38.620> now<00:03:38.799> to<00:03:38.889> see<00:03:39.099> what<00:03:39.220> it

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
gonna do a flash test now to see what it

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.309 
gonna do a flash test now to see what it
looks<00:03:39.400> back<00:03:39.579> but<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.239> looks<00:03:40.569> like<00:03:40.630> with<00:03:40.959> flush

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
looks back but it looks like with flush

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:49.740 
looks back but it looks like with flush
back<00:03:41.590> I<00:03:41.919> don't<00:03:42.459> think<00:03:42.819> that<00:03:43.569> it<00:03:43.720> has<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:48.569> so<00:03:49.569> if

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
back I don't think that it has it so if

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.059 
back I don't think that it has it so if
it<00:03:49.870> doesn't<00:03:50.109> have<00:03:50.200> SPF<00:03:50.590> in<00:03:50.739> it<00:03:50.799> then<00:03:50.950> it

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
it doesn't have SPF in it then it

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.000 
it doesn't have SPF in it then it
shouldn't<00:03:51.340> have<00:03:51.430> a<00:03:51.459> flashback<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:53.709> will

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
shouldn't have a flashback and I will
