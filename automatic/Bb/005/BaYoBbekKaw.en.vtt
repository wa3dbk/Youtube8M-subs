00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
it looks so pretty and we slowly go

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.210 
it looks so pretty and we slowly go
moving<00:06:02.200> it<00:06:02.440> around<00:06:02.910> it's<00:06:03.910> easier<00:06:04.180> if<00:06:04.330> you<00:06:04.510> do

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
if you pile it in the middle and you go

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.500 
if you pile it in the middle and you go
spreading<00:06:11.320> it<00:06:11.560> out<00:06:11.790> it<00:06:12.790> gets<00:06:13.030> a<00:06:13.150> little<00:06:13.270> bit

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510
