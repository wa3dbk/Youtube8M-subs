00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:08.189
 we know a short video today 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.190
 I'll probably do it that way 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.799
 I edited my videos like that 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.740
 Sometimes it will show time today 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.970
 The following is full and that was 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.900
 I noticed that there are now 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.180
 audio tracks from youtube for example 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.699
 I had these two audio tracks 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:32.700
 i wanted to add my video and 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.950
 Although very quiet and did well here 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.110
 For example, I have a black video 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.620
 and that it is not disturbed in the video here 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.180
 we'll add that video to him 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.190
 a video here only has a black one 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.410
 test picture and an audio tracks good that 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.199
 would be mine now in this case 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.870
 agree and above would be normal then 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.489
 The picture here and now should be here 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.420
 be underlaid 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.100
 the music track because of my chatter so 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.530
 is terribly boring 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.970
 since i am now from youtube opening night 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.060
 and riding now as you realize reached 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.869
 Of course, they would accept me too 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.229
 write 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:22.890
 they are of course a lot of mood and what 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:28.040
 we notice this is this red 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.360
 let's say that's the 100th 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.210
 volume of the youtube audio track 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.180
 listening mp3 listen on it you can click 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.439
 the volume down to zero 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.270
 means because of the high or we always like 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.390
 But you do not like it 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.560
 not enough is not enough and you can 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.930
 By the way, if you look at the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.070
 red line double click dive in between 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.560
 make points 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.240
 then it stays there so you can do it like that 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.430
 fade in and there you have one 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.219
 maybe 34 percent and back there 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.020
 100% again we are always well now 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.040
 It was not good enough for me here 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.039
 here there is the so-called 4 percent 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.660
 that was so loud in relation to mine 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.660
 Babbel I am so suffering 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:18.400
 I can maximally so in 4 percent 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.020
 how can I get this now? 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.090
 Of course I will be back here too 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.610
 do not do it here in the video 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.040
 so these four percent have me 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.410
 I wanted to talk about all this 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.010
 is very close I have my 1 5% or 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.070
 anyway 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.450
 5 percent and back four again 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.770
 percent and you can go there again 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.290
 meanwhile set the point if you will 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.270
 between point camp down again and 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.480
 then the other can fade in quietly 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.760
 again between point and good anyway 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.940
 bothered me that I was not there 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.460
 lower than four percent so that 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.860
 snaps a trusted 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.720
 that was still too loud always was 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.160
 we are going much too loud again 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.080
 back yes, then maybe look behind 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.750
 somehow looked something like that said 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.890
 would have a maximum of four percent 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.230
 and that was not good enough for me 4 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.180
 percent yes here even partially 8% 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.840
 difficult a grid 44 that was still too 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.060
 loud 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.260
 Of course, now I could be the other one 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.980
 audi and still carries a bit 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.550
 louder make a bit of actual 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.560
 agree a bit louder here 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.690
 150 percent but that was not 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.220
 In any case, I wanted the four so easily 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.380
 percent not 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.380
 I wanted even quieter and much more 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.920
 Save quiet project under there 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.950
 always such a file man appears 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.850
 can send the file to six pay tv file 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.380
 save as for example times 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.110
 in my personal folder or 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.020
 because of me now save under videos 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.990
 and now let's do that, that's right 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.520
 a saved thing does not happen that way 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.490
 Now I'm in here in my video 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.100
 Folders that is a file right click 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.580
 not with penny now but more often with 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.010
 garrett now is a text file usual 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.570
 it is also an autograph 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.160
 By the way, that's what's going on inside 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.060
 but here not only are all the same 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.370
 yes 2013 very well where is now 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.570
 I like to put these four percent on one 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:32.310
 wants to change percent yes there is 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.170
 always this you gdg happy on the 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.890
 ghost 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.930
 always goes the 13 quasi loudness 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:44.120
 let's go 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:48.350
 150 increases 115 x 100 percent and here 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:51.740
 the four percent that is 0.4 degrees 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.120
 and because why intervene was that 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.590
 here, actually , look at the 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.550
 right place intervene you 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.440
 now instead of four percent 41 den 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.810
 editor I leave that open now I 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.280
 Do it now 04 11 I'm doing now 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.770
 first louder save 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.400
 I read the editor so I ask 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.139
 undone 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.910
 that can undo the 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.039
 editor is still open i like it now 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.380
 a little smaller now 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.000
 publicly that again with pc and can 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.490
 First, look what has happened 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.410
 which job was real now 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:25.270
 you can see that now I was at the 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:28.340
 place I pushed yes to 41 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.560
 I have from 0.4 gend what I have there 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.570
 a 40 percent made common pd 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.039
 for that I have so the spot found 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.960
 where I want to intervene 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.660
 I have still a little open 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.090
 could now undo with edit 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.259
 back to make common edit 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.870
 and common 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.820
 then 0.41 is again that now is the 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.060
 right place and there I want now 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.580
 not four percent but one percent 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.750
 and that's the joke while reminding us 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.520
 just emit here 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.780
 I wanted one percent instead of four 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.949
 I have the right percentage of the job 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.460
 found save 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:03.520
 I'm still leaving the door open 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.889
 now started again with his file 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.830
 and then we want to see you 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:12.009
 hopefully the riding here at the beginning 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.440
 starts with 1 percent and not with four 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:18.520
 percent by analogy we find the others 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:22.180
 england questions and go from google 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.410
 dark away so you can always find a lot 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.000
 nice and if you are rather far 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.780
 can also be ended again 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.479
 shut down 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.120
 very nice so google go 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:33.310
 here is to zero and so on 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.979
 we can make the appropriate entries 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:40.660
 then here arise of four percent 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:42.910
 remove 0.01 and we already have one 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:46.690
 percent and then it's good 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:48.900
 I sincerely hope and 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.900
 bye
