00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.410
 Let's pack now 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.599
 different is how you have coke 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.389
 big one had coke you want cut 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:16.510
 in the middle we will do different 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.580
 I cut with the fagga that I'm going to do here. 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.500
 I have a fragile chocolate 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.010
 I like to be showing you 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.560
 What are you going to do 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.510
 're there so you know for fractional 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.580
 coverage especially for these 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.719
 things 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.340
 I'll put the chocolate here can not 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.870
 to make ends meet with us at the time we 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.840
 You'll cut it out here. 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:45.550
 only it's hard, I understand, it's not hard 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.640
 give you work you have to cut yourself 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.320
 possible with a hot knife with the 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.480
 scissors at least I 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.170
 Are you missing white rice beans? 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.390
 B.C 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.250
 I liked the idea of having the scissors 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:06.299
 It did not give much work that will do 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:11.460
 fill do not do not like I said 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.460
 thin and let the excess 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.890
 let it drain and I'll take this 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.060
 here in the fridge 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.680
 Are you looking to cut corners? 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.930
 The way you cut it is how it goes 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.869
 stay in your practice 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.479
 the levitation in the refrigerator does not put 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.400
 always choose also more when 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.869
 It involved quickly because the refrigerator is 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.340
 a little bit just to give a 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.470
 is not for you to leave it. 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.159
 fully firm to stay watertight 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.720
 but you know he will speak is like is when 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.310
 You're going to do the second layer already. 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.350
 loose and not it will break 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.890
 so it's just to give a way to give a 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.009
 Our look is still soft but there is 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.930
 an oil that he's not from brinks walked 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.850
 seeing how fast it is then it should not 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.860
 arrive at this point totally that later 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.040
 getting through the weather will sweat 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.080
 It's not cool, I put it on 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.080
 freezer is possible faster 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.290
 legal idea also if you do not 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.680
 Do you want to make a cake in here? 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.310
 was even chocolate only then only 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.590
 People cut understood to take 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.590
 leave the shape of the coca bottle 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.239
 know how to take the excess 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.630
 do not take everything is taking the excess only and 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:54.350
 Let's take it again, I'll play another one. 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:57.070
 chocolate to stand firm even for 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.070
 people cut 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.870
 here you can stuff like I told you 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.980
 cake 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.180
 You can make a little kiss here. 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.820
 the sour cream to stay so 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:20.450
 cloying 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:27.140
 then cover z with chocolate filling only 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:28.640
 understood and wanted to run a little 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.910
 work but what does not work that 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.220
 life is but it's pleasurable imagine you 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.670
 make a business of your kids will love 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.650
 if you have a party put on top 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.040
 of the table 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.960
 cool right here that this is a turn coca 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.900
 finally a child's imagination is a beauty 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.540
 good 3 hands, it's really thick 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.980
 That's when we'll do it, let's take it now. 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.770
 to finish there we can be 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.660
 riding our cake that too now 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:06.710
 enjoy the chocolate serve consolation 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.510
 I already left ready here on the side already 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:17.530
 I spent up to 1 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:17.530
 I already put up to 1 as the brigadier speaks 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.880
 you must make it very clear in the bottle 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.880
 little 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:36.050
 We'll eat chocolate then. 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.050
 needs to mess a lot 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.470
 like this 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:55.349
 But of course we have a 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.300
 to accept chocolate and 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:59.340
 chocolate 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.909
 maybe this chocolate of mine is a delight 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.909
 a little more 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.530
 I believe it will give 5 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.290
 your first layer dinha 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:25.400
 but to give a leak in the chocolate 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:30.320
 I'll take me to freeze. 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:34.670
 Ok it was fired, that's it, son. 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.410
 in good movie already making southern ice 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.610
 It took to please a firm and I'm going 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.130
 spend another layer of chocolate 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.260
 Here for later we'll take it out here. 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.150
 remembering that this is just people going 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.400
 handle with a hot knife through the 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.590
 The less I could not get the treasure is 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.690
 but each one each of repeat the person 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.820
 Can you do it if you do not do it well ? 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.910
 well sharp break up reinforces 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.190
 quite I'll put him there already one 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.980
 camadinha I'll take 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.210
 after I take it good not to stay 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.100
 Filling sausage 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.720
 after you pass this layer here to 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.160
 Only thing I 'm going to do is people who are 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.070
 a little knife until the scissors go 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.390
 try to get it out of here without hurting 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.760
 I'll show you around because 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.680
 for the job to take, there is no 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.050
 Way to leave here will stay 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.970
 leaving video fulfilled is not cool 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:24.620
 do it again and already show you 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:28.070
 Good to have a look in our bottle. 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:34.340
 I did cut the cut the cap 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:37.580
 Kind of like that and I did it, I put it here. 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:39.860
 a heartthrob I find the ganache not brigadier 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.470
 that I had made it clear that it 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.230
 work to take can sometimes 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.480
 happen until it gets a bit messy 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.820
 but it's very interesting you can 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.520
 make a cake from where as soon as a 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:56.600
 cola with cake in the middle 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:07:06.130
 You see it really is the robot, I'm not going. 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:10.070
 cut you see that it 's not hard to see 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:15.790
 to see that our same layer cake 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:15.790
 chocolate also a nice people one
