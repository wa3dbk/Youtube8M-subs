Djokovic<00:06:45.090> she<00:06:45.270> never<00:06:45.570> really<00:06:46.080> seemed<00:06:46.410> to<00:06:46.530> me

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
Djokovic she never really seemed to me

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.170 
Djokovic she never really seemed to me
like<00:06:46.740> he<00:06:46.919> knew<00:06:47.280> what<00:06:47.460> to<00:06:47.490> do<00:06:47.759> in<00:06:47.910> the<00:06:48.000> match

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 
like he knew what to do in the match

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.930 
like he knew what to do in the match
well<00:06:48.599> I<00:06:48.630> think<00:06:48.750> it's<00:06:49.020> this<00:06:50.009> play<00:06:50.340> today<00:06:50.699> was

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
well I think it's this play today was

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.749 
well I think it's this play today was
affected<00:06:51.479> by<00:06:51.630> his<00:06:51.810> energy<00:06:52.199> levels<00:06:52.560> which

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 
affected by his energy levels which

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:56.450 
affected by his energy levels which
certainly<00:06:53.759> what<00:06:53.990> we<00:06:54.990> usually<00:06:55.650> see<00:06:55.889> from<00:06:56.130> Novak

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 
certainly what we usually see from Novak

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.100 
certainly what we usually see from Novak
but<00:06:56.520> again<00:06:56.880> a<00:06:56.910> good<00:06:57.120> account<00:06:57.449> of<00:06:57.509> himself<00:06:57.570> I

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
but again a good account of himself I

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.320 
but again a good account of himself I
think<00:06:58.500> it's<00:06:58.770> fair<00:06:58.949> to<00:06:59.039> say<00:06:59.099> Roenick<00:06:59.940> was<00:07:00.090> just

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330 
think it's fair to say Roenick was just

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.720 
think it's fair to say Roenick was just
too<00:07:00.509> good
