00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.639 
bolts in and push back the existing bolt
you<00:01:59.450> want<00:01:59.569> to<00:01:59.659> go<00:01:59.719> ahead<00:01:59.780> and<00:01:59.899> add<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.319> half

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
you want to go ahead and add the half

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.559 
you want to go ahead and add the half
inch<00:02:00.890> blocks<00:02:01.189> onto<00:02:02.090> each<00:02:02.210> one<00:02:02.240> of<00:02:02.479> the

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
inch blocks onto each one of the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.029 
inch blocks onto each one of the
fasteners<00:02:02.990> here<00:02:05.319> and<00:02:06.319> the<00:02:06.469> purpose<00:02:06.829> of<00:02:06.950> this

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
fasteners here and the purpose of this

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.039 
fasteners here and the purpose of this
is<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.399> shim<00:02:07.579> up<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:07.850> space<00:02:08.090> from<00:02:08.929> this

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
is the shim up the space from this

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.660 
is the shim up the space from this
flange<00:02:09.379> area<00:02:09.619> here<00:02:09.920> so<00:02:09.950> that<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.340> hedge<00:02:10.459> can

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
flange area here so that the hedge can

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.610 
flange area here so that the hedge can
sit<00:02:10.910> flat<00:02:11.209> up<00:02:11.840> against<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.260> surface<00:02:14.620> and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
sit flat up against that surface and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.839 
sit flat up against that surface and
again<00:02:15.739> we<00:02:15.950> want<00:02:16.129> the<00:02:16.190> bolt<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.459> just<00:02:16.670> come<00:02:16.819> out

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
again we want the bolt to just come out

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.350 
again we want the bolt to just come out
just<00:02:17.209> about<00:02:18.019> flush<00:02:18.670> with<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.790> spacer<00:02:20.180> there

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
just about flush with the spacer there

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.300 
just about flush with the spacer there
until<00:02:20.870> we<00:02:20.959> get<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.200> hitch<00:02:21.319> up<00:02:21.530> into<00:02:21.620> place<00:02:21.860> and

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
until we get the hitch up into place and

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.979 
until we get the hitch up into place and
then<00:02:22.640> we<00:02:22.760> can<00:02:22.910> push<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.269> bolts<00:02:23.510> back<00:02:23.690> through

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
then we can push the bolts back through

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.949 
then we can push the bolts back through
and<00:02:24.530> attach<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.040> hitch<00:02:25.480> okay<00:02:26.480> now<00:02:26.720> that<00:02:26.870> we've

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
and attach the hitch okay now that we've

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.930 
and attach the hitch okay now that we've
got<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.230> bolts<00:02:27.470> in<00:02:27.560> place<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:28.400> next<00:02:28.640> step<00:02:28.700> is

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
got the bolts in place the next step is

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.860 
got the bolts in place the next step is
to<00:02:29.000> go<00:02:29.060> ahead<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.299> put<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.510> hitch<00:02:29.599> up<00:02:29.840> into

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
to go ahead and put the hitch up into

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.199 
to go ahead and put the hitch up into
position<00:02:30.319> you<00:02:31.190> might<00:02:31.310> require<00:02:31.489> two<00:02:31.880> people<00:02:32.030> to

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
position you might require two people to

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.569 
position you might require two people to
do<00:02:32.420> so<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:32.810> should<00:02:32.989> be<00:02:33.019> it's<00:02:33.319> a<00:02:33.410> fairly<00:02:33.709> large

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
do so it should be it's a fairly large

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.339 
do so it should be it's a fairly large
hitch<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.180> it's<00:02:35.480> kind<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:35.900> hard<00:02:36.079> to<00:02:36.110> have<00:02:36.260> to

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
hitch and it's kind of hard to have to

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.380 
hitch and it's kind of hard to have to
push<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.650> bolts<00:02:36.920> through<00:02:37.069> with<00:02:37.970> just<00:02:38.239> one

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
push the bolts through with just one

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.300 
push the bolts through with just one
person<00:02:38.870> all<00:02:39.620> right<00:02:39.680> once<00:02:39.950> we've<00:02:40.099> got<00:02:40.220> the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
person all right once we've got the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.830 
person all right once we've got the
hitch<00:02:40.459> up<00:02:40.670> into<00:02:40.760> position<00:02:40.970> we<00:02:41.540> want<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.780> go

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
hitch up into position we want to go

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.080 
hitch up into position we want to go
ahead<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.079> put<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.290> fasteners<00:02:42.709> on<00:02:42.879> on<00:02:43.879> the

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
ahead and put the fasteners on on the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.880 
ahead and put the fasteners on on the
forward<00:02:44.420> most<00:02:44.569> bolt<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.079> existing<00:02:45.500> bolt<00:02:45.709> or

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
forward most bolt the existing bolt or

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.809 
forward most bolt the existing bolt or
why<00:02:45.950> not<00:02:45.980> go<00:02:46.160> ahead<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.400> use<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.579> existing

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
why not go ahead and use the existing

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.910 
why not go ahead and use the existing
nut<00:02:47.319> we<00:02:48.319> took<00:02:48.440> off<00:02:48.650> earlier<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:51.500> then<00:02:51.650> on<00:02:51.769> the

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
nut we took off earlier and then on the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.240 
nut we took off earlier and then on the
two<00:02:52.069> rear<00:02:52.310> most<00:02:52.549> ones<00:02:52.790> we<00:02:53.209> want<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.480> use<00:02:54.250> the

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
two rear most ones we want to use the

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.160 
two rear most ones we want to use the
fastener<00:02:55.639> combination<00:02:56.209> of<00:02:56.359> a<00:02:56.420> flat<00:02:56.690> washer

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
fastener combination of a flat washer

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.449 
fastener combination of a flat washer
lock<00:02:58.100> washer<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.850> nut<00:03:03.069> I'm<00:03:04.069> gonna<00:03:04.220> use<00:03:04.340> the

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
lock washer and nut I'm gonna use the

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.660 
lock washer and nut I'm gonna use the
same<00:03:04.489> combination<00:03:04.880> for<00:03:05.359> both<00:03:05.480> sides<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:06.670> the

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
same combination for both sides and the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.039 
same combination for both sides and the
final<00:03:08.000> step<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.329> to<00:03:08.420> go<00:03:08.510> ahead<00:03:08.569> and<00:03:08.780> torque<00:03:08.930> the

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
final step is to go ahead and torque the

final step is to go ahead and torque the
bolts<00:03:09.200> down<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.030> two<00:03:11.239> rear<00:03:11.780> most<00:03:11.810> ones<00:03:12.230> we

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
bolts down and the two rear most ones we

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.080 
bolts down and the two rear most ones we
