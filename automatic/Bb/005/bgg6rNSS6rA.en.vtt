00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
body says to itself okay let's pick

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.300 
body says to itself okay let's pick
tents<00:02:38.200> let's<00:02:39.200> start<00:02:39.530> building<00:02:39.770> the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
tents let's start building the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.760 
tents let's start building the
adrenaline<00:02:40.880> just<00:02:41.300> in<00:02:41.630> case<00:02:41.840> our<00:02:42.110> horse<00:02:42.410> that's

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
adrenaline just in case our horse that's

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.600 
adrenaline just in case our horse that's
a<00:02:43.010> response<00:02:43.460> fearfully<00:02:44.120> I'm<00:02:44.600> ready<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.050> do<00:02:45.200> it

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
a response fearfully I'm ready to do it

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.990 
a response fearfully I'm ready to do it
right<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:47.020> so<00:02:48.020> there's<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.290> different

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
right and so there's a different

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.020 
right and so there's a different
chemistry<00:02:50.000> in<00:02:50.420> your<00:02:50.570> body<00:02:50.780> in<00:02:51.110> that<00:02:51.350> moment

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
chemistry in your body in that moment

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.340 
chemistry in your body in that moment
versus<00:02:53.030> if<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.270> see<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.660> something<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.200> go

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
versus if you see that something you go

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.780 
versus if you see that something you go
up<00:02:54.620> not<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.430> worry

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
up not to worry

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.420 
up not to worry
we're<00:02:56.360> going<00:02:56.690> here<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.380> I'm<00:02:57.980> going<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.190> focus

we're going here and I'm going to focus

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.610 
we're going here and I'm going to focus
here<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:58.910> put<00:02:59.030> my<00:02:59.060> energy<00:02:59.540> here<00:02:59.780> there'll<00:03:00.590> be

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
here and put my energy here there'll be

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.910 
here and put my energy here there'll be
a<00:03:00.770> different<00:03:01.100> response<00:03:01.520> in<00:03:01.850> your<00:03:02.270> body<00:03:02.920> your

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
a different response in your body your

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.490 
a different response in your body your
