00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.050 

decided<00:01:25.820> to<00:01:26.060> Plasti<00:01:26.480> Dip<00:01:26.510> mine<00:01:28.060> mainly

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
decided to Plasti Dip mine mainly

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.480 
decided to Plasti Dip mine mainly
because<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:31.450> big<00:01:32.450> dogs<00:01:32.720> out<00:01:32.930> in<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.140> lake

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
because the big dogs out in the lake

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.010 
because the big dogs out in the lake
mainly<00:01:34.490> because<00:01:34.670> there<00:01:35.360> was<00:01:35.479> a<00:01:35.510> few<00:01:35.810> blemishes

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
mainly because there was a few blemishes

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.080 
mainly because there was a few blemishes
on<00:01:36.560> them<00:01:36.800> and<00:01:37.570> you<00:01:38.570> know<00:01:38.660> I<00:01:38.690> think<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.050> black

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
on them and you know I think the black

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.280 
on them and you know I think the black
complements<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.210> black<00:01:41.450> paint<00:01:42.250> real<00:01:43.250> nice

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
complements the black paint real nice

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.940 
complements the black paint real nice
but<00:01:46.600> yeah<00:01:47.600> consider<00:01:48.170> this<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.650> official
