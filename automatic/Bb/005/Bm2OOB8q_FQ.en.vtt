that came with the countertops and these

per<00:02:28.650> side<00:02:28.920> splash<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:29.970> do<00:02:30.300> kind<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.600> need

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
per side splash so you do kind of need

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.150 
per side splash so you do kind of need
it<00:02:30.780> for<00:02:31.140> bathrooms<00:02:31.500> especially<00:02:31.620> if<00:02:32.040> the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
it for bathrooms especially if the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.590 
it for bathrooms especially if the
granite<00:02:32.490> goes<00:02:32.610> up<00:02:32.760> against<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.180> wall<00:02:33.360> but

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
granite goes up against the wall but

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.030 
granite goes up against the wall but
it's<00:02:33.810> going<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.080> be<00:02:34.200> pretty<00:02:34.500> darn<00:02:34.740> cool

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
it's going to be pretty darn cool

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.630 
it's going to be pretty darn cool
because<00:02:35.340> our<00:02:36.060> old<00:02:36.420> countertops<00:02:37.080> are

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
because our old countertops are

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.790 
because our old countertops are
extremely<00:02:38.640> ugly
