in<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> year<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.310> think<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.240> good

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
in the year and I think this is a good

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.359 
in the year and I think this is a good
game<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:58.140> us<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.860> think<00:01:58.890> there's<00:01:59.250> any

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
game for us and I think there's any

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.850 
game for us and I think there's any
drama<00:01:59.729> surrounding<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.420> game<00:02:00.689> for<00:02:01.530> any

drama surrounding this game for any
reasons<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.579> think

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
reasons I think

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.460 
reasons I think
began<00:02:03.420> when<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:03.720> can<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:03.960> focus<00:02:04.110> on<00:02:04.320> football

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
began when we can just focus on football

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.190 
began when we can just focus on football
and<00:02:04.710> start<00:02:05.400> fast<00:02:05.700> second<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.540> defense<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and start fast second on defense the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.660 
and start fast second on defense the
