today i'm here to do a demo of the
formula<00:00:41.219> 5<00:00:41.460> from<00:00:41.850> catalan<00:00:42.239> bread<00:00:42.559> this<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.620> a

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
formula 5 from catalan bread this is a

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.459 
formula 5 from catalan bread this is a
very<00:00:44.070> straightforward<00:00:44.460> dry<00:00:45.030> box<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.870> kind<00:00:46.379> of

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
very straightforward dry box it kind of

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.939 
very straightforward dry box it kind of
does<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:47.420> pushed<00:00:48.420> tweed<00:00:49.410> amp<00:00:50.339> overdrive<00:00:51.149> thing

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
does a pushed tweed amp overdrive thing

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:53.719 
does a pushed tweed amp overdrive thing
basically<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.070> kind<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.610> know

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
basically it's kind of like you know

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:55.880 
basically it's kind of like you know
gives<00:00:54.269> you<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> tone<00:00:54.629> if<00:00:54.780> yet<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> tweed<00:00:55.680> amp

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
gives you the tone if yet a tweed amp

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.039 
gives you the tone if yet a tweed amp
just<00:00:56.280> cranked<00:00:56.760> all<00:00:56.909> the<00:00:56.940> way<00:00:57.059> up<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.870> gives

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.049 
just cranked all the way up but it gives

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:00.200 
just cranked all the way up but it gives
it<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.469> at<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:59.159> little<00:01:00.030> less

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
it to you at a little less

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.479 
it to you at a little less
ear-shattering<00:01:01.019> volume<00:01:01.799> so<00:01:02.070> let's<00:01:02.250> take<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
ear-shattering volume so let's take a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.219 
ear-shattering volume so let's take a
look<00:01:03.180> at<00:01:03.269> the<00:01:03.390> pedal<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.839> controls

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
look at the pedal and the controls

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.389 
look at the pedal and the controls
really<00:01:04.949> straightforward<00:01:06.170> volume<00:01:07.399> that's

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
really straightforward volume that's

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.760 
really straightforward volume that's
your<00:01:08.580> output<00:01:08.880> level<00:01:09.210> your<00:01:10.020> gain<00:01:10.259> control

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
your output level your gain control

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.960 
your output level your gain control
pretty<00:01:11.580> much<00:01:11.820> straightforward<00:01:13.789> where<00:01:14.789> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
pretty much straightforward where the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.149 
pretty much straightforward where the
gain<00:01:15.179> control<00:01:15.330> begins<00:01:15.899> is<00:01:16.350> if<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.950> had<00:01:17.039> like

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
gain control begins is if you had like

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.219 
gain control begins is if you had like
an<00:01:17.310> old<00:01:17.580> tweet<00:01:17.850> amp<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.240> say<00:01:18.450> about<00:01:18.659> 3:00<00:01:19.050> on

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
an old tweet amp on say about 3:00 on

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.690 
an old tweet amp on say about 3:00 on
the<00:01:19.319> volume<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.039> goes<00:01:20.250> from<00:01:20.520> there

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the volume and it just goes from there

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.219 
the volume and it just goes from there
it<00:01:20.850> really<00:01:20.909> screams<00:01:22.069> it<00:01:23.069> gives<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.520> gain<00:01:24.229> far

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
it really screams it gives you gain far

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.950 
it really screams it gives you gain far
past<00:01:25.530> what<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.159> could<00:01:26.429> get<00:01:26.580> from<00:01:26.850> pushing<00:01:27.690> an

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
past what you could get from pushing an

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.249 
past what you could get from pushing an
amp<00:01:28.140> all<00:01:28.319> the<00:01:28.500> way<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.679> its<00:01:28.890> limits<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:30.259> tone

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
amp all the way to its limits and tone

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.450 
amp all the way to its limits and tone
control<00:01:31.710> which<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:31.920> kind<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.429> a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
control which is kind of like a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.130 
control which is kind of like a
high-pass<00:01:32.909> filter<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:33.690> you<00:01:33.780> roll<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.050> all

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
high-pass filter so if you roll it all

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.809 
high-pass filter so if you roll it all
the<00:01:34.170> way<00:01:34.350> off<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:34.649> going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.830> take<00:01:35.009> your<00:01:35.220> your

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
the way off it's going to take your your

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.899 
the way off it's going to take your your
highs<00:01:36.030> down<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.780> good<00:01:37.110> bit<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:38.130> let's<00:01:38.579> listen<00:01:38.790> to

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
highs down a good bit so let's listen to

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.800 
highs down a good bit so let's listen to
the<00:01:39.060> clean<00:01:39.299> sound<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.619> amplifier<00:01:41.659> this<00:01:42.659> is

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the clean sound of the amplifier this is

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.730 
the clean sound of the amplifier this is

let's listen what happens when I clean

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.309 
let's listen what happens when I clean
the<00:03:08.890> volume<00:03:09.250> up<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:10.390> that's<00:03:10.450> ten<00:03:10.900> on<00:03:11.170> the

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
right in the pedal up a lot and try to

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:56.159 
right in the pedal up a lot and try to
play<00:03:59.640> on<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.150> neck<00:04:00.450> as<00:04:01.260> we<00:04:01.560> get

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
you can really get a lot of nice jangle

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.619 
you can really get a lot of nice jangle
out<00:04:58.330> of<00:04:58.449> this<00:04:58.569> too<00:04:58.810> if<00:04:59.050> you<00:05:00.270> put<00:05:01.270> something

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:01.629 
out of this too if you put something

out of this too if you put something
like<00:05:01.659> this<00:05:01.930> in<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.199> bridge<00:05:02.469> not<00:05:02.800> keep<00:05:03.069> the

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:03.219 
like this in the bridge not keep the

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:11.730 
like this in the bridge not keep the
volume<00:05:03.400> down<00:05:03.699> a<00:05:03.759> bit

I<00:05:17.570> lighten<00:05:18.570> up<00:05:18.660> my<00:05:18.840> touch<00:05:19.080> I<00:05:19.260> can<00:05:19.290> really<00:05:19.560> get<00:05:19.650> a

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
I lighten up my touch I can really get a

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.310 
I lighten up my touch I can really get a
lot<00:05:19.770> of<00:05:19.890> dynamics

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:51.030
