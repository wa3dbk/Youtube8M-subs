normal now if this microphone was a

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.460 
normal now if this microphone was a
condenser<00:01:23.380> mic<00:01:23.620> I<00:01:23.920> would<00:01:24.910> use<00:01:25.470> phantom

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
condenser mic I would use phantom

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.170

testing<00:02:24.410> 1<00:02:24.590> 2<00:02:24.620> we<00:02:24.980> can<00:02:25.070> hear<00:02:25.190> myself<00:02:25.310> right

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
testing 1 2 we can hear myself right

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.060 
testing 1 2 we can hear myself right
there<00:02:25.790> see<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.540> it's<00:02:26.720> on<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.230> that's<00:02:27.890> how

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
there see that so it's on and that's how

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.180 
there see that so it's on and that's how
we<00:02:28.130> hook<00:02:28.340> up<00:02:28.460> our<00:02:28.610> microphone<00:02:29.890> I'll<00:02:30.890> turn<00:02:31.100> it

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
we hook up our microphone I'll turn it

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.860 
we hook up our microphone I'll turn it
off<00:02:31.310> now<00:02:31.880> it's<00:02:32.030> important<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.510> make<00:02:32.660> sure<00:02:32.690> your

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
off now it's important to make sure your

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.680 
off now it's important to make sure your
levels<00:02:33.170> are<00:02:33.290> low<00:02:33.770> before<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.280> start<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.910> use

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
levels are low before you start to use

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.420 
levels are low before you start to use
your<00:02:35.720> microphones<00:02:36.350> or<00:02:36.530> any<00:02:36.680> input<00:02:37.040> into<00:02:37.160> our

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
your microphones or any input into our

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.380 
your microphones or any input into our
SP<00:02:37.790> 5<00:02:38.030> 5<00:02:38.270> 5<00:02:38.950> so<00:02:39.950> let's<00:02:40.340> keep<00:02:40.520> these<00:02:40.670> levels<00:02:41.000> low

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
SP 5 5 5 so let's keep these levels low

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.480 
SP 5 5 5 so let's keep these levels low
I'll<00:02:41.450> keep<00:02:41.630> this<00:02:41.750> down<00:02:41.990> also<00:02:42.200> as<00:02:42.350> well<00:02:42.530> and

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
I'll keep this down also as well and

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.390 
I'll keep this down also as well and
then<00:02:43.670> I'm<00:02:43.790> through<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.210> mic<00:02:45.010> I'll<00:02:46.010> turn<00:02:46.280> off

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
then I'm through the mic I'll turn off

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.550 
then I'm through the mic I'll turn off
right<00:02:46.580> there<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.060> then<00:02:47.630> now<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:48.140> can<00:02:48.410> use<00:02:48.440> it

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
right there and then now I can use it

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.920 
right there and then now I can use it
this<00:02:49.160> mic<00:02:49.460> right<00:02:49.670> here<00:02:49.700> which<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.030> my<00:02:50.240> internal

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
this mic right here which is my internal

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.650 
this mic right here which is my internal
mic<00:02:51.080> source<00:02:51.380> this<00:02:52.130> is<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.340> internal<00:02:52.760> mic<00:02:53.030> okay

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
mic source this is the internal mic okay

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.830 
mic source this is the internal mic okay
so<00:02:54.650> if<00:02:54.770> an<00:02:54.860> external<00:02:55.610> mic<00:02:55.760> as<00:02:55.880> well<00:02:56.090> there's<00:02:56.750> on

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
so if an external mic as well there's on

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.110 
so if an external mic as well there's on
the<00:02:56.870> way<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.140> actually<00:02:57.320> plug<00:02:57.770> into<00:02:58.010> our<00:02:58.220> SP<00:02:58.700> 5<00:02:58.910> 5

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
the way to actually plug into our SP 5 5

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.710 
the way to actually plug into our SP 5 5
5<00:02:59.330> I'll<00:02:59.600> plug<00:02:59.780> this<00:02:59.900> right<00:02:59.989> now<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:04.630> just<00:03:05.630> took

and you notice there's two different

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.840 
and you notice there's two different
ends<00:03:23.570> here<00:03:23.780> as<00:03:23.870> well<00:03:24.760> now<00:03:25.760> here<00:03:26.060> we<00:03:26.209> have<00:03:26.239> a

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
ends here as well now here we have a

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.640 
ends here as well now here we have a
female<00:03:28.850> XLR<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:29.570> we<00:03:29.750> have<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:29.930> quarter<00:03:30.470> inch

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
female XLR and we have a quarter inch

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.460 
female XLR and we have a quarter inch
cable<00:03:31.120> this<00:03:32.120> is<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.330> singles<00:03:32.840> you<00:03:32.930> can<00:03:33.110> see<00:03:33.260> here

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
cable this is a singles you can see here

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.660 
cable this is a singles you can see here
so<00:03:33.620> it's<00:03:33.770> just<00:03:33.800> a<00:03:33.980> mono<00:03:34.220> cable<00:03:34.580> of<00:03:34.640> course

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
so it's just a mono cable of course

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.870 
so it's just a mono cable of course
obviously<00:03:35.300> and<00:03:36.430> this<00:03:37.430> thing<00:03:37.610> goes<00:03:37.730> on<00:03:37.760> the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
obviously and this thing goes on the

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:45.360 
obviously and this thing goes on the
microphone<00:03:40.720> looks<00:03:41.720> out<00:03:41.900> plug<00:03:42.170> in<00:03:42.260> right<00:03:42.410> there

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.490 

they<00:03:46.370> actually<00:03:47.120> get<00:03:47.270> a<00:03:47.300> plugin<00:03:47.690> properly<00:03:48.230> here

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
they actually get a plugin properly here

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.040 
they actually get a plugin properly here
we<00:03:48.620> go<00:03:48.770> and<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:49.880> other<00:03:49.910> end<00:03:50.390> I'm<00:03:50.660> going<00:03:50.900> right

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
we go and the other end I'm going right

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.270 
we go and the other end I'm going right
in<00:03:51.200> here<00:03:52.090> so<00:03:53.090> this<00:03:53.480> input<00:03:53.870> source<00:03:54.470> doubles<00:03:55.160> the

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
in here so this input source doubles the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.480 
in here so this input source doubles the
XLR<00:03:55.790> and<00:03:56.030> also<00:03:56.720> as<00:03:56.900> quarter-inch<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:57.860> you'll

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
XLR and also as quarter-inch and you'll

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.280 
XLR and also as quarter-inch and you'll
see<00:03:58.610> a<00:03:58.640> diagram<00:03:59.150> right<00:03:59.330> here<00:03:59.390> for<00:03:59.900> ring<00:04:00.080> tip

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
see a diagram right here for ring tip

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.170 
see a diagram right here for ring tip
sleeve<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:01.130> how<00:04:01.250> they<00:04:01.400> correspond<00:04:01.940> between

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
sleeve and how they correspond between

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.080 
sleeve and how they correspond between
the<00:04:02.270> XLR<00:04:02.720> cable<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:04.250> quarter-inch<00:04:04.910> cable

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
the XLR cable and the quarter-inch cable

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.430 
the XLR cable and the quarter-inch cable

overall<00:04:19.370> output<00:04:19.850> volume<00:04:20.000> is<00:04:20.299> low<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:21.320> I<00:04:21.380> go<00:04:21.500> to

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
overall output volume is low and I go to

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.090 
overall output volume is low and I go to
my<00:04:21.620> mic<00:04:21.920> level<00:04:22.310> get<00:04:23.210> that<00:04:23.300> low<00:04:23.450> as<00:04:23.510> well<00:04:24.100> I'll

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
my mic level get that low as well I'll

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.120 
my mic level get that low as well I'll
turn<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.370> mic<00:04:25.520> on<00:04:26.380> testing<00:04:27.380> one<00:04:27.620> two<00:04:27.650> three<00:04:28.040> or

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
turn the mic on testing one two three or

turn the mic on testing one two three or
me<00:04:28.190> this<00:04:28.310> one<00:04:28.430> works<00:04:28.610> as<00:04:28.700> well<00:04:29.230> so<00:04:30.230> you<00:04:30.320> can<00:04:30.440> see

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
me this one works as well so you can see

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.330 
me this one works as well so you can see
these<00:04:32.180> are<00:04:32.360> two<00:04:32.390> different<00:04:32.870> ways<00:04:33.200> hook<00:04:34.160> up<00:04:34.280> a

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
these are two different ways hook up a

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.420 
these are two different ways hook up a

never<00:05:10.070> know<00:05:10.280> and<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.930> reason<00:05:12.110> why<00:05:12.200> we<00:05:12.290> do<00:05:12.380> this

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
never know and the reason why we do this

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.050 
never know and the reason why we do this
close<00:05:12.710> let<00:05:12.830> me<00:05:12.920> turn<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.310> switch<00:05:13.520> here<00:05:13.850> you

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
close let me turn the switch here you

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.320 
close let me turn the switch here you
want<00:05:14.180> to<00:05:14.270> go<00:05:14.360> from<00:05:14.660> normal<00:05:15.140> to<00:05:15.910> Heisey<00:05:16.910> when<00:05:17.300> I

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
want to go from normal to Heisey when I

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.670 
want to go from normal to Heisey when I
put<00:05:17.510> on<00:05:17.570> the<00:05:17.630> guitar<00:05:17.960> when<00:05:18.140> the<00:05:18.200> bass<00:05:18.320> guitar

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
put on the guitar when the bass guitar

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.830 
put on the guitar when the bass guitar
so<00:05:19.610> I<00:05:19.640> wanna<00:05:19.760> make<00:05:19.790> sure<00:05:20.150> there's<00:05:20.540> no<00:05:20.630> noise

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
so I wanna make sure there's no noise

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.240 
so I wanna make sure there's no noise
now<00:05:21.140> what<00:05:21.320> happens<00:05:21.710> also<00:05:21.920> is<00:05:22.100> that<00:05:22.130> the

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
now what happens also is that the

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.860 
now what happens also is that the
Machine<00:05:22.610> sort<00:05:23.540> of<00:05:24.280> mutes<00:05:25.280> the<00:05:25.580> input<00:05:26.120> while

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
Machine sort of mutes the input while

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.320 
Machine sort of mutes the input while
this<00:05:27.110> switches<00:05:27.440> over<00:05:27.590> so<00:05:28.460> that<00:05:28.490> way<00:05:28.820> you<00:05:29.240> won't

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
this switches over so that way you won't

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.120 
this switches over so that way you won't
damage<00:05:29.720> any<00:05:30.020> circuitry<00:05:30.440> and<00:05:30.620> also<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:30.950> same

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
damage any circuitry and also the same

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.150 
damage any circuitry and also the same
time<00:05:31.370> just<00:05:32.270> loud<00:05:32.450> pop<00:05:32.840> like<00:05:33.170> for<00:05:33.350> example<00:05:33.410> you

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
time just loud pop like for example you

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.040 
time just loud pop like for example you
put<00:05:34.370> in<00:05:34.460> something<00:05:34.580> a<00:05:34.880> little<00:05:34.910> lot<00:05:35.240> of<00:05:35.330> pop<00:05:35.570> to

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
put in something a little lot of pop to

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.350 
put in something a little lot of pop to
make<00:05:36.860> sure<00:05:36.980> the<00:05:37.070> song<00:05:37.280> connection<00:05:37.700> as<00:05:37.760> well<00:05:37.910> so

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
make sure the song connection as well so

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.360 
make sure the song connection as well so
make<00:05:38.480> sure<00:05:38.510> that's<00:05:38.630> in<00:05:38.780> perfectly<00:05:39.230> well<00:05:39.440> and<00:05:40.250> I

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
make sure that's in perfectly well and I

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.180 
make sure that's in perfectly well and I
got<00:05:40.460> my<00:05:40.580> advanced<00:05:40.790> guitar<00:05:40.970> on<00:05:41.980> now<00:05:42.980> unless

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
got my advanced guitar on now unless

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.939 
got my advanced guitar on now unless
that's<00:05:43.370> on<00:05:43.670> I<00:05:44.030> know<00:05:44.270> it's<00:05:44.420> right

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:46.949 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.459 

like<00:05:47.939> a<00:05:47.969> play<00:05:48.180> on<00:05:48.330> bass<00:05:48.449> guitar<00:05:48.479> but<00:05:49.289> you<00:05:49.349> can

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:49.469 
like a play on bass guitar but you can

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:51.770 
like a play on bass guitar but you can
see<00:05:49.680> right<00:05:49.889> here<00:05:50.060> the<00:05:51.060> other<00:05:51.270> end<00:05:51.509> is<00:05:51.599> right

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
see right here the other end is right

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.230 
see right here the other end is right
there<00:05:51.990> inside<00:05:52.289> the<00:05:52.439> Machine<00:05:52.759> and<00:05:53.759> the<00:05:54.150> other

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
there inside the Machine and the other

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.499 
there inside the Machine and the other
one<00:05:54.419> is<00:05:54.539> here<00:05:54.749> on<00:05:54.990> the<00:05:55.110> bass<00:05:55.229> guitar<00:05:55.259> itself

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:56.509 
one is here on the bass guitar itself

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:00.189 
one is here on the bass guitar itself
and<00:05:57.509> I<00:05:57.689> guess<00:05:57.840> play<00:05:57.990> the<00:05:58.050> bass<00:05:58.199> guitar<00:05:58.229> I

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
and I guess play the bass guitar I

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:12.320 
and I guess play the bass guitar I
control<00:06:01.199> the<00:06:01.259> fly<00:06:01.409> in<00:06:01.469> here<00:06:10.729> and<00:06:11.729> here's<00:06:12.060> one

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
control the fly in here and here's one

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.969 
control the fly in here and here's one
end<00:06:12.539> here<00:06:13.069> the<00:06:14.069> other<00:06:14.189> ones<00:06:14.400> there<00:06:15.830> nothing

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
end here the other ones there nothing

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.559 
end here the other ones there nothing
turn<00:06:17.219> it<00:06:17.310> off<00:06:18.590> don't<00:06:19.590> hear<00:06:19.740> anything<00:06:19.889> at<00:06:20.039> all

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:20.569 
turn it off don't hear anything at all

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:23.600 
turn it off don't hear anything at all
that's<00:06:21.569> how<00:06:21.840> we<00:06:21.900> use<00:06:22.319> a<00:06:22.349> guitar<00:06:22.680> or<00:06:23.279> bass

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
that's how we use a guitar or bass

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.450 
that's how we use a guitar or bass
guitar<00:06:24.029> and<00:06:24.960> we<00:06:25.349> put<00:06:25.529> it<00:06:25.650> directly<00:06:25.740> into<00:06:26.279> the

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
guitar and we put it directly into the
