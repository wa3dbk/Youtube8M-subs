so<00:00:02.290> we've<00:00:02.409> got<00:00:02.530> our<00:00:02.560> sheetrock<00:00:03.070> put<00:00:03.340> up<00:00:03.870> and

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:04.870 
so we've got our sheetrock put up and

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.430 
so we've got our sheetrock put up and
then<00:00:05.170> we<00:00:05.259> cut<00:00:05.440> the<00:00:05.560> ceiling<00:00:06.009> panel<00:00:07.290> we've<00:00:08.290> got

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440 
then we cut the ceiling panel we've got

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.760 
then we cut the ceiling panel we've got
the<00:00:08.559> ceiling<00:00:08.950> panel<00:00:09.280> up<00:00:09.459> in<00:00:09.670> there<00:00:09.879> and<00:00:10.770> we

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:11.770 
the ceiling panel up in there and we

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.379 
the ceiling panel up in there and we
ended<00:00:11.949> up<00:00:12.039> screwing<00:00:12.369> some<00:00:12.639> boards<00:00:13.000> onto<00:00:13.299> the

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.389 
ended up screwing some boards onto the

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.769 
ended up screwing some boards onto the
face<00:00:13.690> of<00:00:13.750> that<00:00:14.260> wood<00:00:15.070> at<00:00:15.250> the<00:00:15.369> top<00:00:15.610> just<00:00:15.940> to

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:16.779 
face of that wood at the top just to

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.249 
face of that wood at the top just to
help<00:00:16.960> hold<00:00:17.230> that<00:00:17.439> up<00:00:17.470> and<00:00:17.890> then<00:00:18.730> I<00:00:19.150> we<00:00:19.929> threaded

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:20.259 
help hold that up and then I we threaded

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.900 
help hold that up and then I we threaded
the<00:00:21.240> pipe<00:00:22.240> up<00:00:22.839> in<00:00:23.289> there<00:00:23.499> and<00:00:23.740> then<00:00:24.580> just<00:00:24.699> put

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
the pipe up in there and then just put

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.370 
the pipe up in there and then just put
the<00:00:24.999> clamp<00:00:25.269> on<00:00:25.480> that<00:00:25.630> to<00:00:25.839> hold<00:00:26.050> the<00:00:26.199> middle

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
the clamp on that to hold the middle

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.620 
the clamp on that to hold the middle
part<00:00:26.679> up<00:00:26.919> then<00:00:27.640> we<00:00:27.759> actually<00:00:27.880> put<00:00:28.210> some<00:00:28.359> screws

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
part up then we actually put some screws

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.300 
part up then we actually put some screws
up<00:00:28.929> around<00:00:29.169> the<00:00:29.289> perimeter<00:00:29.800> just<00:00:30.189> some

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
up around the perimeter just some

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.029 
up around the perimeter just some
drywall<00:00:30.550> screws<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.470> we<00:00:32.560> kept<00:00:32.739> them<00:00:32.860> close

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 
drywall screws and we kept them close

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:34.740 
drywall screws and we kept them close
enough<00:00:33.280> to<00:00:33.399> the<00:00:33.520> edge<00:00:33.640> that<00:00:33.940> after<00:00:34.390> we<00:00:34.480> put<00:00:34.660> our

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
enough to the edge that after we put our

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.029 
enough to the edge that after we put our
wall<00:00:34.960> panel<00:00:35.320> up<00:00:35.469> and<00:00:35.680> then<00:00:35.770> we're<00:00:35.890> going<00:00:35.980> to

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
wall panel up and then we're going to

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:37.470 
wall panel up and then we're going to
add<00:00:36.100> some<00:00:36.190> trim<00:00:36.579> up<00:00:36.760> there<00:00:36.940> at<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.030> top<00:00:37.120> that's

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
add some trim up there at the top that's

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.209 
add some trim up there at the top that's
going<00:00:37.690> to<00:00:37.750> cover<00:00:37.960> up<00:00:38.110> all<00:00:38.320> those<00:00:38.469> screws<00:00:41.219> then

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
going to cover up all those screws then

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.630 
going to cover up all those screws then
we<00:00:42.609> also<00:00:43.109> put<00:00:44.109> construction<00:00:45.010> adhesive<00:00:45.280> we

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
we also put construction adhesive we

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.130 
we also put construction adhesive we
used<00:00:45.789> a<00:00:45.910> PL<00:00:46.750> 100<00:00:47.440> construction<00:00:48.100> adhesive<00:00:48.250> and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
used a PL 100 construction adhesive and

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.400 
used a PL 100 construction adhesive and
put<00:00:50.140> dabs<00:00:50.410> all<00:00:50.649> over<00:00:50.829> the<00:00:50.920> back<00:00:51.129> of<00:00:51.160> that<00:00:51.550> panel

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
put dabs all over the back of that panel

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.970 
put dabs all over the back of that panel
so<00:00:53.410> that<00:00:53.489> really<00:00:54.489> even<00:00:54.850> after<00:00:55.149> just<00:00:55.359> a<00:00:55.769> an<00:00:56.769> hour

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
so that really even after just a an hour

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.490 
so that really even after just a an hour
so<00:00:57.460> we'll<00:00:57.609> be<00:00:57.730> able<00:00:57.820> to<00:00:57.910> pull<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:59.050> wood

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
so we'll be able to pull the the wood

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.400 
so we'll be able to pull the the wood
down<00:00:59.800> those<00:01:00.699> clamps<00:01:01.030> down<00:01:01.210> and<00:01:01.719> that<00:01:02.019> payment

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
down those clamps down and that payment

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.279 
down those clamps down and that payment
will<00:01:02.530> hold<00:01:03.190> itself<00:01:03.519> up<00:01:03.699> there

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:09.660 

so<00:01:08.289> we<00:01:08.380> just<00:01:08.530> put<00:01:08.590> some<00:01:08.859> tape<00:01:09.039> across<00:01:09.369> the

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
so we just put some tape across the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.700 
so we just put some tape across the
panel<00:01:10.060> so<00:01:10.210> that<00:01:10.240> we<00:01:10.420> could<00:01:10.539> mark<00:01:10.780> a<00:01:10.899> line<00:01:11.079> the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
panel so that we could mark a line the

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.069 
panel so that we could mark a line the
length<00:01:11.890> we<00:01:12.070> want<00:01:12.310> and<00:01:13.119> we're<00:01:13.240> using<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.659> 4-inch

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.079 
length we want and we're using a 4-inch

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:16.859 
length we want and we're using a 4-inch
right<00:01:14.289> angle<00:01:14.619> grinder<00:01:15.039> I'm<00:01:15.820> going<00:01:16.509> to<00:01:16.600> cut

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
right angle grinder I'm going to cut

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:46.680 
right angle grinder I'm going to cut
that<00:01:17.140> line<00:01:18.960> go<00:01:19.960> ahead

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.970 

all<00:01:47.690> right<00:01:47.900> now<00:01:48.080> if<00:01:48.230> you<00:01:48.350> want<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.530> scribe<00:01:48.890> a

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
all right now if you want to scribe a

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.380 
all right now if you want to scribe a
panel<00:01:49.340> we<00:01:49.460> can<00:01:49.580> just<00:01:49.700> do<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:49.970> with<00:01:50.120> a<00:01:50.150> belt

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
panel we can just do that with a belt

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.580 
panel we can just do that with a belt
sander<00:01:50.660> so<00:01:52.240> we<00:01:53.240> cut<00:01:53.480> up<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:53.810> left<00:01:54.230> about<00:01:54.530> the

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
sander so we cut up and left about the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.340 
sander so we cut up and left about the
sixteenth<00:01:55.190> of<00:01:55.280> an<00:01:55.430> inch<00:01:55.520> away<00:01:55.670> from<00:01:55.790> that<00:01:56.030> line

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
sixteenth of an inch away from that line

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:08.520 
sixteenth of an inch away from that line
and<00:01:57.350> then<00:01:57.830> you<00:01:57.920> can

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.050 

you

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.340 

so<00:02:12.060> we<00:02:12.150> brought<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.480> panel<00:02:12.840> up<00:02:12.930> here<00:02:12.960> we've

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
so we brought the panel up here we've

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.890 
so we brought the panel up here we've
got<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.650> stood<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.040> we<00:02:14.790> used<00:02:15.030> some<00:02:15.630> suction

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
got it stood in we used some suction

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.600 
got it stood in we used some suction
cups<00:02:16.290> like<00:02:16.440> what<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.740> carry<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.040> mirror<00:02:17.430> with

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
cups like what you carry a mirror with

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.960 
cups like what you carry a mirror with
told<00:02:18.480> on<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.900> panel<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.470> then<00:02:20.460> from<00:02:20.850> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
told on that panel and then from the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.600 
told on that panel and then from the
back<00:02:21.000> side<00:02:21.740> we've<00:02:22.740> got<00:02:22.770> that<00:02:23.160> whole<00:02:23.370> wall

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
back side we've got that whole wall

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.390 
back side we've got that whole wall
covered<00:02:24.090> with<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:25.050> PL<00:02:25.350> 100<00:02:25.830> construction

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
covered with the PL 100 construction

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.740 
covered with the PL 100 construction
adhesive<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:28.130> then<00:02:29.130> down<00:02:29.460> at<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.640> bottom<00:02:29.750> on

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
adhesive and then down at the bottom on

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.350 
adhesive and then down at the bottom on
that<00:02:31.290> flange<00:02:31.650> we<00:02:32.040> ran<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.250> bead<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.670> silicone

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.550 

it's<00:02:36.360> hard<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.600> see<00:02:36.840> in<00:02:36.990> here<00:02:37.200> but<00:02:37.350> there's<00:02:37.470> a

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
it's hard to see in here but there's a

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.870 
it's hard to see in here but there's a
bead<00:02:37.740> of<00:02:37.860> clear<00:02:37.950> silicone<00:02:38.580> all<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.790> way

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
bead of clear silicone all the way

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.910 
bead of clear silicone all the way
across<00:02:39.000> there<00:02:39.450> that's<00:02:40.050> all<00:02:40.170> still<00:02:40.440> wet<00:02:40.650> right

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
across there that's all still wet right

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.670 
across there that's all still wet right
now<00:02:40.950> then<00:02:41.310> we're<00:02:41.430> going<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.580> push<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.240> panel

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
now then we're going to push the panel

the hole into some wood and then a

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.849 
the hole into some wood and then a
session<00:03:52.420> will<00:03:52.840> be<00:03:52.959> a<00:03:52.989> discussion<00:03:53.290> plate

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
session will be a discussion plate

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.860 
session will be a discussion plate
around<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.310> shower<00:03:54.609> head<00:03:54.910> that<00:03:55.269> covers<00:03:55.720> up

so<00:03:59.980> far<00:04:00.220> our<00:04:00.730> next<00:04:01.060> step<00:04:01.299> is<00:04:01.480> going<00:04:01.690> to<00:04:01.750> be

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
corners and you go up and around the top

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.800 
corners and you go up and around the top
we're<00:04:12.100> going<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.280> put<00:04:12.489> a<00:04:12.519> seat<00:04:12.910> into<00:04:13.660> this
