00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.330
 today in university street 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.790
 we start from the University of Murcia 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.890
 to start the investigation about the 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.460
 concept of pedagogy that people have 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.460
 at street level 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.750
 hello antonio we know what is the 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.870
 pedagogy 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.570
 the pedagogy I think is a science 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.200
 which is used to apply education 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.200
 correctly 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.190
 in general 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.190
 very good then 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.380
 what is for you the pedagogy for me 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.750
 the pedagogy in the formation of 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.700
 professionals who will help children 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.070
 in their learning they study their 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.750
 attitudes that guide you in general 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.550
 and that's what I understand why I do 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.550
 Thanks a lot to you 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:04.480
 logic is a science 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.480
 object of the study of education 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.100
 if I'm not mistaken pedagogy as well as 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.650
 the sciences that also study all 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.000
 children something like learning to 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.000
 educate them and others 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.600
 could you tell me that it is for you 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.350
 pedagogy 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.890
 for me, it's a science that studies 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.850
 to people their attitudes their way of 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.580
 be 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.580
 its capabilities all basically 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.890
 of people 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.530
 person or girls up to adults 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.750
 for me 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.340
 it's more 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.340
 as counselor and psychologist 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.010
 could you explain to me what 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.380
 understood by pedagogy because I think that 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.540
 science the science that studies the 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.640
 education the history of education and 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.640
