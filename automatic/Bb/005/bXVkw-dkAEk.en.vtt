tend to probably be more just for the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.670 
tend to probably be more just for the
players<00:01:42.689> who<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.110> use<00:01:43.350> slower

sensitivities<00:01:44.430> he<00:01:45.270> uses<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> professional

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.380 
sensitivities he uses a professional
sensitivity<00:01:46.740> which<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> somewhat<00:01:47.460> largely

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
sensitivity which is a somewhat largely

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.069 
sensitivity which is a somewhat largely
higher<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.409> faster<00:01:49.860> much<00:01:50.250> more<00:01:50.490> rapid

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
higher and faster much more rapid

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.020 
higher and faster much more rapid
sensitivity<00:01:52.079> than<00:01:52.170> mine<00:01:52.460> so<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.670> if<00:01:53.880> this
