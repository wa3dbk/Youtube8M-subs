 I welcome the guys with you Alex and I decided 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:11.250
 to record a video for those who also like 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.460
 I have a crappy computer that's not enough 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.619
 forever ram 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.109
 I rummaged through many sites looking for different 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.930
 utility programs and found a very one 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.720
 interesting shit shadow that will help 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.420
 you optimize the load on 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.630
 RAM 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.750
 The site is called Weiss Cleaner dot com 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:39.840
 here there is a download section go here 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:44.270
 and look for a utility called wise memory 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.219
 optimism click on the button 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.860

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.970
 it starts immediately and it works for 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.400

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.080

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.939
 memory and real time 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.250
 as you can see I have 2 2 gigabytes 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:38.400
 RAM is used 800 megabytes 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.400
 But if you are using it 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.399

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:49.079
 optimist optimists and systems cleared 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.390
 you only need to do this once 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.619
 before you say let's turn it on 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.719
 the computer did this optimization here 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.450
 as you can see , RAM costs have decreased 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.549
 all now this program will follow 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.280

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.599

 lag plus I cleaned the computer but this 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.850
