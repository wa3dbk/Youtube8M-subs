00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.610
 let's prepare for the meal a rich 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:41.400
 rice to the poblana 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.400
 We are going to need 2 cups of rice 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:50.180
 three poblano chiles roasted clean and in 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.850
 strips 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.100
 we are also going to need an onion 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.440
 well you already know that I am very 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.060
 exaggerated for the onion I'm going to put 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.180
 a complete but if you want 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:06.380
 put half put half too 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:09.470
 We're going to need corn kernels like 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.710
 I found it fresh corn I 'm going to occupy 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.130
 can ones 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.360
 I will also occupy a spoonful of 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:22.470
 chicken powder consommé 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.610
 we're going to need salt to taste a little 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.300
 of vegetable oil and we're going to need a 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.300
 liter of water 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.530
 the equivalent to four cups of water 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.360
 you already know that in the channel and 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.630
 we have white green yellow rice and 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.730
 red today we are going to make this rich rice to 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.750
 the population that is surely going to 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.080
 love 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.500
 I'm going to wash my rice and I'm going to put it 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.430
 to fry in a casserole with a trickle 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.450
 of oil 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.170
 I have already washed my rice 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.710
 and now I'm going to empty it in mica soles with 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.710
 oil 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.200
 and I will leave to brown 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.690
 our rice and make gold 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.140
 Now what I'm going to do is put in the 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.840
 blender glass the onion and the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.510
 poblano peppers with chicken consommé 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.510
 and a little water and I'm going to liquefy 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.120
 let's strain 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.380
 our sauce that we just made 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.380
 for our rice 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.180
 the salt 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.670
 I will also add 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.120
 little pieces of corn kernels 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.099
 I had a can I will add as 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.819
 half a can more or less because it is a 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.819
 big tin 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.530
 and I'm going to add the water 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.630
 let's cover our rice with a 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.500
 top and we come back in 10 minutes to see 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.050

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.500

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.290

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.719
