00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
know if this was actually when the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.960 
know if this was actually when the
injury<00:02:58.620> occurred<00:02:58.980> but<00:02:59.370> as<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.550> can<00:02:59.670> see<00:02:59.820> this

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
injury occurred but as you can see this

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.490 
injury occurred but as you can see this
play<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.209> bit<00:03:00.450> later<00:03:00.660> certainly<00:03:01.320> he<00:03:01.410> knew

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
play a bit later certainly he knew

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.229 
play a bit later certainly he knew
something<00:03:01.800> was<00:03:01.920> wrong<00:03:02.130> yeah<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:03.120> after

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
something was wrong yeah and after

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.790 
something was wrong yeah and after
talking<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.720> some<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:03.900> his<00:03:04.019> teammates<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.620> think

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
talking to some of his teammates I think

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.040 
talking to some of his teammates I think
they<00:03:04.920> all<00:03:05.100> felt<00:03:05.519> that<00:03:05.880> first<00:03:06.510> play<00:03:06.720> we<00:03:06.870> saw

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050

happens<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.890> responsibility<00:03:41.760> owners<00:03:42.000> for

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
happens the responsibility owners for

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.640 
happens the responsibility owners for
that<00:03:42.239> really<00:03:42.420> is<00:03:42.630> on<00:03:42.810> their<00:03:42.989> teeth<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.380> NBA

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.400 
wondered what he have the strength would
he<00:04:41.790> be<00:04:41.910> physical<00:04:42.360> enough<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:43.200> play

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
he be physical enough to play

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.350 
he be physical enough to play
international<00:04:44.070> ball<00:04:44.220> and<00:04:44.520> then<00:04:44.610> be<00:04:44.820> effective

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
international ball and then be effective

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.030 
international ball and then be effective
I<00:04:45.510> think<00:04:45.960> he<00:04:46.080> proved<00:04:46.350> a<00:04:46.500> little<00:04:46.740> bit<00:04:46.830> of<00:04:46.950> that

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
I think he proved a little bit of that

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.310 
I think he proved a little bit of that
last<00:04:47.250> night<00:04:47.490> but<00:04:48.030> this<00:04:48.570> is<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.810> much<00:04:49.080> more

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
last night but this is a much more

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.080 
last night but this is a much more
physical<00:04:49.530> game<00:04:49.950> than<00:04:50.160> people<00:04:50.460> realize<00:04:50.880> I<00:04:50.910> mean

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
physical game than people realize I mean

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.060 
physical game than people realize I mean
you<00:04:51.210> should<00:04:51.360> see<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:51.720> way<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.470> defense<00:04:52.920> is

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
you should see the way the defense is

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.980 
you should see the way the defense is
played<00:04:53.340> and<00:04:53.580> how<00:04:53.730> how<00:04:54.300> much<00:04:54.450> you<00:04:54.570> can<00:04:54.720> put<00:04:54.870> your

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
played and how how much you can put your

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.570 
played and how how much you can put your
hands<00:04:55.290> on<00:04:55.380> people<00:04:55.530> things<00:04:55.830> you<00:04:55.950> can't<00:04:56.190> do<00:04:56.370> in

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
hands on people things you can't do in

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.100 
hands on people things you can't do in
the<00:04:56.610> NBA<00:04:56.910> you<00:04:57.240> can<00:04:57.630> get<00:04:57.750> away<00:04:57.840> with

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
the NBA you can get away with

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.960 
the NBA you can get away with
defensively<00:04:58.830> international<00:04:59.490> basketball<00:04:59.610> so

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
defensively international basketball so

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
defensively international basketball so
it's<00:05:00.060> gonna<00:05:00.150> be<00:05:00.270> a<00:05:00.330> much<00:05:00.570> different

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
it's gonna be a much different

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.600 
it's gonna be a much different
transition<00:05:01.770> for<00:05:01.890> Anthony<00:05:02.160> Davis<00:05:02.400> there<00:05:02.580> I

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
transition for Anthony Davis there I

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.190 
transition for Anthony Davis there I
think<00:05:02.940> that<00:05:03.060> it<00:05:03.150> would<00:05:03.270> be<00:05:03.330> with<00:05:03.900> him<00:05:04.050> just

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
think that it would be with him just

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.300 
think that it would be with him just
coming<00:05:04.470> into<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.710> league<00:05:04.860> and<00:05:04.890> plan<00:05:05.130> for<00:05:05.160> the

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
coming into the league and plan for the

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.680 
coming into the league and plan for the
whole<00:05:05.460> certainly<00:05:05.880> this<00:05:06.000> experience<00:05:06.570> you

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
whole certainly this experience you

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.030 
whole certainly this experience you
would<00:05:06.840> think<00:05:07.080> helps<00:05:07.380> him<00:05:07.590> in<00:05:07.740> terms<00:05:07.890> of

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
would think helps him in terms of

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.010 
would think helps him in terms of
leading<00:05:08.220> this<00:05:08.370> hornets<00:05:08.790> franchise<00:05:09.270> and<00:05:09.600> and
