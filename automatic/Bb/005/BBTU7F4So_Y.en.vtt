00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.900
 waiter or is it and the lone star of smaug 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.760

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.680
 the one i love were all just stupid 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.000
 mistake you will see it when i die 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.890
 at the start I'm pretty dirty 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.300
 in addition, it weakened a bit because was 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.010
 i'm a little angry with goddamn now 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.540
 i'm a dead goddamn 2 kilo 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.340
 goddamn drink dead that is possible too 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.050
 no more so much because you are just dead 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.120
 it's about ways you know yourself 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.399
 know how you died knowing about yourself 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.930
 which caused you to die and which 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.489
 you yourself know how you could actually do it 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.379
 avoid it but so again as he 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.489
 just phuket to get but further 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.230
 game just plays behind us 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.850
 nice intensive game-play car folder 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.079
 stand if and here so I put them in the back 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.520
 and the coming so I went that ff so 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.050
 behind are simply no more lightning 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.640
 strike somewhere near the forms and comes to it 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.230
 the person I expect that 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.820
 arrived also just walk after a while 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.470
 arrive walk it arrives 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.760
 and otherwise no leaf waste just 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.439
 good through and I would like appjes again 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.850
 are going to have a few games about that 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.350
 and also just one 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.130
 bit about call of duty but chose 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.600
 of course there is more and more 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.250
 information outside and I want one 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.780
 bit my opinion about the game 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.180
 first i want a whole or you fast 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.189
 about e3 because e3 is of course just it 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.600
 greatest game guy in the whole world 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.640
 any game that will ever come out 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.170
 next year you will be promoted on that 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.759
 a trailer will be uploaded 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.170
 the game play all uploaded and actually 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.060
 it's just a kind of christmas 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.740
 for the gamers of the games that go 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.180
 you can just decide to go 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.310
 I buy that game is that game a bit 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.840
 my expectations where will the game be 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.430
 a bit cool and i can just be my 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.170
 save money to go on such a game 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.759
 and I just bought it all myself 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.799
 trailers so far from true 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.450
 viewed and there is really just view 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.799
 games in between of a few games 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.659
 always expected no fat 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.890
 words such as dead rising 3 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.240
 I knew it was kind of open 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.009
 become a world and it will be now 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.350
 dead rising 2 was of course just one 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.149
 small supermarket where you did it in member 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.920
 but dead rising 3 is just a big one 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.329
 open on so I think that is very cool 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.710
 to see and i just love sum that 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.540
 Games of course does not play alone 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.740
 but call of duty x-arc from far cry 3 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.579
 still on the place anytime you are 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.140
 still not played 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.489
 after half a year or so must decamp 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.050
 a still more time in play 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.910
 he just also plays many more games 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.300
 and games that are coming out next 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.470
 year 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.000
 look really just looked out of you 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.650
 also a little playstation 4 game 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.120
 place in between so I can do it too 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.440
 a bit all the quality check and it 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.700
 it all looks really cool 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.140
 I will probably go anyway 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.300
 buy playstation 4 because yesterday I had 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.010
 of course to upload the entire over xbox 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.750
 one or the playstation 4 but I'm here 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.310
 now just about completely gone 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.670
 because I just want to go to the Playstation 4 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.830
 to buy 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.210
 and here comes the first post 13 look 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.680
 hot cream here you must always do 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.090
 what standing around people kempen 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.680
 then the first pole looks 13 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.180
 roast but you really just go fat 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.980
 games come true i want to you too 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.150
 just ask of what to predict 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.470
 you probably buy next year 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.270
 I myself will probably very much 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.430
 buy games such as dead rising 3 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.110
 like gta5 of course that also for years 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.940
 ago that pre-judged can be a jury 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.500
 I naturally also chose a pedophile atmosphere 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.910
 who also just looks sick or am sick 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.350
 wildfire now has a lot of place in it 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.880
 and it just looks real again 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.620
 beautiful from just the sum of normal 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.970
 single player the rest also just looks 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.590
 be graphics look natural again 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.600
 beautiful and that game really works 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.120
 just come back tars tights 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.550
 how do we conclude that it was 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.620
 compiet and tar and that they just don't have any 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.060
 word more man but anyways prayed a lot 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.709
 will of course compete with again 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.060
 call of duty and in itself it is whole 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.830
 very different types of game 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.930
 of course the battlefield is just real 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.910
 an open folders super large folder all 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.290
 four goals that spin and call or 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.000
 duty is just really able to fact on 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.500
 may have fact but on one side 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.239
 play every call of duty pretty much 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.440
 paddle filter housing and every second a lot 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.820
 play you can get along 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.709
 in the house and that creates it 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.570
 competition and that is why it always sits 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.280
 from yes can studies peter no pedophile 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.900
 so better that nice the graphics that 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.000
 come up with more players online that is 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.769
 more harm can vice better and so it goes 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.060
 the heat and I buy them anyway 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.260
 just both so my making these 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.880
 don't argue 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.470
 you come to the second that fails 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.459
 thief and stately and cards it flash 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.870
 behind that window 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.610
 I could just walk back and grab him 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.170
 he just went straight for it again 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.880
 but I'm just going to buy both and 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.680
 furthermore, nature is much more super 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.239
 great games but I want to give quickly 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.170
 I have them over call or duty ghosts 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.880
 of course there is something more 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.980
 information came out and I have 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.600
 also seen a few campaign missions and 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.950
 I find it very very greasy just sing 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.030
 the graphics look nicer 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.989
 Of course, new engine 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.340
 built-in 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.780
 a new call of duty engine and it 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.489
 looks nice but I did 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.290
 just a little more the expected I think 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.000
 well not really just i radiate 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.290
 I already expected a little more from me 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.970
 actually gets back with call of duty 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.229
 and I think they just have to 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.510
 are going to change what I see now 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.460
 it's just likely again 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.990
 same as any other calf that I have 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.810
 hope the multiplayer is normal 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.280
 refresh will bring is 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.260
 will bring us and not just again 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.910
 same point 5 again 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.570
 weapons in it button only another name 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.680
 to give 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.060
 I really just hope that they have something whole 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.280
 I'm going to make news for a while 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.050
 but further on a multiplayer game play 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.760
 the single player just looks bold 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.410
 of course you have the game my dagger 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.090
 you also know the name again 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.650
 sequins cry-kane my cloth that can you 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.180
 self-controlled with such a camera on one 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.150
 back can just be behind the enemy 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.320
 enter into you need an enemy episode 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.730
 I think everyone just looked new 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.990
 future are in it again 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.580
 and of course you also have a sweetheart 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.740
 youtube everyone is coming so then you can 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.570
 you can if you are behind an obstacle 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.430
 You just have to watch your site whatever you like 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.600
 would like the computer to the left or 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.590
 look to the right and then you hang 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.570
 actually with your head 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.010
 because obstacle and I don't know if that 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.960
 will turn out well because maybe 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.760
 this really created just 10,000 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.169
 more the job is in call of duty like me 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.940
 for example, such a neighborhood, I am late 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.350
 I can only do a lot of your smoke option 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.240
 of course already shooting and so I know 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.350
 not or with it over it plus the pain 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.180
 is going to bring but that is just 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.950
 things you have to go await you 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.720
 also have that thing you left 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.190
 can jump over obstacles without too 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.110
 but to stop running so then you can 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.430
 You also just keep shooting 2 over the 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.139
 shoot a climb with a wall 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.610
 hope and that really is just kicking on 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.330
 call of duty ghosts and I am sure 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.500
 waiting for 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.210
 is certainly just waiting for 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.979
 battlefield 4 and I am used to anyway 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.240
 waiting for a new constant 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.410
 consoles are of course just seven 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.690
 released years ago 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.430
 the playstation 3 and the xbox 360 as me 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.690
 the really big wait for the playstation 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.740
 4 I'm probably going anyway 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.810
 buy playstation 4 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.729

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.320
 Now look at the things they both do 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:53.690
 have as the playstation 4 sees the lot 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.979
 think better in terms of the xbox one anyway 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.020
 I both do the science service one 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.250
 kind of cool all two designs of xbox 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.450
 one and the playstation 4 school 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.350
 sticker fridge 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.210
 you can just follow me on the ground 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.750
 tifanny things are still very so they see 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.190

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.539

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.820

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.830

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.120
