00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
strength and the highest is 181 so this

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.270 
strength and the highest is 181 so this
one<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.170> these<00:01:19.290> slightly<00:01:19.710> higher<00:01:20.009> end<00:01:20.189> of

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
one is that these slightly higher end of

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.950 
one is that these slightly higher end of
the<00:01:20.310> spectrum<00:01:20.369> but<00:01:21.119> again<00:01:21.240> that's<00:01:21.570> still<00:01:21.780> not

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
the spectrum but again that's still not

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.170 
the spectrum but again that's still not
