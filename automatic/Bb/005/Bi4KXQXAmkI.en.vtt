00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240
 Is a lion round this time Thank you for your viewing There However wear the previous 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:16.119
 I will think a little about the deck of the evil spirits 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:23.100
 The first thing we want you to be aware of is that it is mainly for beginners. 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:30.270
 If you have a character, it's not like you can afford It will try hard not to do as much as possible 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:35.010
 I Tomomi and is the First Vic-chan bow type or genie of fascination that let's review the current Genie 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:38.160
 If you guard with 4 types of shield because it is a long distance 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:44.079
 It looks like you can reduce the damage 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:49.719
 If you are a warrior, it may be a good idea to approach with the sebum at the top, so you should aim at it . 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:52.890
 It's very valuable for me because I'm status up system for skills 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:59.280
 By all means it is what you want to 4 convex 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:04.830
 Next, let's check the special attack weapon. The type of weapon is the same bow as the genie. 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:10.020
 I thought that 4 types of weapons are special attack weapons but it seems different 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:15.030
 If equipped with special attack weapons, the attack against genie will increase by 1.5 times 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.360
 If it is set to your bow type character, it will be reborn as a special attack character 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.760
 It is a thing 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.490
 As for how to get anxious, do you get it from the treasure box at the time of the demon defeat? 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:31.350
 You can get it from Genie Coins 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:37.790
 The details are still there, but you may be able to get a kill number reward as well 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.790
 Let's think about the deck to get this genie or Biku 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:48.980
 We will check with recap I was switched the screen 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:52.770
 Attack force to slayer character Falstaff nars Genie 5 times 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:58.439
 It is a character dedicated to the devil festival 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:01.880
 It is quite difficult to get, so if you can get it, it will be your friend's 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:08.720
 I hope it helps 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:11.819
 A result of the lucky thing I drew before this video created not to say that avoiding expensive during the last 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.540
 I was able to get one 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:20.470
 So let me help you with your friend 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:25.090
 It is a notification to everyone who always receives viewing comments 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:28.960
 Although I have also stated it in the comment section of the previous video, just in case 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.560
 I have stated the comment of the same contents 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.420
 Sorry to trouble you, but over Please confirm 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:40.069
 Let's go next in Yes 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.560
 Special effects Chara Foro is 1.5 times the attack on Suns Genie 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:48.890
 It is the last of the Genie 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:50.800
 I do not know the convex number, but I think that there are a lot of people, and thanks to the management like it, it is a superb attack character 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:57.430
 It is now 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:03:01.719
 Everyone who got the last try and got a bath will continue to put it on the deck 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:05.090
 There is also a special attack, but because the boss has a bow attribute 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:07.940
 City seems to be able to reduce damage 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:13.370
 Let's go next 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:16.000
 It is aire that can be acquired with the ring gacha now This special attack weapon is a bow 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:24.069
 So after the event starts 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:28.180
 If you acquire special weapons and equip them, the attack on genie will increase the attack on genie by 1.5 times 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:32.410
 Or Vic also is equipped with a weapon Once you get I heard 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:35.980
 It may be Ali that you put in the deck and you 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.240
 At first there is reason to choose these two people for the time being 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:45.960
 Skill is a parameter improvement system 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:48.670
 I will increase the attack power of allies for a certain period of time Even if the genie Ibe with a time limit , the attack power 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:53.709
 Whether there is up 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:56.180
 I think that the difference will come out surely Mr. Musica in the last event 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:01.489
 I used 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.860
 It's quite different because I can't get musica unless it's a bar. 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.320
 so 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.320
 We pick up the two above this time 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:15.170
 Then I put together a little above, but try to organize while checking your current Arcana 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:22.420
 Let's go 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:29.250
 I think people who have confidence in the operation and arms have a good fight and there is also a single-color deck with full bows. 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:29.250
 It feels like a shame that you can not use either special effects characters or weapons 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:42.789
 As I think that you can defeat even if you don't care about it while the level of the devil is low, so kill while 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:44.969
 Get coins and items and try to put them into the deck gradually 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:50.729
 thinking about 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:54.729
 Slayer Since the time rather than lose it I think that there are many patterns that escape to insufficient 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:58.150
 Character and friend parameter up skills etc 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:03.449
 Let's enjoy the Genie events from tomorrow lion 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:07.199
 By the way, I will try to slay it with such a deck at first 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:12.860
 Let's try various things while watching the situation while defeating 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.860
 At this time Thank you for your viewing on this side
