00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.840
 thomése juhasz woke up once again with a new complete variety to get you 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:15.479
 demy 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:19.999
 at the abyss deplae i fell today in tibet is a pre on the power i lost 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:23.220
 try to leave the rent that container flicker down because 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.649
 in every folder you have something you can do in the folder in turn 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.929
 I always call the WAP hopet that has stolen the very large folder 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.710
 divorce annoying, for example, let the gate down 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.350
 fall 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.700
 in this folder both forms that neighbors that sit before me you can open and close 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.710
 every folder and you do have a certain interaction that you have with the game 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.430
 could enter into that and I like that in folders when I play that way I always want too 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.479
 ethical goals only have killer and why portillo was fed up 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:51.709
 which is also always nice and now you can choose the partner to get out of it 

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:53.720
 doors to be welded shut and in i8 uefa 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.889
 what else can it do against that by approaching disney 

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:58.370
 and I like to do that in certain folders 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.830
 but today I want to get rid of you soon 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.589
 about 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:02.980
 the game system 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.650
 if you depré to the abyss I play with the vector and the vector with I set 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.840
 index 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.700
 can also be used as a show but a bit of oil coal was of course 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.469
 annoying for a semi china when japan tries to shoot the long distance 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:18.289
 but i'm nice on the streak you see i'm nice they are behind one 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.340
 myopia jier we are going to have some good hair 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.590
 nice for you not play 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.650
 and so immediately on a mental side 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.870
 Sport a few times just ineke and he would be there I am 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.130
 I killed several times in succession 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.509
 and the game system I all duels is really very unreliable the first 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.840
 after all, you can demolish premises 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.240
 almost no more in game, except for blizzcon, but still exciting 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.040
 you can just put an emmy next to what is in need at once 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.200
 what as exciting 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.729
 You should immediately check how well you are planning for the environment 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.530
 scanner what if you don't 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.710
 you just get against kill the bet so quickly to get through it so she chose 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.119
 save if you are straining there is this that can give us we are rock hard for help 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.630
 and I find on the one hand what you want but of course right now is the 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.260
 not for example anymore 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.710
 nice bah you all your team once my span sometimes alone sun spain then laymen 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.629
 when the team is to spain beside and the fog 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.689
 and between them every time again when you tense or when you walk around that you 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:17.959
 must 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.730
 Remember that there can be someone standing next to you just because someone would be there 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.659
 underprivileged 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.969
 Do you know if someone can fall next to someone and if you keep that in mind 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:26.829
 likes 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.769
 you can usually do that with a human killer 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.199
 like the ineke nasa for example 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:35.199
 keep an eye on it response system it is so unreliable too 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:36.490
 indonesia and 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.230
 indonesia is also the case that they can simply put our calculators on the table 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.039
 somewhat larger ones grumbled like stone 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.269
 they can also just go to tracks in that folder is really broken big 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.620
 that was still they can just stand for weeks for today but you have to 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.819
 just watch as a study can give 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.519
 I can't even give if they can scan it for that 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.099
 what you can stretch anywhere in the folder 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.950
 he said no more like in black ops being like a mole war 3 about twenty 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.810
 the spam spots are different but there are cannes in every folder 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.040
 of five the different span spots but because of it is also a bit 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:10.419
 different 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.189
 went to work and I haven't quite got it yet 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.529
 what it is exactly works normally with the water you know for a while 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.420
 it is now just really all I am box 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.480
 first you will be apples so I am not going very well with of course very 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.600
 quickly die what you have to get used to the game the steprace just a few 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.209
 you just stick to the things you eat, a guy and just enjoy yourself 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.570
 play the game because it is fun to play 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.230
 it is all just as well a good get used to and once they do 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.080
 throw own set up you've made 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.730
 tiger recipe also made a deep idea 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.349
 where are your weapons and teletext i am now a fiddle of 50 and i have something again 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.410
 heard new things 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.760
 then you can just go and play nicely and I was therefore quite a few things out 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.599
 from testing 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.799
 for example, I have a panel at the end of the future 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.229
 is just a new type of helicopter and all sutil can collectively 4 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:58.219
 kallo stunt team 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:59.869
 nol war 2 to 3 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:03.899
 on black ops 2 that was all zever suspend league but now it's a one 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:08.759
 suspended I heard they must get 9 score points for the leg and if you like 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.860
 there they look but heikki on danny really a lot 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.879
 that is also thanks to that many folders 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.310
 so houses have such a bee going up in the air and it is all in 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.749
 the houses are 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:22.009
 I will therefore not recommend to use 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.349
 but you can of course just turn on to see if you might be what you or 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:25.660
 not 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.520
 but we also have to look at the complete messi sees the mowing scores 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.590
 26 out of 6 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.219
 not the best score but it happened that I got exciting a couple of times it works 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:36.509
 at least i'm straining beside and iniesta i'm not going to do very much but by 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.339
 the fire look people were giving white whites for more chance is dead 

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:43.059
 check mowing channel then already sir for more never allow more recipes for 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.400
 now 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.540
 still found dwm
