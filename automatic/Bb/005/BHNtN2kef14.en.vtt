what<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> did<00:00:42.079> was<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> cut<00:00:43.410> one<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.680> these

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
what I did was I cut one of these

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.319 
what I did was I cut one of these
bottles<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.309> half<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.260> then<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:47.180> turn<00:00:48.180> it

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329

upside<00:00:48.719> down<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:52.430> then<00:00:53.430> put<00:00:53.670> sugar<00:00:53.969> water<00:00:54.270> in

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
upside down and then put sugar water in

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.830 
upside down and then put sugar water in
there

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
there

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.160 
there
I<00:00:54.870> used<00:00:55.140> Gatorade<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:57.059> they<00:00:57.420> fly<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.930> there

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
I used Gatorade and they fly in there

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.799 
I used Gatorade and they fly in there
and<00:00:58.530> then<00:00:59.250> they<00:00:59.399> can't<00:00:59.670> find<00:01:00.329> their<00:01:00.510> way<00:01:00.539> out

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
and then they can't find their way out

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.260 
and then they can't find their way out
anyway<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:02.340> that's<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:03.769> also<00:01:05.000> dirt<00:01:06.000> and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
anyway so that's that also dirt and

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.500 
anyway so that's that also dirt and
stuff<00:01:06.479> can<00:01:06.659> add<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.200> your<00:01:07.350> sheets<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.510> in

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
your pillowcases and all that so it's

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.060 
your pillowcases and all that so it's
always<00:01:12.780> good<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:12.990> take<00:01:13.229> them<00:01:13.409> out<00:01:13.530> shake<00:01:13.890> them

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
and then leave them off in the Sun for a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.640 
and then leave them off in the Sun for a
bit<00:01:17.310> because<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.570> Sun<00:01:18.869> kills<00:01:19.259> bacteria<00:01:21.650> and

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
bit because the Sun kills bacteria and

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.800 
bit because the Sun kills bacteria and
it's<00:01:23.340> always<00:01:23.490> good<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.790> stay<00:01:24.119> nice<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.390> clean
