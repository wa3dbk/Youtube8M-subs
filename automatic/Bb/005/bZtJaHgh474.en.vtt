 video in this case of good eyes that 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.550
 approximate the birds that are about to say 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.500
 well advertised for what 2014 is worth 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.010

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.890
 that other extremes of ego do not even deny 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.879
 the sound but the computer this game 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.460
 of July 29 in the USA and July 30 in 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.110
 europe I believe and well here we are going to 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.329
 start with the indices with a lot of nothing 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.860
 you will not like it but put it 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.040
 there is an announced for July 21 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.720
 that shut that gas and 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.120
 alva helling part of the seven in 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.210
 you can see most of 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.600
 good sindics that are index most 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.630
 although good of all those in 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.000
 that are about ten are fiscal and for 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.640
 put it like that and most are indexes 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.160
 but with good eyes like you can 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.500
 be for example this one a sonic type 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.520
 something predicted what never enters 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.140
 mega 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.840
 megatone edition this game be good 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.190
 well that's it, I had not left in 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.210
 principle between that I'm wrong 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:42.000
 I was in the game of videogames 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.520
 those who have been playing for a long time go to 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.200
 know what wave 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.200
 energy I play 4 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:56.990
 faith princess I think this and this 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:59.270
 that is, cousin see 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.579
 the greatest action and here says the freedom 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.909
 works that those who follow the games 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.799
 Japanese so to speak where to know 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.840
 the game is good I do not know that it's about 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.230
 the truth never seen in images that 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.150
 the vx has never come out we are here 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.390
 several strategy games so kind 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.849
 clash of plants for good so 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.000
 give an example the young man who is the 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.580
 typical pixelated monkey marked yesterday 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.459
 marx that we have a game japan or 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.850
 Japanese Chinese or whatever the big faith is 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.090
 that for this game the gamescom passed 3 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.580
 Montoro very well but it was that you have 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.580
 a musical band so to speak 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:46.180
 and you take him to concerts will continue 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.400
 bigger and things like that and other games 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.760
 I do not know what it is either yes 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.900
 guardians of good strategy and we will 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.640
 give work to be a game 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.799
 recognized of the very best star alliance 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.090
 one of the games that worked the most 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.889
 the foot spin or psp as you want to tell 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.210
 jungers this game I think a movie 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:09.690
 if there is a movie on mobile youtube 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:13.100
 clint eastwood be a young grid 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.540
 typical diego batman beyond hotmail and 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.640
 good it raised that always the same as 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.270
 There are six chapters and each chapter in 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.960
 half an hour 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.970
 It deals with deals that, by the way, this one 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.380
 had served came van controls for 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.720
 who had them the year ancestor I think 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.660
 what would be 'green lantern' batman robin 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.910
 superman among other things the software 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.590
 no nastic is born that is more hot 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.840
 Japanese Chinese then if I say 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.600
 remind me of my own or say it was 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.040
 blame that is to say billion trees in the 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.390
 zone rainbow that explains how they can 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.260
 see greater sounds as the 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.420
 beginning 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.439

 how we do here the walking dead man 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.699

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.259
 wolfe-simon sour cherries forging at best 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.070
 some who are all here have already 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:29.780
 the navelgas mule 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.500

 fisherman a p 1511 a gta or something for the 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:47.080
 style and I doubt we will give work 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:51.789
 it's not indie group game 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:54.550
 although most of the majority but the 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:57.900
 most are japs and they are more or less 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.900
 with one or the other is the same 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:05.610
