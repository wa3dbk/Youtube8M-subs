00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
you can see it over on the horizon let's

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.359 
you can see it over on the horizon let's
try<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:26.920> zoom<00:01:27.070> up<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.430> bit<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:31.570> that<00:01:32.219> kind<00:01:33.219> of

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
try and zoom up a bit it's that kind of

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:34.980 
try and zoom up a bit it's that kind of
a<00:01:33.430> blackest<00:01:34.060> thing<00:01:34.210> over<00:01:34.420> there<00:01:34.540> so<00:01:34.719> it's

one<00:01:47.710> end<00:01:48.930> there's<00:01:49.930> no<00:01:50.079> safety<00:01:50.380> on<00:01:50.680> this<00:01:50.920> so

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
one end there's no safety on this so

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.440 
one end there's no safety on this so
that's<00:01:51.310> why<00:01:51.460> I<00:01:51.579> didn't<00:01:51.820> want<00:01:51.939> to<00:01:52.000> keep<00:01:52.210> it<00:01:52.360> low

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
that's why I didn't want to keep it low

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.039 
that's why I didn't want to keep it low
until<00:01:52.689> right<00:01:52.869> now<00:01:52.899> here<00:01:53.680> we<00:01:53.740> go

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
until right now here we go

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.660 
until right now here we go
come<00:01:56.049> to<00:01:56.170> stay<00:01:56.289> a<00:01:56.320> little<00:01:56.500> bit<00:01:56.799> it<00:01:57.310> only<00:01:57.490> has

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
come to stay a little bit it only has

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.279 
come to stay a little bit it only has
iron<00:01:57.909> sights<00:01:58.240> so<00:01:58.360> with<00:01:58.479> iron<00:01:58.659> sights<00:01:58.899> this<00:01:59.170> is

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
iron sights so with iron sights this is

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.270 
iron sights so with iron sights this is
going<00:01:59.409> to<00:01:59.470> be<00:01:59.530> really<00:01:59.710> tough<00:01:59.890> because<00:02:00.009> most

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
going to be really tough because most

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.160 
going to be really tough because most
people<00:02:00.520> matter<00:02:00.759> scope<00:02:01.060> on<00:02:01.210> this<00:02:01.360> foot<00:02:06.030> okay

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
people matter scope on this foot okay

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.979 
people matter scope on this foot okay
try<00:02:08.670> another<00:02:09.670> one<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:10.269> one<00:02:10.450> may<00:02:10.599> have<00:02:10.720> fallen

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
try another one that one may have fallen

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.460 
try another one that one may have fallen
a<00:02:11.140> little<00:02:11.319> short<00:02:12.090> right<00:02:13.090> now<00:02:13.120> I'm<00:02:13.390> about<00:02:13.630> 100

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
a little short right now I'm about 100

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.280 
a little short right now I'm about 100
yards<00:02:15.090> maybe<00:02:16.090> slightly<00:02:16.480> more<00:02:16.630> away<00:02:16.989> from<00:02:17.200> my

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
yards maybe slightly more away from my

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:25.410 
yards maybe slightly more away from my
target<00:02:17.560> so

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.350

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.750 

all<00:02:47.900> right<00:02:48.080> let's<00:02:48.740> go<00:02:48.920> collect<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.610> other

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:12.969 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:18.819 

as<00:03:14.139> you<00:03:15.139> can<00:03:15.290> see<00:03:16.299> did<00:03:17.299> then<00:03:18.019> are<00:03:18.230> really<00:03:18.680> on

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.610 
as you can see did then are really on
that<00:03:19.010> line<00:03:19.249> very<00:03:19.700> proud<00:03:20.030> of<00:03:20.060> it<00:03:20.359> it<00:03:21.079> did<00:03:21.290> really

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
that line very proud of it it did really

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.789 
that line very proud of it it did really
good<00:03:23.139> unfortunately<00:03:24.139> it<00:03:24.230> seems<00:03:24.439> that<00:03:24.620> the

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
good unfortunately it seems that the

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.569 
good unfortunately it seems that the
Nerf<00:03:25.489> dart<00:03:26.239> went<00:03:26.510> all<00:03:26.629> the<00:03:26.659> way<00:03:26.780> through<00:03:27.579> so

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
Nerf dart went all the way through so

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.339 
Nerf dart went all the way through so
you<00:03:29.090> know<00:03:29.180> it's<00:03:29.359> a<00:03:29.420> bit<00:03:29.540> more<00:03:29.689> powerful<00:03:30.049> than<00:03:30.290> I

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
you know it's a bit more powerful than I

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.319 
you know it's a bit more powerful than I
thought<00:03:30.560> would<00:03:30.739> be<00:03:30.829> especially<00:03:31.069> at<00:03:31.370> 125<00:03:32.150> yards

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
thought would be especially at 125 yards

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.209 
thought would be especially at 125 yards
I<00:03:32.599> really<00:03:33.109> didn't<00:03:33.319> expect<00:03:33.680> it<00:03:33.799> to<00:03:33.829> do<00:03:34.040> that

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:34.219 
I really didn't expect it to do that

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:36.729 
I really didn't expect it to do that
kind<00:03:34.459> of<00:03:34.519> damage<00:03:34.790> that<00:03:35.269> first<00:03:35.900> shot<00:03:36.109> was<00:03:36.290> way

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
kind of damage that first shot was way

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.559 
kind of damage that first shot was way
low<00:03:37.159> I<00:03:37.219> I<00:03:37.459> don't<00:03:37.639> know<00:03:37.700> if<00:03:37.819> I<00:03:37.879> didn't<00:03:38.150> see<00:03:38.540> it

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
low I I don't know if I didn't see it

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.330 
low I I don't know if I didn't see it
the<00:03:38.689> darting<00:03:39.109> good<00:03:39.319> enough<00:03:39.530> but<00:03:40.069> I'm<00:03:40.189> really

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
the darting good enough but I'm really

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.090 
the darting good enough but I'm really
surprised<00:03:40.730> at<00:03:40.879> the<00:03:40.939> power<00:03:41.180> of<00:03:41.329> this<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:43.090> Wow
