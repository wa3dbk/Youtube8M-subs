00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
brown side but a 2 is too light so I

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.950 
brown side but a 2 is too light so I
just<00:04:38.070> went<00:04:38.250> with<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.430> 1b<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:39.720> wasn't

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
just went with the 1b and it wasn't

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.600 
just went with the 1b and it wasn't
pretty<00:04:40.350> well<00:04:40.710> have<00:04:41.070> to<00:04:41.280> say<00:04:41.460> myself<00:04:43.430> this<00:04:44.430> is

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
pretty well have to say myself this is

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.370 
pretty well have to say myself this is
what<00:04:44.640> it<00:04:44.880> looks<00:04:45.120> like<00:04:45.240> so<00:04:45.690> I'm<00:04:45.870> thinking<00:04:46.260> the

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
what it looks like so I'm thinking the

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.700 
what it looks like so I'm thinking the
one<00:04:46.560> day<00:04:46.940> looks<00:04:47.940> pretty<00:04:48.360> good

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.850 

so<00:04:53.490> that's<00:04:54.270> basically<00:04:54.479> all<00:04:54.810> I<00:04:55.020> can<00:04:55.350> think<00:04:55.380> of

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
so that's basically all I can think of

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.960 
so that's basically all I can think of
right<00:04:56.130> now<00:04:57.860> further<00:04:58.860> than<00:04:59.130> my<00:04:59.250> edges<00:04:59.669> I<00:04:59.820> use

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
right now further than my edges I use

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
layering on towards the front and like

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.630 
layering on towards the front and like
on<00:06:12.780> the<00:06:12.990> sides<00:06:13.260> of<00:06:13.560> the<00:06:13.680> hair<00:06:13.920> but<00:06:14.160> other<00:06:14.370> than

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
on the sides of the hair but other than

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.120 
on the sides of the hair but other than
that<00:06:14.730> there's<00:06:15.150> no<00:06:15.420> real<00:06:15.770> cutting<00:06:16.770> that<00:06:16.950> has

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
that there's no real cutting that has

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.880 
that there's no real cutting that has
been<00:06:17.310> done<00:06:17.520> to<00:06:17.550> the<00:06:17.850> hair<00:06:18.060> so<00:06:18.470> this<00:06:19.470> is<00:06:19.680> just

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
been done to the hair so this is just

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.380 
been done to the hair so this is just
what<00:06:20.040> the<00:06:20.160> hair<00:06:20.340> looks<00:06:20.550> like<00:06:20.730> so<00:06:21.090> now

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.390 
what the hair looks like so now

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.980 
what the hair looks like so now
basically<00:06:22.220> for<00:06:23.220> the<00:06:23.280> most<00:06:23.460> part<00:06:23.730> well<00:06:24.480> I<00:06:24.600> can't

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
basically for the most part well I can't

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.390 
basically for the most part well I can't
really<00:06:25.110> think<00:06:25.200> of<00:06:25.410> anything<00:06:25.710> else<00:06:26.100> that's

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
really think of anything else that's

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.350 
really think of anything else that's
what<00:06:26.640> I<00:06:26.730> grabbed<00:06:27.030> the<00:06:27.180> texture<00:06:27.600> this<00:06:28.440> hair

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
what I grabbed the texture this hair

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.690 
what I grabbed the texture this hair
it's<00:06:30.360> running<00:06:31.170> here<00:06:31.440> so<00:06:31.800> it's<00:06:32.160> very<00:06:32.310> straight

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
it's running here so it's very straight

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.820 
it's running here so it's very straight
it<00:06:35.700> is<00:06:36.000> so<00:06:36.540> key<00:06:36.840> but<00:06:37.290> it's<00:06:37.470> a<00:06:37.560> little<00:06:37.710> more

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
it is so key but it's a little more

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.350 
it is so key but it's a little more
thick<00:06:38.460> so<00:06:39.060> if<00:06:39.540> you<00:06:39.750> have<00:06:40.080> a<00:06:40.110> hair<00:06:40.590> like<00:06:40.830> mine<00:06:41.100> or

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
thick so if you have a hair like mine or

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.270 
thick so if you have a hair like mine or
natural<00:06:42.360> hair<00:06:42.660> if<00:06:42.960> you<00:06:43.380> make<00:06:43.560> your<00:06:43.770> hair<00:06:43.980> good

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
natural hair if you make your hair good

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.040 
natural hair if you make your hair good
press<00:06:44.640> and<00:06:44.910> flat<00:06:45.210> iron<00:06:45.480> in<00:06:45.600> it<00:06:45.780> it<00:06:46.020> should

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
press and flat iron in it it should

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.750 
press and flat iron in it it should
blend<00:06:46.530> in<00:06:46.710> because<00:06:46.890> my<00:06:47.190> hair<00:06:47.460> is<00:06:47.490> natural<00:06:48.000> and

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:49.760 
blend in because my hair is natural and

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.510 
blend in because my hair is natural and
this<00:06:50.760> hair<00:06:51.060> is<00:06:51.210> silky<00:06:51.480> or<00:06:52.410> whatever<00:06:52.770> but<00:06:53.160> it

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
this hair is silky or whatever but it

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:01.040 
this hair is silky or whatever but it
still<00:06:53.910> blends<00:06:54.210> in<00:06:54.450> really<00:06:54.480> well<00:06:59.450> so<00:07:00.450> that's<00:07:00.810> it

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
still blends in really well so that's it

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.720 
still blends in really well so that's it
for<00:07:01.260> this<00:07:01.380> review<00:07:01.620> like<00:07:02.070> I<00:07:02.190> said<00:07:02.430> it<00:07:02.520> was<00:07:02.610> just
