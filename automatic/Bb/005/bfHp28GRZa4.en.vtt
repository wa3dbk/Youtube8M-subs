00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 This is Jack 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 When everything is in this planet, when it becomes a real body, the gold is also realized, and the problem comes out. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 It is when they perceive that if this becomes the extreme reality, they cannot access it. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Here, they need a plan, which is why Yanu went to these Atlantis and said: Listen 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 We have a problem, because everything is starting to materialize and the process will be realized. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 I am 'affirmative' - one day, we will reconnect here without discrimination, and this is 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 The same 'will also' brings us an opportunity that will always exist. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Of course, these Atlanteans 'love' their planet, because this is them, this planet is like them. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Is a performance of them, and this is being materialized, but they are not, they 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Really think that they will also be materialized together, because they belong to this planet, and 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 They don't understand why this is the case, followed by these Atlanteans: 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Ok, you can, you can materialize your plan, let us see how you make it. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 And then we will revisit it, now, to Yannu, he knows: Pulling, fucking 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 He has a problem because he needs gold. If he has no gold, he can't exist. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 And this will be a problem, because he is spatially trans-dimensional, and does not have to be materialized. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 It’s these gold that are materialized, he needs to realize his city here on earth, he must 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 He must ask for it, and tell him that he will do whatever he can, it is very interesting, because this is 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 He is more important than anything else, he knows he needs gold to exist, because gold (laughs) 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 They believe that gold is the ability to give them a continuation of existence, can be transformed (shape-shift) 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Keep waiting like 'what is their truth?' is from gold | they are converted from gold, if they don't have gold 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 They are waste, they will be worthless, they will die 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Now, you may be asking these types of people to come from there? Let us talk about this question - from these Atlanteans 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 These Atlanteans have a very fascinating pattern, which is almost like these types of people. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 However, it is taller, taller, more slender, all, male and female are moderately reasonable and are slim. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 They have feet, they have their hands - they are very beautiful, they are really beautiful people 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Gorgeous, innocent, perfect (laugh) is this kind of person you see in an instant 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Imagine, I am sure - sorry, I just need to substitute this way a bit to explain to you 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 I am sure that men see women sometimes, now this is even for men, there is this experience. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 This is the 'male' I have seen there, out of the performance of these Atlantis, if you see one 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 The woman is walking and you just look at her, and you seem to be (shocked) 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 And everything is 'pause' for a moment, and the only thing that exists in that moment is this woman. 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 I walked there - like this, I definitely have a lot of men who have had such an experience. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 They can’t help but stare at this woman, it’s like, to a certain extent, being 'fascinated’ 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 Like you have been given some spells, this is what I experienced when I looked at these Atlanteans. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 I am not, in essence, watching these are male | female levies, this is just their presence, which is simply 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Dramatic, you know, they are doing everything, it’s all sound - Imagine a materialized 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 The movement of sound, the flow of sound, this sound when they are communicating 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Their faces, yes, so, in other words (laughs) I just remembered these 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Therefore, this human material form is derived from the patterns of these Atlanteans, these Atlanteans, and 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 There is another planet, its shape, I will say, it is from these Atlanteans, though 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 This is a qualitative (post) type, which is more detailed - the modified type is derived from another planet because 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 They noticed that they need a comfortable 'type' to follow them, so that they can be comfortable | easy to move around 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Because they perceive that they need to develop a vessel, one can support 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 When they are on this earth, now, this 'program' is basically purely made of this utensil, so that you can go 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Move inside and walk around - oh, my God, this is almost the same as this connection (laugh), like moving inside 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 And follow the process that has to be done, and then move it back, but this is the same 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Unsuccessful, because these golds are constantly starting to be real, and this is straight 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 If they take this gold from here and move it into cross-dimensional space, it won't work - because it doesn't work like this directly. 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Therefore, Yannu said: I will deal with this later, let me focus on designing a vessel, a certain type. 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 And this is when Enki and Enlil are on the scene. Now, Ennier is more developed and designed. 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 These - let me call this, for example: What would be this material utensil really necessary 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 So that it can be supported on this solid body planet? You know, for example, you have these hairs growing 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 What is the function of your character on your physical body - your eyes, your eye cover, yours - like these, head lice 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 Out of this real female | male real body, like these vagina and these penis - no longer exists 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 At first, this pure cockroach is really just a straight line of real body, you will not see, like, these elbows 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 This (arm) is basically straight, however, it can be toggled 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 This is just a dynamic, you don't have these elbows here. 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 These hands were also very straight at the time, very strong, really, even bigger than the materialized body itself. 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 This head is just a normal round head, you have eyes, of course 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Ok, I will continue in my next visit, thank you all.
