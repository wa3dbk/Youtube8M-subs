00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
you can build from there so we'll take a

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.589 
you can build from there so we'll take a
look<00:00:27.550> at<00:00:27.699> our<00:00:27.789> concept<00:00:28.210> here<00:00:28.329> we're<00:00:28.419> going<00:00:28.539> to

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
look at our concept here we're going to

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.029 
look at our concept here we're going to
take<00:00:28.720> a<00:00:28.749> look<00:00:28.929> at<00:00:29.079> our<00:00:29.199> at<00:00:29.380> our<00:00:29.499> stick<00:00:29.800> side

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
take a look at our at our stick side

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.970 
take a look at our at our stick side
first<00:00:31.200> so<00:00:32.200> we'll<00:00:32.349> talk<00:00:32.439> about<00:00:32.590> our<00:00:32.739> stick

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
first so we'll talk about our stick

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.709 
first so we'll talk about our stick
route<00:00:33.190> first<00:00:33.970> so<00:00:34.180> that<00:00:34.210> comes<00:00:34.480> from<00:00:34.629> the

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
route first so that comes from the

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.180 
route first so that comes from the
number<00:00:34.960> two<00:00:35.109> spot<00:00:35.260> here<00:00:35.590> on<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:35.739> stick<00:00:35.980> side

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
number two spot here on the stick side

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.069 
number two spot here on the stick side
so<00:00:36.820> whether<00:00:37.180> he's<00:00:37.390> going<00:00:37.510> to<00:00:37.570> be<00:00:37.660> an<00:00:37.719> attached

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
so whether he's going to be an attached

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.169 
so whether he's going to be an attached
tight<00:00:38.410> end<00:00:38.680> or<00:00:39.190> is<00:00:39.370> going<00:00:39.489> to<00:00:39.550> be<00:00:39.609> a<00:00:39.699> detached

00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:40.179

stretch here between two and three and

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.180 
stretch here between two and three and
three<00:00:47.379> is<00:00:47.440> usually<00:00:47.710> coming<00:00:47.859> from<00:00:48.039> the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
as you look across this field it's a

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.850

defense now from a quarterback
progression<00:02:05.410> standpoint<00:02:05.860> comes<00:02:06.700> up<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:06.910> the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
progression standpoint comes up to the

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.719 
progression standpoint comes up to the
line<00:02:07.240> obviously<00:02:07.780> it's<00:02:07.870> reading<00:02:08.700> safeties<00:02:09.700> and

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
line obviously it's reading safeties and

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.430 
line obviously it's reading safeties and
coverages<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.600> just<00:02:10.750> trying<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.110> figure<00:02:11.260> out

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
coverages and just trying to figure out

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.200 
coverages and just trying to figure out
what's<00:02:11.680> going<00:02:11.980> on<00:02:12.070> his<00:02:12.550> first<00:02:12.970> thought

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
what's going on his first thought

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.160 
what's going on his first thought
process<00:02:13.750> is

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
process is

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.860 
process is
can<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.620> get<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.340> football<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.690> hitch

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
can you get the football to the hitch

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.809 
can you get the football to the hitch
route<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.710> we<00:02:17.830> just<00:02:17.980> call<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.340> take<00:02:18.610> it

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
route and we just call that a take it

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.670 
route and we just call that a take it
it's<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.330> must<00:02:19.600> take<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:19.990> if<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.200> have<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.590> if

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
it's a must take it if you have it if

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.410 
it's a must take it if you have it if
you've<00:02:20.800> got<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:20.980> soft<00:02:21.280> corner<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.940> if<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:22.330> got

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
you've got a soft corner and if you got

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.850 
you've got a soft corner and if you got
a<00:02:22.480> lever<00:02:22.720> defender<00:02:23.140> that's<00:02:23.290> playing<00:02:23.560> inside

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
a lever defender that's playing inside

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.559 
a lever defender that's playing inside
of<00:02:23.980> number<00:02:24.190> two<00:02:24.370> let's<00:02:24.940> take<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.360> hitch

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
of number two let's take that hitch

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:26.940 
of number two let's take that hitch
until<00:02:25.810> they<00:02:25.990> don't<00:02:26.170> give<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.590> us<00:02:26.620> anymore

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
until they don't give it to us anymore

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.460 
until they don't give it to us anymore
if<00:02:27.850> that's<00:02:28.120> not<00:02:28.300> part<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.780> equation

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
if that's not part of the equation

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.050 
if that's not part of the equation
it's<00:02:29.740> all<00:02:29.950> right<00:02:30.130> here<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.430> way<00:02:30.550> we've<00:02:30.820> been

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
it's all right here the way we've been

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.790 
it's all right here the way we've been

good quick game footwork which here we
use<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.959> rocker<00:02:44.260> step<00:02:44.970> where<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.000> rocker<00:02:46.360> step

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
use a rocker step where the rocker step

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.990 
use a rocker step where the rocker step
get<00:02:47.020> his<00:02:47.110> eyes<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.400> flat<00:02:48.610> area<00:02:48.910> and

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
see if this tailback or this number

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.220 
see if this tailback or this number
three<00:02:51.160> spot<00:02:51.280> can<00:02:52.030> outflank<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.810> defense

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
three spot can outflank the defense

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.380 
three spot can outflank the defense
immediately<00:02:53.739> if<00:02:54.250> he<00:02:54.370> does<00:02:54.519> then<00:02:55.060> we<00:02:55.180> get<00:02:55.269> the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
immediately if he does then we get the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.270 
immediately if he does then we get the
football<00:02:55.600> here<00:02:56.050> if<00:02:56.200> he's<00:02:56.680> getting<00:02:56.830> squeezed

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
football here if he's getting squeezed

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.040 
football here if he's getting squeezed
with<00:02:57.430> leverage<00:02:57.760> right<00:02:57.970> here<00:02:58.180> now<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.480> window

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
with leverage right here now the window

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.040 
with leverage right here now the window
gets<00:02:59.769> created<00:03:00.160> here<00:03:00.400> for<00:03:00.910> our<00:03:01.000> stick<00:03:01.269> wrap<00:03:01.480> so

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
gets created here for our stick wrap so

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.780 
gets created here for our stick wrap so
it's<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.230> very<00:03:02.440> easy<00:03:02.530> concept<00:03:02.920> I<00:03:03.370> think<00:03:03.700> it's

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
it's a very easy concept I think it's

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.979 
it's a very easy concept I think it's
something<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.090> can<00:03:04.300> use<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.480> lot<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.810> different

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
something you can use a lot of different

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.320 
something you can use a lot of different
formations<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:05.800> can<00:03:05.950> use<00:03:06.130> motion<00:03:06.640> but<00:03:07.090> in<00:03:07.209> the

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
formations you can use motion but in the

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.150 
formations you can use motion but in the
end<00:03:07.480> you've<00:03:08.110> got<00:03:08.260> guys<00:03:08.440> going<00:03:08.769> to<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.890> same

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
end you've got guys going to the same

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.580 
end you've got guys going to the same
spots<00:03:09.489> no<00:03:09.670> matter<00:03:09.850> what<00:03:10.350> formation<00:03:11.350> you<00:03:11.410> use

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
spots no matter what formation you use

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.070 
spots no matter what formation you use
in<00:03:11.739> or<00:03:11.950> motion<00:03:12.370> adjustments<00:03:12.880> but<00:03:13.390> from<00:03:13.989> the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
in or motion adjustments but from the

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.720 
in or motion adjustments but from the
standpoint<00:03:14.320> the<00:03:14.650> quarterback<00:03:15.070> can<00:03:15.489> you<00:03:15.610> get

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
standpoint the quarterback can you get

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.270 
standpoint the quarterback can you get
the<00:03:15.820> football<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.450> ticket<00:03:16.810> if<00:03:17.350> not<00:03:17.680> he's

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
the football to the ticket if not he's

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.910 
the football to the ticket if not he's
going<00:03:18.430> arrow<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:19.030> stick<00:03:19.329> as<00:03:20.140> your<00:03:20.440> quarterback

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
going arrow to stick as your quarterback

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.430 
going arrow to stick as your quarterback
advances<00:03:21.670> versus<00:03:22.329> some<00:03:22.510> man<00:03:22.750> teams<00:03:23.079> obviously

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
advances versus some man teams obviously

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.410 
advances versus some man teams obviously
if<00:03:23.860> you've<00:03:24.220> got<00:03:24.370> press<00:03:24.700> man<00:03:24.970> here<00:03:25.239> and<00:03:25.329> it's

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
if you've got press man here and it's

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.720 
if you've got press man here and it's
one<00:03:25.600> high<00:03:25.840> this<00:03:26.410> thing<00:03:26.590> is<00:03:26.650> gonna<00:03:26.769> convert<00:03:27.280> to

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
one high this thing is gonna convert to

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.150 
one high this thing is gonna convert to
either<00:03:27.880> a<00:03:28.030> fade<00:03:28.390> or<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.750> go<00:03:29.049> and<00:03:29.320> then<00:03:29.890> here

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
either a fade or to a go and then here

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.590 
either a fade or to a go and then here
this<00:03:30.340> thing<00:03:30.519> is<00:03:30.579> going<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:30.850> turn<00:03:31.000> into<00:03:31.030> a

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
this thing is going to turn into a

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.270 
this thing is going to turn into a
bounce<00:03:32.049> and<00:03:32.380> that's<00:03:32.530> where<00:03:32.709> this<00:03:32.829> guy<00:03:33.040> can

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
bounce and that's where this guy can

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.310 
bounce and that's where this guy can
become<00:03:33.519> an<00:03:33.640> option<00:03:34.120> I<00:03:34.269> think<00:03:34.959> there's<00:03:35.290> a

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
become an option I think there's a

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.660 
become an option I think there's a
little<00:03:35.500> bit<00:03:35.590> more<00:03:35.620> teaching<00:03:36.160> to<00:03:36.280> go<00:03:36.400> with<00:03:36.519> that

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
little bit more teaching to go with that

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.310 
little bit more teaching to go with that
but<00:03:36.850> I<00:03:36.940> think<00:03:37.150> from<00:03:37.600> a<00:03:37.660> standpoint<00:03:37.900> whether

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
but I think from a standpoint whether

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.600 
but I think from a standpoint whether
you're<00:03:38.530> in<00:03:38.799> youth<00:03:39.010> football<00:03:39.220> high<00:03:39.579> school

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
you're in youth football high school

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.210 
you're in youth football high school
football<00:03:39.880> I<00:03:40.480> think<00:03:40.690> you<00:03:40.930> teach<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:41.350> as<00:03:41.530> you

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
football I think you teach it as you

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.300 
football I think you teach it as you
take<00:03:42.730> this<00:03:43.180> right<00:03:43.450> here<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.780> hitch<00:03:43.959> route

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
take this right here and the hitch route

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.190 
take this right here and the hitch route
immediately<00:03:45.310> if<00:03:45.549> you<00:03:45.610> have<00:03:45.790> it<00:03:46.180> if<00:03:46.570> not<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:47.110> go

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
immediately if you have it if not you go

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.140 
immediately if you have it if not you go
arrow<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.950> stick

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.120 

I<00:03:51.180> just<00:03:52.170> want<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.410> break<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:52.680> down<00:03:52.740> a<00:03:52.920> little

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
I just want to break this down a little

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.890 
I just want to break this down a little
bit<00:03:53.280> more<00:03:53.550> here<00:03:54.060> as<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.240> can<00:03:54.360> see<00:03:54.570> we're<00:03:54.780> only

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
bit more here as you can see we're only

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.720 
bit more here as you can see we're only
gonna<00:03:55.050> take<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.260> look<00:03:55.470> at<00:03:55.590> our<00:03:55.680> stick<00:03:56.040> in<00:03:56.460> our<00:03:56.610> in

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
gonna take a look at our stick in our in

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.220 
gonna take a look at our stick in our in
our<00:03:56.820> tailback<00:03:57.210> coming<00:03:57.750> from<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:57.990> number

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
our tailback coming from the number

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.930 
our tailback coming from the number
three<00:03:58.440> spot<00:03:58.560> getting<00:03:58.980> out<00:03:59.070> into<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.460> flat<00:03:59.580> I

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
three spot getting out into the flat I

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.850 
three spot getting out into the flat I
think<00:04:00.270> some<00:04:00.390> key<00:04:00.750> coaching<00:04:01.200> points<00:04:01.500> we'll

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
think some key coaching points we'll

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.770 
think some key coaching points we'll
start<00:04:02.160> with<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.400> stick<00:04:02.640> route<00:04:02.850> obviously<00:04:03.660> if

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
start with the stick route obviously if

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.030 
start with the stick route obviously if
you're<00:04:03.900> not<00:04:04.050> gonna<00:04:04.170> be<00:04:04.350> an<00:04:04.440> attached<00:04:04.770> tight

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
you're not gonna be an attached tight

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.320 
you're not gonna be an attached tight
end<00:04:05.190> you're<00:04:05.280> gonna<00:04:05.370> be<00:04:05.550> a<00:04:05.580> detached<00:04:05.940> tighten

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
end you're gonna be a detached tighten

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.850 
end you're gonna be a detached tighten
you<00:04:06.720> don't<00:04:06.930> want<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.170> remove<00:04:07.440> yourself<00:04:07.590> from

gonna find the window just when you spit
yourself<00:04:27.900> out<00:04:28.080> it<00:04:28.290> could<00:04:28.440> happen<00:04:28.620> in<00:04:28.890> one<00:04:29.160> yard

yourself out it could happen in one yard
it<00:04:29.640> can<00:04:29.760> happen<00:04:29.880> at<00:04:30.120> two<00:04:30.330> three<00:04:30.690> four<00:04:31.170> but

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.040 
it can happen at two three four but
you're<00:04:32.730> not<00:04:32.880> it's<00:04:33.180> not<00:04:33.330> gonna<00:04:33.600> be<00:04:33.810> a

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
you're not it's not gonna be a

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.620 
you're not it's not gonna be a
continuous<00:04:34.950> fluid<00:04:35.220> out<00:04:35.790> route<00:04:36.180> with<00:04:36.480> that

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
continuous fluid out route with that

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.510 
continuous fluid out route with that
stick<00:04:36.900> route<00:04:37.110> now<00:04:37.710> taking<00:04:38.130> a<00:04:38.190> look<00:04:38.220> at<00:04:38.430> this

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
stick route now taking a look at this

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.950 
stick route now taking a look at this
arrow<00:04:38.790> route<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.240> number<00:04:39.510> one<00:04:39.630> thing<00:04:39.840> we're

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
arrow route the number one thing we're

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.150 
arrow route the number one thing we're
going<00:04:40.080> to<00:04:40.140> talk<00:04:40.260> about<00:04:40.350> with<00:04:40.530> this<00:04:40.620> tailback

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
going to talk about with this tailback

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.800 
going to talk about with this tailback
is<00:04:41.430> he's<00:04:41.850> gonna<00:04:41.940> take<00:04:42.180> a<00:04:42.240> little<00:04:42.390> bit<00:04:42.600> about<00:04:42.750> a

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
is he's gonna take a little bit about a

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.630 
is he's gonna take a little bit about a
wider<00:04:43.110> alignment<00:04:43.710> so<00:04:43.830> hopefully<00:04:44.220> within<00:04:44.520> your

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
wider alignment so hopefully within your

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.910 
wider alignment so hopefully within your
spread<00:04:44.910> run<00:04:45.690> game<00:04:45.930> you're<00:04:46.560> gonna<00:04:46.680> have<00:04:46.830> an

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
spread run game you're gonna have an

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.500 
spread run game you're gonna have an
alignment<00:04:47.250> that<00:04:47.520> your<00:04:47.640> tail<00:04:47.820> back<00:04:47.970> lines<00:04:48.300> up

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
alignment that your tail back lines up

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.690 
alignment that your tail back lines up
wide<00:04:49.170> so<00:04:49.440> you<00:04:49.530> can<00:04:49.560> match<00:04:49.890> that<00:04:49.920> with<00:04:50.250> stick<00:04:50.550> so

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
wide so you can match that with stick so

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.730 
wide so you can match that with stick so
they<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:51.360> defense<00:04:51.720> can't<00:04:51.930> identify<00:04:52.050> every

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
they the defense can't identify every

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.920 
they the defense can't identify every
time<00:04:52.950> that<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.220> tail<00:04:53.430> backs<00:04:53.670> wide<00:04:53.970> that<00:04:54.810> he's

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
time that the tail backs wide that he's

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.690 
time that the tail backs wide that he's
gonna<00:04:55.050> be<00:04:55.230> running<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.740> narrow<00:04:56.220> route<00:04:56.460> so<00:04:56.669> you

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
gonna be running a narrow route so you

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.340 
gonna be running a narrow route so you
want<00:04:56.880> to<00:04:56.940> be<00:04:57.120> able<00:04:57.390> to<00:04:57.540> line<00:04:57.810> them<00:04:57.930> up<00:04:57.990> out<00:04:58.140> here

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
want to be able to line them up out here

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.480 
want to be able to line them up out here
and<00:04:58.470> bring<00:04:58.620> them<00:04:58.710> back<00:04:58.860> this<00:04:59.040> way<00:04:59.220> on<00:04:59.370> an

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
and bring them back this way on an

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.520 
and bring them back this way on an
outside<00:04:59.820> zone<00:05:00.090> or<00:05:00.570> some<00:05:00.990> sort<00:05:01.200> of<00:05:01.260> stretch

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
outside zone or some sort of stretch

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.680 
outside zone or some sort of stretch
play<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.860> opposite<00:05:02.220> way<00:05:02.460> so<00:05:02.700> with<00:05:03.270> this<00:05:03.450> route

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
play the opposite way so with this route

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.540 
play the opposite way so with this route
we<00:05:04.200> don't<00:05:04.380> talk<00:05:04.560> about<00:05:04.770> depth<00:05:05.040> at<00:05:05.190> all<00:05:05.340> they

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
we don't talk about depth at all they

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.040 
we don't talk about depth at all they
get<00:05:05.669> one<00:05:05.880> yard<00:05:06.120> that's<00:05:06.360> great<00:05:06.570> in<00:05:06.720> terms<00:05:06.900> of

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
get one yard that's great in terms of

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.970 
get one yard that's great in terms of
their<00:05:07.169> route<00:05:07.350> we<00:05:08.130> talked<00:05:08.580> about<00:05:08.790> mostly<00:05:09.150> is

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
their route we talked about mostly is

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.040 
their route we talked about mostly is
their<00:05:10.980> horizontal<00:05:11.550> width<00:05:12.060> so<00:05:12.660> we<00:05:12.750> don't<00:05:12.900> talk

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
their horizontal width so we don't talk

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.630 
their horizontal width so we don't talk
about<00:05:13.169> them<00:05:13.410> it's<00:05:13.740> all<00:05:13.980> about<00:05:14.130> getting<00:05:14.370> with

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
about them it's all about getting with

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.520 
about them it's all about getting with
what<00:05:15.270> we've<00:05:15.419> got<00:05:15.600> to<00:05:15.720> try<00:05:15.900> and<00:05:16.020> do<00:05:16.110> here<00:05:16.140> is<00:05:16.410> we

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
what we've got to try and do here is we

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.380 
what we've got to try and do here is we
want<00:05:16.710> to<00:05:16.800> put<00:05:17.220> a<00:05:17.250> conflict<00:05:17.790> on<00:05:17.910> the<00:05:18.000> defense

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
want to put a conflict on the defense

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.470 
want to put a conflict on the defense
between<00:05:19.080> the<00:05:19.260> two<00:05:19.440> and<00:05:19.620> three<00:05:19.860> okay<00:05:20.850> we<00:05:21.300> want

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
between the two and three okay we want

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.659 
between the two and three okay we want
to<00:05:21.510> put<00:05:21.690> a<00:05:21.720> nice<00:05:21.930> horizontal<00:05:22.470> stretch<00:05:23.070> here<00:05:23.490> on

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
to put a nice horizontal stretch here on

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.970 
to put a nice horizontal stretch here on
this<00:05:24.240> flat<00:05:24.510> defender<00:05:24.840> so<00:05:25.440> if<00:05:25.530> he<00:05:25.620> squeezes

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
this flat defender so if he squeezes

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.590 
this flat defender so if he squeezes
here<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:26.490> we<00:05:26.580> outflank<00:05:27.060> he<00:05:27.270> gets<00:05:27.480> the

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
here and we outflank he gets the

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.200 
here and we outflank he gets the
football<00:05:28.020> if<00:05:28.380> he<00:05:28.530> gets<00:05:28.710> wide<00:05:28.950> now<00:05:29.790> what<00:05:30.180> that

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
football if he gets wide now what that

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.150 
football if he gets wide now what that
does<00:05:30.390> is<00:05:30.750> that<00:05:30.780> creates<00:05:30.990> a<00:05:31.200> window<00:05:31.530> for<00:05:32.040> the

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
does is that creates a window for the

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.950 
does is that creates a window for the
stick<00:05:32.520> so<00:05:32.700> I<00:05:32.760> think<00:05:32.820> a<00:05:33.000> key<00:05:33.210> coaching<00:05:33.630> point<00:05:33.840> is

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
stick so I think a key coaching point is

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.330 
stick so I think a key coaching point is
you're<00:05:34.080> starting<00:05:34.260> to<00:05:34.470> build<00:05:34.650> this<00:05:34.890> into<00:05:35.130> your

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
you're starting to build this into your

you're starting to build this into your
offense<00:05:35.730> if<00:05:36.150> you've<00:05:36.360> got<00:05:36.510> to<00:05:36.630> take<00:05:36.780> a<00:05:36.810> hard

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
offense if you've got to take a hard

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.380 
offense if you've got to take a hard
look<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:37.890> teach<00:05:38.190> these<00:05:38.400> kids<00:05:38.730> don't<00:05:39.150> remove

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
look and teach these kids don't remove

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.480 
look and teach these kids don't remove

concept we're going to use some motion
right<00:06:05.360> here<00:06:05.420> what<00:06:05.630> we're<00:06:05.720> going<00:06:05.750> to<00:06:05.870> do<00:06:05.960> we're

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
right here what we're going to do we're

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.270 
right here what we're going to do we're
going<00:06:06.110> to<00:06:06.230> call<00:06:06.380> this<00:06:06.500> our<00:06:06.680> stick<00:06:06.920> side<00:06:07.100> over

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
going to call this our stick side over

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.200 
going to call this our stick side over
here<00:06:07.340> so<00:06:07.490> we're<00:06:07.610> going<00:06:07.730> to<00:06:07.790> know<00:06:07.880> number<00:06:08.090> one

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
here so we're going to know number one

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.020 
here so we're going to know number one
is<00:06:08.420> gonna<00:06:08.540> run<00:06:08.720> up<00:06:08.810> must<00:06:09.020> outside<00:06:09.470> release<00:06:09.740> go

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
is gonna run up must outside release go

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.010 
is gonna run up must outside release go
we're<00:06:11.030> gonna<00:06:11.150> use<00:06:11.360> a<00:06:11.390> little<00:06:11.570> bit<00:06:11.780> of<00:06:11.870> motion

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
we're gonna use a little bit of motion

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.820 
we're gonna use a little bit of motion
right<00:06:12.320> here

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
right here

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.680 
right here
we<00:06:13.520> know<00:06:13.640> he<00:06:13.790> becomes<00:06:14.060> the<00:06:14.150> number<00:06:14.270> three<00:06:14.600> spot

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
we know he becomes the number three spot

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.140 
we know he becomes the number three spot
he's<00:06:14.990> gonna<00:06:15.110> run<00:06:15.350> his<00:06:15.470> arrow<00:06:15.650> out<00:06:16.000> you<00:06:17.000> bet

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
he's gonna run his arrow out you bet

just get inside the tackle box so there
there's<00:06:27.590> a<00:06:27.680> simple<00:06:28.010> way<00:06:28.040> line<00:06:28.460> up<00:06:28.580> an<00:06:28.700> empty

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
there's a simple way line up an empty

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.390 
there's a simple way line up an empty
you<00:06:29.810> know<00:06:29.930> most<00:06:30.230> defenses<00:06:30.950> want<00:06:31.130> to<00:06:31.220> really

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
you know most defenses want to really

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.300 
you know most defenses want to really
slide<00:06:31.820> to<00:06:32.510> that<00:06:32.630> trip<00:06:32.960> side<00:06:33.200> you're<00:06:33.980> gonna<00:06:34.040> use

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
slide to that trip side you're gonna use

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.620 
slide to that trip side you're gonna use
some<00:06:34.550> motion<00:06:34.940> you're<00:06:35.090> gonna<00:06:35.180> get<00:06:35.330> those<00:06:35.420> guys

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
some motion you're gonna get those guys

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.750 
some motion you're gonna get those guys
thinking<00:06:36.080> before<00:06:36.350> the<00:06:36.440> snap<00:06:36.770> obviously<00:06:37.700> it

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
thinking before the snap obviously it

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.100 
thinking before the snap obviously it
all<00:06:37.850> starts<00:06:38.180> right<00:06:38.240> here<00:06:38.540> if<00:06:38.630> you've<00:06:38.750> got<00:06:38.930> the

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
all starts right here if you've got the

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.810 
all starts right here if you've got the
take<00:06:39.320> it<00:06:39.500> let's<00:06:39.710> take<00:06:39.980> it<00:06:40.190> if<00:06:40.460> you<00:06:40.550> got<00:06:40.670> the

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
take it let's take it if you got the

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.160 
take it let's take it if you got the
matchup<00:06:41.180> if<00:06:41.300> defense<00:06:41.570> they're<00:06:41.780> gonna<00:06:41.870> slide

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.170 
matchup if defense they're gonna slide

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.750 
matchup if defense they're gonna slide
to<00:06:42.380> the<00:06:42.470> trip<00:06:42.680> side<00:06:42.920> you<00:06:43.340> know<00:06:43.460> that<00:06:43.610> that

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.760 
to the trip side you know that that

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.820 
to the trip side you know that that
levers<00:06:44.090> defenders<00:06:44.510> gonna<00:06:44.660> line<00:06:44.870> up<00:06:44.900> inside<00:06:45.230> of

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
levers defenders gonna line up inside of

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.980 
levers defenders gonna line up inside of
number<00:06:46.460> two<00:06:46.640> take<00:06:47.210> that<00:06:47.420> if<00:06:47.570> you<00:06:47.660> don't<00:06:47.750> have

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
number two take that if you don't have

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.080 
number two take that if you don't have
it<00:06:48.170> simply<00:06:48.770> go<00:06:48.890> arrow<00:06:49.220> to<00:06:49.430> stick<00:06:49.730> another

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
it simply go arrow to stick another

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.230 
it simply go arrow to stick another
variation<00:06:50.780> out<00:06:51.530> of<00:06:51.680> empty<00:06:52.010> that<00:06:52.820> we've<00:06:52.970> used

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 
variation out of empty that we've used

00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:01.060 
variation out of empty that we've used
and<00:06:53.390> you'll<00:06:53.480> see<00:06:53.660> video<00:06:53.960> on<00:06:54.110> that<00:06:54.290> as<00:06:54.470> well<00:07:00.070> as

and you'll see video on that as well as

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.440 
and you'll see video on that as well as
we'll<00:07:01.280> just<00:07:01.460> line<00:07:01.610> up<00:07:01.730> right<00:07:01.880> there<00:07:02.060> three<00:07:02.300> by

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:02.450 
we'll just line up right there three by

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.690 
we'll just line up right there three by
two<00:07:02.510> into<00:07:03.050> the<00:07:03.140> boundary<00:07:03.620> will<00:07:04.160> move<00:07:04.340> this<00:07:04.490> guy

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:04.700 
two into the boundary will move this guy

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.340 
two into the boundary will move this guy
over<00:07:04.730> here<00:07:04.970> into<00:07:05.330> the<00:07:05.420> three<00:07:05.660> spot<00:07:05.930> he's<00:07:06.200> gonna

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:06.350 
over here into the three spot he's gonna

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.440 
over here into the three spot he's gonna
run<00:07:06.620> the<00:07:06.740> arrow<00:07:06.920> it's<00:07:07.490> just<00:07:07.730> another<00:07:07.940> way<00:07:08.210> to

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:08.450 
run the arrow it's just another way to

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.630 
run the arrow it's just another way to
get<00:07:08.810> that<00:07:08.990> defense<00:07:09.410> sliding<00:07:09.919> it<00:07:10.220> can<00:07:10.460> be<00:07:10.550> an

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:10.640 
get that defense sliding it can be an

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.000 
get that defense sliding it can be an
easy<00:07:10.850> take<00:07:11.210> it<00:07:11.419> right<00:07:11.600> here<00:07:11.900> if<00:07:12.050> not<00:07:12.620> you're

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.010 
easy take it right here if not you're

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.370 
easy take it right here if not you're
simply<00:07:13.280> going<00:07:13.460> one<00:07:14.180> two<00:07:14.750> two<00:07:14.900> right<00:07:15.110> there<00:07:15.290> at

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
simply going one two two right there at

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.710 
simply going one two two right there at
the<00:07:15.470> arrow<00:07:15.620> to<00:07:15.919> stick<00:07:16.190> and<00:07:16.460> you<00:07:17.330> know<00:07:17.419> how<00:07:17.600> it

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:17.720 
the arrow to stick and you know how it

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.050 
the arrow to stick and you know how it
is<00:07:17.840> it<00:07:17.990> for<00:07:18.620> defenses<00:07:19.100> and<00:07:19.430> empty

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.060 
is it for defenses and empty

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.790 
is it for defenses and empty
you<00:07:20.360> know<00:07:20.450> every<00:07:20.870> week<00:07:21.020> teams<00:07:21.380> are<00:07:21.500> gonna<00:07:21.590> have

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:21.800 
you know every week teams are gonna have

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.030 
you know every week teams are gonna have
a<00:07:22.390> different<00:07:23.390> way<00:07:23.480> to<00:07:23.540> defend<00:07:23.870> empty<00:07:24.350> and<00:07:24.530> you

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:25.040 
a different way to defend empty and you

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.470 
a different way to defend empty and you
just<00:07:25.250> got<00:07:25.370> to<00:07:25.460> figure<00:07:25.610> out<00:07:25.850> how<00:07:26.060> you<00:07:26.120> can<00:07:26.330> take

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:26.480 
just got to figure out how you can take

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.390 
just got to figure out how you can take
advantage<00:07:26.540> of<00:07:27.050> it<00:07:27.200> some<00:07:27.860> people<00:07:27.890> keep<00:07:28.250> it

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 
advantage of it some people keep it

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.460 
advantage of it some people keep it
simple<00:07:28.700> some<00:07:28.910> teams<00:07:29.150> will<00:07:29.690> bring<00:07:29.810> pressure<00:07:30.169> if

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:30.470 
simple some teams will bring pressure if

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.570 
simple some teams will bring pressure if
they're<00:07:30.620> gonna<00:07:30.710> bring<00:07:30.919> pressure<00:07:31.220> obviously

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.580 
they're gonna bring pressure obviously

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.530 
they're gonna bring pressure obviously
they're<00:07:31.700> going<00:07:31.820> to<00:07:31.880> try<00:07:32.030> and<00:07:32.060> bring<00:07:32.240> six

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:32.540 
they're going to try and bring six

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.270 
they're going to try and bring six
they've<00:07:32.690> only<00:07:32.840> got<00:07:33.050> five<00:07:33.350> to<00:07:33.530> cover<00:07:33.770> it's

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 
they've only got five to cover it's

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.710 
they've only got five to cover it's
quick<00:07:34.520> passing<00:07:34.970> game<00:07:35.150> you<00:07:35.270> should<00:07:35.419> be<00:07:35.540> able<00:07:35.630> to

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:35.720 
quick passing game you should be able to
