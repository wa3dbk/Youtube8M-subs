 Hello, this is Jean Wolf from the blog green 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.120
 who risked today a fr 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.690
 new green caste dedicate the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.990
 watermelon 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.570
 it is an excellent fruit to consume in 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.820
 was very refreshing a lot of 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.859
 people do not know the only one to 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.210
 choose to prepare it and keep it for 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.070
 to choose a good watermelon 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.189
 you have to choose a watermelon that is 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.840
 so heavy so between watermelons you 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.140
 put the two watermelons you take 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.790
 the one that is the heaviest and if you 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.329
 store on it as if the cracked on a 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.430
 door 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.920
 it must sound hollow what has indicated 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.420
 that she is ripe so always take the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.879
 watermelon that sounds best for 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.149
 prepare the watermelon the material is 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.460
 simple one a cutting board a 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:59.670
 big knife and watermelon it takes 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:02.940
 rinse with water first to begin 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.390
 cut both sides the watermelon it goes 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.210
 so let left and right 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:15.930
 will straighten it up to the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.610
 vertical then we remove the Corsican 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.860
 so we go around the watermelon 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.860
 and the Corsican gradually as removing 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.970
 once you've done that you 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.130
 will have to get only the flesh is 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.990
 no white traces or 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.990
 Corsican remains on your watermelon 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.159
 Another step you the cut in two 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.570
 you get two pieces and if two 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.930
 pieces you still have the trenches 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.500
 in finn in thin slices or slice 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.030
 according to your choice so the watermelon 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.549
 keeps very well cool it's for 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.280
