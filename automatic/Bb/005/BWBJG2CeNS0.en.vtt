00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.560
 spot at the gathering inaudible today probe 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.380
 takes a spinner black fury 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.300
 by the way is very good turntables overcast and 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.610
 sunny day 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:35.390
 superbly caught here on a small 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:39.590
 the pinwheel caught and pike anyway 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:43.220
 let law. slow on the brink 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:47.780
 petal failure this issue will be discussed 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.000
 about catching pike on turntables and shakes for 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.179
 start dwell on such an interesting 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.519
 pike bait from the pinwheel like 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.010
 known there are two kinds of front 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.600
 laden rear surrounded turntables in 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.160
 in general 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.879
 pike can be put on any spinning 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.980
 bait and I must say that on the turntable 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.010
 often the easiest way to catch why 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.659
 because the pinwheel when wiring creates 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.390
 very intense vibrations and even 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.899
 relatively small pinwheel well 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.200
 hear groping well known pike 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.829
 well caught on the turntable almost 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.630
 all season 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.399
 and at the front on the back 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.509
 surrounded by turntables pike can be caught 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.509
 almost year round 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.560
 if you use for example the front 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.119
 loaded turntables they are very good 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.399
 allow you to control but and 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.619
 use jig methods so they 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.499
 work great in the fall and 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.700
 even in winter if you can catch 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:02:00.340
 in the pond and the reservoir does not freeze 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.140
 in the summer of spring the rear 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.240
 surrounded by turntables because they 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.780
 allow to melt not deep sites 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.789
 pond and very quickly allow you to catch 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.650
 pike 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.019
 if we talk about the nuances of pike fishing on 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.180
 turntables then of course there are certain 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.709
 secrets and tricks when fishing for pikes 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.200
 front surrounded and rear 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.569
 surrounded by turntables for short 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.120
 talk about what kind of pinwheel is 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.569
 pike I must say that pike my 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.090
 turntables if you take for example the scale 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:34.569
 turntables from there two zeros to the fifth 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.090
 the sixth number then pike turntables 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.340
 there will be a release that are size here 2 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.849
 numbers and above are in principle the most 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.000
 the optimal size of the turntables will be 3 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.519
 4 5 6 numbers and on such sizes 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.370
 turntables pike comes across as shallow 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.130
 so big so 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.400
 from size priority when fishing for pike 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.720
 one third of the size of the pinwheel when fishing for pike 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.720
 there is a place to be 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.870
 if we talk about a particular model 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.210
 turntables then there certainly should not be 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.330
 no duty because in certain 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:49.730
 periods and in certain fishing conditions 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.680
 in order to hold the bait 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.080
 best fit 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.110
 for example start up and is full in others 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.690
 terms of the comet type ogli spinner 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.190
 certain conditions rear turntable 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.040
 laden front surrounded 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.320
 therefore, in no case can not advance 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.570
 say that here's a turntable for example long 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.940
 it is the left spinner or spinner 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.080
 type comet is the best yet virtus 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.750
 this can not be 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.390
 why there is no perfect turntable 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.280
 for catching pike because spinner notes 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.530
 to select based on the fishing conditions a 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.690
 conditions of catching are in certain 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.730
 places you need to hold the turntable of the very bottom 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.400
 and very slowly the general criterion 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.140
 wiring for turntables 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.910
 when fishing for pike is that 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.010
 turntable should be carried out very slowly 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.840
 extremely slowly on the verge of failure 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.750
 petal if we will conduct 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.510
 pinwheel fast strong resistance 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.880
 When posting, then such a spinner of course 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.470
 will catch active pike but passive 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.740
 pike on such here usb not respond 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.420
 will be if taken for granted that 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.660
 the pinwheel when fishing for pike should 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:56.150
 can be done very slowly 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.460
 easy to pick up a turntable to certain 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.060
 catching conditions for example if we catch 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.460
 depth of 2 3 meters and processing we need 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.520
 make right at the bottom and very slowly 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.080
 well fit lung type turntables 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.169
 because the pinwheel type is full has 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.180
 small angle of deviation of the petal and its 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.310
 can be pretty slow and 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.440
 weakly resists at compilation 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.090
 therefore, it can be done extremely 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.850
 slowest bottom if we need 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.370
 hold the turntable a little higher for example 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.740
 at a depth of two and a half meters there 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.960
 type turntables work very well 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.030
 the comet is such a turntable 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.180
 resist slightly stronger than brittle and 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.760
 for this reason, it already goes a little higher 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.990
 if we need to hold the turntable itself 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.670
 surface come 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.500
 on slow and here already out of competition 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.540
 spinner that's ogli type 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.830
 which strongly resists when 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.130
 underwrap and 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.620
 goes to as high as possible that's it 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.930
 so you need to pick up the turntable 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.060
 because 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.200
 we must proceed from the fact that we must 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.510
 guess at what depth 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.220
 Approximately is pike and precisely 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.900
 at this level we need to spend 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.960
 turntable and so that it goes 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.740
 as slow as possible and that is why 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.630
 there is such a variety of turntables 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.760
 heavy light very light with a lot 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.100
 the angle of deviation of the petal with the average 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.440
 petal deviation angle is very small 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.140
 interesting also such varieties 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.450
 spinners spiner would you spinner woes and what 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.200
 Well, that's good if you take here such 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.260
 spinnerbait 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:30.440
 This spinner would be this firms that it is visible that 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:33.320
 u spiner would have this petal this one 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.970
 he sliding and pushing the petal we 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.950
 we can change the angle of rotation of this 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.470
 spinnerbait was a petal rotation at 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:43.300
 wiring and so here 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.300
 spiner be it can be said 11
