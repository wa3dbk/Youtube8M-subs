is it seems like flashbacks gonna be a

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.080 
is it seems like flashbacks gonna be a
lot<00:04:12.889> more<00:04:12.949> important<00:04:13.430> than<00:04:13.489> let's<00:04:13.939> say

cards<00:04:45.470> of<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.590> site<00:04:45.800> am<00:04:46.159> I<00:04:46.280> of<00:04:46.400> course<00:04:46.550> there's

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
cards of the site am I of course there's

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.820 
cards of the site am I of course there's
some<00:04:47.060> rare<00:04:47.270> that<00:04:47.539> and<00:04:48.050> no<00:04:48.169> one<00:04:48.289> knows<00:04:48.440> what's

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
some rare that and no one knows what's

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.800 
some rare that and no one knows what's
going<00:04:49.070> to<00:04:49.130> come<00:04:49.250> out<00:04:49.509> but<00:04:50.509> I<00:04:50.570> think<00:04:50.900> that<00:04:52.810> it's

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
going to come out but I think that it's

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.390 
going to come out but I think that it's
gonna<00:04:53.990> be<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.289> good<00:04:54.500> set<00:04:54.680> it's<00:04:54.770> gonna<00:04:54.860> be<00:04:55.039> darker

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
gonna be a good set it's gonna be darker

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.279 
gonna be a good set it's gonna be darker
I<00:04:55.430> think<00:04:55.669> that<00:04:55.849> black<00:04:56.360> is<00:04:56.389> gonna<00:04:56.810> get<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:56.990> boost

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
I think that black is gonna get a boost

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:58.990

block set that was large with rise of

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.890 
block set that was large with rise of
the<00:06:24.650> eldrazi<00:06:25.090> so<00:06:26.090> hopefully<00:06:26.479> they've<00:06:26.660> learned

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
the eldrazi so hopefully they've learned

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.420 
the eldrazi so hopefully they've learned
their<00:06:26.990> lesson<00:06:27.410> a<00:06:27.500> little<00:06:27.740> bit<00:06:27.889> cuz<00:06:28.160> we're<00:06:28.310> as<00:06:28.400> a

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
their lesson a little bit cuz we're as a

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.090 
their lesson a little bit cuz we're as a
little<00:06:28.760> drowsy<00:06:28.910> was<00:06:29.680> drafting<00:06:30.680> it<00:06:30.800> was<00:06:30.919> kind

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
little drowsy was drafting it was kind

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:37.620 
little drowsy was drafting it was kind
of<00:06:31.160> men<00:06:31.550> and<00:06:33.639> it<00:06:34.639> looks<00:06:34.910> like<00:06:35.200> an<00:06:36.220> estrade

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
of men and it looks like an estrade

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.170 
of men and it looks like an estrade
restored<00:06:38.630> will<00:06:38.810> be<00:06:38.930> drafted<00:06:39.410> by<00:06:39.560> itself<00:06:40.180> so

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 
restored will be drafted by itself so

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.860 
restored will be drafted by itself so
you<00:06:41.810> won't<00:06:41.990> get<00:06:42.550> like<00:06:43.550> it<00:06:43.729> was<00:06:43.910> rise<00:06:44.240> worldwake

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
you won't get like it was rise worldwake

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.790 
you won't get like it was rise worldwake
or<00:06:45.229> it<00:06:46.099> no<00:06:46.430> it<00:06:46.490> was<00:06:46.639> drafted<00:06:47.530> back<00:06:48.530> then<00:06:48.680> it

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
or it no it was drafted back then it

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.670 
or it no it was drafted back then it
would<00:06:48.919> send<00:06:49.070> a<00:06:49.160> car<00:06:49.280> worldwake<00:06:49.610> rise<00:06:50.680> this

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
would send a car worldwake rise this

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.430 
would send a car worldwake rise this
time<00:06:51.919> it's<00:06:52.190> actually<00:06:52.550> just<00:06:52.639> going<00:06:52.760> to<00:06:52.849> be

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
time it's actually just going to be

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.010 
time it's actually just going to be
triple<00:06:54.789> restored<00:06:55.789> when<00:06:56.090> it's<00:06:56.240> or<00:06:56.630> advocate

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020 
triple restored when it's or advocate

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.750 
triple restored when it's or advocate
restored<00:06:57.320> when<00:06:57.410> it's<00:06:57.530> drafted<00:06:58.070> but<00:06:58.520> in<00:06:58.669> a

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:58.760 
restored when it's drafted but in a

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.750 
restored when it's drafted but in a
start<00:06:59.000> block<00:06:59.300> constructed<00:07:00.289> will<00:07:00.530> be<00:07:00.760> two

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.760 
start block constructed will be two

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.230 
start block constructed will be two
backs<00:07:02.000> of<00:07:02.180> each<00:07:02.330> so<00:07:02.660> two<00:07:02.690> dark<00:07:03.289> ascension<00:07:03.530> to

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
backs of each so two dark ascension to

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.659 
backs of each so two dark ascension to
innistrad<00:07:05.240> to<00:07:05.720> absent<00:07:06.289> story<00:07:06.590> so<00:07:07.550> i<00:07:07.580> think

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:07.669 
innistrad to absent story so i think

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:10.540 
innistrad to absent story so i think
this<00:07:07.849> is<00:07:07.910> gonna<00:07:08.030> be<00:07:08.180> fun<00:07:08.389> um<00:07:09.169> i<00:07:09.260> think<00:07:09.919> that<00:07:10.460> the

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550 
this is gonna be fun um i think that the

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.010 
this is gonna be fun um i think that the
