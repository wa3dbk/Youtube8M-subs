 responsive hockey does ok party continues 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:17.299
 and that's how you have more than 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.299
 restart your google chrome 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.750

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:37.890
 was good here we are going to tackle 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.790
 our problem is to accelerate his 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:46.290
 pc so I have two solutions that work 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:48.479
 it is to download sought after cleaner 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.079
 on google it is a software that we 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.340
 play really well 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:57.930
 exclaims your pc so you launch a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:01.460
 once you have downloaded it and you 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.840

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.189

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.869
 markets 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.250
 second solution to go in 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.680

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.090

 performance you have on the side done 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.950
 open a toy disk use and you
