this<00:02:33.240> is<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.540> very<00:02:33.810> hard<00:02:34.080> exercise<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.800> can<00:02:34.920> see

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
this is a very hard exercise you can see

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.290 
this is a very hard exercise you can see
it's<00:02:35.370> kind<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.580> throwing<00:02:35.790> me<00:02:35.910> up<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.120> balance

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
it's kind of throwing me up a balance

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.620 
it's kind of throwing me up a balance
there<00:02:37.550> but<00:02:38.550> we're<00:02:38.820> trying<00:02:38.940> along<00:02:39.240> with<00:02:39.420> this

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
there but we're trying along with this

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.280 
there but we're trying along with this
is<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.700> not<00:02:41.820> just<00:02:42.000> pull<00:02:42.240> on<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.510> bar<00:02:42.720> but

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
is to is to not just pull on the bar but

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.670 
is to is to not just pull on the bar but

like I would drive into into a squat bar
this<00:02:50.460> is<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:50.640> very<00:02:50.820> challenging<00:02:51.030> exercise<00:02:51.690> I
