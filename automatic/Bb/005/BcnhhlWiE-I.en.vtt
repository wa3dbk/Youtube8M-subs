megapixel<00:00:13.799> cause<00:00:14.040> iceland<00:00:14.610> its<00:00:15.330> aperture<00:00:15.660> is

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
megapixel cause iceland its aperture is

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.200 
megapixel cause iceland its aperture is
one<00:00:16.170> point<00:00:16.470> F<00:00:16.740> one<00:00:17.010> point<00:00:17.310> nine<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:17.910> basically

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
one point F one point nine so basically

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.880 
one point F one point nine so basically
what<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.570> means<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.930> less<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.529> bit<00:00:19.710> more

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
and clearer images we have a 1.3

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.769 
and clearer images we have a 1.3
megapixel<00:00:25.760> wide-angle<00:00:26.760> front<00:00:26.789> facing<00:00:27.359> camera

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779

can<00:00:54.899> take<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> picture<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.219> are<00:00:56.340> many

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
can take a picture and there are many

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.459 
can take a picture and there are many
fun<00:00:57.030> applications<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.050> effects<00:00:58.440> that

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
fun applications and the effects that

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.080 
fun applications and the effects that
you<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.649> apply<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.129> top<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.609> so<00:00:59.820> now<00:00:59.850> it's
