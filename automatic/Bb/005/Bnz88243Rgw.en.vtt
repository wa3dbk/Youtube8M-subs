my window and Vinnie review I had a

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.259 
my window and Vinnie review I had a
feeling<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.430> show<00:00:26.640> probably<00:00:27.029> wouldn't

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
feeling that this show probably wouldn't

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.089 
feeling that this show probably wouldn't
last<00:00:27.390> long<00:00:27.599> unless<00:00:28.320> they're<00:00:28.619> probably<00:00:28.859> some

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
last long unless they're probably some

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.650 
last long unless they're probably some
soccer<00:00:29.369> moms<00:00:29.699> complaining<00:00:30.210> about<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
soccer moms complaining about the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.410 
soccer moms complaining about the
constant<00:00:31.140> cussing<00:00:31.790> now<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.820> understand<00:00:33.300> what

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
constant cussing now I understand what

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.330 
constant cussing now I understand what
Vinnie<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.170> type<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.469> show<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.800> obviously

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
Vinnie is a type of show that obviously

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.060 
Vinnie is a type of show that obviously
should<00:00:35.579> be<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.820> Nick<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.149> night<00:00:36.390> but<00:00:36.989> hey<00:00:37.170> it's

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
should be on Nick at night but hey it's

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.680 
should be on Nick at night but hey it's
on<00:00:38.280> Nickelodeon<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.180> there's<00:00:39.360> nothing<00:00:39.629> you

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
on Nickelodeon so there's nothing you

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.350 
on Nickelodeon so there's nothing you
could<00:00:39.840> do<00:00:39.960> about<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.399> but<00:00:41.399> apparently<00:00:41.790> this

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
could do about it but apparently this

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.690 
could do about it but apparently this
isn't<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.780> reason<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.530> hope<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.280> not<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
isn't the reason I hope is not the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.119 
isn't the reason I hope is not the
reason<00:00:45.149> obviously<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.469> real<00:00:46.649> reason<00:00:47.100> that

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
reason obviously the real reason that

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.150 
reason obviously the real reason that
the<00:00:47.399> reason<00:00:47.640> why<00:00:47.789> window<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.870> Vinnie<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.410> keep

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the reason why window and Vinnie is keep

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.729 
the reason why window and Vinnie is keep
being<00:00:50.460> canceled<00:00:51.000> pretty<00:00:51.780> much<00:00:51.960> because<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
being canceled pretty much because the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.770 
being canceled pretty much because the
show<00:00:52.949> has<00:00:52.980> had<00:00:53.399> low<00:00:53.640> ratings<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.420> don't<00:00:54.719> know

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
show has had low ratings I don't know

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.360 
show has had low ratings I don't know
how<00:00:55.020> because<00:00:55.289> window<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.920> Vinnie<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.340> a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
how because window and Vinnie is a

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.970 
how because window and Vinnie is a
pretty<00:00:56.699> good<00:00:56.879> show<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:58.289> has<00:00:58.530> his<00:00:58.710> funny

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
pretty good show and it has his funny

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.410 
pretty good show and it has his funny
moments<00:00:59.609> it's<00:01:00.570> entertaining<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.320> me<00:01:02.030> but<00:01:03.030> it's

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
moments it's entertaining to me but it's

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.770 
moments it's entertaining to me but it's
due<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.750> low<00:01:04.229> ratings<00:01:04.489> apparently<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:06.360> first

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780
