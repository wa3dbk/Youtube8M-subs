00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.090

 all the best known players 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:30.859
 some do not have the majority 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.560
 They have obviously added the league but 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:36.430
 there is still a lot of work in it and 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.430
 little more 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.900

 I will leave the links in the description 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.750
 simply the installation is quite 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.120
 easy simply what you have to 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.169
 do is install it directly first 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.370
 the one of the fbi 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:28.780
 and then the patch or if you have the 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.780
 cd directly and install the patch 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:32.939
 you can do as I do what is 

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:34.919
 install the patch in a folder part 

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.539
 and then copy and paste all the 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.519
 files that have installed us in the 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.689
 press folder this well above all 

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:41.729
 It's good for people who have problems 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:43.620

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.600

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.180
 people who have road problems that 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.880

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.419
 we copy and paste everything and we will have it 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.990
 very easy as galaxies in the topic faces 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.670

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.530
 a little digitally 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.090

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.570
