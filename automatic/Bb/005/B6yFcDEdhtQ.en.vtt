00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.449
 Hi all 

00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:04.600
 here patrick's thousand 465 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.260
 with the other idiots you already know 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.720
 masturbate 258 and choose the 456 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.469
 Snail had already told you not to call me that 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:16.929
 motherfucker 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:18.249
 fuck 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:20.109
 do I care xd 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.429
 but enough of conversation and let's start that this story is a bit long but 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:25.759
 very interesting 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.060
 in agreement 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.489
 here we have the following story 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.320
 it's about the well-known pokémon game 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.740
 let's start 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.740
 this starts with a pokémon 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.230
 this seemed specific to me 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.290
 otherwise 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.820
 it probably would not have happened 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.000
 something that would have made me happy 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.870
 I started with his game saved just to see everything he had 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.740
 the information said that I had all the pokémon in their collapse that I 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.440
 He remembered that he loved to use codes made or clean and to improve his 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.380
 experience when playing 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.840
 it was probably the only thing that led him to stay with the game for everything 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.080
 that time 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.240
 but even using cheats gets boring over time 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.930
 after starting his game 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.710
 I saw his team had six 100-level assassin radicó 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.500
 like all the pokémon that I had 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.220
 he captured them using the belated code finds any pokémon 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.189
 although he did not need any pokémon to complete his pokédex or 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.610
 needed and tense expected to exchange was always a fun experience 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.630
 just to see where they came from 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.040
 so I went to the global trading center of jubilation and fez city to see what they could 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.620
 give me one of these resources 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.659
 I knew I could change them for anything 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.990
 but secretly I had a grudge against these six for massacring me so many times 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.450
 already in the exchange network I offered one for a bronze before random elegy of the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.270
 first list 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.880
 oo I could not choose a genre but I chose that the level was sit down to that 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.359
 it was a more or less fair deal 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:10.569
 after that 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.549
 I left for a while 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.079
 after doing nothing for at least six hours I went back to see if someone 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.429
 offered something for the exchange 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:23.199
 I was immediately thrilled when the exchange sequence began 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.840
 I know it was a simple ronson but still 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.949
 I liked the process very much 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.699
 could you see me sent a magic artime would have exited for that 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:36.759
 I received a bronze they are cinema already it threatened the one of him 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:41.079
 I was surprised that they gave me a cinema in exchange I never got a movie theater 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.779
 exchange employ them 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.549
 but the man bothered me a little 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.450
 being a slightly religious person 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.349
 I do not feel comfortable talking about something related to hell or something 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.880
 even writing this makes me feel like I could trigger an event 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.469
 similar again 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:02.609
 I just hope that this works as a learning experience and entered for 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.509
 you and not like something else for me 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:12.519
 after leaving check his bylaws everything was in 666 his old coach was 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.359
 called bel 6 was captured in the power 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.419
 but it was inside a chevy sun 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.239
 clearly it was left 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.209
 but it was what I got to offer an art 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.969
 I wanted to get rid of him 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:27.969
 so the only other option was to release it 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.169
 before going to the pc check the item that had adhered 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.539
 the owner had added an email that is always fun 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:40.789
 although the choices of what to say are severely limited if the 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.199
 letters are always cheesy 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:48.129
 I chose the one of free says the mail and it did not seem to be elaborated in a normal way 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.319
 in fact it seemed as if they had done it letter by letter as it was done in 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.569
 good and silver 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.209
 the message had only three words 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.199
 take me back 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:01.169
 I was not sure of what that meant 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.239
 I certainly could not offer it for exchange 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.109
 and even if I could there was no way to make sure that it elevates the return to 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.969
 adhere so I deleted the message and fullana ps to release it 

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:18.190
 I chose the option to deposit pokémon and select elvel to release it 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.470
 but every time I explain it, he shrugged 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.820
 he immediately came back with a message saying something like that of he does not want 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.300
 leave t 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.860
 when I checked elvel again I had another mail item 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.860
 which did not make sense so I took it away the first time 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:37.120
 I opened it and read a slightly longer message 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.319
 I can not go by myself 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.300
 take me back 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.830
 again I removed him elite or try to release him without success 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.150
 when I tried to deposit it the game told me to remove the mail from 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.370
 Pokémon before depositing 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.499
 I know 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:55.610
 I did it twice 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.009
 but after reviewing it again the one had another new mail in his possession 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.930
 the tubert 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.699
 I would like to know why this Pokémon was making my game 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:08.409
 will act so weird 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.500
 this pokémon was disgusted 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.900
 not the game 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.330
 and I know that once present does not affect the game but a bad one can make the 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.800
 game colapse 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.389
 but this one was not doing either of the two things but rather something 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:23.819
 intermediate 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:25.949
 eager to get rid of him 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.949
 of that gtc building and move forward to cover 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.410
 I was very impatient to take a flying pokémon from the pc so I just 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.080
 teach one of the recuersos the branch movement and use it 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:43.289
 but when I chose solace ontón on the map the game informed me that I could not 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:44.050
 fly there 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.530
 I knew that my brother had visited the city before and I did not know why not 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.759
 I could go but I did not take the time to think about it so I just 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.569
 volley I took 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.569
 I immediately noticed the lack of people on the route 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:59.030
 in fact 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.580
 I do not remember who I could face or even there and things like that 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.759
 but I know that at least there would be a few cnpss there the area was 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:07.990
 completely alone
