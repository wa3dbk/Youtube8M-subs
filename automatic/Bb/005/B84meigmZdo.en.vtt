00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.750
 right at the beginning of the season, it was expected that it could happen 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.750
 something like that or not at all the truth is that it is not 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.919
 we considered that we had a team with a base from last year that 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:16.119
 if not maybe to aspire to something they are very great positions although yes 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.820
 we had the illusion of being able to qualify to the ounce 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.380
 neither do we ever think that we could have a team playing the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.140
 positions 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.429
 of descent 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.319
 things did not happen, it got complicated and finally 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.369
 Per hundred I did not expect it 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.460
 the fis s min 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.930
 how things have changed as far as their last one is concerned with the signing of 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.860
 stoichkov 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.950
 good as it occurred to us month they had landau with several they went directly 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.140
 to Bulgarian 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.160
 not us percent 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.700
 n in Asia we usually have them always clear or not 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.610
 certainly let's make mistakes and in fact we made a lot of mistakes 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.610
 in our project our team philosophy the idea that we want 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.610
 we had it very clear therefore at the same time 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.310
 that we ratified Fernando Vázquez in the post to continue until the end of 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.239
 season 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.070
 At that same moment we knew that Fernando Vázquez 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.150
 was not 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.680
 the coach for the next season and from there we already 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.980
 we put to plan 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.970
 we no longer worried so much 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.600
 that you could get news to Fernando that we are looking for a 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.540
 coach that the next season 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.509
 in fact he finished 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.429
 a tepuy a short time we also talked to his representative and told him not to 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.060
 we had less 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.060
 so from there we started planning and planning 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.980
 is what we expected and what we wanted to know 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.460
 I asked Celtism 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.050
 but that there was no opportunity for the results as they were 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.310
 we wanted to 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.549
 a game a little different when I say different that I was also criticized 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.320
 a lot to say those moments in which basket I was looking for 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.850
 as Celtic trainer 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.960
 I do not mean it is better or worse Jesus technical thing in which 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.479
 we do not get fundetec pressure different than the kind of 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.740
 soccer you like 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.010
 his most aggressive football more to attack 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.050
 and for that I got stuck thinking what coach could give us that there 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.050
 we made a list of several coaches 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:14.599
 I think it's one of the few times that we make direct negotiations with 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.479
 coaches and you will not find out if the media and the fans 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:24.129
 we started with some of us, we were seeing who fit the most in that kind of 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.559
 soccer I wanted 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:28.559
 and in the team philosophy that we had 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.459
 and the one that went closest to all that 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.069
 he was stoic 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.229
 and reads and at the end bush when we ask that 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.349
 per cent in the match back to that fernando not 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.799
 oo could not continue with us 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.909
 because in it more the team very despondent 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.549
 Well then we called him and asked him if he would be willing 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.339
 anticipate possible project we had to take over the equipment 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:58.759
 still in this vital risk 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:02.249
 We were tremendously surprised that he did not say yes. 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:04.229
 said that he had liked 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:07.089
 the project when we present it 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:10.359
 what coincided were the philosophy that we had of 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.569
 of grassroots football 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.569
 that the interesting thing I want a project was not the economic apart 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:18.849
 which is that he did not pay attention to that 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.919
 that we could have that permanent direct contact with him in the 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.979
 negotiations not always through representatives 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:27.710
 like this study we have for some 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.769
 a motor command person that we can approach him 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.650
 we finally saw that it fit into everything we wanted a very large part 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.159
 and then it was that we decided to bring it 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.829
 anticipating our future option the child I do not know if you do not 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.049
 means all that or what past thing is past and therefore not 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:45.440
 there is 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.660
 absolutely criollo no problem but with other coaches 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.230
 have started conversations if you want to say it is obviously a 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.170
 question whose resounding answer that the psyche to see us stay there 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.389
 several parties in this process do not 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.389
 one of them is when it is decided to ratify 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.569
 to fernando 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.269
 criticize we say seriously we did not offer the charge to anyone 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.929
 and it's totally serious 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:15.239
 but if I asked the possibilities of some to come 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.009
 among them was clement was camacho if I had a series of 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.159
 trainers 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:23.739
 when there are some of them that we could rethink ourselves that 

00:04:23.739 --> 00:04:25.830
 They could give a different character 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.860
 who had at that time 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.669
 they tell us that they are not willing to take the risk of beni al celta 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:32.770
 with with 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.770
 with few days and the team where I was 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.599
 we see that what we have left were coaches that we understood 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.240
 that were of a type of school or very similar to the one of fernando vázquez 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.879
 we saw that it was 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:48.020
 mccann game 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.810
 what did not mean there was no attraction 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.810
 additional to the one that had vázquez and that's why we confirmed it 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.520
 later and when we started looking for the kind of game that we 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.889
 we thought and we believed that 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.770
 there is not a curious thing and insults what we feel a lot in the fans 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:08.999
 is that they remember a lot 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:12.859
 of those matches that the staff closest to but lost because they 

00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:16.620
 you ask for daring game users who had that game more 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.340
 it's already here we wanted to go back to that idea to take up that idea of ​​course 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.620
 It's not ours 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.120
 but yes in philosophy you want to 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.850
 of that game is what we were looking for for this project 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.580
 new Celtic 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.289
 pafos estrada I am products here 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.129
 man we would like to have our program but I think it is a 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:39.080
 man who has not done much in the media and who prefers to speak 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.759
 bit 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.909
 because of its slight character is very special we do not know 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.899
 we made a study of a very deep analysis of all its characteristics 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.240
 and well there are some that compensate engines and although 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.529
 is that you do not want to 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:59.949
 percent for being a long time at this time the means 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:01.319
 I believe that 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.289
 It can be convenient at this time 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.039
 but I also understand that he has a 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:09.520
 must comply with the fans and with the means of vigo 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.240
 and that little by little the antrum will start in the dynamics 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.480
 of being able to talk and be able to say we think it can only be this she knows 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.260
 he knows he has the doors open 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
 so that at any time you may have to buy them a little bit 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:27.830
 your intentions and even questions a little bit about your life because 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.009
 we know that she was very closely linked to Spain specifically to 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:34.740
 barcelona but we would like to have other things and that the invitation that the 

00:06:34.739 --> 00:06:39.339
 program directed by jacobo bush zeta certainly this addiction is not one of the 

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:43.050
 few times that journalists do not know what is being worked on 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.599
 with the coaches ee and it's true that in this one in this case it was a total 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:52.319
 surprise the journalists are mosson moss for a hundred 

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:57.240
 as he writes we get a lot 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.569
 too much 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:03.059
 the themes are the one of soccer in the subjects of the players to 

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:06.819
 no journalists have a mission to fulfill 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:11.409
 and they try to fulfill it in the best possible way and I understand that there is a 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:15.210
 journalist at that critical moment to have the exclusive of who would be the 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.219
 Celtic trainer he owns could be important to him and to his medium 

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:22.219
 they do not have to do their work to what I mean is that 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.599
 percent and if we were talking about a project and we were saying that 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:30.130
 that project we wanted to bring it to approval in some way or 

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:34.699
 introduce yourself before the people to the fans to see what they thought of the 

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:37.999
 because it seemed to us that it was not very appropriate to give the name 

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:42.350
 and then tell him hey this is my name and this is my project 

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:44.289
 we wanted to present 

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:46.539
 this bali project with the endorsement st 

00:07:46.539 --> 00:07:49.889
 say then we have thought about this person that can lead to the blueprint 

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:56.800
 that's why that kind of way
