most bang for your buck concept you're
going<00:06:17.840> to<00:06:18.050> have<00:06:18.229> the<00:06:18.620> most<00:06:18.830> muscle

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
going to have the most muscle

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.180 
going to have the most muscle
stimulation<00:06:19.930> with<00:06:20.930> your<00:06:21.169> compound<00:06:21.710> movements

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
stimulation with your compound movements

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.560 
stimulation with your compound movements
therefore<00:06:22.760> if<00:06:22.820> we<00:06:22.910> have<00:06:23.030> more<00:06:23.300> muscle

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
therefore if we have more muscle

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.029 
therefore if we have more muscle
stimulation<00:06:24.139> you're<00:06:24.500> destroying<00:06:24.770> more

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 
stimulation you're destroying more

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.430 
stimulation you're destroying more
muscle<00:06:25.490> fibers<00:06:25.880> which<00:06:26.479> is<00:06:26.660> going<00:06:26.840> to<00:06:26.930> hence<00:06:27.110> in

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
muscle fibers which is going to hence in

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.310 
muscle fibers which is going to hence in
a<00:06:27.710> greater<00:06:28.370> muscle<00:06:28.669> mass<00:06:29.000> okay<00:06:29.510> thank<00:06:30.169> you<00:06:30.260> for

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
a greater muscle mass okay thank you for

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.729 
a greater muscle mass okay thank you for
sticking<00:06:30.590> around<00:06:30.740> we'll<00:06:31.190> see<00:06:31.430> you<00:06:31.490> again<00:06:31.550> soon
