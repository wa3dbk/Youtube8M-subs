what is up guys Cruz designs here and in
this<00:00:06.299> tutorial<00:00:06.480> I'm<00:00:06.990> going<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.259> show<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.529> some

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
this tutorial I'm going to show you some

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.850 
this tutorial I'm going to show you some
really<00:00:08.700> basic<00:00:08.910> on<00:00:09.330> modeling<00:00:09.690> skills<00:00:10.019> I'm<00:00:10.800> just

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
really basic on modeling skills I'm just

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.680 
really basic on modeling skills I'm just
going<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.070> show<00:00:11.219> you<00:00:11.280> two<00:00:11.519> ways<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.300> can

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
going to show you two ways that you can

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.020 
going to show you two ways that you can
kind<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.620> customize<00:00:13.830> these<00:00:14.340> shapes<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.880> bit

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
kind of customize these shapes a bit

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.090 
kind of customize these shapes a bit
more<00:00:15.210> because<00:00:15.719> cinema<00:00:16.170> 4d<00:00:16.440> doesn't<00:00:16.890> give<00:00:16.980> you

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
more because cinema 4d doesn't give you

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.380 
more because cinema 4d doesn't give you
that<00:00:17.279> many<00:00:17.460> shapes<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:18.119> play<00:00:18.300> around<00:00:18.510> with<00:00:18.750> and

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
that many shapes to play around with and

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.670 
that many shapes to play around with and
if<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.480> want<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> model<00:00:22.020> something<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.529> need

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
if you want to model something you need

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.509 
if you want to model something you need
to<00:00:22.800> be<00:00:22.920> able<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.340> change<00:00:24.090> these<00:00:24.420> shapes<00:00:25.099> so<00:00:26.099> i'm

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
to be able to change these shapes so i'm

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.400 
to be able to change these shapes so i'm
going<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.240> show<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.420> two<00:00:27.750> ways<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.990> do<00:00:28.230> that

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
going to show you two ways to do that

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.490 
going to show you two ways to do that
and<00:00:28.849> the<00:00:29.849> example<00:00:29.910> I'm<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.630> use<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:31.140> with

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
and the example I'm going to use is with

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.130 
and the example I'm going to use is with
a<00:00:31.529> hemisphere<00:00:32.600> so<00:00:33.600> I'm<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.809> enlarge

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
a hemisphere so I'm going to enlarge

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.479 
a hemisphere so I'm going to enlarge
this<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:36.380> the<00:00:37.380> number<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.710> segments<00:00:38.340> is

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
this and the number of segments is

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.220 
this and the number of segments is
really<00:00:38.850> important<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.510> whatever<00:00:39.989> shape

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
really important so whatever shape

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.709 
really important so whatever shape
you're<00:00:40.440> doing<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.250> want<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.600> put

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
you're doing this with you want to put

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.319 
you're doing this with you want to put
the<00:00:42.750> number<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.079> segments<00:00:43.500> up<00:00:43.649> quite<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> bit<00:00:44.940> so

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the number of segments up quite a bit so

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.770 
the number of segments up quite a bit so
near<00:00:45.930> 50<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.590> quite<00:00:46.860> good<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.629> I'm<00:00:48.629> going<00:00:48.750> to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
near 50 is quite good and I'm going to

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.869 
near 50 is quite good and I'm going to
change<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.140> type<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.680> hemisphere<00:00:50.399> just<00:00:50.760> for

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
change the type to hemisphere just for

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.970 
change the type to hemisphere just for
the<00:00:50.940> tutorial<00:00:51.320> because<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.530> quite<00:00:52.800> an<00:00:52.860> easy

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
the tutorial because it's quite an easy

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.389 
the tutorial because it's quite an easy
shape<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.730> customize<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.860> does<00:00:56.010> get<00:00:56.160> used

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
shape to customize and it does get used

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.389 
shape to customize and it does get used
quite<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.670> lot<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:58.559> uh<00:00:58.920> basically<00:01:00.199> I<00:01:01.309> want<00:01:02.309> to

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
quite a lot so uh basically I want to

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.820 
quite a lot so uh basically I want to
cut<00:01:02.609> out<00:01:02.820> some<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.239> these<00:01:03.329> layers<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.470> maybe

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
cut out some of these layers so maybe

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.240 
cut out some of these layers so maybe
bottom<00:01:05.610> layer<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.350> as<00:01:07.350> lay<00:01:07.530> around<00:01:07.650> here<00:01:08.040> and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
bottom layer just as lay around here and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.270 
bottom layer just as lay around here and
maybe<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.790> layer<00:01:09.000> up<00:01:09.330> here<00:01:09.619> so<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.979> first<00:01:11.130> thing

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
maybe a layer up here so the first thing

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.219 
maybe a layer up here so the first thing
that<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.700> do<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.600> make<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.900> editable

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
so that's just a cool shape don't really

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.370 
so that's just a cool shape don't really
know<00:02:02.119> what<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:02.360> is<00:02:02.509> but<00:02:03.700> that's<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.970> first<00:02:05.380> tip

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
know what it is but that's the first tip

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.620 
know what it is but that's the first tip
for<00:02:07.070> modeling<00:02:07.460> being<00:02:08.060> able<00:02:08.239> to<00:02:08.360> delete

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
for modeling being able to delete

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.220

certain<00:02:09.020> sections<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:09.770> a<00:02:09.860> shape<00:02:10.069> and<00:02:11.230> i'm

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
certain sections of a shape and i'm

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.580 
certain sections of a shape and i'm
going<00:02:12.349> to<00:02:12.410> show<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:13.489> other<00:02:13.610> tip<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.590> this

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
going to show you how to cut bits out of

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.509 
going to show you how to cut bits out of
shapes<00:02:22.790> using<00:02:23.150> other<00:02:23.480> shapes<00:02:23.830> so<00:02:24.830> i'm<00:02:25.400> going

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
shapes using other shapes so i'm going

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.100 
shapes using other shapes so i'm going
to<00:02:25.580> get<00:02:25.730> cube<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.769> i'm<00:02:27.769> going<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.930> squish<00:02:29.930> it

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
to get cube and i'm going to squish it

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:38.229 
to get cube and i'm going to squish it
down<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.349> bit<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:31.600> elongate<00:02:32.600> it<00:02:35.080> we<00:02:36.080> go<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:37.239> now

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
down a bit and elongate it we go and now

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.640 
down a bit and elongate it we go and now
basically<00:02:38.930> what<00:02:39.170> i<00:02:39.260> want<00:02:39.560> is<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:41.049> hole<00:02:42.049> straight

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
basically what i want is a hole straight

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.920 
basically what i want is a hole straight
through<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:43.010> middle<00:02:43.040> right<00:02:43.519> about<00:02:43.760> here<00:02:44.030> so

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
through the middle right about here so

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.930 
through the middle right about here so
kind<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.350> kind<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.370> like<00:02:46.459> a<00:02:46.489> plank<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:46.880> wood

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
kind of kind of like a plank of wood

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.900 
kind of kind of like a plank of wood
with<00:02:47.209> a<00:02:47.239> hole<00:02:47.450> in<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.720> so<00:02:48.709> I'm<00:02:48.980> going<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.190> find<00:02:49.819> a

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
with a hole in it so I'm going to find a

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.000 
with a hole in it so I'm going to find a
sheet<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:50.420> will<00:02:50.540> make<00:02:50.690> a<00:02:50.720> hole<00:02:51.019> that's<00:02:51.830> a

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
sheet that will make a hole that's a

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.580 
sheet that will make a hole that's a
cylinder<00:02:52.810> that'll<00:02:53.810> go<00:02:53.900> straight<00:02:54.290> through<00:02:54.500> the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
cylinder that'll go straight through the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.009 
cylinder that'll go straight through the
middle<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:55.780> then<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:56.930> want<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:57.230> come<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.830> this

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
middle and then you want to come to this

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.900 
middle and then you want to come to this
menu<00:03:00.019> here<00:03:00.319> this<00:03:00.620> option<00:03:01.040> it's<00:03:01.580> kind<00:03:01.670> of<00:03:01.760> like

hold and select a bool click that and

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.830 
hold and select a bool click that and
you<00:03:09.440> want<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:09.650> make<00:03:09.739> sure<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:10.100> shape<00:03:10.370> that

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
you want to make sure the shape that

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.810 
you want to make sure the shape that
you're<00:03:11.840> using<00:03:12.049> to<00:03:12.200> cut<00:03:12.470> out<00:03:12.709> is<00:03:12.980> at<00:03:13.519> the<00:03:13.609> very

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
you're using to cut out is at the very

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.530 
you're using to cut out is at the very
bottom<00:03:14.090> of<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:15.079> order<00:03:16.010> so<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.850> cylinder<00:03:17.329> is

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
bottom of the order so the cylinder is

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.599 
bottom of the order so the cylinder is
what<00:03:17.750> I'm<00:03:17.870> cutting<00:03:18.320> out<00:03:18.530> of<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:19.040> object<00:03:19.430> so

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
what I'm cutting out of the object so

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.009 
what I'm cutting out of the object so
the<00:03:19.730> cylinder<00:03:20.090> goes<00:03:20.209> on<00:03:20.359> the<00:03:20.450> bottom<00:03:20.600> you

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
the cylinder goes on the bottom you

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.009 
the cylinder goes on the bottom you
don't<00:03:21.890> want<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.100> select<00:03:22.400> both<00:03:23.209> of<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.600> objects

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
don't want to select both of the objects

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.670 
don't want to select both of the objects
and<00:03:24.320> drag<00:03:25.250> them<00:03:25.430> up<00:03:25.579> into<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.209> bull<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:27.470> as

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
and drag them up into the bull and as

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.599 
and drag them up into the bull and as
you<00:03:27.769> can<00:03:27.890> see<00:03:27.920> my<00:03:28.250> cylinder<00:03:28.609> has<00:03:29.570> disappeared

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
you can see my cylinder has disappeared

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.509 
you can see my cylinder has disappeared
and<00:03:31.609> now<00:03:31.850> you<00:03:32.480> can<00:03:32.630> click<00:03:32.810> on<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.049> bull<00:03:33.519> press

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
and now you can click on the bull press

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.210 
and now you can click on the bull press
C<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.350> that<00:03:36.350> kind<00:03:36.530> of<00:03:36.560> just<00:03:36.709> groups<00:03:36.920> them<00:03:37.130> all

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
C and that kind of just groups them all

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.490 
C and that kind of just groups them all
together<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:37.790> if<00:03:38.570> you<00:03:38.660> have<00:03:38.750> got<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.930> hole<00:03:39.140> in

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
together and if you have got a hole in

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.460 
together and if you have got a hole in
your<00:03:39.650> plank<00:03:40.239> so<00:03:41.239> obviously<00:03:42.049> i<00:03:42.140> can<00:03:42.319> make

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
your plank so obviously i can make

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.949 
your plank so obviously i can make
several<00:03:42.739> holes<00:03:43.069> all<00:03:43.340> along<00:03:43.609> but<00:03:44.390> this<00:03:44.690> can<00:03:44.870> be

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
several holes all along but this can be

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.539 
several holes all along but this can be
really<00:03:45.230> helpful<00:03:45.350> for<00:03:45.769> modeling<00:03:46.160> just<00:03:46.370> about

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
really helpful for modeling just about

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.460 
really helpful for modeling just about
everything<00:03:46.880> one<00:03:47.840> thing<00:03:48.019> you<00:03:48.109> want<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.350> make

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
everything one thing you want to make

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.050 
everything one thing you want to make
sure<00:03:48.500> you<00:03:48.709> don't<00:03:48.890> do<00:03:49.130> is<00:03:49.370> try<00:03:49.609> and<00:03:49.640> kind<00:03:49.940> of

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
sure you don't do is try and kind of

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.020 
sure you don't do is try and kind of
clean<00:03:50.329> everything<00:03:50.569> up<00:03:50.840> by<00:03:51.530> pulling<00:03:52.100> out<00:03:52.280> the

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
clean everything up by pulling out the

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.050 
clean everything up by pulling out the
queue<00:03:53.299> because<00:03:53.810> if<00:03:54.019> i<00:03:54.109> do<00:03:54.170> that<00:03:54.760> and<00:03:55.760> then

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
queue because if i do that and then

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.210 
queue because if i do that and then
delete<00:03:56.389> that<00:03:57.730> kind<00:03:58.730> of<00:03:58.819> just<00:03:58.940> met

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
delete that kind of just met

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.240 
delete that kind of just met
is<00:03:59.310> everything<00:03:59.730> up<00:03:59.880> and<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:01.590> can<00:04:01.710> see<00:04:01.920> it's

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
is everything up and you can see it's

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.140 
is everything up and you can see it's
now<00:04:02.430> hollow<00:04:02.730> inside<00:04:03.950> so<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.910> want<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.120> make
