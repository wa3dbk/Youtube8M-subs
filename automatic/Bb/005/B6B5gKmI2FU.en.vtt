ratio<00:02:19.000> all<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.239> time<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:20.200> number<00:02:20.590> two<00:02:20.739> is<00:02:20.920> we

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
ratio all the time and number two is we

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.520 
ratio all the time and number two is we
can<00:02:21.610> have<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.790> better<00:02:21.940> drawbar<00:02:22.480> better<00:02:23.170> lorisha
