torpedo<00:00:06.660> ships<00:00:07.080> like<00:00:07.470> this<00:00:07.680> one<00:00:08.059> are<00:00:09.080> so<00:00:10.080> very

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
torpedo ships like this one are so very

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.820 
torpedo ships like this one are so very
crucial<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.700> winning<00:00:11.969> battles<00:00:12.389> in<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.830> campaign

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
crucial to winning battles in a campaign

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.010 
crucial to winning battles in a campaign
or<00:00:14.070> maybe<00:00:14.400> multiplayer<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.389> depends<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:15.839> the

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
or maybe multiplayer it depends on the

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.580 
or maybe multiplayer it depends on the
human<00:00:16.410> but<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.460> could<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:18.029> want<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:19.020> thing

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
human but you could just want this thing

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.830 
human but you could just want this thing
torpedo<00:00:20.010> ships<00:00:20.250> have<00:00:20.400> like<00:00:20.550> four<00:00:21.119> maybe<00:00:21.539> five

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
torpedo ships have like four maybe five

foot<00:00:22.140> Peters<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.529> can't<00:00:22.710> remember<00:00:22.890> exactly

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
foot Peters I can't remember exactly

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.000 
foot Peters I can't remember exactly
when<00:00:24.779> they<00:00:24.869> launched<00:00:25.050> two<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.410> them<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:25.949> you

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
when they launched two of them so you

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.310 
when they launched two of them so you
have<00:00:26.099> about<00:00:26.279> eight<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.910> ten<00:00:27.090> torpedoes<00:00:27.779> which

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
have about eight to ten torpedoes which

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.759 
have about eight to ten torpedoes which
might<00:00:28.650> not<00:00:28.830> seem<00:00:29.039> like<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.220> whole<00:00:29.369> lot<00:00:29.429> but<00:00:30.119> just

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
might not seem like a whole lot but just

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.979 
might not seem like a whole lot but just
a<00:00:31.790> direct<00:00:32.790> hit<00:00:32.969> on<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.239> could<00:00:33.420> sink<00:00:33.630> this

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
a direct hit on this could sink this

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.350 
a direct hit on this could sink this
ship<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.040> most<00:00:35.250> advanced<00:00:36.120> ship

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
ship and this is the most advanced ship

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.790 
ship and this is the most advanced ship

um

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
um

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.500 
um
and<00:00:49.520> that<00:00:50.520> ship<00:00:50.730> was<00:00:50.820> about<00:00:51.059> two<00:00:51.210> thousand

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
and that ship was about two thousand

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.209 
and that ship was about two thousand
dollars<00:00:51.539> base<00:00:52.050> game<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.469> one<00:00:52.649> thousand<00:00:53.070> this

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
dollars base game it's one thousand this

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.130 
dollars base game it's one thousand this
is<00:00:53.370> eighteen<00:00:53.760> thousand<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.379> imagine<00:00:55.620> a

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
is eighteen thousand so just imagine a

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.880 
is eighteen thousand so just imagine a
$1,000<00:00:58.140> yep<00:00:58.500> no<00:00:59.370> $2000<00:01:00.149> ship<00:01:00.510> could<00:01:01.320> destroy

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
$1,000 yep no $2000 ship could destroy

$1,000 yep no $2000 ship could destroy
this<00:01:02.670> huge<00:01:03.149> ironclad<00:01:04.080> warrior<00:01:04.939> that<00:01:05.939> has<00:01:06.150> I

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
this huge ironclad warrior that has I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.620 
this huge ironclad warrior that has I
think<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.200> was<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.850> thousand<00:01:08.850> hulls<00:01:09.180> Frank

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
think it was like a thousand hulls Frank

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.810 
think it was like a thousand hulls Frank
maybe<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:10.080> like<00:01:10.290> something<00:01:11.159> cute<00:01:11.520> number

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
maybe it's like something cute number

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.160 
maybe it's like something cute number
maybe<00:01:12.060> I'm<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.390> forgetting<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.049> as

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
maybe I'm just forgetting that on as

torpedoes and the only one and you could

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.499 
torpedoes and the only one and you could
just<00:01:22.650> already<00:01:23.040> see<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> huge<00:01:23.820> damage<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
just already see the huge damage the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.679 
just already see the huge damage the
other<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.810> hit<00:01:25.080> also<00:01:25.549> actually<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.150> already

other one hit also actually so already
it's<00:01:27.869> down<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> couple<00:01:28.320> guns<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:30.350> great<00:01:31.350> amount

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
it's down a couple guns a great amount

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.890 
it's down a couple guns a great amount
of<00:01:31.740> people<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.700> order<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.270> sound<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.750> made

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
of people in order the sound I just made

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.690 
of people in order the sound I just made
was<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.290> you've<00:01:34.860> already<00:01:35.009> hit<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.250> pretty<00:01:35.520> hard

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
was and you've already hit a pretty hard

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.980 
was and you've already hit a pretty hard
now<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.860> second<00:01:37.860> torpedo<00:01:38.450> it<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.750> smacks

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
now this second torpedo it just smacks

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.780 
now this second torpedo it just smacks
her<00:01:40.229> right<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> hall<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.460> whole<00:01:44.610> ship

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
her right in the hall and the whole ship

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.609 
her right in the hall and the whole ship
blows<00:01:45.030> up<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:46.670> this<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.850> why<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.780> torpedo<00:01:49.320> ship

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
blows up so this is why the torpedo ship

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.920 
blows up so this is why the torpedo ship
is<00:01:49.799> something<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.250> really<00:01:50.820> really<00:01:51.119> want<00:01:51.840> to
