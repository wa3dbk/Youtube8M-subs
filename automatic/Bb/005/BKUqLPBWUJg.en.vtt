00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
things like a taco option which was for

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.179 
things like a taco option which was for
graphics<00:01:22.229> where<00:01:22.500> they<00:01:22.680> could<00:01:22.799> turn<00:01:22.950> something

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
graphics where they could turn something

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.190

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
on or off now what we've done we've

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.840 
on or off now what we've done we've
taken<00:01:25.409> seven<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.100> next<00:01:26.340> level<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.700> they

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
taken seven to the next level and they

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.760 
taken seven to the next level and they
can<00:01:27.000> redefine<00:01:27.360> their<00:01:27.750> entire<00:01:28.110> plain<00:01:28.470> canvas

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.649 
can redefine their entire plain canvas
they<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.610> do<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.030> real<00:01:30.240> time<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
they can do this in real time and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.359 
they can do this in real time and
basically<00:01:31.020> change<00:01:31.409> any<00:01:31.710> element<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
basically change any element of the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.950 
basically change any element of the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
are the challenges when it comes to

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.320 
are the challenges when it comes to
giving<00:02:20.860> so<00:02:21.130> much<00:02:21.250> power<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.880> player<00:02:22.090> in

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
giving so much power to the player in

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.240 
giving so much power to the player in
terms<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:22.990> having<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.440> content<00:02:23.860> there<00:02:24.010> for

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
terms of having the content there for

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.600 
terms of having the content there for
them<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.900> very<00:02:26.170> challenging<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:27.010> what<00:02:27.490> the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
them it is very challenging and what the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.850 
them it is very challenging and what the
design<00:02:27.850> thing<00:02:28.060> didn't<00:02:28.300> want<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.480> do<00:02:28.630> is<00:02:28.959> what<00:02:29.650> I

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
design thing didn't want to do is what I

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.560 
design thing didn't want to do is what I
consider<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.520> cheap<00:02:30.850> illusion<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.510> choice

an<00:04:57.139> effect<00:04:57.260> on<00:04:57.590> the<00:04:58.010> game<00:04:58.130> world<00:04:58.370> and<00:04:58.550> that<00:04:58.610> and

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
an effect on the game world and that and

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.460 
an effect on the game world and that and
the<00:04:59.000> lasting<00:04:59.419> effects<00:04:59.690> on<00:04:59.810> the<00:04:59.840> game<00:05:00.080> world<00:05:00.320> I

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
the lasting effects on the game world I

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.140 
the lasting effects on the game world I
think<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:01.130> key<00:05:01.310> thing<00:05:01.340> we're<00:05:01.700> trying<00:05:01.940> to<00:05:02.030> do

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
think the key thing we're trying to do

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.430 
think the key thing we're trying to do
is<00:05:02.530> sort<00:05:03.530> of<00:05:04.389> rekindle<00:05:05.389> redefine<00:05:06.290> the

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
is sort of rekindle redefine the

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.440 
is sort of rekindle redefine the
relationship<00:05:07.010> between<00:05:07.160> the<00:05:07.460> game<00:05:07.639> and<00:05:07.970> their

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
relationship between the game and their

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.540 
relationship between the game and their
game<00:05:08.600> can<00:05:09.320> you<00:05:09.410> talk<00:05:09.560> about<00:05:09.590> words<00:05:10.160> therefore

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
game can you talk about words therefore

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.430 
game can you talk about words therefore
