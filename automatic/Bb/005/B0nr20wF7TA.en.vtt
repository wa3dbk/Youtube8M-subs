the owl has too forward and too bad

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.200 
the owl has too forward and too bad
giving<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.500> very<00:00:37.500> very<00:00:37.860> savage<00:00:38.309> pizza<00:00:38.850> me

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
giving it a very very savage pizza me

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.060 
giving it a very very savage pizza me
but<00:00:39.390> when<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.600> kills<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.110> prey<00:00:40.350> catches<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
but when it kills the prey catches the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.010 
but when it kills the prey catches the
prey<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:42.000> that's<00:00:42.120> his<00:00:42.300> first<00:00:42.510> secret<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
prey so that's his first secret the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.720 
prey so that's his first secret the
second<00:00:43.350> circuit<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> wings<00:00:44.190> now<00:00:44.520> other

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
second circuit is in the wings now other

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.549 
second circuit is in the wings now other
birds<00:00:45.000> when<00:00:45.600> they<00:00:45.629> beat<00:00:45.870> their<00:00:46.050> wings<00:00:46.230> it

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
birds when they beat their wings it

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.790 
birds when they beat their wings it
makes<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.890> noise<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.780> that<00:00:48.780> would<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:48.960> a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
makes a noise and that would be a

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.090 
makes a noise and that would be a
giveaway<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:50.910> now<00:00:51.090> hovering<00:00:52.020> above<00:00:52.590> small

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
giveaway for now hovering above small

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.189 
giveaway for now hovering above small
prey<00:00:53.430> with<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.210> prey<00:00:54.420> would<00:00:54.570> hear<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.079> owl

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
prey with the prey would hear the owl

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.150 
prey with the prey would hear the owl
but<00:00:56.129> owls<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.610> evolved<00:00:57.180> silent<00:00:58.140> wings<00:00:58.379> they

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
but owls have evolved silent wings they

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.220 
but owls have evolved silent wings they
can<00:00:59.370> beat<00:00:59.609> their<00:00:59.850> wings<00:01:00.000> without<00:01:00.300> any<00:01:00.690> noise

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
can beat their wings without any noise

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.100 
can beat their wings without any noise
at<00:01:01.260> all<00:01:01.680> because<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.480> ends<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> feathers

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
at all because the ends of the feathers

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.670 
at all because the ends of the feathers
have<00:01:04.799> become<00:01:05.460> soft<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:07.049> only<00:01:07.200> trouble<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.560> of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
have become soft the only trouble is of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.460 
have become soft the only trouble is of
course<00:01:07.770> its<00:01:08.270> needs<00:01:09.270> much<00:01:09.450> more<00:01:09.479> energy<00:01:10.020> to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
course its needs much more energy to

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.289 
course its needs much more energy to
keep<00:01:10.650> beating<00:01:11.070> those<00:01:11.220> wings<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.119> worth

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
keep beating those wings but it's worth

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.350 
keep beating those wings but it's worth
it<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.780> owl<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.409> be<00:01:13.530> completely<00:01:13.920> silent

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
it for the owl to be completely silent

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.109 
it for the owl to be completely silent
now<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.420> ears<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:17.040> ears<00:01:17.280> are<00:01:17.729> extraordinary

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
now the ears the ears are extraordinary

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.520 
now the ears the ears are extraordinary
because<00:01:18.509> one<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.780> higher<00:01:19.020> than<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> other

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
because one is higher than the other

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.620 
because one is higher than the other
that<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.799> symmetrical<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.759> they're

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that is symmetrical and they're

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.719 
that is symmetrical and they're
incredibly<00:01:22.170> sensitive<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:23.600> these<00:01:24.600> ears<00:01:24.900> are

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
incredibly sensitive and these ears are

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.160 
incredibly sensitive and these ears are
in<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.909> different<00:01:27.299> position<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:27.990> the

in a different position so that the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.350 
in a different position so that the
Cylons<00:01:28.500> hit<00:01:28.860> them<00:01:29.100> at<00:01:29.369> different<00:01:29.549> times<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
Cylons hit them at different times and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.690 
Cylons hit them at different times and
they're<00:01:30.869> capable<00:01:31.170> believe<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.040> or<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.220> of

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
they're capable believe it or not of

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.260 
they're capable believe it or not of
distinguishing<00:01:33.799> 130<00:01:34.799> millionth<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.729> second

in arrival of sounds at their ears and

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.010 
in arrival of sounds at their ears and
with<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.860> ability<00:01:41.520> they're<00:01:41.909> able<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.570> this

with this ability they're able and this

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.170 
with this ability they're able and this
has<00:01:43.140> been<00:01:43.290> proved<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.740> experiments<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.850> hunt

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
has been proved in experiments to hunt

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.010 
has been proved in experiments to hunt
in<00:01:45.420> pitch<00:01:45.990> darkness<00:01:46.520> just<00:01:47.520> by<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.180> sound<00:01:48.570> of

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
in pitch darkness just by the sound of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.100 
in pitch darkness just by the sound of
the<00:01:49.950> mouse<00:01:50.159> as<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.610> rustles<00:01:51.479> around<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.990> the

the mouse as it rustles around on the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.420 
the mouse as it rustles around on the
ground<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:53.520> they<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:53.759> incredible<00:01:53.909> hearing

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
ground so they have incredible hearing

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.700 
ground so they have incredible hearing
in<00:01:56.430> addition<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.540> course<00:01:57.810> their

in addition to that of course their
crowning<00:01:59.100> glory<00:01:59.490> are<00:01:59.700> their<00:01:59.820> eyes<00:02:00.060> as

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
crowning glory are their eyes as

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.080 
crowning glory are their eyes as
enormous<00:02:01.200> eyes<00:02:01.560> which<00:02:02.430> will<00:02:02.549> come<00:02:02.729> from<00:02:02.969> the

so that in the dim light because the owl

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.990 
so that in the dim light because the owl
is<00:02:15.300> 30<00:02:15.990> times<00:02:16.350> better<00:02:16.710> in<00:02:17.160> dim<00:02:17.520> light<00:02:17.700> than<00:02:17.880> you

wise was of course it's a trick it's

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.420 
wise was of course it's a trick it's
