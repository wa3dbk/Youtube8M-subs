00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.260 
do also get rather dehydrated when it's
cold<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:32.220> third<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.670> final<00:01:33.000> thing<00:01:33.030> I'd

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
cold out the third and final thing I'd

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.940 
cold out the third and final thing I'd
like<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.540> discuss<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:34.079> with<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.590> a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
like to discuss here with you is a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.280 
like to discuss here with you is a
rather<00:01:35.189> important<00:01:35.670> one<00:01:35.850> now<00:01:36.630> those<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.110> you

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
rather important one now those of you

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.200 
rather important one now those of you
who<00:01:37.439> don't<00:01:37.740> already<00:01:38.100> charge<00:01:38.640> your<00:01:38.850> batteries

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
who don't already charge your batteries

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.999 
who don't already charge your batteries
fully<00:01:39.509> you're<00:01:39.930> really<00:01:40.200> gonna<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.799> start

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
fully you're really gonna have to start

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.859 
fully you're really gonna have to start
to<00:01:41.189> do<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.850> winter<00:01:42.210> because<00:01:42.540> cold

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
to do this for winter because cold

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.990 
to do this for winter because cold
causes<00:01:43.409> batteries<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.009> die<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> bit<00:01:44.640> quicker

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
causes batteries to die a bit quicker

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.880 
causes batteries to die a bit quicker
those<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.930> still<00:01:46.170> running<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> trickle

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
those of you still running a trickle

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.440 
those of you still running a trickle
charger<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.490> would<00:01:47.670> highly<00:01:48.000> recommend<00:01:48.030> you

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
charger I would highly recommend you

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.359 
charger I would highly recommend you
perhaps<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:48.960> pick<00:01:49.259> up<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.500> smart<00:01:49.829> charger<00:01:50.220> for

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
perhaps just pick up a smart charger for

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.429 
perhaps just pick up a smart charger for
these<00:01:50.520> winter<00:01:50.790> months<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.930> your<00:01:52.079> battery

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
these winter months so that your battery

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.230 
these winter months so that your battery
is<00:01:52.500> actually<00:01:53.040> fully<00:01:53.280> charged<00:01:53.759> as<00:01:53.880> opposed<00:01:54.149> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
is actually fully charged as opposed to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.080 
is actually fully charged as opposed to
your<00:01:54.390> guesswork<00:01:54.840> with<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.470> trickle<00:01:55.770> charge

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
your guesswork with the trickle charge

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.730 
your guesswork with the trickle charge
now<00:01:57.090> during<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.810> winter<00:01:58.049> months<00:01:58.079> batteries

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
now during the winter months batteries

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.560 
now during the winter months batteries
traditionally<00:01:59.250> die<00:01:59.549> faster<00:02:00.149> because<00:02:00.420> they're

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
traditionally die faster because they're

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.899 
traditionally die faster because they're
more<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:00.960> exposed<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.770> cold<00:02:02.040> cold<00:02:02.490> bites

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
more so exposed to the cold cold bites

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.090 
more so exposed to the cold cold bites
into<00:02:03.329> them<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.659> therefore<00:02:03.810> they<00:02:04.229> die<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.829> bit

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
into them and therefore they die a bit

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.740 
into them and therefore they die a bit
quicker<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.670> can't<00:02:06.090> tell<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.270> how<00:02:06.360> many<00:02:06.450> times

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
quicker I can't tell you how many times

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.020 
quicker I can't tell you how many times
this<00:02:07.020> has<00:02:07.170> happened<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.560> myself<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.550> various
