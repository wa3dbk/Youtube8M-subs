00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:13.290
 the trends you have to start from this 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.690
 all of you are now winter 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.190
 surely you know how much fashion goes 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.020
 in a range of requests 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.880
 because the request for customization 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.990
 today it is more extensive is actually a little 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.240
 false in that sense 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.949
 in the sense that countries are diktats 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.320
 of images that lead you to 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.270
 choose a certain type of product 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.829
 final I'm not talking about make-up product 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.719
 of product for what concerns the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.309
 resultant of the face when not 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.510
 everyone can afford it to her 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.489
 the need for the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.739
 personalization but this comes from 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.710
 culture of each of you of course but 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.739
 especially by the intelligence of kg of 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.230
 closed to products , there are fashions 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.719
 this year is is you know one well 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.160
 an address around 50 60 but for the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.430
 winter make-up for example yes 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.840
 it aims a lot on the belle epoque 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.660
 so back on one eye a lot 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.979
 intense with a slightly rounded shape 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.659
 a slight nuance under the eye 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.400
 also using color so not one 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.860
 sort of smokey that we are used to 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.320
 use with the beautiful shaded black effect 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.270
 maybe open but a layer like it 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.890
 They were the women of the twenties 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.270
 20's silent movie divas 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.670
 because women don't wear make-up 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.890
 at the time actually also through the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.970
 color then dark blue blue green notes 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.009
 dark 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.630
 if you want to use it also with a plum 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.329
 very dark mixture from always with a 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.180
 dark bronze gives me a sort of image 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.619
 almost reflected a very dreamy effect 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.299
 as well as black if you want it 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.350
 use together with the gray on the eyes 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.350
 very clear for example or on the blue and 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.240
 to seal this the dark lipsticks 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.790
 so here comes a new image 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.979
 on a very clear complexion 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.560
 Americans use are very embodied 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.729
 blogging effect we use on a 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.409
 incarnate matte effect 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.360
 we also start using some of the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.119
 Illuminati used on the areas of the cheekbone 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.890
 be careful if you have wrinkles what is the 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.390
 substantial difference today in the product 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.429
 which products are clearly much more 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.470
 light create brighter effects less 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.140
 covering but for example for eye shadows 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.600
 to create this kind of effect yes 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.820
 they use 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.840
 wet-effect eyeshadows and then 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.950
 this effect much talked about a land 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.050
 particular that almost creates an effect of 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.640
 almost crystal light reflection for 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.500
 whose eyeshadow effect looks like a 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.510
 wet eyeshadow then here 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.120
 technological innovation in this case 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.440
 in a product that goes to call a 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.450
 twenties effect but you pass 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.880
 through a door that the absolute one 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.650
 of innovation on the other hand for whom 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.780
 does not want to use this type of 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.910
 product has the effect of 50 years 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.500
 sixty then a very light make-up 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.910
 on the eyelid without color with a 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.390
 very thin eyeliner for the effect 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.370
 50s a lipstick with coral colors 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.200
 if you want to maintain a 50s effect 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.270
 if you want to push a little more 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.770
 towards the belle epoque a reuse is used 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.690
 dark color or alternatively a 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.070
 eyeliner more often instead with one 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.200
 kitchen to recall the effects of years 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.060
 sixty for every winter we are here and there 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.060
 we push right towards the belle epoque
