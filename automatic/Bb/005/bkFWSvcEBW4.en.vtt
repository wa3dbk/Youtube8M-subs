I<00:01:35.040> simply<00:01:36.030> had<00:01:36.270> someone<00:01:36.659> build<00:01:36.869> me<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> frame

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
I simply had someone build me a frame

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.670

around<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.159> wall<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.700> then<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.540> took<00:01:39.810> wire<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
around the wall and then I took wire and

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.859 
around the wall and then I took wire and
made<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.369> into<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.579> crisscross<00:01:41.850> pattern<00:01:42.060> after

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.139 
made it into a crisscross pattern after
that<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.799> simply<00:01:44.159> plan<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.700> Confederate

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
that I simply plan it Confederate

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.090

Jasmine along the bottom of the wall and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.719 
Jasmine along the bottom of the wall and
as<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.759> grew<00:01:47.970> out<00:01:48.000> into<00:01:48.960> long<00:01:49.170> stalks<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:50.159> simply

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
as it grew out into long stalks I simply

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.359 
as it grew out into long stalks I simply
wrapped<00:01:51.000> him<00:01:51.210> around<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:52.290> trellis<00:01:52.710> wire<00:01:52.979> and

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
wrapped him around the trellis wire and

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.660 
wrapped him around the trellis wire and
it<00:01:54.060> formed<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.540> frame<00:01:54.890> within<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.070> year<00:01:56.430> we

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670
