work<00:00:23.810> there's<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> few<00:00:24.990> things<00:00:25.170> up<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.920> put<00:00:26.310> a

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
work there's a few things up and put a

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.790 
work there's a few things up and put a
picture<00:00:26.640> up<00:00:26.849> right<00:00:27.150> now

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.680 

and<00:00:31.609> you<00:00:32.059> can<00:00:32.239> see<00:00:32.509> that<00:00:32.540> there<00:00:32.960> is<00:00:34.120> a<00:00:35.120> bead

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
and you can see that there is a bead

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.869 
and you can see that there is a bead
some<00:00:36.350> split<00:00:36.680> shots<00:00:38.050> your<00:00:39.050> hook<00:00:39.739> bobber<00:00:40.430> and

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
some split shots your hook bobber and

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.900 
some split shots your hook bobber and
then<00:00:41.690> two<00:00:41.930> separate<00:00:42.320> knots<00:00:42.530> at<00:00:42.769> the<00:00:42.949> end<00:00:43.100> they

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
then two separate knots at the end they

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.979 
then two separate knots at the end they
have<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.180> same<00:00:44.920> purpose<00:00:45.920> so<00:00:46.870> even<00:00:47.870> one<00:00:47.960> of

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
have the same purpose so even one of

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.439 
have the same purpose so even one of
those<00:00:48.110> works<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:49.430> one<00:00:49.610> that's<00:00:49.790> pink<00:00:50.180> or<00:00:50.420> red

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
those works the one that's pink or red

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.500 
those works the one that's pink or red
that<00:00:51.170> works<00:00:51.409> the<00:00:51.589> best<00:00:51.769> and<00:00:52.300> that's<00:00:53.300> what

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
that works the best and that's what

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.270 
that works the best and that's what
we're<00:00:53.690> going<00:00:53.870> to<00:00:53.930> start<00:00:54.110> with<00:00:56.890> they<00:00:57.890> come<00:00:58.159> in<00:00:58.190> a

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
we're going to start with they come in a

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:07.109 
we're going to start with they come in a
little<00:00:58.430> line<00:01:05.050> has<00:01:06.050> like<00:01:06.200> four<00:01:06.410> or<00:01:06.500> five<00:01:06.530> hosing

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
little line has like four or five hosing

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.400 
little line has like four or five hosing
first<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:08.300> first<00:01:08.509> thing<00:01:08.720> going<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:08.929> do<00:01:08.990> is<00:01:09.140> put

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
first the first thing going to do is put

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.690 
first the first thing going to do is put
your<00:01:09.440> line<00:01:09.850> in<00:01:10.850> one<00:01:10.910> of<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.330> end<00:01:11.509> hose<00:01:12.700> next

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
your line in one of the end hose next

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.410 
your line in one of the end hose next
thing<00:01:13.880> is<00:01:13.910> you<00:01:14.300> want<00:01:14.539> to<00:01:14.710> spin<00:01:15.710> it<00:01:15.740> once<00:01:16.420> and

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
thing is you want to spin it once and

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.590 
thing is you want to spin it once and
put<00:01:17.750> your<00:01:17.929> line<00:01:18.080> back<00:01:18.380> through<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:20.240> bottom

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
put your line back through the bottom

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.850 
put your line back through the bottom
hoe<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:21.830> opposite<00:01:22.220> end<00:01:22.460> on<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.750> backside

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.000 

so<00:01:28.550> it<00:01:28.700> makes<00:01:28.880> twist<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:30.380> can<00:01:30.530> might<00:01:30.740> not<00:01:30.890> be

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
so it makes twist you can might not be

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.610 
so it makes twist you can might not be
able<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.190> see<00:01:31.430> that<00:01:31.900> what<00:01:32.900> you<00:01:33.020> see<00:01:33.230> how<00:01:33.410> it's

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
able to see that what you see how it's

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.620 
able to see that what you see how it's
twisted<00:01:34.100> that<00:01:34.700> keeps<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.060> from<00:01:35.180> sliding<00:01:35.390> up

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
twisted that keeps it from sliding up

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.100 
twisted that keeps it from sliding up
and<00:01:35.690> down<00:01:36.430> you're<00:01:37.430> on<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.640> fish<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.180> your

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
and down you're on the fish and your

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
and down you're on the fish and your
depth<00:01:39.520> moves<00:01:40.520> well<00:01:41.330> you're<00:01:41.450> now<00:01:41.540> an<00:01:41.600> efficient

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
depth moves well you're now an efficient

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.930 
depth moves well you're now an efficient
so<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.790> slip<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:46.130> whole<00:01:46.400> point<00:01:46.610> is<00:01:46.760> the

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
so the slip the whole point is the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.480 
so the slip the whole point is the
bobber<00:01:47.150> is<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:48.260> you<00:01:48.380> have<00:01:48.470> not<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.860> top<00:01:49.070> but

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
bobber is that you have not the top but

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.940 
bobber is that you have not the top but
not<00:01:49.700> could<00:01:50.000> go<00:01:50.150> inside<00:01:50.600> your<00:01:50.810> real<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.290> you

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
not could go inside your real and you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.469 
not could go inside your real and you
could<00:01:52.100> fish<00:01:52.340> as<00:01:52.550> deep<00:01:52.729> as<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:52.970> want<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:53.300> just

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
could fish as deep as you want you just

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.380 
could fish as deep as you want you just
adjust<00:01:53.570> this<00:01:54.080> for<00:01:54.350> your<00:01:55.100> depth<00:01:55.340> it's<00:01:56.150> a<00:01:56.210> lot

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
adjust this for your depth it's a lot

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.450 
adjust this for your depth it's a lot
different<00:01:56.570> than<00:01:56.840> using<00:01:57.050> the<00:01:57.229> clip-on<00:01:58.070> bobbers

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
different than using the clip-on bobbers

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.130 
different than using the clip-on bobbers
because<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:58.910> can't<00:01:59.180> really<00:01:59.360> just<00:01:59.720> your<00:01:59.900> depth

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
because you can't really just your depth

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.070 
because you can't really just your depth
you<00:02:00.320> can<00:02:00.520> but<00:02:01.520> you<00:02:01.880> can't<00:02:02.270> go<00:02:02.630> more<00:02:02.810> than<00:02:02.869> 10

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
you can but you can't go more than 10

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.440 
you can but you can't go more than 10
feet<00:02:03.290> because<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:03.680> can't<00:02:03.860> recast<00:02:04.190> it<00:02:04.400> you<00:02:05.180> try

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
feet because you can't recast it you try

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.120 
feet because you can't recast it you try
but<00:02:05.810> you<00:02:05.990> can<00:02:06.170> get<00:02:06.290> you<00:02:06.560> can't<00:02:06.770> do<00:02:06.860> very<00:02:07.100> good

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
but you can get you can't do very good

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.130 
but you can get you can't do very good
up<00:02:07.810> put<00:02:08.810> your<00:02:08.899> not<00:02:09.050> on<00:02:09.310> slide<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.489> up<00:02:10.610> some<00:02:11.140> put

these over and over and over they get a

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.930 
these over and over and over they get a

little cut in them and their keep from
your<00:02:26.300> sinkers<00:02:26.690> taking<00:02:27.050> a<00:02:27.080> line<00:02:27.260> down<00:02:27.489> so<00:02:28.489> you

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
your sinkers taking a line down so you

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.850 
your sinkers taking a line down so you
could<00:02:28.760> use<00:02:29.000> these<00:02:29.239> they<00:02:29.630> do<00:02:29.900> pretty<00:02:30.290> good<00:02:30.440> just

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
could use these they do pretty good just

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.250 
could use these they do pretty good just
not<00:02:31.040> for<00:02:31.430> days<00:02:32.330> on<00:02:32.510> end<00:02:32.540> internal<00:02:32.989> fishing
