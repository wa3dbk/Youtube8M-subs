00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
that we could use a different kind of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.090 
that we could use a different kind of
dynamic<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.390> can't<00:01:03.540> require<00:01:03.869> tuners<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.860> could

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
dynamic it can't require tuners it could

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.130 
dynamic it can't require tuners it could
be<00:01:05.280> faster<00:01:05.700> could<00:01:05.909> not<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> ones<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.049> we

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
be faster could not but the ones that we

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.240 
be faster could not but the ones that we
were<00:01:07.260> getting<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> ones<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.130> knew

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
were getting and the ones that we knew

ok<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.870> think<00:03:06.900> if<00:03:07.200> Konami<00:03:07.560> would<00:03:07.830> have<00:03:07.950> just

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
ok you think if Konami would have just

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.460 
ok you think if Konami would have just
left<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.580> synchros<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.720> know<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.020> tuners

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
left the synchros you know the tuners

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.470 
left the synchros you know the tuners
and<00:03:10.500> everything<00:03:11.310> off<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.790> band<00:03:12.030> list<00:03:12.330> that

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
and everything off the band list that

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.720 
and everything off the band list that
they<00:03:12.600> just<00:03:12.840> need<00:03:13.049> to<00:03:13.170> change<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:14.190> synchros

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
they just need to change that synchros

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.800 
they just need to change that synchros
would<00:03:14.910> still<00:03:15.150> have<00:03:15.299> a<00:03:15.330> fighting<00:03:15.660> chance

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
would still have a fighting chance

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.800 
would still have a fighting chance
against<00:03:16.590> their<00:03:17.220> exceed<00:03:17.489> counterparts<00:03:18.090> or<00:03:18.630> do

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
against their exceed counterparts or do

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.270 
against their exceed counterparts or do
you<00:03:18.900> think<00:03:19.170> they<00:03:19.350> are<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.680> way<00:03:19.830> in<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.040> past

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
you think they are the way in the past

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.820 
you think they are the way in the past
and<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.420> guess<00:03:21.600> that's<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:22.019> for<00:03:22.049> this<00:03:22.290> week<00:03:22.500> this

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
and I guess that's it for this week this

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.150 
and I guess that's it for this week this
is<00:03:22.950> like<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.310> guy<00:03:23.430> out
