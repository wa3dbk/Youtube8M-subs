00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
have to really think about that I mean

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
it was so compelling it's just on the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.190 
it was so compelling it's just on the
edge<00:01:59.790> easy<00:02:00.210> because<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.540> was<00:02:00.719> just<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:00.930> holy

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
edge easy because I was just so holy

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.149 
edge easy because I was just so holy
when<00:02:01.649> I'll<00:02:01.770> kind<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.189> thing<00:02:02.479> I<00:02:03.950> really<00:02:04.950> have<00:02:05.070> to

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159
