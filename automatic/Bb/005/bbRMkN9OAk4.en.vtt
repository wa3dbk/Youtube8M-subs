with just what you see in your hand all
right<00:00:30.170> now<00:00:30.380> here's<00:00:30.530> how<00:00:30.650> you<00:00:30.710> do<00:00:30.890> it<00:00:31.010> first

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
right now here's how you do it first

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.580 
right now here's how you do it first
thing<00:00:32.090> you<00:00:32.150> do<00:00:32.270> is<00:00:32.390> you<00:00:32.510> establish<00:00:33.020> what<00:00:33.379> your

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
thing you do is you establish what your

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.500 
thing you do is you establish what your
sweep<00:00:33.860> is<00:00:34.040> gonna<00:00:34.220> be<00:00:34.430> in<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:34.699> landscape<00:00:35.239> and

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
sweep is gonna be in the landscape and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.560 
sweep is gonna be in the landscape and
you<00:00:36.199> plant<00:00:36.500> your<00:00:36.739> feet<00:00:36.980> wide<00:00:37.340> and<00:00:37.790> make<00:00:38.330> sure

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
you plant your feet wide and make sure

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.290 
you plant your feet wide and make sure
the<00:00:38.809> alignment<00:00:39.110> on<00:00:39.530> your<00:00:39.800> feet<00:00:40.070> is<00:00:40.250> 90<00:00:40.970> degrees

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
the alignment on your feet is 90 degrees

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.600 
the alignment on your feet is 90 degrees
perpendicular<00:00:41.660> with<00:00:42.559> the<00:00:42.739> center<00:00:43.070> of<00:00:43.220> the

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
perpendicular with the center of the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.720 
perpendicular with the center of the
sweep<00:00:43.880> as<00:00:44.120> you<00:00:44.360> intend<00:00:44.750> to<00:00:44.890> capture<00:00:45.890> then

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
sweep as you intend to capture then

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.670 
sweep as you intend to capture then
obviously<00:00:47.270> you<00:00:47.810> hold<00:00:48.020> your<00:00:48.230> camera<00:00:48.560> and

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
obviously you hold your camera and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.220 
obviously you hold your camera and
vertical<00:00:49.070> position<00:00:49.520> you<00:00:50.239> come<00:00:50.480> up<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:50.899> you<00:00:51.079> do

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
vertical position you come up and you do

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.139 
vertical position you come up and you do
a<00:00:51.260> practice<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:52.220> you<00:00:52.340> just<00:00:52.550> kind<00:00:52.760> of<00:00:52.790> go<00:00:52.940> back

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
a practice and you just kind of go back

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.700 
a practice and you just kind of go back
and<00:00:53.450> forth<00:00:53.660> like<00:00:53.780> this<00:00:54.079> you're<00:00:54.290> not<00:00:54.380> taking

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
and forth like this you're not taking

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.650 
and forth like this you're not taking
any<00:00:54.890> pictures<00:00:55.220> you're<00:00:55.640> just<00:00:55.820> looking<00:00:56.300> at<00:00:56.450> your

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
any pictures you're just looking at your

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.780 
any pictures you're just looking at your
image<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.170> making<00:00:57.860> sure<00:00:58.070> what<00:00:58.309> you<00:00:58.460> want<00:00:58.700> to

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790

image and making sure what you want to
include<00:00:59.000> in<00:00:59.630> it<00:00:59.780> then<00:01:00.590> you<00:01:00.770> come<00:01:00.980> back<00:01:01.219> to<00:01:02.090> the

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
include in it then you come back to the

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.540 
include in it then you come back to the
very<00:01:02.420> beginning<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.020> you<00:01:03.079> always<00:01:03.320> go<00:01:03.620> left<00:01:04.040> to

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
very beginning and you always go left to

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.920 
very beginning and you always go left to
right<00:01:05.950> so<00:01:06.950> let's<00:01:07.130> move<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.490> strap<00:01:07.910> and<00:01:08.840> you

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
right so let's move the strap and you

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.980 
right so let's move the strap and you
take<00:01:09.140> your<00:01:09.350> left<00:01:10.280> arm<00:01:10.550> plant<00:01:11.119> it<00:01:11.300> in<00:01:11.450> your<00:01:11.479> side

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
take your left arm plant it in your side

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.609 
take your left arm plant it in your side
and<00:01:12.670> anchor<00:01:13.670> it<00:01:13.789> and<00:01:14.270> then<00:01:14.720> if<00:01:15.110> you<00:01:15.260> have<00:01:15.470> to

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
and anchor it and then if you have to

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.780 
and anchor it and then if you have to
adjust<00:01:16.150> the<00:01:17.150> zoom<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.750> do<00:01:17.869> that<00:01:18.790> establish

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
adjust the zoom and do that establish

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.600 
adjust the zoom and do that establish
your<00:01:19.970> focus<00:01:20.479> in<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:21.020> most<00:01:21.320> distant<00:01:21.950> part<00:01:22.460> of

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
your focus in the most distant part of

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.810 
your focus in the most distant part of
the<00:01:22.670> image<00:01:23.180> turn<00:01:24.170> off<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.920> automatic<00:01:25.130> focus

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
the image turn off the automatic focus

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.109 
the image turn off the automatic focus
and<00:01:29.200> then<00:01:30.200> as<00:01:30.560> we<00:01:30.770> did<00:01:30.950> previously<00:01:31.119> you're

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
and then as we did previously you're

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.350 
and then as we did previously you're
going<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.330> take<00:01:32.540> two<00:01:32.920> black<00:01:33.920> frames<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.330> that

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
going to take two black frames so that

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.609 
going to take two black frames so that
when<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:35.689> put<00:01:35.900> your<00:01:36.049> images<00:01:36.439> in<00:01:36.590> your

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
when you put your images in your

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.560 
when you put your images in your
software<00:01:37.189> you'll<00:01:37.369> be<00:01:37.520> able<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:37.790> know<00:01:38.000> where

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
software you'll be able to know where

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.719 
software you'll be able to know where
the<00:01:38.720> sequence<00:01:39.080> starts<00:01:39.280> so<00:01:40.280> we're<00:01:40.400> gonna<00:01:40.520> go

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
the sequence starts so we're gonna go

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.289 
the sequence starts so we're gonna go
ahead<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:40.909> start<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:43.610> we<00:01:43.729> take<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.030> first

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
ahead and start and we take the first

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.310 
ahead and start and we take the first
one<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:44.869> you<00:01:44.930> pivot<00:01:45.890> at<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.189> waist<00:01:47.170> pivot<00:01:48.170> at

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
one and you pivot at the waist pivot at

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.840 
one and you pivot at the waist pivot at
the<00:01:48.439> waist<00:01:48.680> your<00:01:49.009> upper<00:01:49.250> body<00:01:49.460> stays

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
the waist your upper body stays

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.020 
the waist your upper body stays
absolutely<00:01:50.150> still<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:51.320> then<00:01:52.220> you<00:01:52.369> visually

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
absolutely still and then you visually

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.179 
absolutely still and then you visually
find<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.659> elements<00:01:54.140> in<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.350> image<00:01:54.680> to<00:01:54.920> give

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
find the elements in the image to give

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.980 
find the elements in the image to give
you<00:01:55.310> 30%<00:01:55.700> overlap<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:56.900> you<00:01:57.409> simply<00:01:57.680> shoot<00:01:58.990> but

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
you 30% overlap and you simply shoot but

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.999 
you 30% overlap and you simply shoot but
notice<00:02:00.439> I'm<00:02:00.710> twisting<00:02:01.280> only<00:02:01.729> at<00:02:01.939> the<00:02:02.060> waist

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.559 

and<00:02:08.009> that's<00:02:08.190> what<00:02:08.399> about<00:02:08.610> five<00:02:08.849> or<00:02:09.000> six<00:02:09.149> images

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
and that's what about five or six images

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.360 
and that's what about five or six images
right<00:02:09.750> there<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.170> that's<00:02:10.619> all<00:02:10.830> there<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.069> to

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
right there and that's all there is to

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.630 
right there and that's all there is to
it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.050 
it
you<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.390> practice<00:02:13.550> sweeping<00:02:14.550> level
