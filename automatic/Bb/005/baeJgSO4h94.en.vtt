of it so I thought that if I chopped it
up<00:01:24.950> tinier<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.009> tinier<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.460> tinier<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.939> would

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
up tinier and tinier and tinier it would

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.240 
up tinier and tinier and tinier it would
eventually<00:01:27.240> disappear<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.619> used<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.950> chop

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250
