someone<00:01:11.340> actually<00:01:11.430> commented<00:01:12.060> me<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.170> I

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
someone actually commented me this and I

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.359

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
think we know about this until I found

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.060 
think we know about this until I found
out<00:01:14.550> but<00:01:14.789> if<00:01:15.149> you<00:01:15.539> get<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.780> villager<00:01:16.289> attract<00:01:16.890> it

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
out but if you get a villager attract it

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.100 
out but if you get a villager attract it
with<00:01:17.250> emeralds<00:01:17.970> they<00:01:18.179> will<00:01:18.330> follow<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.840> just

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
with emeralds they will follow you just

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.320 
with emeralds they will follow you just
the<00:01:19.200> same<00:01:19.410> as<00:01:19.560> mobs<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:20.550> like<00:01:20.940> wheat<00:01:21.210> and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
the same as mobs with like wheat and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.930 
the same as mobs with like wheat and
stuff<00:01:21.679> they<00:01:22.679> will<00:01:22.830> follow<00:01:23.039> you<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.429> they<00:01:23.789> will

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
stuff they will follow you and they will

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.450 
stuff they will follow you and they will
actually<00:01:24.450> build<00:01:24.810> their<00:01:25.380> houses<00:01:25.649> and<00:01:26.280> then

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
actually build their houses and then

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.840 
actually build their houses and then
perhaps<00:01:27.300> if<00:01:27.690> you<00:01:27.780> get<00:01:27.929> another<00:01:28.200> one<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:29.520> has<00:01:29.670> to

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
perhaps if you get another one it has to

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.020 
perhaps if you get another one it has to
be<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.000> male<00:01:30.360> or<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:31.140> female<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.950> make<00:01:32.310> babies<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
be a male or a female to make babies and

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.480 
be a male or a female to make babies and
then<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.659> baby<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.590> know<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.280> just

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
then that baby you know it can is just

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.090 
then that baby you know it can is just
an<00:01:35.640> end<00:01:35.820> never<00:01:36.180> ending<00:01:36.540> life<00:01:36.750> cycle<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.920> two

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
an end never ending life cycle the two

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.890 
an end never ending life cycle the two
village<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.579> only<00:01:38.700> give<00:01:38.909> birth<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.270> babies

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
village can only give birth to babies

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.350 
village can only give birth to babies
but<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.560> think<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.070> babies<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.610> incest<00:01:42.030> which

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
but I think the babies can incest which

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.350 
but I think the babies can incest which
is<00:01:42.450> pretty<00:01:42.600> disgusting<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.710> know<00:01:44.360> we've

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
is pretty disgusting but you know we've

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.100 
is pretty disgusting but you know we've
all<00:01:45.509> been<00:01:45.689> there<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:46.079> think<00:01:46.860> um<00:01:47.689> yeah<00:01:48.689> they<00:01:48.990> just

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110

build<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.439> massive<00:01:49.649> village<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:51.030> is

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
build a massive village and this is

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.480

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
really cool to living okay so the second

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.010 
really cool to living okay so the second
up<00:01:53.610> they<00:01:53.759> actually<00:01:54.180> involves<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.689> Christmas

making a video about this it probably is

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.710 
making a video about this it probably is
getting<00:02:14.160> out<00:02:14.340> there<00:02:14.370> quicker<00:02:15.090> then<00:02:15.540> they'll

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
getting out there quicker then they'll

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.470 
getting out there quicker then they'll
expect<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.459> so<00:02:17.459> it's<00:02:17.610> pretty<00:02:17.820> unfair<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.329> then

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
expect to so it's pretty unfair and then

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.270 
expect to so it's pretty unfair and then
but<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.930> do<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.200> for<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.500> guys<00:02:19.530> really<00:02:19.980> I

but I just do it for you guys really I

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.990 
but I just do it for you guys really I
don't<00:02:20.610> care<00:02:20.760> what<00:02:20.850> happens<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.329> him<00:02:21.570> anyway<00:02:22.410> em

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
don't care what happens to him anyway em

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.630

he's had in snow tipton mountains by
Snowden<00:02:27.060> mantle<00:02:27.329> I<00:02:27.390> think<00:02:27.600> he's<00:02:27.690> adding<00:02:28.019> like

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
Snowden mantle I think he's adding like

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.120 
Snowden mantle I think he's adding like
massive<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.690> snow<00:02:30.690> mountains<00:02:31.320> in<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.650> snow

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
massive and snow mountains in the snow

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.370 
massive and snow mountains in the snow

biomes I actually have a picture of what
Jeb<00:02:34.620> put<00:02:34.920> i<00:02:35.130> think<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.239> was<00:02:36.390> leaked<00:02:36.900> by

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.380 
Jeb put i think it was leaked by
accident<00:02:38.040> i'm<00:02:38.190> not<00:02:38.370> entirely<00:02:38.640> sure<00:02:38.790> might<00:02:39.239> be

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
accident i'm not entirely sure might be

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.160 
accident i'm not entirely sure might be
a<00:02:39.420> myth<00:02:39.629> understand

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
a myth understand

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.070 
a myth understand
in<00:02:40.380> with<00:02:40.590> Mo<00:02:40.800> yang<00:02:41.099> and<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.819> crew<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.420> then

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
in with Mo yang and the crew and then

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.720 
in with Mo yang and the crew and then
what<00:02:43.290> jabo<00:02:43.620> actually<00:02:43.950> wanted<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.220> do<00:02:44.400> but<00:02:44.580> I'm

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
what jabo actually wanted to do but I'm

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.860

he<00:02:44.970> removed<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.599> i<00:02:45.780> think<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.170> was<00:02:46.819> about<00:02:47.870> and

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
he removed it i think it was about and

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.050 
he removed it i think it was about and
two<00:02:49.140> hours<00:02:49.260> later<00:02:49.470> Arthur<00:02:50.250> actually<00:02:50.550> saw<00:02:51.030> it

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
two hours later Arthur actually saw it

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.030 
two hours later Arthur actually saw it
and<00:02:51.420> I'm<00:02:51.630> actually<00:02:51.780> checking<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.530> was<00:02:52.920> shaking

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
like zong but yeah if we pretty course a

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.860 
could I could see it could be a little
bit<00:03:02.010> game-changing<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.880> be<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:02.970> lovely<00:03:03.450> place

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
how to make it I'd have probably

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.080 
how to make it I'd have probably
imagined<00:03:37.709> it<00:03:37.799> would<00:03:37.860> be<00:03:37.920> like<00:03:38.100> some<00:03:38.280> bread<00:03:39.060> and

imagined it would be like some bread and

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.020 
imagined it would be like some bread and
milk<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:40.100> possibly<00:03:41.100> some<00:03:41.250> new<00:03:41.400> items<00:03:41.580> like
