00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 my life is on again today 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.500
 get an inquiry about mine 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.269
 facebook fanpage if I have one 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.769
 I could handle that particular topic 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.370
 I'll just read the message 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.070
 group before 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.440
 hello have often watched his videos 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.779
 and tries to implement things 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.920
 but most of the time the women have me 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.020
 flash off 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.970
 I have two three honest women 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.430
 caught who told me what it was 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.560
 was the one I just had bad breath 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.080
 the others drive me too casually 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.780
 The third one told me that 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.570
 Say what you look like decides who 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.680
 come together character decides who 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:45.440
 Please keep input regarding basics 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.640
 I obviously messed up like that 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.920
 that means the request is now in 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.660
 end effect you have now tried women 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.360
 to partially address her 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.489
 blown off and yes I wanted to go now 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.120
 every case as I understand it now 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:05.640
 Are you asking me more about small ones? 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:08.310
 after little things after so simple 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.909
 things that could change visually 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.830
 or even just one that's not easy 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.450
 worn right at the beginning and now 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.799
 I refer again to the claim 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.290
 So you said in the third woman 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.030
 where always now character from where 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.310
 always decides exactly how you look 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.020
 so who come together so the women 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.079
 obviously a few things 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.790
 said you just had or or that 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.650
 Missed why they just now 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.630
 just did not want to contact you 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.630
 and that's why I have my list now 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.400
 written by 10 facts the the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.259
 actually incredible for some 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.670
 of course are for the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.710
 Of course that can now 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.840
 click away for yes for one or the other 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.880
 others who sometimes failed 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.829
 he could hear it now 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.049
 something also learns just like we already do 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.460
 but said march optically 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.850
 That's why my first failed 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.490
 comes well-groomed outside is incredible 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.929
 importantly that means being washed 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.459
 then maybe that one a bit 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.840
 gel in the hair has if you because of the 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.690
 Type is or just really 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.129
 well-groomed hair body hygiene yet 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.560
 sweat does not smell sweat 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.480
 stains so in the end de daily 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.400
 use 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.239
 yes that would be so point one for the groomed 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.680
 outer then point two nails people too 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.750
 if that feels that is not so important 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.250
 Men's women also look at your hands 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.160
 and then one long with so 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.049
 Fingernails comes then yes that can be 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.579
 the beginning is already a criterion 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.470
 his 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.750
 third reason well-kept and washed 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.430
 clothes depending on the style of course which 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.610
 Clothing does not matter at first 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.920
 but just that it is clean that 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.110
 she does not delete rick is not none 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.940
 great spots so easy 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.379
 really well kept small and no through 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.079
 loaded broken shoes 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.880
 something in the direction of easy and the 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.709
 second woman said you were to her 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.459
 casually dressed you can not do much 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.049
 change it 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.450
 she just was not the type so 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.440
 or you do not have your type there 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.579
 You really can not do that much 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.290
 change because you have to go now 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.760
 Do not dress fancier just because you 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.739
 Maybe you want to appeal to women 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.120
 also chic dresses to stand there 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.040
 I should just look like that 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.109
 it is easy for one to stand up to oneself 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.549
 it really has its clothing style 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.959
 since not with his little one is not 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.940
 satisfied then you can do something 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.040
 change but otherwise ran to you 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.959
 casually dressed well then comes the 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.829
 next the casual types maybe 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.319
 dear fourth point mom has those you 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.560
 Do you have a chat directly ? 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.780
 what is there now on wednesday because of that 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.010
 people are cleaning teeth chewing gum 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.870
 for many, of course 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.000
 some forgot maybe you had 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.160
 the stressful day time from the office directly 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.660
 in the balance land there is also so 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.950
 chewing gum that's just there too 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.650
 bit the routine promote 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.090
 But what in the bag for yes can 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.739
 you quickly from the clearing away so 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.209
 problem 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.140
 50 I personally find the net and 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.629
 does not score from me personally 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.970
 Add behave like please and thank you 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.860
 I get the crisis if I have something for 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.220
 do somebody and he does not say please and 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.380
 Thank you 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.970

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.430
 please and thank you, that's just the way it is 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.380
 basics and I think it's incredible 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.940
 rude if you forget something because 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.750
 I mean when my child is gonna get it 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.260
 That's easy to say thank you 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.090
 a matter of course for the 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.040
 most for some not me personally 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.970
 falling is negative even if you are 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.520
 does not make six overly anti-social 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.080
 language and insults come 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.960
 of course now on the type 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.010
 But me mad the total war from I 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.810
 The crisis when I am with someone 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.200
 entertained and we say the otter 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.200
 wÃ¶rgl full shit help and stop totally 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.419
 many swear words and lasting words 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.110
 that is also a logo for me otherwise 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:46.840
 you can just rewrite or yourself 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.790
 a little bit more cautious 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.229
 express 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.850
 I think it is very important that 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.830
 someone has groomed skin that is called 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.940
 cream the face very important 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.410
 stick with it so finally 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.700
 Skin scales are none 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.889
 dry lips 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.260
 So there's just one tosses 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.080
 lip care on it and hand cream 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.130
 that you just have nice hands 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.320
 that's one point I too 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:12.610
 then made eighth point again 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.200
 theme fragrant japan is of course also with 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.850
 chips thing if you do not have a few format 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.070
 I do not mind my god 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.900
 but when one smells and it always comes 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.289
 Well, I'll lose those too 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.150
 infobox a few might or mine 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.940
 a favorite fragrance and that as of 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.880
 mary kay and his name is turin and the as 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.900
 so unbelievably tasty so I have it 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.220
 not otherwise 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.050
 actually in writing so that is 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.669
 really great tests the x 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.190
 but I laid you this one more time 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.389
 in the infobox ninth point there I have 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.190
 I had to laugh because I had 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.050
 yesterday a message from a reader 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.639
 she wrote me lola I have 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.440
 The other day I do not have to like her 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.570
 I have never had such a guy 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.680
 met and I am annoyed with myself 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.570
 even that I'm at such a 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.770
 triviality on the slopes but with one 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.660
 wallet pays for something 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.430
 had velcro and that was not 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.990
 so cute that she wrote to me 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.940
 them so yes, I just about 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.800
 overlooked that is totally sweet and 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.639
 nice and nice and she just wanted me 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.720
 say it looks so funny 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.919
 and that she actually thinks that 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.600
 adult men do not do that anymore 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.979
 therefore should have the now easy 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.130
 times associated with purely because I quite 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:16.780
 golden from driving yes switched 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.449
 Change the Velcro 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.070
 Wallets are really that way for you 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:24.820
 elementary school and then I had such a 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:26.380
 little bit of male 40 young woman 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.060
 look for a lot here 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.979
 He also had a velcro closure 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.690
 I would be a woman like that 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:34.090
 has raised eyebrows so what's 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.220
 that now or was it while shopping what 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.599
 every house that was another movie that 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.120
 was the actor it's always something 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:41.380
 with no matter in any case has one 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.690
 Velcro portfolio 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.220
 well and tenth comes if you already 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.400
 maybe the woman came to this 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:51.580
 to think and dad home stinking 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.889
 and tidy cars and and where 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.180
 are brooding and dusty and dirty that 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:57.340
 is completely disgusting if you are in such a way 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.409
 real car has to go up and by the way 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.180
 This is not just for the women 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:03.400
 Men's women vacate her 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.440

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.050
 have cars and it's really my 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.789
 car does not always look perfect either 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.090
 So I try my best 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:17.490
 women and men yes you can your cars 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.289

 also read out so many 

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:30.150
 news that many fail 

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:32.340
 that it really is that way now 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.960
 Of course, this sounds like that 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.819
 the small things that just everyone 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.229
 makes but obviously does it 

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:39.120
 not every old person is simply too 

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:41.759
 Hearts and write me the infobox 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.229
 write me before box yes 

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:45.389
 You can also be aware of an infobox 

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:47.099
 write no, write me that 

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:48.509
 comments here the tips are whether we 

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:49.889
 at some point ignored 

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:52.259
 are now have not woken 

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:53.699
 or if you add something to it 

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:55.669
 it could have happened only 

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:58.889
 Maybe the woman said after that 

00:07:55.669 --> 00:08:00.419
 yes yes yes otherwise write me really 

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:01.949
 always the news that maybe so 

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:02.879
 my wednesday video i treat 

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:06.530

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:06.530
