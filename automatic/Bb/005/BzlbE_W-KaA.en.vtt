 percent of the total builds when the natural deployment is obscured 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.570
 Roth was stuck 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.800
 and here comes on it only if you the legal Meike Fries their owners 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.040
 if you first pulled off directly then I'm sorry 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.780
 then it was not allowed to play along with it, but that's fine too 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.870
 Mai Kreft 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.090

 Punkt says Treffpunkt eV 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.430
 Address will then be sent again to a letter 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.369
 I was told in my last video that's been pretty lately 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.200
 aggressive when real videos down AP in the last video shows that he 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.200
 stand celebrities for the best there are only ditched annotated 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:20.119
 around 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.829
 why I aggressive the other videos did not seem that Binz 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.419
 in no way 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.810
 just stop in a video where is the first and her parents more excited 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:30.199
 Percent Dr

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.689
 Wildlife in video on earlier then 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.650
 This is never fun as a rss feed or anything like that 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.000
 Percent really exciting for me not who my videos are not 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.059
 except the sun that excited me 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:49.299
 Settlement other story 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.299
 Thank you for pounding the experiment 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.199
 Percent year for this proposal is not 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.089
 for the 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:58.649
 for pointing out that something is really trying to do that, of course 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:59.749
 to change 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:04.009
 Good percent of data over the next few weeks became spear owner 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:06.299
 fortunately, karl-erich already has holidays 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:13.180
 I'll reorganize the channel a bit to see if I can 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.039
 not yet 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:16.239
 Now everyone betrays world 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.890
 There are basically little things that do not fit in any way 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.390
 big gigantic that is difficult to 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.010
 also to comment for Black Ops should start playing Loke Thut Ball 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.579
 Of course not 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.540
 Surprisingly, there are some little things as I said but how to do it 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.739
 still a big impact 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:37.749
 around 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:39.659
 that was political 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.799
 I took up last pass of Xmarks and I will now 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.079
 actually with the sometimes at alltours be completely honest dad and teammates 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.980
 Paper has passed me the desire that what was so great was on Wednesday 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.340
 about the country directly 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.790
 Percent Parton explained with the man praying has been very important to everyone 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.749
 give something to scribe in front of console 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:05.799
 and that was really super boÃŸ arrived after choice was hit everything 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.549
 pretty small and I just do not have that on ps2 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.699
 I do not know 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:14.499
 I have no idea that I do not think Warendorfer is playing dirty 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:18.329
 If I'm honest I have to look there for the Xerox Live 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.329
 First time buyers are on offer one euro a month 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.940
 and I think, or I guess I'm still there 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.349
 But I will not buy a month this morning the day after tomorrow 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.430
 But those who are so few weeks again maybe if the 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.559
 Restructuring restructured Rome difficult word he follows shot 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.349
 Well 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.559
 apart from that, I've got it now 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:48.389
 the couch by in quotes so you have and I am through 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.180
 Ellzee mountain bath course

 um and that I am the twelve on the zig in the puff centrist the shit I can 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.409
 quick trouble and Abyss is the motivation as well as in men 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:01.089
 Therefore, there will be a bit less mountain from Bigge in the near future 

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:02.749
 but 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:05.580
 not perfect there no more but 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.180
 Parin iger is going to crystallize out of Philistines in the end 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.580
 become 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.939
 but 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:18.409
 Karen do not have a clue Stenger such a 2 but the Easter week is little there 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.479

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:23.900
 Motivation again 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.130
 which Voigt Jahr Petkovic did play a bit more active again 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.000
 few hours played around that was 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.930
 fail computer 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.889
 but then no 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.800
 It's not that easy, but then I'm like you 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.960

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.240

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.009
 so and now the last topic what we end right to you St 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.620
 for good deeds 96 has searched two behind and looked after at Google 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:53.259

 some people determined 

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:06.830
 looking forward 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.430
 so and that was the Round Team Deathmatch 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.580
 I finish here with 41 to one I hope you liked it as always if so 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.800
