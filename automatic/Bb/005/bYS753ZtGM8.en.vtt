so<00:04:48.319> now<00:04:48.650> that<00:04:48.710> you've<00:04:49.009> learned<00:04:49.039> the<00:04:49.430> basics<00:04:49.490> of

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
so now that you've learned the basics of

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.210 
so now that you've learned the basics of
ball<00:04:50.330> spinning<00:04:50.690> I<00:04:50.930> have<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:51.139> couple<00:04:51.470> tips<00:04:51.800> to

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
ball spinning I have a couple tips to

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.809 
ball spinning I have a couple tips to
help<00:04:52.400> everybody<00:04:52.849> along<00:04:54.129> first<00:04:55.129> when<00:04:55.580> you<00:04:55.669> get

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819 
help everybody along first when you get

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:57.939 
help everybody along first when you get
your<00:04:55.940> ball<00:04:56.120> from<00:04:56.389> a<00:04:56.419> store<00:04:56.930> you<00:04:57.440> want<00:04:57.680> to

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
your ball from a store you want to

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.279 
your ball from a store you want to
release<00:04:58.550> some<00:04:58.819> of<00:04:58.849> the<00:04:59.060> air<00:04:59.090> so<00:04:59.750> look<00:04:59.960> for<00:05:00.199> the

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
release some of the air so look for the

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.969 
release some of the air so look for the
plug<00:05:00.590> and<00:05:00.979> usually<00:05:01.430> they<00:05:01.550> just<00:05:01.759> pull<00:05:02.060> out<00:05:02.240> and

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
plug and usually they just pull out and

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.890 
plug and usually they just pull out and
you<00:05:03.979> know<00:05:04.130> take<00:05:04.460> out<00:05:04.639> about<00:05:04.970> a<00:05:05.270> quarter<00:05:05.720> of<00:05:05.750> the

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
you know take out about a quarter of the

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.290 
you know take out about a quarter of the
air<00:05:06.080> maybe<00:05:06.349> it's<00:05:06.740> just<00:05:07.130> easier<00:05:07.849> to<00:05:07.909> catch

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
air maybe it's just easier to catch

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.100 
air maybe it's just easier to catch
easier<00:05:08.930> to<00:05:09.110> grab<00:05:09.409> and<00:05:10.449> it<00:05:11.449> makes<00:05:11.630> a<00:05:11.750> whole<00:05:11.960> lot

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
easier to grab and it makes a whole lot

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.320 
easier to grab and it makes a whole lot
easier<00:05:12.319> to<00:05:12.560> learn<00:05:12.830> ball<00:05:13.159> spinning<00:05:13.580> when<00:05:14.120> the

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
easier to learn ball spinning when the

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.559 
easier to learn ball spinning when the
ball<00:05:14.509> is<00:05:14.539> more<00:05:14.930> squishy<00:05:16.150> seconds<00:05:17.150> when<00:05:17.419> you're

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 
ball is more squishy seconds when you're

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:20.230 
ball is more squishy seconds when you're
catching<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:18.139> ball<00:05:18.349> look<00:05:18.949> for<00:05:19.430> the<00:05:19.759> center

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
catching the ball look for the center

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.469 
catching the ball look for the center
point<00:05:20.599> of<00:05:20.949> where<00:05:21.949> the<00:05:22.069> ball<00:05:22.250> is<00:05:22.460> spinning<00:05:22.759> so

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
point of where the ball is spinning so

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.659 
point of where the ball is spinning so
Labonte's<00:05:24.020> vertical<00:05:24.590> axis<00:05:25.130> and<00:05:25.400> you're<00:05:25.550> going

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
Labonte's vertical axis and you're going

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.480 
Labonte's vertical axis and you're going
to<00:05:25.699> have<00:05:25.880> to<00:05:26.000> spot<00:05:26.389> it<00:05:26.569> and<00:05:26.780> aim<00:05:27.740> for<00:05:27.979> that<00:05:28.129> part

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
to have to spot it and aim for that part

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.399 
to have to spot it and aim for that part
when<00:05:28.879> you're<00:05:29.120> catching<00:05:29.539> the<00:05:29.629> ball<00:05:29.780> you'll

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
when you're catching the ball you'll

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:33.939 
when you're catching the ball you'll
have<00:05:30.620> a<00:05:30.650> more<00:05:31.039> successful<00:05:31.340> catch<00:05:31.940> and<00:05:32.949> third

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
have a more successful catch and third

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:35.350 
have a more successful catch and third
have<00:05:34.370> a<00:05:34.400> lot<00:05:34.610> of<00:05:34.759> fun<00:05:34.909> when<00:05:35.090> your<00:05:35.210> balls

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
have a lot of fun when your balls

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.180 
have a lot of fun when your balls
spinning<00:05:35.840> it's<00:05:36.080> always<00:05:36.289> more<00:05:36.560> productive

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
spinning it's always more productive

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.559 
spinning it's always more productive
when<00:05:37.280> you're<00:05:37.460> in<00:05:37.550> a<00:05:37.580> good<00:05:37.789> mood<00:05:38.060> and<00:05:38.449> you're
