00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
than the any other enemy in this stage I

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.070 
than the any other enemy in this stage I
don't<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.959> yet<00:02:40.160> if<00:02:41.160> they<00:02:42.060> see<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.510> they'll

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
don't and yet if they see you they'll

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.199 
don't and yet if they see you they'll
try<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.560> check<00:02:43.800> your<00:02:43.950> ID<00:02:44.130> they<00:02:44.940> don't<00:02:45.090> check

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
try to check your ID they don't check

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.720 
try to check your ID they don't check
anyone<00:02:45.540> else's<00:02:45.840> ID<00:02:46.019> but<00:02:46.380> me<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.100> really

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
anyone else's ID but me so I really

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.850 
anyone else's ID but me so I really
think<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.060> developers<00:02:48.690> fucked<00:02:49.170> up<00:02:49.470> when<00:02:49.830> they

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
think the developers fucked up when they

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.840 
think the developers fucked up when they
were<00:02:50.040> designing<00:02:50.610> this<00:02:50.820> mission<00:02:51.830> back<00:02:52.830> in<00:02:53.010> 2002

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
were designing this mission back in 2002

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.630 
were designing this mission back in 2002
when<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:54.810> game<00:02:54.989> came<00:02:55.049> out<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.680> really<00:02:56.459> think

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
when this game came out I really think

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.100 
when this game came out I really think
they<00:02:56.850> fucked<00:02:57.180> up<00:02:57.680> because<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:59.630> how<00:03:00.630> could<00:03:00.870> how

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
they fucked up because you how could how

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.960 
they fucked up because you how could how
can<00:03:01.290> these<00:03:01.380> these<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.130> how<00:03:02.430> can<00:03:02.580> these<00:03:02.670> enemies

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
can these these in how can these enemies

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
can these these in how can these enemies
tell<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.480> you're<00:03:03.930> not<00:03:04.080> part<00:03:04.350> one<00:03:04.799> of<00:03:04.920> them

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
tell that you're not part one of them

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.300 
tell that you're not part one of them
what<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.710> hell<00:03:08.530> see<00:03:09.530> I<00:03:09.590> got<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:09.860> try<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.010> avoid

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
what the hell see I got to try to avoid

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.650

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
all of them that I can this is

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.780

is<00:04:38.110> because<00:04:38.500> i'm<00:04:38.680> holding<00:04:38.949> a<00:04:39.010> big-ass

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
is because i'm holding a big-ass

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.760 
is because i'm holding a big-ass
crossbow<00:04:40.000> is<00:04:40.270> that<00:04:40.599> it<00:04:40.810> if<00:04:41.199> i<00:04:41.349> was<00:04:41.470> holding<00:04:41.650> the

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
crossbow is that it if i was holding the

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.439 
crossbow is that it if i was holding the
same<00:04:41.979> weapon<00:04:42.280> as<00:04:42.370> then<00:04:42.580> maybe<00:04:42.849> they<00:04:43.120> wouldn't

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
same weapon as then maybe they wouldn't

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.800 
same weapon as then maybe they wouldn't
do<00:04:43.599> anything<00:04:43.870> i<00:04:44.380> doubt<00:04:45.220> it<00:04:45.460> but<00:04:45.789> i<00:04:46.060> guess<00:04:46.660> it's

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
do anything i doubt it but i guess it's

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.700
