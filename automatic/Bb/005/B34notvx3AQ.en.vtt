00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.970
 I'm fabian intense on the open 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.370
 kiel kiel and we have here today 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.780
 Oliver Pocher rented it with us 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.030
 the manager and ours 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.309
 So just send it over 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.910
 Look in what you have so for 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.320
 audience no idea so 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.699
 Last time we were very little 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.070
 need to have had a bad send time 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.439
 you just love 20 clock 20 clock la coka 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.820
 Watch TV and 20 o'clock and the problem is 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.230
 also the open channel and of course 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.219
 not as much money as prosieben like you 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.930
 Well 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.000
 We have no money at all 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.200
 It is true that we still 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.079
 a little less but we have 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.809
 nothing at prosieben 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:46.680
 therefore, all the advice here is the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.190
 your presenter so it still has to be done 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.200
 learn a lot 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.700
 I 'm looking for the cash Spengemann 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.700
 the michelle hunziker the open channel 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:04.439
 the two are together oh the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:06.090
 are together at the same time 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.250
 television ideas that someone says together 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.960
 but that is the audience 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.670
 Of course, do not know what public 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.810
 know that the two are together 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.810
 otherwise we have no ratings 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.479
 you just put it on somehow 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:29.930
 a fashion style as the two 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:29.930
 together are still driven together 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.270
 because she also attracts your attention 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.170
 not completely rightly bound 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.170
 Fields do what they did 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.869
 Send out that also is still easy 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.780
 it is also such a broadcast that means 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.640
 simply so that even as they pack 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.020
 were simply the stuff and almost 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.380
 time for the money tv worked here 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.229
 worked 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.840
 what are they doing for magazine that 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.230
 make a youth magazine 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.870
 Youth magazine on all sorts of things 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.450
 for the young ones, what does not happen 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.130
 not worth it again very briefly 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.959
 My name is Oliver Pocher will be today 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.550
 the recording manager here and me 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.290
 Just want this is very clean here 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.030
 and runs smoothly I do not want any 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.100
 I just want to listen to cell phones 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.810
 we have total peace of mind 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:40.220
 Finally, make professional here 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.220
 television ok, we have understood each other 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.940
 happy spectators of the open channel 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:06.459
