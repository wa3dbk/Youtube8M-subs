talking<00:00:06.779> about<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.170> spider<00:00:07.740> code<00:00:08.040> tough<00:00:08.309> I

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
talking about the spider code tough I

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.549 
talking about the spider code tough I
think<00:00:09.510> this<00:00:09.599> knife<00:00:09.870> has<00:00:09.900> been<00:00:10.200> out<00:00:10.290> for<00:00:10.469> about

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
think this knife has been out for about

a year and I've wanted it for a long
time<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.719> just<00:00:12.900> never<00:00:13.110> picked<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.530> up<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.340> got

time I just never picked it up and I got

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.880 
time I just never picked it up and I got
it<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.150> few<00:00:15.179> weeks<00:00:15.360> ago<00:00:15.599> it's<00:00:16.410> still<00:00:16.529> relatively

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
it a few weeks ago it's still relatively

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.640 
it a few weeks ago it's still relatively
new<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.279> me<00:00:17.960> just<00:00:18.960> want<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.140> talk<00:00:19.170> about<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.619> a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
new to me just want to talk about it a

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.950 
new to me just want to talk about it a
little<00:00:19.770> bit<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:20.820> just<00:00:21.210> go<00:00:21.449> over<00:00:21.510> some<00:00:21.689> stats

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
little bit I just go over some stats

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.320 
little bit I just go over some stats
first<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.529> overall<00:00:22.830> length<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> eight

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
first the overall length is a eight

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.540 
first the overall length is a eight
point<00:00:24.720> eight<00:00:24.930> five<00:00:25.050> inches<00:00:25.980> long<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.400> it's

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
point eight five inches long so it's

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.339 
point eight five inches long so it's
kind<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.789> kind<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.150> bigger<00:00:27.330> knife<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:28.320> blade

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
kind of kind of a bigger knife the blade

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.880 
kind of kind of a bigger knife the blade
length<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.240> 3.7<00:00:30.240> inches<00:00:30.539> but<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.560> cutting

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
length is 3.7 inches but the cutting

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.740 
length is 3.7 inches but the cutting
edge<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.279> only<00:00:32.460> three<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.090> then<00:00:33.390> we<00:00:33.540> start<00:00:33.719> to

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
edge is only three and then we start to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.940 
edge is only three and then we start to
look<00:00:33.870> at<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.050> blade<00:00:34.230> you'll<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.920> has

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
look at the blade you'll see that it has

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.799 
look at the blade you'll see that it has
a<00:00:35.070> has<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> pretty<00:00:35.790> big<00:00:35.969> coil<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> cutting

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
a has a pretty big coil so the cutting

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.350 
a has a pretty big coil so the cutting
edge<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.110> shortened<00:00:37.500> up<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.680> little<00:00:37.890> bit<00:00:38.360> closed

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
edge is shortened up a little bit closed

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.799 
edge is shortened up a little bit closed
its<00:00:40.010> 5.15<00:00:41.010> inches<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.760> feels<00:00:42.360> really<00:00:42.570> good<00:00:42.660> in

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
its 5.15 inches it feels really good in

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.119 
its 5.15 inches it feels really good in
the<00:00:42.930> hand<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.440> definitely<00:00:43.620> big<00:00:43.980> and

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the hand but it's definitely big and

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.170 
the hand but it's definitely big and
beefy<00:00:44.600> comes<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.750> at<00:00:45.870> six<00:00:46.079> point<00:00:46.379> three<00:00:46.440> ounces

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
beefy comes in at six point three ounces

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.790 
beefy comes in at six point three ounces
the<00:00:48.180> blade<00:00:48.420> thickness<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:49.020> four<00:00:49.230> millimeters

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the blade thickness is four millimeters

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.850 
the blade thickness is four millimeters
which<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> substantial<00:00:51.059> blade<00:00:51.710> it's<00:00:52.710> kind

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
which is a substantial blade it's kind

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.840 
which is a substantial blade it's kind
of<00:00:52.890> why<00:00:53.010> they<00:00:53.129> called<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> tough<00:00:53.640> it's

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
of why they called the tough it's

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.170 
of why they called the tough it's
supposed<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.180> be<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> hard<00:00:55.140> use<00:00:55.410> tough<00:00:56.180> beefy

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
supposed to be a hard use tough beefy

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.860 
supposed to be a hard use tough beefy
overbuild<00:00:58.109> kind<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.070> hard<00:00:59.250> use<00:00:59.460> folder<00:00:59.910> so

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
overbuild kind of hard use folder so

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.090 
overbuild kind of hard use folder so
it'd<00:01:00.930> be<00:01:00.989> perfect<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.590> sitting<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.920> couch

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
it'd be perfect for sitting on the couch

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.880 
it'd be perfect for sitting on the couch
and<00:01:02.280> flick<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.640> watch<00:01:02.940> TV<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:04.559> handle

material it is g10 one the presentation
side<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.760> then<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.150> lock<00:01:09.570> bar<00:01:09.810> side<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.350> made

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
side and then the lock bar side is made

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.330 
side and then the lock bar side is made
out<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.830> titanium<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.960> blade<00:01:13.229> itself<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.979> made

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
out of titanium the blade itself is made

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.859 
out of titanium the blade itself is made
out<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.850> CPM<00:01:16.430> 3v<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> powdered

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
out of a CPM 3v and that is a powdered

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.679 
out of a CPM 3v and that is a powdered
steel<00:01:19.189> it<00:01:20.189> gives<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> little<00:01:20.700> bit<00:01:20.820> more<00:01:21.030> of

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
steel it gives you a little bit more of

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.789 
steel it gives you a little bit more of
uniform<00:01:22.259> consistency<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.159> 3v<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.799> it's

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
uniform consistency and 3v is a it's

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.780 
uniform consistency and 3v is a it's
harder<00:01:26.130> than<00:01:26.159> woodpecker<00:01:27.000> lips<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.810> is

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
harder than woodpecker lips it is

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.050 
harder than woodpecker lips it is
resistant<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.470> chips<00:01:31.549> it's<00:01:32.549> supposed<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.880> have

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
resistant to chips it's supposed to have

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.140 
resistant to chips it's supposed to have
terrific<00:01:33.560> toughness<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.770> edge<00:01:35.700> retention

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
terrific toughness and edge retention

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.270 
terrific toughness and edge retention
and<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:37.290> also<00:01:37.409> supposed<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.829> resist

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
and it's also supposed to resist

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.520 
and it's also supposed to resist
corrosion<00:01:38.640> pretty<00:01:39.299> well<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:40.259> one<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
corrosion pretty well but one of the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.170 
corrosion pretty well but one of the
things<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.860> read<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.490> when<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.909> does

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
things that I read is that when it does

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.510 
things that I read is that when it does
get<00:01:42.720> some<00:01:42.930> corrosion<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> tends<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.189> pit

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
get some corrosion on it it tends to pit

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.130 
get some corrosion on it it tends to pit
so<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:44.909> more<00:01:45.030> than<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.509> surface<00:01:45.899> rust

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
so it's more than just like surface rust

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.499 
so it's more than just like surface rust
it<00:01:46.860> actually<00:01:47.070> digs<00:01:47.700> into<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.060> steel<00:01:48.240> pretty

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
it actually digs into the steel pretty

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.139 
it actually digs into the steel pretty
good<00:01:49.280> one<00:01:50.280> things<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.640> kind<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.880> notice

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
good one things that you kind of notice

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.030 
good one things that you kind of notice
is<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.329> there's<00:01:51.899> no<00:01:51.930> screws<00:01:52.259> here<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.619> took

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
is that there's no screws here I took

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.710 
is that there's no screws here I took
the<00:01:53.280> pocket<00:01:53.610> clip<00:01:53.759> off<00:01:53.939> I'm<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> lefty<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.659> I

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
the pocket clip off I'm a lefty so I

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.300 
the pocket clip off I'm a lefty so I
carry<00:01:54.930> left-handed<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.860> took<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.070> off<00:01:56.280> to

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
carry left-handed and I took it off to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.069 
carry left-handed and I took it off to
the<00:01:56.520> right-handed<00:01:57.090> side<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.570> switch<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
the right-handed side to switch it and

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.190 
the right-handed side to switch it and
actually<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:59.040> carrying<00:01:59.369> some<00:01:59.610> knives

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
actually like carrying some knives

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.200 
actually like carrying some knives
without<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.439> clip<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.159> my<00:02:02.189> pocket<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.939> then

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
without the clip in my pocket and then

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.940 
without the clip in my pocket and then
this<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.540> one<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.750> those<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.619> I'll<00:02:04.920> just

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
this is one of those that I'll just

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.530 
this is one of those that I'll just
carry<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.520> my<00:02:05.549> pocket<00:02:05.759> probably<00:02:06.420> i<00:02:06.450> don't

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
carry in my pocket probably i don't

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.639 
carry in my pocket probably i don't
think<00:02:06.869> i'll<00:02:06.990> i'll<00:02:07.770> carry<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.220> with<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.399> clip<00:02:08.759> and

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
think i'll i'll carry it with a clip and

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.830 
think i'll i'll carry it with a clip and
it<00:02:10.429> fits<00:02:10.670> in<00:02:10.789> there<00:02:10.879> pretty<00:02:11.030> nice<00:02:11.299> i<00:02:11.540> mean<00:02:11.689> it's

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
it fits in there pretty nice i mean it's

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.080 
it fits in there pretty nice i mean it's
it's<00:02:12.379> thick<00:02:12.769> and<00:02:12.799> it's<00:02:13.010> heavy<00:02:13.280> but<00:02:13.430> for<00:02:13.909> right

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
it's thick and it's heavy but for right

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.539 
it's thick and it's heavy but for right
now<00:02:14.379> I'm<00:02:15.379> just<00:02:15.500> enjoying<00:02:15.680> pocket<00:02:16.220> carry<00:02:16.430> on

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
now I'm just enjoying pocket carry on

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.990 
now I'm just enjoying pocket carry on
that<00:02:16.670> this<00:02:17.360> blade<00:02:17.720> is<00:02:18.019> gorgeous<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.099> it<00:02:19.370> has<00:02:19.519> I

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
that this blade is gorgeous and it has I

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.280 
that this blade is gorgeous and it has I
guess<00:02:20.209> it's<00:02:20.450> like<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.599> satin<00:02:20.930> finish<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.200> you

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
guess it's like a satin finish and you

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.649 
guess it's like a satin finish and you
can<00:02:21.439> see<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.739> grind<00:02:22.090> mark<00:02:23.090> soul<00:02:23.299> in<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.480> but<00:02:23.569> I

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
can see the grind mark soul in it but I

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.860 
can see the grind mark soul in it but I
just<00:02:23.780> think<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:24.049> is<00:02:24.319> look<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:24.799> nice<00:02:24.950> as<00:02:25.159> a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
just think it is look so nice as a

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.240 
just think it is look so nice as a
full-length<00:02:26.870> fuller<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.890> think<00:02:28.099> that<00:02:28.220> is

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
full-length fuller and I think that is

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.710 
full-length fuller and I think that is
to<00:02:28.459> lighten<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.760> blade<00:02:28.970> up<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.209> little<00:02:29.420> bit<00:02:29.540> I

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
to lighten the blade up a little bit I

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.599 
to lighten the blade up a little bit I
don't<00:02:29.959> know<00:02:30.109> if<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.319> adds<00:02:30.500> some<00:02:30.680> rigid

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
don't know if it adds some rigid

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.410 
don't know if it adds some rigid
rigidity<00:02:32.420> or<00:02:32.470> torsion<00:02:33.470> strength<00:02:33.799> but<00:02:34.609> some

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
rigidity or torsion strength but some

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.610 
rigidity or torsion strength but some
people<00:02:35.599> think<00:02:35.689> it's<00:02:35.870> kind<00:02:35.989> of<00:02:36.049> goofy<00:02:36.319> looking

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
people think it's kind of goofy looking

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.319 
people think it's kind of goofy looking
but<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:36.769> like<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.430> one<00:02:38.000> of<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.120> other<00:02:38.269> things

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
but I like it one of the other things

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.509 
but I like it one of the other things
that<00:02:38.480> you'll<00:02:38.659> notice<00:02:38.689> is<00:02:38.959> that<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.799> angle<00:02:40.340> of

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
that you'll notice is that the angle of

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.050 
that you'll notice is that the angle of
the<00:02:41.150> blade<00:02:41.359> is<00:02:41.540> canted<00:02:42.049> from<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:42.889> handle<00:02:43.340> but

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
the blade is canted from the handle but

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.699 
the blade is canted from the handle but
I<00:02:44.120> think<00:02:44.329> that<00:02:44.510> makes<00:02:44.720> for<00:02:44.870> good<00:02:44.989> cutting<00:02:45.260> it

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
I think that makes for good cutting it

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.460 
I think that makes for good cutting it
fits<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.519> hand<00:02:46.760> really<00:02:47.030> well<00:02:47.180> i<00:02:47.209> can't<00:02:48.200> see

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
fits in the hand really well i can't see

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.020 
fits in the hand really well i can't see
cutting<00:02:48.859> with<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:49.099> like<00:02:49.220> this<00:02:49.370> though<00:02:49.700> i've

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
cutting with it like this though i've

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.440 
cutting with it like this though i've
used<00:02:50.359> it<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.569> break<00:02:50.720> down<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:50.930> lot<00:02:51.139> of<00:02:51.260> boxes<00:02:52.450> we

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
used it to break down a lot of boxes we

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.819 
used it to break down a lot of boxes we
have<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.599> lot<00:02:53.750> of<00:02:53.780> snow<00:02:54.049> going<00:02:54.319> on<00:02:54.439> where<00:02:54.650> i<00:02:54.680> live

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
have a lot of snow going on where i live

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.379 
have a lot of snow going on where i live
and<00:02:54.950> i<00:02:55.010> just<00:02:55.159> got<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.340> new<00:02:55.489> snow<00:02:55.670> blower<00:02:55.909> and<00:02:56.209> i

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
and i just got a new snow blower and i

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:57.520 
and i just got a new snow blower and i
use<00:02:56.569> it<00:02:56.599> to<00:02:56.750> break<00:02:56.930> out<00:02:57.019> of<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.139> box<00:02:57.170> last

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
use it to break out of the box last

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.860 
use it to break out of the box last
night<00:02:57.739> and<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.639> can't<00:02:58.849> see<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.030> mark<00:02:59.569> on<00:02:59.720> that

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
night and you can't see a mark on that

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.780 
night and you can't see a mark on that
one<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.319> blade<00:03:00.500> it<00:03:00.620> looks<00:03:00.769> as<00:03:00.889> new<00:03:01.069> as<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.639> did

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
one that blade it looks as new as it did

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.660 
one that blade it looks as new as it did
when<00:03:01.909> I<00:03:01.970> got<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.389> but<00:03:03.109> I<00:03:03.590> was<00:03:03.980> choked<00:03:04.280> up<00:03:04.430> using

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
when I got it but I was choked up using

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.640 
when I got it but I was choked up using
this<00:03:04.879> joy<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.510> then<00:03:05.750> had<00:03:05.900> this<00:03:05.989> thumb<00:03:06.260> up<00:03:06.409> here

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
this joy and then had this thumb up here

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.080 
this joy and then had this thumb up here
because<00:03:06.859> I<00:03:07.010> was<00:03:07.129> breaking<00:03:07.430> down<00:03:07.459> a<00:03:07.549> box<00:03:07.819> is<00:03:08.000> it

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
because I was breaking down a box is it

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.149 
because I was breaking down a box is it
worked<00:03:08.299> really<00:03:08.420> well<00:03:08.540> you<00:03:09.500> can<00:03:09.620> see<00:03:09.829> it's<00:03:10.010> got

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
worked really well you can see it's got

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.149 
worked really well you can see it's got
a<00:03:10.220> pretty<00:03:11.060> serious<00:03:11.359> tip<00:03:11.750> on<00:03:11.930> there<00:03:12.139> the<00:03:12.889> little

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
a pretty serious tip on there the little

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.009 
a pretty serious tip on there the little
bit<00:03:13.250> of<00:03:13.370> an<00:03:13.459> indent<00:03:13.819> on<00:03:14.120> either<00:03:14.480> side<00:03:14.780> from<00:03:14.989> the

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
bit of an indent on either side from the

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.330 
bit of an indent on either side from the
fuller<00:03:15.319> so<00:03:15.530> it<00:03:15.590> kinda<00:03:15.769> looks<00:03:15.889> like<00:03:15.919> a<00:03:16.040> spear

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
fuller so it kinda looks like a spear

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.569 
fuller so it kinda looks like a spear
point<00:03:16.579> I'd<00:03:17.540> imagine<00:03:18.109> that<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.799> is<00:03:19.160> a<00:03:19.190> good

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
point I'd imagine that it is a good

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.869 
point I'd imagine that it is a good
thrusting<00:03:20.560> blade<00:03:21.560> that<00:03:21.769> penetrates<00:03:22.340> quite

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
thrusting blade that penetrates quite

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.569 
thrusting blade that penetrates quite
well<00:03:23.060> there's<00:03:23.810> not<00:03:23.989> a<00:03:24.049> lot<00:03:24.290> of<00:03:24.560> blade<00:03:25.370> area

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
well there's not a lot of blade area

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.970 
well there's not a lot of blade area
that<00:03:25.849> we<00:03:25.909> talked<00:03:26.120> about<00:03:26.239> so<00:03:26.750> again<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.500> think

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
that we talked about so again I think

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.189 
that we talked about so again I think
this<00:03:28.069> is<00:03:28.220> really<00:03:28.430> for<00:03:28.669> more<00:03:28.909> hard<00:03:29.269> you<00:03:29.900> know<00:03:30.019> we

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:30.199 
this is really for more hard you know we

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.229 
this is really for more hard you know we
really<00:03:30.230> got<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.650> get<00:03:30.769> a<00:03:30.829> grip<00:03:30.909> get<00:03:31.909> in<00:03:32.060> there

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
really got to get a grip get in there

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.330 
really got to get a grip get in there
and<00:03:32.269> do<00:03:32.510> some<00:03:32.750> precision<00:03:33.440> cutting<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:36.340> let's

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
and do some precision cutting the let's

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.580 
and do some precision cutting the let's
talk<00:03:37.489> a<00:03:37.549> little<00:03:37.639> bit<00:03:37.909> about<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:39.260> construction

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
talk a little bit about the construction

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.210 
talk a little bit about the construction
so<00:03:40.519> as<00:03:40.940> I<00:03:41.030> mentioned<00:03:41.060> this<00:03:41.389> is<00:03:41.540> a<00:03:41.569> thick<00:03:42.229> TI

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
so as I mentioned this is a thick TI

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.059 
so as I mentioned this is a thick TI
this<00:03:43.879> side<00:03:44.090> is<00:03:44.120> a<00:03:44.329> stainless<00:03:44.810> steel<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.349> g10

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
this side is a stainless steel and g10

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.159 
this side is a stainless steel and g10
it<00:03:46.909> does<00:03:47.090> have<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.329> back<00:03:47.510> spacer<00:03:47.930> that<00:03:48.079> goes

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169 
it does have a back spacer that goes

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:49.689 
it does have a back spacer that goes
about<00:03:48.349> halfway<00:03:48.560> up<00:03:48.739> and<00:03:49.040> that<00:03:49.129> has<00:03:49.250> some<00:03:49.370> open

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
about halfway up and that has some open

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.610 
about halfway up and that has some open
construction<00:03:50.209> here<00:03:50.419> I<00:03:50.569> prefer<00:03:51.290> to<00:03:51.530> have

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
construction here I prefer to have

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.710 
construction here I prefer to have
standoffs<00:03:52.069> but<00:03:52.579> you<00:03:52.849> know<00:03:53.000> six<00:03:53.449> and<00:03:53.540> one<00:03:53.629> half

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
standoffs but you know six and one half

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.629 
standoffs but you know six and one half
a<00:03:53.959> dozen<00:03:53.989> another<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:54.709> then<00:03:55.220> if<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.430> take<00:03:55.579> a

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
a dozen another and then if you take a

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.390 
a dozen another and then if you take a
look<00:03:55.909> you<00:03:56.060> can<00:03:56.209> see<00:03:56.239> in<00:03:56.870> so<00:03:57.229> if<00:03:57.889> you<00:03:57.979> can<00:03:58.159> see

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
look you can see in so if you can see

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.089 
look you can see in so if you can see
and<00:03:58.609> they're<00:03:58.729> used<00:03:58.909> two<00:03:59.090> little<00:03:59.329> screws<00:04:00.099> it

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
and they're used two little screws it

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.539 
and they're used two little screws it
has<00:04:01.280> a<00:04:01.310> stainless<00:04:01.669> steel<00:04:02.739> piece<00:04:03.739> connected<00:04:04.370> to

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
has a stainless steel piece connected to

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.670 
has a stainless steel piece connected to
the<00:04:04.639> titanium<00:04:05.209> lock<00:04:05.389> bar<00:04:05.629> so<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.349> lock<00:04:06.500> bar

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
the titanium lock bar so the lock bar

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.589 
the titanium lock bar so the lock bar
interface<00:04:07.099> is<00:04:07.310> actually<00:04:07.729> stainless<00:04:08.359> steel

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
interface is actually stainless steel

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.330 
interface is actually stainless steel
which<00:04:09.260> is<00:04:09.379> good<00:04:09.530> because<00:04:09.650> you<00:04:09.799> don't<00:04:09.949> have<00:04:10.010> t.i

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
which is good because you don't have t.i

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.819 
which is good because you don't have t.i
sticky<00:04:10.819> problems<00:04:11.269> and<00:04:11.569> this<00:04:12.139> last<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.680> little

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
sticky problems and this last a little

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.369 
sticky problems and this last a little
bit<00:04:12.919> longer<00:04:13.250> so<00:04:13.780> you<00:04:14.780> don't<00:04:14.959> get<00:04:15.019> some<00:04:15.199> of<00:04:15.290> the

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
bit longer so you don't get some of the

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:16.839 
bit longer so you don't get some of the
deformation<00:04:15.859> issues<00:04:16.159> that<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:16.400> do<00:04:16.519> with<00:04:16.669> TI

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:16.849 
deformation issues that you do with TI

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:19.269 
deformation issues that you do with TI
and<00:04:16.940> a<00:04:17.180> harder<00:04:17.510> steel<00:04:17.750> I<00:04:17.779> think<00:04:18.320> with<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.650> 3v

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:19.279 
and a harder steel I think with the 3v

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.039 
and a harder steel I think with the 3v
is<00:04:19.459> probably<00:04:19.789> important<00:04:20.239> to<00:04:20.450> have<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.810> steel

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
is probably important to have the steel

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.800 
is probably important to have the steel
interface<00:04:21.829> on<00:04:22.039> that

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
interface on that

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.390 
interface on that
if<00:04:23.380> you<00:04:23.500> take<00:04:23.620> a<00:04:23.650> look<00:04:23.710> at<00:04:23.830> that<00:04:23.889> lock<00:04:24.130> bar

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
if you take a look at that lock bar

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.260 
if you take a look at that lock bar
that's<00:04:24.850> really<00:04:25.150> short<00:04:25.419> compared<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:26.080> say

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
that's really short compared to say

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.879 
that's really short compared to say
other<00:04:28.270> knives<00:04:28.690> make<00:04:29.380> sure<00:04:29.410> you<00:04:29.530> take<00:04:29.620> a<00:04:29.680> look

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
other knives make sure you take a look

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.210 
other knives make sure you take a look
at<00:04:29.950> this<00:04:31.260> Strider<00:04:32.260> sng<00:04:32.680> you'll<00:04:32.830> see<00:04:32.980> that<00:04:33.070> the

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
at this Strider sng you'll see that the

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.270 
at this Strider sng you'll see that the
lock<00:04:34.150> bar<00:04:34.360> is<00:04:34.450> longer<00:04:34.930> so<00:04:35.169> it<00:04:35.889> makes<00:04:36.040> a<00:04:36.160> little

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
lock bar is longer so it makes a little

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.270 
lock bar is longer so it makes a little
bit<00:04:36.520> more<00:04:36.700> flexible<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:38.410> tough<00:04:38.680> is<00:04:38.919> a<00:04:38.980> lot

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
bit more flexible the the tough is a lot

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.570 
bit more flexible the the tough is a lot
harder<00:04:39.520> to<00:04:39.880> disengage<00:04:40.710> I<00:04:41.710> can<00:04:42.220> still<00:04:42.400> do<00:04:42.550> it

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580

harder to disengage I can still do it
one-handed<00:04:43.060> and<00:04:43.570> I<00:04:44.440> don't<00:04:44.650> know<00:04:44.740> if<00:04:44.800> that's<00:04:44.919> a

one-handed and I don't know if that's a

one-handed and I don't know if that's a

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.810 
you know once you start to choke up on
it<00:05:14.229> I<00:05:14.590> mean<00:05:15.010> I<00:05:15.040> guess<00:05:15.190> you<00:05:15.280> could<00:05:15.310> hold<00:05:15.580> it<00:05:15.669> like

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
it I mean I guess you could hold it like

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.060 
it I mean I guess you could hold it like
that<00:05:15.940> I<00:05:16.240> really<00:05:16.810> felt<00:05:17.229> a<00:05:17.350> lot<00:05:17.530> more<00:05:17.560> natural

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
that I really felt a lot more natural

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.290 
that I really felt a lot more natural
but<00:05:18.220> hold<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.430> knife<00:05:18.550> like<00:05:18.669> this<00:05:18.790> as<00:05:19.090> I<00:05:19.150> was

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
but hold the knife like this as I was

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.460 
but hold the knife like this as I was
cutting<00:05:19.510> with<00:05:19.630> I<00:05:21.090> like<00:05:22.090> these<00:05:22.570> you<00:05:23.320> know<00:05:23.440> I

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
cutting with I like these you know I

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
cutting with I like these you know I
don't<00:05:23.740> know<00:05:23.800> what<00:05:23.919> else<00:05:23.979> to<00:05:24.070> call<00:05:24.160> my<00:05:24.340> so<00:05:24.400> it

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
don't know what else to call my so it

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.920 
don't know what else to call my so it
looks<00:05:24.610> like<00:05:24.669> a<00:05:24.760> golf<00:05:25.030> ball<00:05:25.240> divot<00:05:25.570> that<00:05:25.750> are<00:05:25.840> up

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
looks like a golf ball divot that are up

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.690 
looks like a golf ball divot that are up
and<00:05:26.080> down<00:05:26.169> the<00:05:26.260> side<00:05:26.470> I<00:05:26.740> think<00:05:27.340> it<00:05:27.400> really<00:05:27.430> adds

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
and down the side I think it really adds

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.180 
and down the side I think it really adds
to<00:05:27.789> the<00:05:27.910> character<00:05:28.090> of<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:29.620> knife<00:05:29.800> and<00:05:30.010> it

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
to the character of the knife and it

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.800 
to the character of the knife and it
probably<00:05:30.400> lightens<00:05:31.000> it<00:05:31.030> up<00:05:31.150> a<00:05:31.270> little<00:05:31.419> bit<00:05:31.630> I

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
probably lightens it up a little bit I

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
probably lightens it up a little bit I
don't<00:05:32.020> think<00:05:32.169> it<00:05:32.229> would<00:05:32.320> lighten<00:05:32.500> it<00:05:32.590> up<00:05:32.650> that

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
don't think it would lighten it up that

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.460 
don't think it would lighten it up that
much<00:05:33.120> but<00:05:34.120> their<00:05:34.479> own<00:05:34.570> both<00:05:34.750> sides<00:05:35.020> and<00:05:35.260> maybe

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
much but their own both sides and maybe

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.909 
much but their own both sides and maybe
it<00:05:35.650> adds<00:05:35.830> to<00:05:36.660> to<00:05:37.660> the<00:05:37.750> texture<00:05:38.140> here<00:05:38.350> I'm<00:05:38.590> just

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
it adds to to the texture here I'm just

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.279 
it adds to to the texture here I'm just
not<00:05:39.010> hundred<00:05:39.250> percent<00:05:39.490> sure<00:05:39.520> but<00:05:40.390> I<00:05:40.780> do<00:05:41.020> think

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
not hundred percent sure but I do think

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.590 
not hundred percent sure but I do think
it<00:05:41.440> is<00:05:41.470> different<00:05:41.800> looking<00:05:42.250> and<00:05:42.490> as<00:05:43.240> part<00:05:43.539> of

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
it is different looking and as part of

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.580 
it is different looking and as part of
that<00:05:43.660> I<00:05:43.780> kind<00:05:43.930> of<00:05:44.020> think<00:05:44.110> it's<00:05:44.260> a<00:05:44.289> little<00:05:44.470> goofy

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
that I kind of think it's a little goofy

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.159 
that I kind of think it's a little goofy
looking<00:05:45.039> but<00:05:45.310> I<00:05:45.340> really<00:05:45.850> like<00:05:46.060> it<00:05:46.270> I<00:05:46.450> think<00:05:47.080> it

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
looking but I really like it I think it

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.710 
looking but I really like it I think it
is<00:05:47.530> an<00:05:47.800> attractive<00:05:48.130> knife<00:05:48.490> and<00:05:48.820> the<00:05:49.419> fact<00:05:49.630> that

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
is an attractive knife and the fact that

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.909 
is an attractive knife and the fact that
it<00:05:49.870> looks<00:05:49.900> different<00:05:50.140> is<00:05:50.410> one<00:05:50.530> of<00:05:50.590> the<00:05:50.650> reasons

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
it looks different is one of the reasons

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:57.600 
it looks different is one of the reasons
I<00:05:50.979> like<00:05:51.130> it<00:05:52.380> do<00:05:53.380> some<00:05:53.560> comparison<00:05:56.610> some

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
I like it do some comparison some

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.190 
I like it do some comparison some
comparisons<00:05:58.150> here<00:05:58.419> as<00:05:58.660> you<00:05:58.870> can<00:05:58.900> see<00:05:59.020> the

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
comparisons here as you can see the

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.590 
comparisons here as you can see the
blade<00:05:59.410> is<00:05:59.620> close<00:05:59.979> to<00:06:00.250> an<00:06:00.550> sng<00:06:01.060> blade<00:06:01.300> which<00:06:01.479> i

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
blade is close to an sng blade which i

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.029 
blade is close to an sng blade which i
believe<00:06:01.660> is<00:06:01.810> also<00:06:02.110> four<00:06:02.320> millimeters<00:06:02.830> thick

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
believe is also four millimeters thick

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:05.430 
believe is also four millimeters thick
in<00:06:03.760> terms<00:06:03.940> of<00:06:04.090> cutting<00:06:04.300> and<00:06:04.630> both<00:06:05.050> knives<00:06:05.289> have

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
in terms of cutting and both knives have

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.110 
in terms of cutting and both knives have
a<00:06:05.470> big<00:06:05.740> coil<00:06:06.010> so<00:06:06.400> you<00:06:06.460> line<00:06:06.729> them<00:06:06.820> up<00:06:06.940> at<00:06:07.090> the

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
a big coil so you line them up at the

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.450 
a big coil so you line them up at the
pivot<00:06:07.510> the<00:06:07.930> handle<00:06:08.350> is<00:06:08.530> a<00:06:08.919> little<00:06:09.220> bit<00:06:09.310> longer

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
pivot the handle is a little bit longer

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.100 
pivot the handle is a little bit longer
here<00:06:09.789> in<00:06:09.880> the<00:06:09.970> in<00:06:10.120> the<00:06:10.150> Strider<00:06:10.510> tends<00:06:10.840> to<00:06:10.960> be

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
here in the in the Strider tends to be

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:17.010 
here in the in the Strider tends to be
more<00:06:11.260> straight<00:06:15.360> this<00:06:16.360> would<00:06:16.600> be<00:06:16.780> a

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
more straight this would be a

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.360 
more straight this would be a
left-handed<00:06:18.090> spyderco<00:06:19.090> military<00:06:20.250> so<00:06:21.250> it's

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
left-handed spyderco military so it's

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.980 
left-handed spyderco military so it's
about<00:06:21.430> the<00:06:21.700> size<00:06:21.880> of<00:06:22.090> the<00:06:22.180> military<00:06:22.630> but<00:06:22.930> the

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
about the size of the military but the

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.830 
about the size of the military but the
military<00:06:23.200> has<00:06:23.560> a<00:06:23.590> lot<00:06:23.919> more<00:06:24.389> cutting<00:06:25.389> edge<00:06:25.539> and

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
military has a lot more cutting edge and

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.690 
military has a lot more cutting edge and
then<00:06:26.410> I<00:06:26.770> don't<00:06:27.190> know<00:06:27.250> if<00:06:27.310> you<00:06:27.400> want<00:06:27.520> to<00:06:27.610> call

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
then I don't know if you want to call

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.230 
then I don't know if you want to call
this<00:06:27.880> a<00:06:27.940> toil<00:06:28.240> or<00:06:28.419> not<00:06:28.600> I<00:06:28.680> would<00:06:29.940> but<00:06:30.940> the<00:06:31.060> toy

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
this a toil or not I would but the toy

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.500 
this a toil or not I would but the toy
seems<00:06:31.599> to<00:06:31.780> be<00:06:31.930> more<00:06:32.190> with<00:06:33.190> the<00:06:33.340> handle<00:06:33.789> and<00:06:33.970> the

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 
seems to be more with the handle and the

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.820 
seems to be more with the handle and the
blade<00:06:34.690> then<00:06:34.930> opposed<00:06:35.200> it<00:06:35.349> just<00:06:35.500> really<00:06:35.680> with

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
blade then opposed it just really with

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.570 
blade then opposed it just really with
the

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
the

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.550 
the
so<00:06:37.580> that's<00:06:38.000> some<00:06:38.180> some<00:06:38.659> size<00:06:38.900> comparisons

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
so that's some some size comparisons

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.809 
so that's some some size comparisons
that<00:06:39.620> oh<00:06:39.830> and<00:06:39.979> I<00:06:40.039> have<00:06:40.129> one<00:06:40.280> more<00:06:40.310> i<00:06:40.490> was<00:06:40.669> going

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:40.819 
that oh and I have one more i was going

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:48.129 
that oh and I have one more i was going
to<00:06:40.849> compare<00:06:44.440> this<00:06:45.440> is<00:06:45.770> a<00:06:46.360> spyderco<00:06:47.360> endura<00:06:47.780> but

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 
to compare this is a spyderco endura but

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:51.100 
to compare this is a spyderco endura but
it's<00:06:48.470> a<00:06:48.590> waved<00:06:48.830> endura<00:06:49.220> so<00:06:49.430> you<00:06:49.520> can<00:06:49.639> see<00:06:50.110> the

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.110 
it's a waved endura so you can see the

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.589 
it's a waved endura so you can see the
indoor<00:06:51.379> is<00:06:51.560> again<00:06:52.099> a<00:06:52.129> similar<00:06:52.789> size<00:06:53.030> actually

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 
indoor is again a similar size actually

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:57.249 
indoor is again a similar size actually
it's<00:06:53.720> a<00:06:53.780> little<00:06:54.110> bit<00:06:54.259> longer<00:06:55.960> if<00:06:56.960> you<00:06:57.110> line

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:57.259 
it's a little bit longer if you line

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:58.600 
it's a little bit longer if you line
them<00:06:57.379> up<00:06:57.500> at<00:06:57.650> the<00:06:57.680> pivot<00:06:58.039> a<00:06:58.159> lot<00:06:58.370> of<00:06:58.460> times

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
them up at the pivot a lot of times

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.820

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:05.539 
because I think that that is probably

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:08.110 
because I think that that is probably
most<00:07:05.690> accurate<00:07:06.080> representation<00:07:06.770> but<00:07:07.699> you

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 
most accurate representation but you

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.999 
most accurate representation but you
know<00:07:08.210> I<00:07:08.240> could<00:07:08.449> be<00:07:08.479> wrong<00:07:08.690> not<00:07:09.139> an<00:07:09.259> expert<00:07:09.560> by
