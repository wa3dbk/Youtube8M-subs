this<00:00:56.399> season<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.879> over<00:00:57.000> maybe<00:00:57.239> it'll<00:00:57.510> sink<00:00:57.750> in

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
this season is over maybe it'll sink in

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.420 
this season is over maybe it'll sink in
a<00:00:57.960> little<00:00:57.989> bit<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.289> think<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.710> sunk<00:00:58.920> into<00:00:59.160> some

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
a little bit I think it's sunk into some

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.119 
a little bit I think it's sunk into some
recruits<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.090> think<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.020> sunk<00:01:01.260> into<00:01:01.500> our

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
recruits I think it's sunk into our

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.590 
recruits I think it's sunk into our
players<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.550> little<00:01:02.789> bit<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.180> coaches

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
players a little bit for the coaches

players a little bit for the coaches
we're<00:01:03.750> sort<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.049> we're<00:01:04.890> sort<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.159> riding<00:01:05.489> right

we're sort of we're sort of riding right
now<00:01:06.260> so<00:01:07.400> but<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.869> do<00:01:09.869> think<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.710> goal

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
you're in you need to try and find a way

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.219

completes<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> circle<00:01:27.840> for<00:01:28.020> me<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.710> 2013

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
completes the circle for me for 2013

completes the circle for me for 2013
season<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.600> important<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:31.079> try<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
season so it's important that we try and

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.890 
season so it's important that we try and
take<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.979> step<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.460> do<00:01:33.270> believe<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:33.810> going

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
take that step I do believe it's going

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.410 
take that step I do believe it's going
to<00:01:33.990> come<00:01:34.140> down<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.549> you<00:01:35.549> know<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> execution

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
game of football what it is you know

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.340 
game of football what it is you know
there's<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.729> lot<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.939> things<00:01:45.750> conceptually

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
there's a lot of things conceptually

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.590 
there's a lot of things conceptually
that<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.740> deal<00:01:46.920> with<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:47.880> at<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.090> same<00:01:48.329> time

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
that you deal with but at the same time

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.210 
that you deal with but at the same time
the<00:01:49.079> elements<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.590> football<00:01:49.920> remain

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the elements of football remain

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.090 
the elements of football remain
unchanged<00:01:51.090> it'll<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.869> who<00:01:52.649> does<00:01:52.829> those<00:01:53.040> things

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
unchanged it'll be who does those things

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.160 
unchanged it'll be who does those things
the<00:01:53.490> best<00:01:53.670> especially<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.720> think<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:55.049> this

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
the best especially I think in this

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.740 
the best especially I think in this
football<00:01:55.560> game<00:01:55.590> because<00:01:56.060> we<00:01:57.060> are<00:01:57.210> similar<00:01:57.630> in

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
football game because we are similar in

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.990 
football game because we are similar in
a<00:01:57.840> lot<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.990> respects<00:01:58.549> you<00:01:59.549> know<00:01:59.640> we<00:01:59.759> put<00:01:59.909> an

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
a lot of respects you know we put an

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.020 
a lot of respects you know we put an
emphasis<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.570> now<00:02:01.100> you<00:02:02.100> know<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.610> basics

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
emphasis on now you know the basics

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.920 
emphasis on now you know the basics
debate<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.899> very<00:02:04.079> basics<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.520> game<00:02:05.930> both

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
debate the very basics of the game both

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.050 
debate the very basics of the game both
football<00:02:07.229> teams<00:02:07.680> teams<00:02:08.340> are<00:02:08.550> they<00:02:08.759> do<00:02:08.819> what

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
football teams teams are they do what

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.470 
football teams teams are they do what
they<00:02:09.209> do<00:02:09.289> but<00:02:10.289> they<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.619> elements<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.480> spread

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
they do but they have elements of spread

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.910 
they do but they have elements of spread
they<00:02:12.660> have<00:02:12.780> elements<00:02:13.050> they<00:02:13.319> have<00:02:13.410> trick<00:02:13.620> play

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
they have elements they have trick play

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.190 
they have elements they have trick play
they<00:02:14.130> have<00:02:14.220> different<00:02:14.400> things<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.819> we<00:02:14.910> do<00:02:15.200> so

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
they have different things that we do so

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.690 
they have different things that we do so
you<00:02:16.709> know<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:16.890> just<00:02:17.069> have<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.610> know

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
you know you just have to you know

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.589 
you know you just have to you know
you're<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.000> you're<00:02:18.120> going<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.270> keep<00:02:18.330> off

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
you're so you're going to keep off

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.330 
you're so you're going to keep off
balance<00:02:19.020> can<00:02:19.290> be<00:02:19.319> kept<00:02:19.560> off<00:02:19.709> balance<00:02:20.099> in<00:02:20.190> those

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
balance can be kept off balance in those

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.949 
balance can be kept off balance in those
situations<00:02:20.940> but<00:02:21.090> at<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.300> same<00:02:21.510> time<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.780> think

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
situations but at the same time I think

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.250 
situations but at the same time I think
that<00:02:22.380> that<00:02:22.610> no<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:23.880> easier<00:02:24.270> no<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:25.140> it

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
that that no is it easier no is it

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.520 
that that no is it easier no is it
harder<00:02:25.739> no<00:02:26.520> we<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:27.510> do<00:02:27.780> what<00:02:27.900> we<00:02:27.930> do<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.170> think

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
harder no we just do what we do I think

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.380 
harder no we just do what we do I think
that's<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.830> basis<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:29.970> know<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.150> look

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
that's the basis of it you know you look

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.080 
that's the basis of it you know you look
at<00:02:30.540> different<00:02:30.810> people<00:02:31.550> there<00:02:32.550> right<00:02:32.790> guards

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
at different people there right guards

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.309 
at different people there right guards
different<00:02:33.390> than<00:02:33.480> our<00:02:33.600> right<00:02:33.810> guard<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:34.200> know

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
different than our right guard you know

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.290 
different than our right guard you know
that<00:02:34.500> type<00:02:34.709> of<00:02:34.739> thing<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.850> look<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.150> see

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
that type of thing so you look to see

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.559 
that type of thing so you look to see
what<00:02:36.480> they<00:02:36.600> do<00:02:36.660> best<00:02:36.989> I<00:02:37.410> think<00:02:38.100> that's<00:02:38.569> what

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
what they do best I think that's what

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.120 
what they do best I think that's what
you<00:02:39.720> do<00:02:39.870> as<00:02:39.989> a<00:02:40.019> football<00:02:40.410> team<00:02:40.590> what<00:02:40.950> do<00:02:41.010> they

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
you do as a football team what do they

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.280 
you do as a football team what do they
do<00:02:41.190> best<00:02:41.489> how<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:41.819> you<00:02:41.910> neutralize<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.450> and

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
do best how do you neutralize that and

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.540 
do best how do you neutralize that and
how<00:02:43.410> do<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.620> move<00:02:43.739> forward<00:02:43.800> from<00:02:44.160> there<00:02:44.370> and

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
how do you move forward from there and

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.920 
how do you move forward from there and
then<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:44.970> game<00:02:45.090> starts<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.540> be<00:02:45.630> playing<00:02:45.840> the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
then the game starts to be playing the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.509 
then the game starts to be playing the
flow<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.290> game<00:02:46.380> sort<00:02:46.769> of<00:02:46.890> takes<00:02:47.069> over<00:02:47.280> and

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
flow of the game sort of takes over and

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.190 
flow of the game sort of takes over and
then<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.760> sort<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.120> i<00:02:48.269> think<00:02:48.780> everybody<00:02:49.080> has

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
then you sort of i think everybody has

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.809 
then you sort of i think everybody has
an<00:02:49.350> idea<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:49.830> planet<00:02:50.190> when<00:02:50.370> they<00:02:50.459> go<00:02:50.580> into<00:02:50.730> a

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
an idea and a planet when they go into a

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.940 
an idea and a planet when they go into a
football<00:02:51.180> game<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:52.410> know<00:02:52.500> like<00:02:52.650> colorful

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
football game and you know like colorful

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.140 
football game and you know like colorful
used<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.370> say<00:02:53.519> everybody's<00:02:53.819> got<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.030> play

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
used to say everybody's got to play

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.770 
used to say everybody's got to play
until<00:02:54.330> they<00:02:54.450> get<00:02:54.569> hit<00:02:55.430> but<00:02:56.430> then<00:02:56.610> once<00:02:56.880> once

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
until they get hit but then once once

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.660 
until they get hit but then once once
once<00:02:58.080> things<00:02:58.560> start<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:58.890> move<00:02:59.160> forward<00:02:59.430> you

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
once things start to move forward you

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.670 
once things start to move forward you
sort<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.000> begin<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.900> find<00:03:01.110> your<00:03:01.260> rhythm<00:03:01.440> and

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
sort of begin to find your rhythm and

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.289 
sort of begin to find your rhythm and
you<00:03:01.769> probably<00:03:02.160> return<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.640> little<00:03:02.940> bit<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.180> who

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
you probably return a little bit to who

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.620 
you probably return a little bit to who
you<00:03:03.480> really<00:03:03.510> are<00:03:03.959> for<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.310> last<00:03:05.489> 13<00:03:05.940> games<00:03:05.970> you

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
you really are for the last 13 games you

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.880 
you really are for the last 13 games you
get<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.959> point<00:03:07.170> where<00:03:07.350> you're<00:03:07.410> done<00:03:07.620> talk

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
get that point where you're done talk

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.170 
get that point where you're done talk
and<00:03:08.130> you're<00:03:08.190> just<00:03:08.400> ready<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.760> play<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.150> I

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
and you're just ready to play and I

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.000 
and you're just ready to play and I
think<00:03:09.390> that's<00:03:09.540> we're<00:03:09.780> at<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.110> point<00:03:10.170> as<00:03:10.980> a

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
think that's we're at that point as a

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.320 
think that's we're at that point as a
football<00:03:11.459> team<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.819> know<00:03:11.910> how<00:03:12.030> many<00:03:12.209> more

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
football team you know how many more

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.750 
football team you know how many more
times<00:03:12.540> can<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.840> practice<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.410> power<00:03:13.760> which

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
times can you practice the power which

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.150 
times can you practice the power which
they<00:03:14.970> run<00:03:15.260> how<00:03:16.260> many<00:03:16.410> important<00:03:16.680> times<00:03:16.830> can<00:03:17.069> we

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
they run how many important times can we

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.449 
they run how many important times can we
do<00:03:17.310> what<00:03:17.430> we<00:03:17.549> do<00:03:17.760> against<00:03:18.180> their<00:03:18.359> defense<00:03:18.750> so

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
do what we do against their defense so

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.770 
do what we do against their defense so
we<00:03:20.459> should<00:03:20.640> know<00:03:20.760> what<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.030> do<00:03:21.180> again<00:03:21.359> it<00:03:21.630> comes

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
we should know what to do again it comes

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.690 
we should know what to do again it comes
down<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.620> basic<00:03:22.920> elements<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.430> have<00:03:23.579> to

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
down to the basic elements you have to

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.310 
down to the basic elements you have to
do<00:03:23.820> things<00:03:24.060> better<00:03:24.269> than<00:03:24.420> they<00:03:24.600> do<00:03:24.750> and

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
do things better than they do and

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.990 
do things better than they do and
inevitably<00:03:25.920> you're<00:03:26.489> not<00:03:26.640> going<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.850> trick

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
inevitably you're not going to trick

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.050 
inevitably you're not going to trick
them<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.209> whole<00:03:27.359> game<00:03:27.980> neither<00:03:28.980> team<00:03:29.220> you're

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
them the whole game neither team you're

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.910 
them the whole game neither team you're
gonna<00:03:30.150> have<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.390> play<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.560> know<00:03:31.680> that's

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
gonna have to play and you know that's

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.160 
gonna have to play and you know that's
so<00:03:32.160> that's<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.060> beauty<00:03:33.329> of<00:03:33.359> football<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.900> think

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
so that's the beauty of football I think

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.250 
so that's the beauty of football I think
that<00:03:34.290> happens<00:03:34.620> in<00:03:34.709> every<00:03:34.799> football<00:03:35.220> game
