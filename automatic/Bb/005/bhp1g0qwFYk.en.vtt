allowed them to be dominant in the

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.400 
allowed them to be dominant in the
global<00:02:57.340> film<00:02:57.579> market<00:02:58.030> but<00:02:58.510> that's<00:02:58.750> changing

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
global film market but that's changing

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.740 
global film market but that's changing
not<00:03:00.130> only<00:03:00.370> because<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:01.180> know<00:03:01.269> China's

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
not only because of you know China's

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.110 
not only because of you know China's
sudden<00:03:02.109> box-office<00:03:02.560> potency<00:03:03.250> but<00:03:03.760> also<00:03:03.910> I

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
sudden box-office potency but also I

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.150 
sudden box-office potency but also I
think<00:03:04.329> because<00:03:04.570> it<00:03:04.690> films<00:03:04.930> like<00:03:05.049> this<00:03:05.350> when

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
think because it films like this when

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.650 
think because it films like this when
other<00:03:06.400> countries<00:03:06.700> are<00:03:06.940> really<00:03:07.209> upping<00:03:07.480> their

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
other countries are really upping their

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.020 
other countries are really upping their
game<00:03:07.720> in<00:03:08.079> terms<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.440> quality<00:03:08.859> I<00:03:09.280> think<00:03:09.640> that

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
game in terms of quality I think that

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.490 
game in terms of quality I think that
there's<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.239> chance<00:03:10.630> that<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:10.989> could<00:03:11.170> entice

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
there's a chance that this could entice

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.289 
there's a chance that this could entice
Americans<00:03:12.130> to<00:03:12.280> maybe<00:03:12.459> go<00:03:12.730> outside<00:03:13.120> their

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
Americans to maybe go outside their

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.150 
Americans to maybe go outside their
comfort<00:03:13.660> zone<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:13.989> check<00:03:14.530> out<00:03:14.709> a<00:03:14.739> foreign

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
comfort zone and check out a foreign

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.590 
comfort zone and check out a foreign
film<00:03:15.340> I<00:03:15.609> mean<00:03:15.910> there's<00:03:16.060> kind<00:03:16.299> of<00:03:16.359> like<00:03:16.480> this

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
film I mean there's kind of like this

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.599 
film I mean there's kind of like this
cliche<00:03:17.170> idea<00:03:17.560> of<00:03:17.680> what<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:17.829> foreign<00:03:18.190> film<00:03:18.370> is

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
cliche idea of what a foreign film is

did<00:03:33.370> kind<00:03:33.639> of<00:03:33.730> co-opt<00:03:34.209> it<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:35.079> that<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:35.620> still

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
did kind of co-opt it and that so still

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.050 
did kind of co-opt it and that so still
something<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.430> think<00:03:36.609> that's<00:03:36.730> going<00:03:36.850> to<00:03:36.970> be<00:03:37.030> a

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
something I think that's going to be a

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.550 
something I think that's going to be a
hurdle<00:03:37.359> for<00:03:37.389> this<00:03:37.660> movie<00:03:38.019> and<00:03:38.049> then<00:03:38.230> the

hurdle for this movie and then the

had<00:04:28.850> done<00:04:28.970> that<00:04:29.210> here<00:04:29.450> because<00:04:29.600> it<00:04:29.840> would<00:04:29.900> make

had done that here because it would make

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.680 
had done that here because it would make
I<00:04:30.230> think<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.530> film<00:04:30.740> more<00:04:30.860> viable<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:32.300> know<00:04:32.390> at

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
might get Americans to check these films

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.910 
might get Americans to check these films
out<00:04:55.790> and<00:04:55.940> I'm<00:04:56.030> hoping<00:04:56.420> with<00:04:56.870> subtitles<00:04:57.350> I<00:04:57.680> am

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920

integrity their artistic integrity but
as<00:05:26.210> I<00:05:26.360> said<00:05:26.419> this<00:05:26.630> looks<00:05:26.840> quite<00:05:27.290> compelling<00:05:27.740> I

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
as I said this looks quite compelling I

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.590 
as I said this looks quite compelling I
think<00:05:28.370> it's<00:05:28.490> only<00:05:28.700> drawback<00:05:29.360> the<00:05:29.419> only

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
think it's only drawback the only

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.720 
think it's only drawback the only
drawback<00:05:29.900> I<00:05:30.320> see<00:05:30.560> I<00:05:30.800> mean<00:05:31.280> I<00:05:31.340> can't<00:05:31.550> quite

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
drawback I see I mean I can't quite

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:32.980 
drawback I see I mean I can't quite

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
that the only drawback I see is that you
