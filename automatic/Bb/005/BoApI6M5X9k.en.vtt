hello in this video we show you what to

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.619 
hello in this video we show you what to
do<00:00:03.929> if<00:00:04.200> your<00:00:04.620> Samsung<00:00:05.190> Galaxy<00:00:05.220> Note<00:00:05.670> freezes

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
do if your Samsung Galaxy Note freezes

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.680 
do if your Samsung Galaxy Note freezes
or<00:00:06.899> stops<00:00:07.500> responding<00:00:08.340> now<00:00:08.970> it's<00:00:09.240> very<00:00:09.420> hard

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
or stops responding now it's very hard

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.629 
or stops responding now it's very hard
to<00:00:09.929> actually<00:00:10.080> get<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.590> device<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.010> do<00:00:11.429> that

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
to actually get a device to do that

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.039 
to actually get a device to do that
because<00:00:11.820> they<00:00:12.120> generally<00:00:12.599> perform

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
because they generally perform

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.049 
because they generally perform
exceptionally<00:00:13.469> well<00:00:14.130> but<00:00:14.610> there<00:00:14.730> may<00:00:14.880> be<00:00:14.910> a

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
exceptionally well but there may be a

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.760 
exceptionally well but there may be a
rare<00:00:15.360> circumstance<00:00:16.109> where<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.500> actually

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
rare circumstance where this actually

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.580 
rare circumstance where this actually
happens<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.699> so<00:00:18.420> if<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.660> start<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.199> get<00:00:19.320> no

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
happens to you so if you start to get no

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.140 
happens to you so if you start to get no
response<00:00:20.100> from<00:00:20.250> advise<00:00:20.550> leave<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.119> few

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
response from advise leave it a few

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.420 
response from advise leave it a few
seconds<00:00:21.840> just<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.140> catch<00:00:22.410> up<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.890> case<00:00:23.100> there's

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
seconds just to catch up in case there's

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.150 
seconds just to catch up in case there's
a<00:00:23.580> little<00:00:24.029> bit<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.269> lag<00:00:24.720> but<00:00:25.080> if<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.830> doesn't

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
a little bit of lag but if that doesn't

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.820 
a little bit of lag but if that doesn't
work<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:27.150> next<00:00:27.330> thing<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.810> do<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:27.990> press<00:00:28.560> and

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.840 
list of the applications you've got open
if<00:00:34.050> it's<00:00:34.590> an<00:00:34.710> application<00:00:35.460> that's<00:00:35.640> not

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
if it's an application that's not

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.850 
if it's an application that's not
responding<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.540> first<00:00:36.930> thing<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.290> do<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.620> try

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
responding the first thing to do is try

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.160 
responding the first thing to do is try
to<00:00:37.890> swipe<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.700> off<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.210> screen<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.719> actually

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170

off the screen to actually close it like
so<00:00:46.289> now<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.789> may<00:00:48.090> sort<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> problem<00:00:49.020> if<00:00:49.260> that

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
so now that may sort the problem if that

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.189 
so now that may sort the problem if that
does<00:00:49.739> not<00:00:49.770> sort<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.520> problem<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.660> next<00:00:51.690> thing

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
does not sort the problem the next thing

do you can potentially power off your

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.080 
do you can potentially power off your
device<00:01:01.920> completely<00:01:02.399> or<00:01:02.989> restart<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.320> device

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
device completely or restart the device

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.750 
device completely or restart the device
if<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.330> doesn't<00:01:06.720> work<00:01:07.340> continue<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.520> press

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.039 

the<00:01:17.939> device<00:01:18.240> will<00:01:18.420> be<00:01:18.570> forced<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.850> actually

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
the device will be forced to actually

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.740 
the device will be forced to actually
restart<00:01:22.159> now<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.400> theory<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.210> should

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
restart now in theory that should

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.499 
restart now in theory that should
resolve<00:01:25.560> all<00:01:25.920> problems<00:01:26.240> that<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.299> actually

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
resolve all problems that you actually

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.539 
resolve all problems that you actually
have<00:01:28.020> with<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> device<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.829> forcing<00:01:29.460> the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
start the device and see if it works

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.900 
start the device and see if it works
normally<00:02:15.150> if<00:02:15.330> it's<00:02:16.050> failing<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:17.190> work
