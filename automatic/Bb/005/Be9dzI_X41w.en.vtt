occasionally<00:00:06.880> you<00:00:07.000> may<00:00:07.149> have<00:00:07.330> an<00:00:07.479> odd<00:00:07.630> project

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:08.139 
occasionally you may have an odd project

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:10.230 
occasionally you may have an odd project
that<00:00:08.290> has<00:00:08.440> a<00:00:08.470> 90<00:00:08.920> degree<00:00:09.220> inside<00:00:09.639> corner

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 
that has a 90 degree inside corner

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.390 
that has a 90 degree inside corner
I<00:00:10.269> find<00:00:11.139> this<00:00:11.290> corner<00:00:11.679> to<00:00:11.919> be<00:00:12.099> a<00:00:12.129> bit

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
I find this corner to be a bit

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.089 
I find this corner to be a bit
challenging<00:00:12.700> to<00:00:13.330> bind<00:00:13.749> but<00:00:14.169> next<00:00:14.620> I<00:00:14.740> will<00:00:14.830> show

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
challenging to bind but next I will show

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.790 
challenging to bind but next I will show
you<00:00:15.160> how<00:00:15.370> to<00:00:15.429> do<00:00:15.700> it<00:00:16.020> first<00:00:17.020> you'll<00:00:17.410> want<00:00:17.680> to

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
you how to do it first you'll want to

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.970 
you how to do it first you'll want to
stabilize<00:00:18.340> the<00:00:18.580> edges<00:00:19.260> look<00:00:20.260> for<00:00:20.530> a<00:00:20.560> mark<00:00:20.800> on

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
stabilize the edges look for a mark on

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.740 
stabilize the edges look for a mark on
your<00:00:21.280> walking<00:00:21.640> foot<00:00:22.090> that<00:00:22.300> you're<00:00:22.480> going<00:00:22.690> to

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
your walking foot that you're going to

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.660 
your walking foot that you're going to
sew<00:00:22.960> your<00:00:23.140> binding<00:00:23.560> on<00:00:23.710> with<00:00:23.920> and<00:00:24.190> then<00:00:24.400> just

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
sew your binding on with and then just

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.510 
sew your binding on with and then just
move<00:00:24.880> it<00:00:25.060> over<00:00:25.150> a<00:00:25.330> little<00:00:25.420> ways<00:00:26.370> maybe<00:00:27.370> an

move it over a little ways maybe an

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.820 
move it over a little ways maybe an
eighth<00:00:27.640> of<00:00:27.790> an<00:00:27.910> inch<00:00:28.030> to<00:00:28.840> the<00:00:28.960> inside<00:00:29.350> so<00:00:29.800> that

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
eighth of an inch to the inside so that

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.000 
eighth of an inch to the inside so that
it<00:00:30.010> won't<00:00:30.370> show<00:00:30.780> after<00:00:31.780> you've<00:00:31.900> sewn<00:00:32.649> on<00:00:32.800> your

the<00:00:52.269> first<00:00:52.510> edge<00:00:52.809> and<00:00:53.729> then<00:00:54.729> just<00:00:54.969> sew<00:00:55.089> that

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
the first edge and then just sew that

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
that you have completed your basting

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.079 
that you have completed your basting
stitch<00:01:02.559> you'll<00:01:02.859> take<00:01:03.069> a<00:01:03.100> scissor<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:03.760> clip

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.760 

then<00:01:11.670> you'll<00:01:11.880> want<00:01:11.969> to<00:01:12.420> take<00:01:13.110> your<00:01:13.259> prepared

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
then you'll want to take your prepared

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.899 
then you'll want to take your prepared
binding<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:15.439> line<00:01:16.439> up<00:01:16.649> the<00:01:16.890> raw<00:01:17.159> edges<00:01:17.460> evenly

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
binding and line up the raw edges evenly

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.960 
binding and line up the raw edges evenly
and<00:01:21.590> then<00:01:22.590> you'll<00:01:22.799> you'll<00:01:23.310> line<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.640> up<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and then you'll you'll line it up in the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.789 
and then you'll you'll line it up in the
mark<00:01:24.179> that<00:01:24.329> you<00:01:24.420> determined<00:01:24.899> before<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.530> that

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
mark that you determined before so that

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.569 
mark that you determined before so that
you're<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.810> outside<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.579> basting

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
you're on the outside of that basting

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.340 
you're on the outside of that basting
stitch<00:01:29.819> so<00:01:30.030> it'll<00:01:30.299> be<00:01:30.420> caught<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.170> seam

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
stitch so it'll be caught in the seam

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.529 
stitch so it'll be caught in the seam
allowance<00:01:32.600> as<00:01:34.579> you<00:01:35.579> sew<00:01:35.789> into<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.090> corner

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
allowance as you sew into the corner

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.880 
allowance as you sew into the corner
here<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.860> will<00:01:38.069> find<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.240> point<00:01:39.810> where<00:01:40.679> it

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
here you will find that point where it

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.100 
here you will find that point where it
is<00:01:41.069> at<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> 45<00:01:41.610> degree<00:01:42.090> angle<00:01:42.360> from<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.899> corner

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
is at a 45 degree angle from the corner

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.949 
is at a 45 degree angle from the corner
and<00:01:43.470> you're<00:01:44.399> still<00:01:44.670> outside<00:01:45.209> that<00:01:45.450> basting

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
and you're still outside that basting

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.649 
and you're still outside that basting
stitch<00:01:46.369> with<00:01:47.369> needle<00:01:47.729> down<00:01:47.939> you're<00:01:48.390> going<00:01:48.569> to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
stitch with needle down you're going to

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.609 
stitch with needle down you're going to
pivot<00:01:48.959> and<00:01:49.939> because<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.179> clip<00:01:51.929> that<00:01:52.170> corner

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
pivot and because you clip that corner

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.469 
pivot and because you clip that corner
now<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.280> can<00:01:53.700> pull<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.899> first<00:01:55.200> side<00:01:55.500> back

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
now you can pull the first side back

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.730 
now you can pull the first side back
right<00:01:57.479> behind<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.259> kind<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.709> a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
right behind you so you kind of have a

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.999 
right behind you so you kind of have a
straight<00:01:59.099> line<00:02:00.110> put<00:02:01.110> your<00:02:01.140> foot<00:02:01.470> back<00:02:01.500> down

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
straight line put your foot back down

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.039 
straight line put your foot back down
and<00:02:02.539> then<00:02:03.539> sew<00:02:04.079> down<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:05.009> second<00:02:05.399> edge<00:02:05.579> at<00:02:06.049> the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
and then sew down the second edge at the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.960 
and then sew down the second edge at the
same<00:02:07.289> distance<00:02:07.560> from<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.069> edge<00:02:08.220> as<00:02:08.579> you<00:02:08.640> did

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
same distance from the edge as you did

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.759 
same distance from the edge as you did
on<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.420> first<00:02:09.450> edge<00:02:09.989> there<00:02:12.290> now<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.349> have<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
on the first edge there now you have the

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.920 
on the first edge there now you have the
binding<00:02:13.980> sewn<00:02:14.340> on<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:14.760> you're<00:02:15.569> going<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.720> want

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
binding sewn on and you're going to want

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.250 
binding sewn on and you're going to want
to<00:02:15.959> go<00:02:16.109> in<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.650> clip<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.519> binding<00:02:18.329> fabric<00:02:18.870> you

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
to go in and clip the binding fabric you

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.559 
to go in and clip the binding fabric you
can<00:02:19.470> actually<00:02:20.510> cut<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.720> V<00:02:22.519> to<00:02:23.519> get<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:24.120> excess

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
can actually cut a V to get that excess

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.420 
can actually cut a V to get that excess
fabric<00:02:24.810> out<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.769> corner<00:02:26.130> will<00:02:26.280> lay

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
fabric out so that the corner will lay

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.330 
fabric out so that the corner will lay
flatter

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.220 

once<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.550> have<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.390> way<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.569> like<00:02:32.840> it

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
once you have that the way you like it

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.100 
once you have that the way you like it
then<00:02:33.410> you'll<00:02:33.670> miter<00:02:34.670> your<00:02:34.940> corner<00:02:35.300> by<00:02:35.510> folding

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
then you'll miter your corner by folding

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.470 
then you'll miter your corner by folding
one<00:02:36.260> side<00:02:36.560> down<00:02:36.800> and<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:38.000> other<00:02:38.120> one<00:02:38.269> on<00:02:38.390> top

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
one side down and the other one on top

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.780 
one side down and the other one on top
so<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:38.989> have<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.290> 45-degree<00:02:40.129> angle<00:02:40.550> there

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
so you have that 45-degree angle there

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.559 
so you have that 45-degree angle there
and<00:02:41.170> then<00:02:42.170> at<00:02:42.500> this<00:02:42.739> point<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.370> could<00:02:43.580> take<00:02:43.910> a

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
and then at this point you could take a

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.979 
and then at this point you could take a
needle<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.260> thread<00:02:45.349> and<00:02:46.180> sew<00:02:47.180> up<00:02:47.360> that<00:02:47.390> mitre

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
needle and thread and sew up that mitre

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.740 
needle and thread and sew up that mitre
if<00:02:48.379> you<00:02:49.069> want<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.489> or<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:49.970> can<00:02:50.120> wait<00:02:50.299> and<00:02:50.480> do<00:02:50.599> it

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
if you want to or you can wait and do it

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.880 
if you want to or you can wait and do it
at<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.440> end<00:02:51.620> on<00:02:52.629> the<00:02:53.629> other<00:02:53.750> side<00:02:54.110> they'll

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
at the end on the other side they'll

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.699 
at the end on the other side they'll
want<00:02:55.099> to<00:02:55.220> fold<00:02:55.489> your<00:02:56.390> binding<00:02:57.049> over<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.590> I

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
want to fold your binding over and I

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.150 
want to fold your binding over and I
