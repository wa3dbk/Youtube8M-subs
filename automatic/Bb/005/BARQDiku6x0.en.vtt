putting<00:02:15.780> exercises<00:02:16.500> together<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.280> start

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
putting exercises together and start

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.180 
putting exercises together and start
tapping<00:02:18.629> into<00:02:19.019> dogs<00:02:19.200> aggression<00:02:19.739> if<00:02:19.980> I'm

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
tapping into dogs aggression if I'm

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.650 
tapping into dogs aggression if I'm
doing<00:02:20.400> police<00:02:20.640> work<00:02:20.730> or<00:02:21.030> potentially<00:02:21.450> shits

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
and work and those sorts of things or if

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.619 
and work and those sorts of things or if
I<00:02:23.310> determine<00:02:23.610> it's<00:02:23.940> beneficial<00:02:24.300> for<00:02:24.450> a

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
I determine it's beneficial for a

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.530 
I determine it's beneficial for a
specific<00:02:25.080> dog<00:02:25.230> when<00:02:25.739> do<00:02:25.830> we<00:02:25.920> do<00:02:26.040> those<00:02:26.220> and

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
specific dog when do we do those and

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.430 
specific dog when do we do those and
generally<00:02:27.540> speaking<00:02:27.629> what<00:02:27.959> its<00:02:28.080> gonna<00:02:28.140> be<00:02:28.410> is

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
generally speaking what its gonna be is

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.680 
generally speaking what its gonna be is
when<00:02:29.250> my<00:02:29.880> young<00:02:30.150> dog<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.800> biting<00:02:31.800> with<00:02:32.069> energy

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
we are going to start putting exercises

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.199 
we are going to start putting exercises
together

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
together

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.640

and when we start putting exercises

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.589 
and when we start putting exercises
together<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:13.950> consider<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:14.459> more<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:15.000> young

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
together I consider this more a young

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.059 
together I consider this more a young
adult<00:03:15.720> section<00:03:16.349> even<00:03:16.680> though<00:03:16.769> some<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:16.980> the

adult section even though some of the

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.860 
adult section even though some of the
dogs<00:03:17.220> doing<00:03:17.489> this<00:03:17.700> can<00:03:17.940> be<00:03:18.030> quite<00:03:18.269> young<00:03:18.510> if<00:03:18.750> I

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
dogs doing this can be quite young if I

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.629 
dogs doing this can be quite young if I
have<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.049> very<00:03:19.290> precocious<00:03:19.590> puppy<00:03:20.100> it's<00:03:20.459> not

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
stressors off the bite first right so

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.330 
stressors off the bite first right so
we've<00:05:12.090> talked<00:05:12.330> about<00:05:12.450> it<00:05:12.680> repeatedly<00:05:13.680> but<00:05:14.220> it

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
we've talked about it repeatedly but it

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.150 
we've talked about it repeatedly but it
bears<00:05:14.550> mentioning<00:05:14.760> again<00:05:15.090> that<00:05:16.080> you<00:05:16.650> want<00:05:16.950> the

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
bears mentioning again that you want the

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.600 
bears mentioning again that you want the
dogs<00:05:17.400> biting<00:05:18.000> to<00:05:18.750> stop<00:05:19.140> the<00:05:19.470> stress<00:05:19.800> you<00:05:20.400> want

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
dogs biting to stop the stress you want

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.360 
dogs biting to stop the stress you want
the<00:05:20.700> dog<00:05:20.850> to<00:05:20.880> think<00:05:21.330> that<00:05:21.510> biting<00:05:22.250> using<00:05:23.250> their

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
the dog to think that biting using their

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.580 
the dog to think that biting using their
mouth<00:05:23.550> is<00:05:23.850> an<00:05:24.030> answer<00:05:24.510> to<00:05:24.780> their<00:05:24.930> stress<00:05:25.230> so

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
mouth is an answer to their stress so

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.380 
mouth is an answer to their stress so
whether<00:05:26.040> we're<00:05:26.250> using<00:05:26.430> new<00:05:26.760> environmental

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.210 
stare at the dog and when the dog bites
me<00:05:50.700> I<00:05:50.880> turn<00:05:51.270> that<00:05:51.450> pressure<00:05:51.720> off<00:05:51.960> and<00:05:52.290> if<00:05:53.130> the

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
me I turn that pressure off and if the

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.610 
me I turn that pressure off and if the
dog<00:05:53.370> is<00:05:53.400> responding<00:05:54.090> well<00:05:54.360> then<00:05:54.810> we<00:05:54.930> gradually

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
dog is responding well then we gradually

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.920 
dog is responding well then we gradually
introduce<00:05:56.220> those<00:05:56.460> stressors<00:05:56.880> while<00:05:57.510> the<00:05:57.720> dogs

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
introduce those stressors while the dogs

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.960 
introduce those stressors while the dogs
biting<00:05:58.260> and<00:05:58.590> we<00:05:59.130> teach<00:05:59.310> the<00:05:59.460> dog<00:05:59.580> to<00:05:59.610> kind<00:05:59.880> of

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
biting and we teach the dog to kind of

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.640 
biting and we teach the dog to kind of
fight<00:06:00.090> back<00:06:00.300> against<00:06:00.660> them<00:06:00.780> but<00:06:01.170> if<00:06:01.440> you've

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
fight back against them but if you've

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.380 
fight back against them but if you've
walked<00:06:01.860> away<00:06:02.010> with<00:06:02.280> one<00:06:02.670> thing<00:06:02.940> from<00:06:03.240> this

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
walked away with one thing from this

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.660 
walked away with one thing from this
video<00:06:03.570> in<00:06:04.110> terms<00:06:04.560> of<00:06:04.740> developing<00:06:05.220> young<00:06:05.400> dogs

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
video in terms of developing young dogs

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.280 
video in terms of developing young dogs
that<00:06:06.240> would<00:06:06.450> be<00:06:06.570> a<00:06:06.600> valuable<00:06:06.990> thing<00:06:07.140> to

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
that would be a valuable thing to

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.650 
that would be a valuable thing to
remember<00:06:07.850> remember<00:06:08.850> to<00:06:08.940> introduce<00:06:09.420> your

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
remember remember to introduce your

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.560 
remember remember to introduce your
stressors<00:06:10.110> off<00:06:10.830> the<00:06:11.280> bite<00:06:11.460> and<00:06:11.640> that<00:06:12.330> biting

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
stressors off the bite and that biting

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.960 
stressors off the bite and that biting
stops<00:06:13.140> the<00:06:13.380> stressors<00:06:13.800> because<00:06:14.610> if<00:06:14.700> your<00:06:14.850> dog

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
stops the stressors because if your dog

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.540 
stops the stressors because if your dog
learns<00:06:15.420> that<00:06:15.630> lesson<00:06:16.050> well<00:06:16.260> they<00:06:16.860> learn<00:06:17.190> to

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
learns that lesson well they learn to

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.270 
learns that lesson well they learn to
counteract<00:06:18.150> stress<00:06:18.630> by<00:06:19.530> doing<00:06:19.860> what<00:06:19.980> we<00:06:20.100> want

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
counteract stress by doing what we want

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.740 
counteract stress by doing what we want
them<00:06:20.430> to<00:06:20.550> do<00:06:20.670> which<00:06:20.910> is<00:06:21.030> confront<00:06:21.420> the<00:06:21.510> decoy

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
them to do which is confront the decoy

there and so we have to now start to

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.780 
there and so we have to now start to
specialize<00:07:02.400> so<00:07:02.850> that<00:07:03.150> video<00:07:04.070> will<00:07:05.070> be<00:07:05.100> broken

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:05.790 
specialize so that video will be broken

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.070 
specialize so that video will be broken
into<00:07:05.940> sections<00:07:06.360> that<00:07:06.480> will<00:07:06.600> be<00:07:06.660> sports

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 
into sections that will be sports

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.590 
into sections that will be sports
specific<00:07:07.740> like<00:07:08.310> so<00:07:08.610> how<00:07:08.850> we<00:07:08.910> teach<00:07:09.360> the

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 
specific like so how we teach the

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.360 
specific like so how we teach the
exercises<00:07:10.260> and<00:07:10.440> how<00:07:10.560> much<00:07:10.740> we<00:07:10.920> focus<00:07:11.250> on

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370 
exercises and how much we focus on

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.850 
exercises and how much we focus on
aggression<00:07:11.730> is<00:07:12.450> going<00:07:13.230> to<00:07:13.290> be<00:07:13.380> dependent<00:07:13.800> on

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
aggression is going to be dependent on

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.930 
aggression is going to be dependent on
the<00:07:13.920> discipline<00:07:14.370> you're<00:07:14.490> doing<00:07:14.730> at<00:07:14.850> this

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 
the discipline you're doing at this
