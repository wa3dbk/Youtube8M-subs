00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.940 

what<00:00:18.369> separates<00:00:18.789> the<00:00:19.060> men<00:00:19.090> from<00:00:19.270> the<00:00:19.539> boys

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
what separates the men from the boys

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.340 
what separates the men from the boys
arguably<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.970> a<00:00:22.119> bike<00:00:22.300> like<00:00:22.570> this<00:00:22.840> the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
arguably it's a bike like this the

Ducati 748 a model shown here now this
particular<00:00:27.279> bike<00:00:27.490> came<00:00:27.759> in<00:00:27.910> three<00:00:28.180> different

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.540 
particular bike came in three different

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.330 
particular bike came in three different
models<00:00:28.689> the<00:00:28.960> e<00:00:29.080> the<00:00:29.770> R<00:00:30.009> and<00:00:30.369> the<00:00:30.460> S<00:00:30.640> model<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:33.160> R

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
models the e the R and the S model the R

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.310 
models the e the R and the S model the R
and<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:33.610> S<00:00:33.760> models<00:00:34.180> were<00:00:34.269> obviously<00:00:34.720> upgraded

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
and the S models were obviously upgraded

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.509 
and the S models were obviously upgraded
and<00:00:35.470> they<00:00:35.590> came<00:00:35.769> with<00:00:35.830> a<00:00:36.010> different<00:00:36.340> wheel

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519 
and they came with a different wheel

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:38.939 
and they came with a different wheel
package<00:00:36.790> as<00:00:37.180> well<00:00:37.210> there<00:00:38.019> was<00:00:38.140> also<00:00:38.320> a<00:00:38.470> Neiman

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
package as well there was also a Neiman

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.299 
package as well there was also a Neiman
Marcus<00:00:40.019> catalog<00:00:41.019> edition<00:00:41.530> which<00:00:41.680> came<00:00:41.980> in

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
Marcus catalog edition which came in

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.520 
Marcus catalog edition which came in
gray<00:00:42.820> but<00:00:43.420> typically<00:00:43.900> you<00:00:43.989> would<00:00:44.140> see<00:00:44.350> these

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
gray but typically you would see these

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.369 
gray but typically you would see these
bikes<00:00:44.830> in<00:00:45.040> either<00:00:45.190> red<00:00:45.640> or<00:00:45.790> yellow

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
bikes in either red or yellow

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.350 
bikes in either red or yellow
so<00:00:47.650> if<00:00:47.769> you<00:00:47.890> see<00:00:48.129> bikes<00:00:48.430> in<00:00:48.670> any<00:00:48.790> other<00:00:48.969> colors

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
so if you see bikes in any other colors

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.850 
so if you see bikes in any other colors
than<00:00:49.540> red<00:00:49.719> or<00:00:49.840> yellow<00:00:49.989> then<00:00:50.500> they've<00:00:50.680> been

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
than red or yellow then they've been

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.190 
than red or yellow then they've been
repainted<00:00:51.250> obviously<00:00:52.000> these<00:00:52.629> bikes<00:00:52.960> came

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
repainted obviously these bikes came

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.869 
repainted obviously these bikes came

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.219 
fuel-injected and I guess the philosophy
of<00:01:11.649> Ducati<00:01:12.160> was<00:01:12.399> that<00:01:12.640> and<00:01:12.940> I<00:01:13.509> kind<00:01:13.810> of<00:01:13.899> agree

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
of Ducati was that and I kind of agree

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.260 
of Ducati was that and I kind of agree
with<00:01:14.500> I<00:01:14.770> mean<00:01:14.950> if<00:01:15.070> you<00:01:15.190> have<00:01:15.369> to<00:01:15.580> use<00:01:15.880> any<00:01:16.090> more

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
with I mean if you have to use any more

now<00:01:37.899> the<00:01:37.959> other<00:01:38.140> thing<00:01:38.349> that<00:01:38.380> separates<00:01:39.009> this

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
now the other thing that separates this

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.449 
now the other thing that separates this
bike<00:01:39.640> from<00:01:39.970> other<00:01:40.119> bikes<00:01:40.619> or<00:01:41.619> Ducatis<00:01:42.250> from

bike from other bikes or Ducatis from

bike from other bikes or Ducatis from
other<00:01:42.580> bikes<00:01:42.880> is<00:01:43.119> what's<00:01:43.869> called<00:01:44.110> the

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
other bikes is what's called the

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.740 
other bikes is what's called the
desmodromic<00:01:44.590> valve<00:01:44.679> design<00:01:45.750> illustrated

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
desmodromic valve design illustrated

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.350 
desmodromic valve design illustrated
here<00:01:47.170> you<00:01:47.679> see<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.369> valve<00:01:48.610> opening<00:01:49.179> and

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
here you see the valve opening and

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.440 
here you see the valve opening and
closing<00:01:49.869> on<00:01:50.709> a<00:01:50.770> cantilevered<00:01:51.520> camshaft<00:01:52.119> and

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
closing on a cantilevered camshaft and

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.130 
closing on a cantilevered camshaft and
the<00:01:53.410> philosophy<00:01:54.009> behind<00:01:54.039> this<00:01:54.670> was<00:01:55.599> to

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
the philosophy behind this was to

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.650 
the philosophy behind this was to
eliminate<00:01:56.530> valve<00:01:57.220> float<00:01:57.759> now<00:01:58.479> this

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
eliminate valve float now this

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.290 
eliminate valve float now this
philosophy<00:01:59.380> is<00:01:59.679> not<00:02:00.069> a<00:02:00.099> new<00:02:00.369> technology<00:02:00.849> it

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
philosophy is not a new technology it

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.809 
philosophy is not a new technology it
actually<00:02:01.690> goes<00:02:01.869> back<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.590> 19th<00:02:03.369> century

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
actually goes back to the 19th century

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.449 
actually goes back to the 19th century
and<00:02:03.880> I<00:02:04.000> believe<00:02:04.209> mercedes-benz<00:02:05.459> actually

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
and I believe mercedes-benz actually

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.309 
and I believe mercedes-benz actually
implemented<00:02:07.060> some<00:02:07.270> of<00:02:07.300> that<00:02:07.509> technology<00:02:07.780> and

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
implemented some of that technology and

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.089 
implemented some of that technology and
some<00:02:08.530> of<00:02:08.679> their<00:02:08.800> earlier
