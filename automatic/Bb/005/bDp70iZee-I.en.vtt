 Hello, you are watching Saydek Steve 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.780
 today we have almost a comic book hero about 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.549
 fantastic four if you 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.130
 used e-books on 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.680
 young, you know how fragile 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.600
 screens but whistler maker came up 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.490
 seriously to this problem and released 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.730
 probably the only reader so far with 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.890
 flexible screen but almost as far as possible 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.810
 bend be clear flags van and not lost 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.010
 whether it is from this functionality you 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.320
 learn from our review wexler black 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.300
 swan beech paths came out quite a while ago but 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.219
 this pore practically has no analogues 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.870
 Of course there are still competitors with 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.670
 plastic flexible screen flex 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.250
 but with flexible body we are more 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.230
 devices we do not know flex technology is 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.969
 Well, but does the gadget cope with 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.840
 its main tasks now 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.370
 tell in the reader box completely 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.579
 traditional for e-books 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.039
 kit namely e-book itself 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.159
 leather case for her charger 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.770
 device with usb port usb cable with 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.049
 microusb connector quick start guide 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.970
 She same warranty card and finally 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.500
 card with a discount code in the company 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.630
 book online store veksler it 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.430
 the reader looks rather unusual 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.920
 even if you don't pay attention to 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.840
 physical properties of the screen but apparently I 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.970
 curvature is as comfortable as 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.979
 created specially in any case 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.040
 interrogative glances of those around you 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.470
 provided just as succinctly possible 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.420
 describe this unusual gadget it is light 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.850
 with an interesting design and pleasant 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.619
 body materials body originally 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.290
 slightly curved to highlight it 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.820
 outstanding ability to bend true 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.829
 under impressive angles can only 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.899
 screen located below the block 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.390
 thickness carries all the stuffing and not 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.340
 it bends but it is for this projection more convenient 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.799
 just keep the book in any position 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.049
 body made of grillo mida durable and lightweight 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.070
 polymer besides flexibility has a nice 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.990
 soft touch coating 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.119
 and the pattern on the back is not only 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.579
 handsome but also helps to keep better 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.860
 gadget most of the front side 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.720
 It takes of course a 6-inch screen under 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.940
 screen are controls not 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.790
 breaking corps here 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.379
 return button 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.209
 this and a group of buttons up down 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.689
 page turning and central 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.519
 ok 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.250
 on the side face is a single button 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.200
 enable and call the menu below the port 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.769
 microusb to charge and connect to 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.469
 computer 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.780
 indicator light and reset button 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:31.329
 elements as you can see at least and this 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.519
 follows the idea of ​​compactness and solidity 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.379
 the device is really quite difficult 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.359
 break down and its weight and thickness in the area 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.599
 screen almost the most minimal 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.139
 of the black swan we know is not bad 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.540
 bends 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:46.420
 but only in the screen area and do it 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.459
 worth yet without fanaticism developers 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.260
 didn't plan to create a roll in 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.689
 gadget tube and were worried 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.879
 reduced ability to break the screen 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:58.169
 unsuccessful movement or load 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:01.180
 book and they succeeded 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:03.129
 except for the outstanding abilities of yoga in those 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.139
 Of course, is it so interesting ? 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.620
 the gadget was the one e 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:10.629
 book answer immediately yes it is a full 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.389
 support only one of 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:16.450
 most important reading of books is not like you 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:19.109
 mp3 radio internet and other nonsense 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.579
 only books only hardcore 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.760
 indeed this gadget has a narrow 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.049
 specialization and copes well with it 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.280
 provides it 600 megahertz 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.349
 rockchip processor 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.269
 linux based operating system 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.609
 built-in memory of 8 gigabytes and 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.319
 600 milliamp hour battery 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.299
 this is the amount of internal memory 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.849
 honest and user friendly 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.519
 Available what is promised plastic 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.560
 6-inch screen plastic and fagot from lg 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.659
 is the culprit in the extraordinary 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.909
 flexibility it is made by e-ink technology 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:51.370
 flex provides 16 grayscale 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.900
 contrast 12 to one and its 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.680
 the resolution corresponds to the indicators 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.329
 pearl hd 1024 by 768 points 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.120
 same for example in amazon kindle 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:03.250
 paperwhite screen is good enough 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.040
 Contrasting and has a background close to white 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.449
 winning even more expensive ones 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.470
 6-inch gadgets work speed 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.959
 we will estimate later 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.939
 control simple truth a bit 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.859
 tugovat and but because the menu is not really 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.870
 extensive it almost does not affect the process 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:19.120
 use management interface 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.219
 The reader is more than simple on the main thing. 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.080
 screen except the top indicators and 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:24.130
 traditional settings for electronic 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.840
 reader sections 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.060
 with the last book read and 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.130
 go to the place of reading the list of all 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.800
 recently read books and all 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.750
 The file library is also available at the bottom. 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.150
 manager through which files of books 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.310
 you can delete or search by name in 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.810
 menu, reading the menu is available 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.700
 called power button 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.250
 where can I find the font increase 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.470
 page rotation in any 4 positions and 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.900
 search by book in the menu by button ok 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.530
 available bookmarks content jump to 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.200
 page 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.510
 background inversion changing fonts and 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.730
 text sizes and other settings then 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.190
 everything is standard and logical enough 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.390
 as for the supported formats 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.100
 in the case of flex one 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.440
 the story is much better than threw off 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.180
 For example reader from Veksler supports 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.810
 all traditional and common 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.200
 book formats 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.330
 since fb2 yes animated and doc files when 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.310
 opening large pdf will of course be needed 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.230
 wait a bit but generally speed 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.300
 work is enough for a comfortable 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.920
 use especially if it's your 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.170
 first leader turning speed 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.190
 pages lower than the latest kindle 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.370
 but matches the possibilities 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.300
 most young devices on the market 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.520
 copying books is quite memory 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.170
 standard connecting reader to computer 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.690
 books can simply be transferred to 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.120
 available 8 gigabyte defined usb 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.830
 flash drives wexler work duration 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.020
 gadget on a single charge depends on 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.720
 readable content but at least equal 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:47.800
 weeks and more active reading and this 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:49.720
 very good result 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.660
 state that the gadget turned out 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.130
 Unusual practical and inexpensive reader 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.440
 twitter can't be called 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.240
 revolutionary breakthrough but it's big 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.970
 step towards her page he 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.820
 which can bend all new well 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.260
 forgotten old 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.040
 checked in sidex see you in our 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.720
 reviews 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:14.790
 read good books friends today 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.790
 we are almost a comic book hero
