00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.680 
progression this week and we're in part
two<00:00:10.380> today<00:00:10.679> which<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.400> think<00:00:11.670> gives<00:00:11.910> most<00:00:12.269> club

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
two today which I think gives most club

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.560 
two today which I think gives most club
level<00:00:12.900> players<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:14.250> most<00:00:14.580> amount<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.059> problem

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
level players the most amount of problem

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.290 
level players the most amount of problem
and<00:00:15.780> it's<00:00:16.410> really<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:16.949> just<00:00:17.010> idea<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.970> how<00:00:18.240> to

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
and it's really this just idea of how to

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.560 
and it's really this just idea of how to
set<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.930> racket<00:00:19.760> combining<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.939> grip<00:00:21.210> change

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
set the racket combining the grip change

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.140 
set the racket combining the grip change
most<00:00:22.230> likely<00:00:22.650> from<00:00:22.830> your<00:00:23.010> guys<00:00:23.160> forehand<00:00:23.880> grip

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
most likely from your guys forehand grip

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.900 
most likely from your guys forehand grip
which<00:00:24.449> should<00:00:24.660> be<00:00:24.810> your<00:00:24.960> starting<00:00:25.350> position

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
which should be your starting position

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.720 
which should be your starting position
into<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> continental<00:00:27.599> grip<00:00:28.730> incorporating

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
into a continental grip incorporating

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.269 
into a continental grip incorporating
what<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:30.119> would<00:00:30.359> consider<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.900> unit<00:00:31.619> turn<00:00:31.980> where

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
what we would consider a unit turn where

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.760 
what we would consider a unit turn where
the<00:00:32.399> body<00:00:32.730> really<00:00:33.180> helps<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.809> set<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.320> racket

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
the body really helps to set the racket

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.940 
the body really helps to set the racket
and<00:00:35.090> then<00:00:36.090> figuring<00:00:36.510> out<00:00:36.750> how<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.500> get<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
and then figuring out how to get the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.310 
and then figuring out how to get the
left<00:00:38.250> hand<00:00:38.640> which<00:00:39.120> plays<00:00:39.390> such<00:00:39.690> an<00:00:39.840> important

position<00:02:05.189> right<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:06.180> he<00:02:07.079> hasn't<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:07.590> set

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
position right here he hasn't just set

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.999 
position right here he hasn't just set
the<00:02:08.280> racquet<00:02:08.729> for<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.940> slice<00:02:09.330> he<00:02:10.140> set<00:02:10.500> his<00:02:10.739> body

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
the racquet for a slice he set his body

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.250 
the racquet for a slice he set his body
for<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> slice<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.239> really<00:02:12.660> key<00:02:12.930> for<00:02:12.959> a

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
for a slice and this is really key for a

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.850 
for a slice and this is really key for a
lot<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.590> you

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
lot of you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.520 
lot of you
is<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.160> mistake<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.820> I<00:02:14.970> see<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.330> lot<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.990> that

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
is the mistake that I see a lot is that

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.400 
is the mistake that I see a lot is that
you<00:02:16.860> know<00:02:17.820> even<00:02:18.210> if<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.480> grip<00:02:18.780> gets<00:02:19.230> too

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
you know even if the grip gets too

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.980 
you know even if the grip gets too
Continental<00:02:20.070> I'll<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:20.970> see<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.360> racket<00:02:21.810> go

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
Continental I'll just see the racket go

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.250 
Continental I'll just see the racket go
back<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:23.190> body<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.670> still<00:02:23.850> open<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.780> this

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
back and the body is still open and this

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.250 
back and the body is still open and this
swing<00:02:25.560> becomes<00:02:25.980> really<00:02:26.280> choppy<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.270> usually

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
swing becomes really choppy and usually

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.710 
swing becomes really choppy and usually
a<00:02:28.290> little<00:02:28.620> bit<00:02:28.770> too<00:02:28.980> level<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.670> what<00:02:30.390> we<00:02:30.510> don't

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
a little bit too level and what we don't

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.410 
a little bit too level and what we don't
do<00:02:31.080> not<00:02:31.320> want<00:02:31.680> on<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:32.190> good<00:02:32.460> slice<00:02:32.820> is<00:02:33.120> for<00:02:33.300> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
do not want on a good slice is for the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.560 
do not want on a good slice is for the
strings<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:34.050> already<00:02:34.500> be<00:02:34.620> wide<00:02:35.190> open<00:02:35.270> at<00:02:36.270> the

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
strings to already be wide open at the

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.200 
strings to already be wide open at the
time<00:02:36.840> we<00:02:37.020> make<00:02:37.230> contact<00:02:37.470> with<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.100> ball<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:39.000> by

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
time we make contact with the ball so by

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.970 
time we make contact with the ball so by
having<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.750> nice<00:02:40.020> unit<00:02:40.590> turn<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.760> helps<00:02:42.360> us

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
having this nice unit turn it helps us

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
having this nice unit turn it helps us
bring<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.190> racket<00:02:44.400> down<00:02:45.060> into<00:02:45.840> contact

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
bring the racket down into contact

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.920 
bring the racket down into contact
maintaining<00:02:48.000> more<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.480> what<00:02:48.660> we<00:02:48.780> would

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
maintaining more of what we would

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.280 
maintaining more of what we would
consider<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.470> square<00:02:49.890> racket<00:02:50.670> angle<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.290> then

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
consider a square racket angle and then

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.290 
consider a square racket angle and then
learning<00:02:52.770> how<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.100> slide<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.730> strings<00:02:54.060> open

learning how to slide the strings open

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.810 
learning how to slide the strings open
at<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.690> end<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:55.020> contact<00:02:55.530> okay<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:56.459> what<00:02:56.700> I'm

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
shot just feel that the you know the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.430 
shot just feel that the you know the
element<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.340> slice<00:03:47.640> is<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:48.000> real<00:03:48.540> nice<00:03:48.780> flow

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
element of the slice is a real nice flow

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.729 
element of the slice is a real nice flow
to<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.920> ball<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.150> body<00:03:51.450> is<00:03:51.870> really

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
to the ball and that the body is really

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.520 
to the ball and that the body is really
helping<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.459> swing<00:03:53.820> it's<00:03:54.090> not<00:03:54.299> just<00:03:54.630> this<00:03:54.840> you

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
helping the swing it's not just this you

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.229 
helping the swing it's not just this you
know<00:03:55.560> feeling<00:03:56.100> of<00:03:56.220> this<00:03:56.340> arm<00:03:56.700> just<00:03:57.000> kind<00:03:57.180> of

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
know feeling of this arm just kind of

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.789 
know feeling of this arm just kind of
chopping<00:03:57.840> out<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.260> ball<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.620> create

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
chopping out to the ball to create

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.870 
chopping out to the ball to create
backspin<00:03:59.459> okay<00:04:00.140> so<00:04:01.250> that's<00:04:02.250> all<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.430> got<00:04:02.700> for

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
backspin okay so that's all I got for
