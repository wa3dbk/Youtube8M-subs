00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.340
 different to all that has 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.110

 now it's not the brand it's the brand and like 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.680
 the appetizer but it's as if I cinar 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.280

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.430
 aperol is one is a drink this sweet and 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.780
 bitter at the same time 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.390
 that you just improvise a tripod 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.860
 with my ipad and with the remote control to 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.170
 air conditioning so leaves the camera 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.640

 they will not get it anywhere 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.369

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.300
 do not 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.390
 smell alive but this intense that is 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.580
 in a red or raised color is a 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.560
 appetizer says pop little appetizer 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.649

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.600
 just 11 degrees mix of roots of 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.760
 high quality herbs of origin 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.530
 Italian 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.800
 synonym of enjoyment 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.560
 of the avant-garde is very fashionable in 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.709
 europe mostly for young people and I'm going 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.350
 to make your brand logo entrance 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.510
 which is the split leaf so it's a drink 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.150
 that we are going to prepare it with a champagne 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.290
 good harvest a sparkling really 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.880
 sweet late harvest this is the one that the 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.050
 who chooses the brand and whoever chooses that 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.850
 also that is very rich I'm going to 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.800
 uncorking usually when one 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.550
 uncorked a bottle should not do 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:49.450
 noise but here is so good that 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.070
 it was not audio effect and it's icy 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.590
 because I left it in the freezer 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.990
 but this appetizer is always 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.280
 should serve with tapas today we're going to 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.160
 serve with sushi which is what we have 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.140
 here to accompany the same I take it and as 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.600
 is done in the northern tradition of 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.150
 Italy is served in a glass is not served in 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.490
 glass then I what I did is very 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.710
 easy anyone can do it if 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.900

 a cocktail glass is not a glass of any 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.740
 style is a glass like wine this 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.210
 it can be like a chopper glass too 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.150
 not those glasses where you use the 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:53.840

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.959
 base that allows you to turn around and 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:19.190
 have one or two livelihoods and see if 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.470

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.720

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.190
 good news is on facebook three parts 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.190
 of this late harvest 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.710
 sweet foaming but it's not amazing 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.450
 but I want you to see it later in the 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.100
 video because it has foam as if the 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.080
 glass had detergent in it exactly 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.080

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.440
 is preparing cute 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.940
 I'm worried because I'm afraid to become 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.430
 an addict to this a part of water with 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:13.919
 gas and there's no way to buy it because 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:16.350
 it is not entering it is entering and just 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:20.010
 to finish the three parts of this 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:23.130

 skin of an orange I will pass him in the 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.040
 edge and I'll make a knot in the 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.560
 Cup to be a little higher than the 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.050
 that made her down a knot with one with 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.780
 a skin with orange peel and like 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.990

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:49.680

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.139
 there is no marriage that can 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:57.000
 thrive if unilaterally one of 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.100
 the halves are retired abroad 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.060
 for 10 days without asking permission without 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.620
 ask permission 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.620

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:18.030

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:19.590

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.440

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.570

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:28.020

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.520
 country who speaks to them 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:40.500
 nicolás artusi we tried the script in my

 the first time followed he debuted with the 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.199
 but even with the pri I think it's going to 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:49.349
 be very marked a moment 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:51.539
