00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 a day today decided to shoot a video 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.219
 it is said to be something original 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.160
 but I am commenting on someone there something 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.960
 began to correspond and promised it 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.699
 In general, the type of video response is what I 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:24.000
 Today I do the following: how to fry kebabs 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.990
 in the presence of a knife and meat but if suddenly 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.240
 you are too lazy to carry skewers 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:34.290
 metal grill especially first 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.480
 you will be brought later 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.620
 laziness is back to pick you can 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.010
 forget it take these four pieces 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.620
 and make my mistake first try 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.890
 stick them in because i'm fire 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.180
 I threw it in and then I could not stick it in 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.399
 such here 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:01.949
 slingshots let's say so on them not crossbar 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.719
 and skewers and slept and chopsticks and desirable 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.409
 equally choose because when he 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:11.040
 will roast to make it easier 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:21.320
 turn take here such 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:21.320
 chopsticks meant to scold her in a hurry 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:34.049
 then such a small moment he kind of 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:36.450
 I recommend his pirate is important 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:43.110
 what should be turned 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:47.299
 as long as we have it, no, itâ€™s still quite normal 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:52.049
 with us if you notice 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:54.380
 chicken and pork a little left under 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.549
 in general skewer 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:03.869
 take sticks equally what kind 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.929
 wood but what you find and a moment later 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.299
 here it is all possible on the fire 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:12.120
 a little bit and he burn a little bit 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:14.329
 first here these bits and pieces burn in the second 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.549
 it warms up a little and 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:21.720
 under the bark of a tree big bitterness 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:25.040
 this bitterness the meat will not go later in 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:30.090
 everything is just ecologically friendly and 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.459
 say chick through and ready, well, everything 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.099
 Straight operations will not show the angle 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.079
 what's there like four slingshots two 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:41.959
 crossbar here such skewers 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.959
 all all bye
