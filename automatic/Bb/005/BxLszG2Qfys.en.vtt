00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
you're sliding up to to hit this so that

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.100 
you're sliding up to to hit this so that
you<00:01:35.009> don't<00:01:35.189> hit<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.270> wrong<00:01:36.509> place<00:01:36.540> so

you don't hit it in the wrong place so

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.730 
you don't hit it in the wrong place so
um<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.369> go<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.790> D<00:01:38.970> flat<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.540> then<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> hit

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
um if I go to the D flat and then I hit

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.370 
um if I go to the D flat and then I hit
the<00:01:41.720> G<00:01:42.720> up<00:01:42.899> here

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the G up here

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.340 
the G up here
so<00:01:43.890> that's<00:01:44.070> forming<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> first<00:01:44.759> chord

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
so that's forming the first chord

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.930 
so that's forming the first chord
and<00:01:46.530> then<00:01:46.680> just<00:01:46.890> slide<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.220> up<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.430> half<00:01:47.640> step

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
and then just slide it up the half step

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.990 
and then just slide it up the half step
to<00:01:47.970> where<00:01:48.330> it's<00:01:49.230> D<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.890> then<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:51.090> flat<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:53.000> and

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
to where it's D and then a flat so and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.420 
to where it's D and then a flat so and
if<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.750> look<00:01:54.990> we<00:01:55.470> have<00:01:55.740> nice<00:01:56.160> little
