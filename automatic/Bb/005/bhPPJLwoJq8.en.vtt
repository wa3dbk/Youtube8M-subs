00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello dear friends today we are with 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.450
 we prepare you unexpectedly beautiful 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.080
 original and very tasty and tender 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.450
 roll 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.960
 we need sugar flour sugar 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.220
 powder 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.680
 4 eggs cream mask he and which by the way with 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.230
 ease can be replaced by well us 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.960
 all known rim 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.380
 salt dough baking powder and vanilla 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.199
 sugar 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.989
 yes and we still need food paint 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.100
 we chose six colors red and yellow 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.640
 blue green pink and purple 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.969
 so let's get started first divide the eggs on 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.550
 yolks and whites and here my dear us 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.610
 need to be very careful because 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.239
 if suddenly a bit of protein gets into the whites 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.030
 yolk 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.030
 then squirrels with us you just do not scramble 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.860
 so now we need to beat the whites and 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.200
 By the way, add a little bit of a pinch of salt 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.650
 then our whites will beat up a lot 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.650
 faster 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.580
 but now squirrels are ready now in them we 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.550
 add sugar and add better not all 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.350
 Immediately and in parts added a little 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:28.380
 mixed and so two or three times it seems we 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.460
 have achieved the desired result our squirrels in 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.740
 whipping process 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.960
 reached us in consistency and 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.840
 by the way the form for checking we 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.210
 turn over the dishes and make sure that with 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.340
 nothing happens by the mass 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.280
 she is firm and not falling out 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.420
 gonna come time to do dry 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.280
 ingredients 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.130
 add vanilla sugar to flour 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.369
 baking powder and a little salt 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.509
 gently stir our mixture not 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.520
 take your time and mix well 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:03.450
 tacx put off to the side and scatter 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.729
 yolks not long after that into yolks we 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.700
 add our chilled protein 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.640
 mass and here again no need to hurry 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.820
 be careful add squirrels by 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.310
 parts slowly and gently stirring 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.110
 mixture 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.450
 avoid quick and sudden movements 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.940
 otherwise our airy protein foam 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.730
 alas can settle well 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.049
 mass we begin to add 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.049
 previously prepared dry mix 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:42.209
 see what we have in the end should 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:48.390
 get gentle loose and very 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:51.030
 beautiful dough so the turn came 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.310
 divide our dough into 6 pieces and 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.310
 paint each of them in the desired color 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.640
 proceed 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:10.520
 ready, perhaps we come to the very 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.580
 interesting moment using ordinary 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.870
 bags with sliced corners here 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.950
 in this way we squeeze our 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.560
 colorful silicone dough 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.450
 the surface here is certainly in a hurry 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.790
 keep yourself under control 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.030
 remember how you studied in the first grade 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.610
 write and draw straight sticks with us 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.370
 It turned out like this we send the dough to 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.790
 oven for 10 minutes at 160 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.660
 degrees and take up the cream for 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.660
 start with cream 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.120
 and put aside 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.569
 now beat mascarpone with sugar 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.569
 powder 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.930
 and here we are adding just now 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.930
 whipped cream and mix 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.240
 well, that's ready too 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.700
 by this time our time and drunkard arrived 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.840
 sponge cake which we immediately cover 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.120
 wet towel 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.120
 to later broke a pony 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.730
 took the form we need leave it 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.840
 cool down after twenty minutes take off 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:30.680
 biscuit wet towel and coat it 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.680
 his cream 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.930
 keep in mind on one side of the cream 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.379
 should be less to fail 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.379
 a lot of surplus 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.930
 slopped sloppy roll up our roll 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:57.100
 voila that's such a handsome we have turned 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.150
 isn't it a terrific gift for 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.560
