benefit for this time we'll concentrate
on<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.260> attack<00:00:28.619> helicopters<00:00:30.380> justifiably<00:00:31.380> so

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
on the attack helicopters justifiably so

on the attack helicopters justifiably so
the<00:00:31.920> attack<00:00:32.219> helicopters<00:00:32.940> as<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.239> class<00:00:33.630> seemed

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
the attack helicopters as a class seemed

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.860 
the attack helicopters as a class seemed
to<00:00:34.200> be<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.620> most<00:00:34.920> nerved<00:00:35.520> when<00:00:36.329> compared<00:00:36.809> to

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
to be the most nerved when compared to

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.500 
to be the most nerved when compared to
battlefield<00:00:37.410> 3<00:00:37.649> some<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.879> bugs<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.270> you

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
battlefield 3 some of the bugs that you

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.810 
battlefield 3 some of the bugs that you
may<00:00:39.750> remember<00:00:40.200> from<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.829> very<00:00:40.980> early<00:00:41.460> days<00:00:41.489> of

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
may remember from the very early days of

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.330 
may remember from the very early days of
benefit<00:00:42.270> 3<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.840> had<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> renaissance<00:00:44.100> in

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
benefit 3 have had a renaissance in

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.610 
benefit 3 have had a renaissance in
battlefield<00:00:44.820> 4<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.629> actually<00:00:46.170> come<00:00:46.500> to

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
battlefield 4 so you actually come to

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.920 
battlefield 4 so you actually come to
think<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:47.039> if<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.879> developments<00:00:48.809> have

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
think of if the developments have

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.540 
think of if the developments have
learned<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.469> lessons<00:00:49.829> from<00:00:49.980> battlefield<00:00:50.489> 3

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
learned that lessons from battlefield 3

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.729 
learned that lessons from battlefield 3
or<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.239> an<00:00:51.390> entirely<00:00:51.719> different<00:00:51.930> team<00:00:52.500> has

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
or if an entirely different team has

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.580 
or if an entirely different team has
developed<00:00:52.920> benefit<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:54.020> some<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.379> new

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
developed benefit for some of the new

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.770 
developed benefit for some of the new
bugs<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.129> are<00:00:56.250> embedded<00:00:56.550> 4<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.239> even<00:00:57.570> a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
bugs that are embedded 4 have even a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.110 
bugs that are embedded 4 have even a
more<00:00:58.410> severe<00:00:58.859> impact<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.699> overall

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
more severe impact on the overall

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.540 
more severe impact on the overall
gameplay<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:01.050> incredible<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.920> sounds<00:01:02.370> but

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
gameplay as incredible as it sounds but

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.240 
gameplay as incredible as it sounds but
that's<00:01:02.760> actually<00:01:03.149> true<00:01:03.420> which<00:01:04.379> those<00:01:04.949> blocks

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
that's actually true which those blocks

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.710 
that's actually true which those blocks
actually<00:01:05.519> are<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:06.030> would<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.330> show<00:01:06.659> you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
actually are we would like to show you

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.020 
actually are we would like to show you
using<00:01:07.350> all<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.860> little<00:01:08.159> snippets<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.850> we

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
using all the little snippets that we

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.510 
using all the little snippets that we
collected<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.750> video<00:01:10.159> first<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.340> all

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
collected for this video first of all

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.700 
collected for this video first of all
let's<00:01:11.850> look<00:01:11.939> at<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.510> called<00:01:12.810> dust<00:01:13.260> zones

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
let's look at the so called dust zones

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.270 
let's look at the so called dust zones
those<00:01:14.610> are<00:01:14.880> simply<00:01:15.390> zones<00:01:15.750> where<00:01:16.380> TV<00:01:16.920> missiles

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
those are simply zones where TV missiles

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.730 
those are simply zones where TV missiles
will<00:01:17.580> only<00:01:17.759> cause<00:01:18.210> dust<00:01:18.840> hits<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.439> enemy

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
will only cause dust hits on the enemy

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.820 
will only cause dust hits on the enemy
helicopters<00:01:20.630> those<00:01:21.630> zones<00:01:22.020> are<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.409> same

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
helicopters those zones are the same

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.580 
helicopters those zones are the same
ones<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.570> Infantry's<00:01:24.570> from<00:01:24.960> both<00:01:25.259> teams

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
ones that Infantry's from both teams

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.370 
ones that Infantry's from both teams
cannot<00:01:26.220> enter<00:01:26.670> without<00:01:27.390> dying<00:01:27.900> within<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
cannot enter without dying within the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.020 
cannot enter without dying within the
next<00:01:28.500> couple<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.920> seconds<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.700> might<00:01:29.880> also

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
next couple of seconds you might also

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.340 
next couple of seconds you might also
call<00:01:30.390> them<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.840> red<00:01:31.320> zones<00:01:32.780> we<00:01:33.780> show<00:01:34.110> that

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
call them the red zones we show that

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.200 
call them the red zones we show that
right<00:01:34.680> here<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.189> first<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.579> all<00:01:35.729> I'm<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
right here so first of all I'm in the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.969 
right here so first of all I'm in the
heady<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.450> get<00:01:36.930> out<00:01:37.020> for<00:01:37.259> split<00:01:37.500> second<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:37.890> you

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
heady I get out for split second so you

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.999 
heady I get out for split second so you
can<00:01:38.159> see<00:01:38.310> I'm<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.759> life<00:01:39.479> zone<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.619> TB

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
can see I'm in the life zone and the TB

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.819 
can see I'm in the life zone and the TB
does<00:01:41.310> damage<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:42.000> my<00:01:42.119> head<00:01:42.270> II<00:01:42.299> later<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.530> when

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
does damage on my head II later on when

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.469 
does damage on my head II later on when
I'm<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.579> dead<00:01:44.790> zone<00:01:44.820> which<00:01:45.329> is

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
I'm in the dead zone which is

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.270 
I'm in the dead zone which is
demonstrated<00:01:45.689> by<00:01:46.140> me<00:01:46.409> getting<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.009> out<00:01:47.070> of

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
demonstrated by me getting in and out of

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.460 
demonstrated by me getting in and out of
the<00:01:47.430> head<00:01:47.579> array<00:01:47.850> quick<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:48.990> see<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
the head array quick you can see the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.800 
the head array quick you can see the
heli<00:01:49.680> hitting<00:01:50.399> my<00:01:50.549> target<00:01:50.970> part<00:01:51.180> causing

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
heli hitting my target part causing

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.590 
heli hitting my target part causing
nothing<00:01:52.049> but<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.409> dust<00:01:52.979> cloud<00:01:53.270> generally<00:01:54.270> this

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
nothing but a dust cloud generally this

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.810 
nothing but a dust cloud generally this
bark<00:01:54.960> works<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.500> every<00:01:55.920> single<00:01:56.159> part<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.640> it

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
bark works on every single part of it

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.120 
bark works on every single part of it
for<00:01:57.090> map<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.140> imagine<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:59.070> can

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
for map and as you can imagine this can

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.819 
for map and as you can imagine this can
become<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.700> severe<00:02:00.119> problem<00:02:00.390> with<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.079> heli<00:02:01.619> crew

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
become a severe problem with a heli crew

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.709 
become a severe problem with a heli crew

as you can see here he's driving into

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.390 
as you can see here he's driving into
the<00:02:16.510> red<00:02:16.690> zone<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.350> TV<00:02:17.709> does<00:02:17.920> no<00:02:18.370> damage

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
the red zone and the TV does no damage

damage<00:02:24.540> now<00:02:25.540> let's<00:02:26.020> talk<00:02:26.260> about<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.860> ghosting

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
damage now let's talk about the ghosting

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.490 
damage now let's talk about the ghosting
of<00:02:27.520> rocket<00:02:27.850> pots<00:02:28.080> especially<00:02:29.080> at<00:02:29.200> close

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
of rocket pots especially at close

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.949 
of rocket pots especially at close
ranges<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.220> can<00:02:30.250> see<00:02:30.670> your<00:02:30.910> pots<00:02:31.360> downright

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
ranges you can see your pots downright

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.410 
ranges you can see your pots downright
fly<00:02:32.440> through<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.950> target<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:34.000> seems<00:02:34.270> as

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
fly through the target and it seems as

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.630 
fly through the target and it seems as
if<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.750> hitbox<00:02:35.140> itself<00:02:35.530> was<00:02:35.739> of<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.190> size<00:02:36.489> of

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
if the hitbox itself was of the size of

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.809 
if the hitbox itself was of the size of
a<00:02:36.790> walnut<00:02:37.030> or<00:02:37.540> so<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.319> teeny<00:02:38.860> tiny<00:02:39.160> spot<00:02:39.670> in

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
a walnut or so so a teeny tiny spot in

a walnut or so so a teeny tiny spot in
the<00:02:39.910> heady<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.420> have<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.690> hit<00:02:40.840> in<00:02:40.989> order

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
the heady that you have to hit in order

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.890 
the heady that you have to hit in order
to<00:02:41.410> register<00:02:41.590> your<00:02:42.069> pots<00:02:42.340> this<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.300> super

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
to register your pots this is a super

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.590 
to register your pots this is a super
annoying<00:02:44.260> problem<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.220> denies<00:02:45.850> pilots

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
annoying problem that denies pilots

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.620 
annoying problem that denies pilots
having<00:02:46.930> good<00:02:47.200> aim<00:02:47.380> their<00:02:47.860> well-deserved

success when fighting off enemies at
close<00:02:51.220> range<00:02:51.730> so<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.330> most<00:02:52.780> certainly<00:02:53.260> needs

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
close range so this most certainly needs

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:06.380 
close range so this most certainly needs
a<00:02:53.590> fix

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.780 

by<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.450> way<00:03:07.690> also<00:03:08.230> TV<00:03:08.500> misses<00:03:08.980> from<00:03:09.159> boats<00:03:09.489> can

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
by the way also TV misses from boats can

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.270 
by the way also TV misses from boats can
ghosts<00:03:10.150> through<00:03:10.569> the<00:03:10.720> enemy<00:03:11.140> both<00:03:11.920> if<00:03:12.099> you're

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
ghosts through the enemy both if you're

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.940 
ghosts through the enemy both if you're
firing<00:03:12.549> them<00:03:12.909> at<00:03:13.150> close<00:03:13.569> range<00:03:13.930> as<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:14.769> can

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
firing them at close range as you can

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.170 
firing them at close range as you can
see<00:03:15.159> here<00:03:15.459> very<00:03:16.269> interesting<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.700> our<00:03:18.700> next

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
see here very interesting to our next

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.330 
see here very interesting to our next
point<00:03:19.360> on<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.599> list<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:20.110> ghosting<00:03:20.709> with<00:03:20.860> TVs

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
point on the list is ghosting with TVs

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
point on the list is ghosting with TVs
the<00:03:22.209> metaphor<00:03:22.720> here<00:03:22.930> is<00:03:23.080> that<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.319> ghost<00:03:23.830> is

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
the metaphor here is that a ghost is

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.539 
the metaphor here is that a ghost is
bypassing<00:03:25.360> an<00:03:25.690> object<00:03:26.110> contact<00:03:26.680> free<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.340> in

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
bypassing an object contact free and in

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.270 
bypassing an object contact free and in
the<00:03:27.730> case<00:03:27.879> of<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.180> TV<00:03:28.540> that<00:03:28.690> means

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
the case of the TV that means

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.830 
the case of the TV that means
bypassing<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.430> hitbox<00:03:30.819> not<00:03:31.150> doing<00:03:31.480> any

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
bypassing the hitbox not doing any

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.110 
bypassing the hitbox not doing any
damage<00:03:32.230> whatsoever<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:33.459> know<00:03:33.489> that<00:03:33.849> part

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
damage whatsoever you know that part

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.720 
damage whatsoever you know that part
from<00:03:34.360> battlefield<00:03:35.290> 3<00:03:35.349> since<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.280> game<00:03:36.700> was

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
from battlefield 3 since the game was

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.119 
from battlefield 3 since the game was
released<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.450> hopefully<00:03:38.049> it<00:03:38.260> will<00:03:38.440> get<00:03:38.620> fixed

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
released and hopefully it will get fixed

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.960 
released and hopefully it will get fixed
so<00:03:39.720> what<00:03:40.720> over<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.079> TV<00:03:41.470> cannot<00:03:41.980> only<00:03:42.190> fly

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
so what over the TV cannot only fly

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.240 
so what over the TV cannot only fly
through<00:03:43.329> your<00:03:43.599> target<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:44.109> can<00:03:44.140> also<00:03:44.440> dust<00:03:44.980> on

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
through your target it can also dust on

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.979 
through your target it can also dust on
it<00:03:46.739> just<00:03:47.739> like<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.160> ghosting<00:03:48.549> effect<00:03:48.989> dusting

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
it just like the ghosting effect dusting

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.660 
it just like the ghosting effect dusting
on<00:03:50.140> your<00:03:50.319> targets<00:03:50.799> is<00:03:50.950> something<00:03:51.370> that<00:03:51.519> you

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
on your targets is something that you

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.030 
on your targets is something that you
all<00:03:51.849> know<00:03:52.150> from<00:03:52.359> Bell<00:03:52.599> V<00:03:52.840> 3<00:03:53.109> &amp;<00:03:53.319> 4<00:03:53.829> the<00:03:53.890> only

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
all know from Bell V 3 &amp; 4 the only

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.530 
all know from Bell V 3 &amp; 4 the only
thing<00:03:54.400> that<00:03:54.519> remains<00:03:54.879> to<00:03:55.060> be<00:03:55.090> said<00:03:55.390> is

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
thing that remains to be said is

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.020 
thing that remains to be said is
hopefully<00:03:56.319> this<00:03:56.829> will<00:03:57.040> be<00:03:57.190> patched<00:03:57.459> one<00:03:57.819> day

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
hopefully this will be patched one day

hopefully this will be patched one day
for<00:03:58.329> good

3 we hope that this time it will be
fixed<00:05:24.680> a<00:05:24.920> lot<00:05:25.190> faster<00:05:25.820> a<00:05:26.590> new<00:05:27.590> thing<00:05:27.830> in<00:05:28.010> before

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
fixed a lot faster a new thing in before

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.700 
fixed a lot faster a new thing in before
is<00:05:28.670> that<00:05:28.880> the<00:05:29.090> camera<00:05:29.600> of<00:05:29.780> your<00:05:29.960> TV<00:05:30.290> starts

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
is that the camera of your TV starts

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.010 
is that the camera of your TV starts
shaking<00:05:30.920> when<00:05:31.340> explosions<00:05:32.150> are<00:05:32.390> going<00:05:32.870> off

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
shaking when explosions are going off

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.380 
shaking when explosions are going off
nearby<00:05:33.350> this<00:05:34.040> applies<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.460> explosions<00:05:35.180> that

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
nearby this applies to explosions that

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.330 
nearby this applies to explosions that
are<00:05:35.540> close<00:05:35.780> to<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.110> missile<00:05:36.380> itself<00:05:36.500> and<00:05:37.040> also

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
are close to the missile itself and also

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.070 
are close to the missile itself and also
to<00:05:37.520> explosions<00:05:38.120> that<00:05:38.300> are<00:05:38.480> close<00:05:38.630> to<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:38.930> head

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
to explosions that are close to the head

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.920 
to explosions that are close to the head
ESO<00:05:39.500> the<00:05:39.740> launcher<00:05:40.160> position<00:05:40.670> obviously<00:05:41.150> this

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
ESO the launcher position obviously this

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.750 
ESO the launcher position obviously this
doesn't<00:05:42.200> make<00:05:42.410> any<00:05:42.590> sense<00:05:42.860> whatsoever<00:05:43.400> and

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
doesn't make any sense whatsoever and

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.250 
doesn't make any sense whatsoever and
therefore<00:05:44.090> we<00:05:44.240> hope<00:05:44.390> it<00:05:44.540> gets<00:05:44.750> fixed<00:05:45.020> too

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
therefore we hope it gets fixed too

therefore we hope it gets fixed too
interestingly<00:05:46.010> now<00:05:46.760> the<00:05:46.840> person<00:05:47.840> of<00:05:47.990> the<00:05:48.170> TV

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
interestingly now the person of the TV

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.680 
interestingly now the person of the TV
shooter<00:05:48.890> is<00:05:49.040> now<00:05:49.250> fully<00:05:49.640> identical<00:05:50.390> with<00:05:50.540> the

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
shooter is now fully identical with the

shooter is now fully identical with the
TV<00:05:51.020> missile<00:05:51.230> itself<00:05:51.710> this<00:05:52.490> means<00:05:52.730> that<00:05:52.940> the

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
TV missile itself this means that the

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.300 
TV missile itself this means that the
player<00:05:53.420> can<00:05:53.720> take<00:05:53.780> damage<00:05:54.260> if<00:05:54.590> the<00:05:54.710> TV<00:05:55.100> missile

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
player can take damage if the TV missile

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.000 
player can take damage if the TV missile
is<00:05:55.520> shot<00:05:55.790> as<00:05:56.360> you<00:05:56.420> can<00:05:56.720> see<00:05:56.930> it<00:05:57.080> is<00:05:57.380> relatively

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
is shot as you can see it is relatively

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.880 
is shot as you can see it is relatively

lose its owner after 1000 meters but
