00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.960
 Hello and welcome to "Wrinkles with Yvonne"! 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.580
 Today I'll show you how to fold a swan out of a banknote. 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.900
 Here we go! 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.960
 Fold one corner of the bill upwards so that it is flush with the long edge. 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.640
 This creates a triangle, which you fold upwards. 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.440
 Open the two folds again. 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.780
 At the vertical fold you now fold over the other side of the bill. 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.220
 This will make the bill square. 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.520
 Halve this square to create a triangle. 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.520
 Open this fold again. 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.440
 You now have a diagonal line in the middle of the bill. 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.060
 Now fold one of the outer edges towards this diagonal. 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.040
 The same folding you do on the other side, 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.240
 so that the shape of a paper kite arises. 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.240
 Turn the bill around. Fold an outer edge to the center line again. 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.000
 You also repeat this folding on the other side of the bill. 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.500
 Now fold the lower tip onto the upper tip. 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.920

 via my partner link in the video description. Thank you very much. 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.920
 That's how it looks now. 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.360
 Halve it in length. 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.460
 Fold down the upper third of the narrow piece. 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.880
 This will be the head of your swan. 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.420
 Hold the lower end of the neck firmly 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.580
 and pull the body down with the other hand. 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.920
 You have to push the body against the table so that the swan stops. 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.380
 Keep your head in shape and shape 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.320
 You have already folded a swan from a banknote. 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.760
 Thank you for watching. 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.540
 I would be happy about a thumbs up 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.900
 and if you subscribe to my channel.

 Until next time.
