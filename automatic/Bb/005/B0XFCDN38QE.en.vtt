00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.109

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.670
 abraÃ£o unveil the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.720
 finally we are a second animal of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.580
 according to my order totally 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.930
 random this is the puzzle 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.179
 We need Mars 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.369
 she is also very fast because 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.780
 A lot of people want to know how thiago 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.149
 if the damage is resolved 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.100
 finally the first simple animals are 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:46.800
 marked on the map this one is matt 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:49.320
 It's on the screen, she quotes if it's pronounced 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.180
 finally the first puzzle is the following in a 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.489
 peaceful field stitched with stones 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.219
 a lookout there guard your eyes 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.719
 dedicated to your delicate look thank 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.789
 all souls second place place 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.309
 rest and has by chance a cemetery 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.210
 on the front tom would probably be that already 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:14.430
 I saw this car here stealing you here. 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:18.360
 is also rich right here on this lap of 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:23.009
 We have the first one we 're leaving. 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.930
 first city notre dame observes 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.689
 their daughters one with the arrival between the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.200
 lady and her son's face at the 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.180
 his flock to the church flock 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.860
 Other major for not one who does not need 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.909
 show me where gabriel 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.570
 then right here and we have a mischievous eggs 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.420
 church that the minimum is right in front of you 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.830
 third friend case 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:52.130
 but I think too well captured or 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.580
 this galera that traders and guarulhos already 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:04.430
 he dressed in cosme we see nothing 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:06.950
 it is very dark is exactly what 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.840
 do on the ceiling 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:15.370
 The purpose of the agreement is Dom Vicente 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.370
 are my brand 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.500
 today was following another one from the bible 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.130
 I think this is the third nimas 14 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.819
 in case 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.160
 we did a second and third in the church 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.970
 security up there has one on top 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.269
 we have the third none of the church like that 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:46.160
 as he himself said it was a match 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:48.319
 similar in a has nothing but give 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.299
 after our sometimes diverge giving 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.859
 place the man ferra the victim of a 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.290
 murderer comes to an agreement the subject 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:56.540
 to get a city the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:06.079
 treasure already under the mount or 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:08.870
 Be a horse and talk and try. 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.840
 I find that I was here because it is 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:16.010
 green the city do not ask and we have here 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.989
 a statue I know if we were all mega 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.390
 understand the French history of 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.070
 revolution and everything else 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.070
 week runs a pacifier 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.340
 so it would be much easier just 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.720
 Let's wake up, not everyone will handle it either. 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.500
 everyone knows on the tip of the tongue what 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.500
 What's the name of the front? 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:53.450
 the attack just because I thought 'ok claw but 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:55.040
 make good progress crowd 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.280
 I think this very specific business 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.810
 with the French Revolution is legal but the 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.310
 game had to try in a way 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.140
 Pass information to us but I think 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.150
 that newspapers have these newspapers 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.030
 scattered around the city tells the story 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.340
 of the revolution and everything else so if I 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.040
 Have a lot of patience to study to 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.760
 read all the papers will get you more 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.930
 it's easy to be a good time to study 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:25.520
 or did you see the video and the puzzles without having 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:28.430
 that reading a lot here is a 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.950
 game nobody found time is fuck 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:36.710
 You only have time to express this 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:39.260
 last the marketing riddle that nobody 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.550
 not only of Mars completed 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.280
 This is it, I hope you have 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.350
 liked to have helped make us there that 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.030
 helped to enroll in the cloister of the item 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.820
 other videos here have their part and 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.530
 follow playlist is behind all 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.510
 Our enemies do not leave the channel 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.660
