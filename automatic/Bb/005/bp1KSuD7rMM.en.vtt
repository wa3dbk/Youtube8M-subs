away early on in this album only at the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.850 
away early on in this album only at the
fourth<00:02:14.460> track<00:02:14.730> they<00:02:15.150> decided<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.690> just<00:02:16.380> put<00:02:16.830> a

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
fourth track they decided to just put a

fourth track they decided to just put a
down<00:02:17.250> payment<00:02:17.330> kind<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.390> slow<00:02:18.600> things<00:02:18.930> down

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020

down payment kind of slow things down
and<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.770> kind<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.010> worked<00:02:20.220> out<00:02:20.310> because<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.670> was

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
and it kind of worked out because it was

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.700 
and it kind of worked out because it was
a<00:02:20.910> really<00:02:21.480> well-done<00:02:21.630> song<00:02:22.050> one<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.650> the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
a really well-done song one of the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.160 
a really well-done song one of the
standout<00:02:23.280> tracks<00:02:23.700> in<00:02:23.940> my<00:02:24.240> opinion<00:02:24.630> on<00:02:25.020> this

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
standout tracks in my opinion on this

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.530 
standout tracks in my opinion on this
album<00:02:25.410> was<00:02:25.650> actually<00:02:26.069> break<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.670> cycle<00:02:27.180> now

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
album was actually break the cycle now

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.970 
album was actually break the cycle now
something<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:27.900> really<00:02:28.110> stuck<00:02:28.230> out<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.680> me<00:02:28.830> in

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
something that really stuck out to me in

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.560 
something that really stuck out to me in
this<00:02:29.100> song<00:02:29.310> was<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.610> fact<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.940> they<00:02:30.090> took<00:02:30.300> a

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
this song was the fact that they took a

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.630 
this song was the fact that they took a
step<00:02:31.140> away<00:02:31.290> from<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.710> normal<00:02:31.920> breakdown

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640
