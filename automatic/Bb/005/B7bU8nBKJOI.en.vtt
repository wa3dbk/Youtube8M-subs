and earthed the cable out onto the
motherboard<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.320> that's<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.710> car<00:01:29.040> earth<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
motherboard so that's the car earth to

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.609 
motherboard so that's the car earth to
the<00:01:29.729> laptop<00:01:30.119> now<00:01:31.220> it's<00:01:32.220> going<00:01:32.430> for<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> few<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
the laptop now it's going for a few and

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.289 
the laptop now it's going for a few and
which<00:01:34.619> then<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.700> run<00:01:35.880> all<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> way

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
which then this is run all the way

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.319 
which then this is run all the way
through<00:01:36.390> center<00:01:36.930> console<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:38.369> up<00:01:38.790> until<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
through center console and up until the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.440 
through center console and up until the
head<00:01:39.509> unit<00:01:39.689> which<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> really<00:01:40.409> simple<00:01:40.829> mod

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
head unit which is a really simple mod

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.149 
head unit which is a really simple mod
where<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.479> wide<00:01:43.320> open<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> tape<00:01:43.979> though

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
where you wide open to the tape though

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.469 
where you wide open to the tape though
you<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.430> put<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> little<00:01:44.759> blank<00:01:45.119> tape

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
you have to put like a little blank tape

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.080 
you have to put like a little blank tape
in<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.619> tape<00:01:46.829> deck<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.369> work<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:47.850> you

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
in the tape deck for it to work but you

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.429 
in the tape deck for it to work but you
can't<00:01:48.299> hear<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.509> running<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.990> really<00:01:49.200> quiet

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
can't hear it running is really quiet

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.499 
can't hear it running is really quiet
and<00:01:50.159> real<00:01:50.340> easy<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:51.000> we'll<00:01:51.149> go<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
and real easy so then we'll go to the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.850 
and real easy so then we'll go to the
screen<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:51.990> hit<00:01:52.079> play<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.320> hopefully<00:01:52.590> it'll

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
screen just hit play and hopefully it'll

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.420 
screen just hit play and hopefully it'll
work<00:01:53.720> so<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:54.990> just<00:01:55.140> works<00:01:55.320> through<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
work so then it just works through the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.020 
work so then it just works through the
edge<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.509> know<00:01:57.659> yourself

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
edge you know yourself

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.240 
edge you know yourself
and<00:01:59.630> while<00:02:00.110> is<00:02:00.259> plain<00:02:00.469> you<00:02:00.649> can<00:02:00.770> go<00:02:00.860> back<00:02:01.039> into

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
and while is plain you can go back into

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.730 
and while is plain you can go back into
your<00:02:01.340> library<00:02:01.820> go<00:02:02.180> back<00:02:02.420> into<00:02:02.630> your<00:02:02.990> all<00:02:03.560> your

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
your library go back into your all your

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.639 
your library go back into your all your
different<00:02:04.039> songs<00:02:04.430> you<00:02:04.969> know<00:02:05.119> you<00:02:05.180> can<00:02:05.450> have

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
different songs you know you can have

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.779 
different songs you know you can have
anything<00:02:06.649> you<00:02:06.829> want<00:02:07.840> a<00:02:09.190> better<00:02:10.190> Christopher

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
anything you want a better Christopher

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.670 
anything you want a better Christopher
why<00:02:11.060> not<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.330> bit<00:02:11.569> Christopher<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.380> they<00:02:12.500> get<00:02:12.650> a

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
why not a bit Christopher so they get a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.960 
why not a bit Christopher so they get a
bit<00:02:12.800> lady<00:02:13.010> in<00:02:13.160> red<00:02:15.099> so<00:02:16.099> yeah<00:02:16.280> really<00:02:16.489> simple<00:02:16.880> to

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
bit lady in red so yeah really simple to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.940 
bit lady in red so yeah really simple to
use<00:02:17.030> interface<00:02:17.420> which<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:17.959> really<00:02:18.170> nice<00:02:18.290> and

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
use interface which is really nice and

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.670 
use interface which is really nice and
you<00:02:19.069> can<00:02:19.280> actually<00:02:19.400> hold<00:02:19.700> down<00:02:19.880> home<00:02:20.090> screen

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
you can actually hold down home screen

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.080 
you can actually hold down home screen
and<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:21.890> playing<00:02:22.430> in<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.610> background<00:02:22.640> and

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
and it is playing in the background and

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.610 
and it is playing in the background and
what<00:02:23.269> right<00:02:23.870> running<00:02:24.440> users<00:02:24.830> is<00:02:25.550> winamp<00:02:26.620> so

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
what right running users is winamp so

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.860 
what right running users is winamp so
you<00:02:27.680> can<00:02:27.950> select<00:02:28.280> this<00:02:28.550> one<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.300> free<00:02:29.510> Winamp

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
you can select this one and free Winamp

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.140 
you can select this one and free Winamp
you<00:02:30.019> can<00:02:30.170> change<00:02:30.440> all<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.830> all<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.730> presets

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
you can change all the all the presets

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.420 
you can change all the all the presets
if<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.540> want<00:02:32.780> some<00:02:33.560> skins<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.099> do<00:02:34.220> another

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
if you want some skins to do another

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.070 
if you want some skins to do another
little<00:02:34.640> thing<00:02:34.730> I've<00:02:34.940> got<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.150> mention<00:02:35.299> we

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
little thing I've got to mention we

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.470 
little thing I've got to mention we
press<00:02:36.260> except<00:02:36.739> we<00:02:37.670> can<00:02:37.819> then<00:02:37.970> go<00:02:38.090> straight<00:02:38.299> to

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
press except we can then go straight to

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.000 
press except we can then go straight to
hibernate

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
hibernate

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.309 
hibernate
so<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.160> hibernates<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:41.180> laptop<00:02:41.750> there<00:02:42.230> you

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
so that hibernates the laptop there you

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.199 
so that hibernates the laptop there you
go<00:02:42.440> I've<00:02:43.280> been<00:02:43.430> puts<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.760> laptop<00:02:44.030> in<00:02:44.150> a

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
go I've been puts the laptop in a

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.180 
go I've been puts the laptop in a
hibernation<00:02:44.780> mode<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:45.769> doesn't<00:02:46.069> use

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
hibernation mode and it doesn't use

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.740 
hibernation mode and it doesn't use
hardly<00:02:46.489> any<00:02:46.640> batteries<00:02:47.000> so<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.180> can<00:02:47.360> leave<00:02:47.540> it

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
hardly any batteries so you can leave it

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.140 
hardly any batteries so you can leave it
on<00:02:47.900> in<00:02:48.560> hibernation<00:02:49.160> mode<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.549> it<00:02:49.640> when<00:02:50.060> the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
on in hibernation mode and it when the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.870 
on in hibernation mode and it when the
powers<00:02:50.480> off<00:02:50.860> it'll<00:02:51.860> run<00:02:52.069> all<00:02:52.190> off<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.459> battery

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
powers off it'll run all off the battery

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.300 
powers off it'll run all off the battery
so<00:02:53.569> then<00:02:54.140> when<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:54.680> want<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:54.920> start<00:02:55.160> it<00:02:55.250> up

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
so then when you want to start it up

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.890 
so then when you want to start it up
again<00:02:55.430> it's<00:02:55.880> really<00:02:56.120> quick<00:02:56.269> but<00:02:56.540> I'm<00:02:56.750> not

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
again it's really quick but I'm not

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.850 
again it's really quick but I'm not
gonna<00:02:57.019> do<00:02:57.140> that<00:02:57.170> analysis<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.769> the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
gonna do that analysis in the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.280 
gonna do that analysis in the
hibernation<00:02:57.980> so<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:59.540> just<00:02:59.750> makes<00:02:59.900> you<00:03:00.079> means

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
hibernation so it just makes you means

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.780 
hibernation so it just makes you means
you<00:03:00.349> don't<00:03:00.500> have<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.769> start<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.430> up<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:01.610> go<00:03:01.760> for

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
you don't have to start it up and go for

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.970 
you don't have to start it up and go for
the<00:03:02.030> booting<00:03:02.360> process<00:03:02.390> every<00:03:03.140> time<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.500> wanna

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
the booting process every time you wanna

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.500 
the booting process every time you wanna
use<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.400> right<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:04.880> we're<00:03:04.970> gonna<00:03:05.060> go<00:03:05.239> ahead<00:03:05.299> and

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
use it right so we're gonna go ahead and

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.720 
use it right so we're gonna go ahead and
take<00:03:05.780> out<00:03:05.959> hibernation<00:03:06.590> mode<00:03:06.739> and<00:03:07.010> this<00:03:07.549> is

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
take out hibernation mode and this is

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.559 
take out hibernation mode and this is
PCB<00:03:08.209> here<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:09.049> power<00:03:09.319> switch<00:03:10.569> unfortunately

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
PCB here the power switch unfortunately

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.270 
PCB here the power switch unfortunately
I'm<00:03:11.930> not<00:03:11.989> very<00:03:12.290> good<00:03:12.410> at<00:03:12.470> soldiering<00:03:12.859> yeah

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
I'm not very good at soldiering yeah

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.009 
I'm not very good at soldiering yeah
it's<00:03:13.459> quite<00:03:13.640> easy<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.269> could<00:03:14.420> quite

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
it's quite easy to you could quite

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.590 
it's quite easy to you could quite
possibly<00:03:15.049> solder<00:03:15.769> it<00:03:15.859> into<00:03:16.130> a<00:03:16.160> button<00:03:16.600> you

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
possibly solder it into a button you

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.590 
possibly solder it into a button you
know<00:03:17.720> put<00:03:18.139> a<00:03:18.170> bit<00:03:18.350> more<00:03:18.560> if<00:03:18.620> you<00:03:18.680> want<00:03:19.120> but<00:03:20.120> you

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
know put a bit more if you want but you

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.879 
know put a bit more if you want but you
know<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:20.840> didn't<00:03:21.350> go<00:03:21.440> ahead<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:21.680> do<00:03:21.769> that

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
know I didn't go ahead and do that

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:22.750 
know I didn't go ahead and do that
because<00:03:22.010> I'm<00:03:22.160> not<00:03:22.250> very<00:03:22.370> good<00:03:22.459> at<00:03:22.549> soldering

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
because I'm not very good at soldering

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.390 
because I'm not very good at soldering
and<00:03:23.299> so<00:03:23.840> that's<00:03:24.019> starting<00:03:24.350> up<00:03:24.410> now<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.220> you

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
and so that's starting up now and you

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.740 
and so that's starting up now and you
see<00:03:25.609> the<00:03:25.700> powers<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.060> come<00:03:26.209> back<00:03:26.359> on<00:03:26.510> here<00:03:26.690> you

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
see the powers to come back on here you

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.599 
see the powers to come back on here you
can<00:03:26.840> see<00:03:26.989> a<00:03:27.019> blue<00:03:27.230> light<00:03:27.380> so<00:03:27.650> you<00:03:28.220> just<00:03:28.370> got<00:03:28.519> to

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
can see a blue light so you just got to

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.970 
can see a blue light so you just got to
give<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:28.819> a<00:03:28.910> minute<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:30.010> power<00:03:31.010> up<00:03:32.260> yep

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
give it a minute to power up yep

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.620 
give it a minute to power up yep
I'll<00:03:34.370> do<00:03:34.609> this<00:03:34.730> in<00:03:34.850> real<00:03:34.970> time<00:03:35.030> I'm<00:03:35.389> not<00:03:35.510> gonna

I've wired this little contraption on to

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.839 
I've wired this little contraption on to
it<00:05:15.970> okay<00:05:16.630> so<00:05:17.139> if<00:05:17.199> wired<00:05:17.440> from<00:05:17.830> here<00:05:18.220> into<00:05:18.610> the

back of the thing and then that powers

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.060 
back of the thing and then that powers
an<00:05:21.789> extra<00:05:22.180> fan<00:05:22.449> so<00:05:23.020> that<00:05:23.169> it<00:05:23.380> can<00:05:23.770> help<00:05:23.919> with

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
an extra fan so that it can help with

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.040 
an extra fan so that it can help with
cooling<00:05:24.430> and<00:05:24.639> then<00:05:25.210> it<00:05:25.360> goes<00:05:25.509> through<00:05:25.539> a

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
cooling and then it goes through a

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.270 
cooling and then it goes through a
little<00:05:27.330> fuse<00:05:28.330> box<00:05:28.570> thing<00:05:28.840> I've<00:05:28.960> got<00:05:29.110> up<00:05:29.229> at<00:05:30.159> the

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
little fuse box thing I've got up at the

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.980 
little fuse box thing I've got up at the
end<00:05:30.400> is<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.669> female<00:05:31.000> another<00:05:31.419> female<00:05:31.630> input

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
end is the female another female input

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.879 
end is the female another female input
socket<00:05:32.169> for<00:05:32.620> the<00:05:33.630> cigarette<00:05:34.630> Chargers<00:05:34.990> so

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
socket for the cigarette Chargers so

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.140 
socket for the cigarette Chargers so
then<00:05:36.039> I<00:05:36.099> could<00:05:36.159> go<00:05:36.490> ahead<00:05:36.639> and<00:05:36.729> plug<00:05:36.880> that<00:05:36.909> one

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
then I could go ahead and plug that one

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.089 
then I could go ahead and plug that one
into<00:05:37.360> it<00:05:37.509> it<00:05:37.960> should<00:05:38.080> pause<00:05:38.259> the<00:05:38.380> laptop<00:05:38.710> and

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
into it it should pause the laptop and

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.010 
into it it should pause the laptop and
that's<00:05:39.310> all<00:05:39.520> being<00:05:39.820> able<00:05:40.000> to<00:05:40.419> sit<00:05:40.659> underneath

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
that's all being able to sit underneath

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.080 
that's all being able to sit underneath
there<00:05:41.409> and<00:05:41.590> you<00:05:42.250> see<00:05:42.430> little<00:05:42.520> bits<00:05:42.789> and<00:05:42.909> proof

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
there and you see little bits and proof

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.439 
there and you see little bits and proof
from<00:05:43.150> there<00:05:43.360> it<00:05:43.750> actually<00:05:44.050> goes<00:05:44.229> quite<00:05:44.500> deep

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
from there it actually goes quite deep

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.360 
from there it actually goes quite deep
under<00:05:46.449> under<00:05:47.259> there<00:05:47.469> so<00:05:47.710> you<00:05:47.800> can<00:05:47.949> put<00:05:48.159> quite<00:05:48.310> a

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
under under there so you can put quite a

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.159 
under under there so you can put quite a
lot<00:05:48.460> of<00:05:48.669> cabling<00:05:49.060> in<00:05:49.210> there<00:05:49.389> if<00:05:49.479> any<00:05:49.659> -<00:05:49.900> just<00:05:50.110> to

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
lot of cabling in there if any - just to

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.140 
lot of cabling in there if any - just to
make<00:05:50.289> everything<00:05:50.500> tidy<00:05:50.830> and<00:05:51.520> just<00:05:52.000> a<00:05:52.029> bit

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
make everything tidy and just a bit

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.909 
make everything tidy and just a bit
time-consuming<00:05:52.360> really<00:05:52.990> but<00:05:53.260> it's<00:05:53.710> quite

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
time-consuming really but it's quite

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.340 
time-consuming really but it's quite
easily<00:05:54.070> done
