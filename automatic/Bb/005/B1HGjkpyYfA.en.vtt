00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.330 

kind<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.290> walk<00:00:34.530> through<00:00:34.920> some<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
kind of walk through some of the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.760 
kind of walk through some of the
fundamental<00:00:35.940> drills<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.650> that

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
fundamental drills that I like and that

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.170 
fundamental drills that I like and that
we've<00:00:37.890> used<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.190> our<00:00:38.280> program<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.940> think

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
we've used in our program that I think

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.280 
we've used in our program that I think
are<00:00:39.300> pretty<00:00:39.450> successful

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
are pretty successful

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.710 
are pretty successful

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
he's going to go right so we'll

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.100 
he's going to go right so we'll
alternate<00:01:38.820> back<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.120> forth<00:01:39.360> between<00:01:39.750> which

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
alternate back and forth between which

way<00:01:40.260> we<00:01:40.440> go<00:01:40.620> so<00:01:41.250> he's<00:01:41.370> going<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.520> pass<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
way we go so he's going to pass to the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.300 
way we go so he's going to pass to the
left<00:01:42.120> real<00:01:42.720> slow<00:01:42.990> here<00:01:43.020> guys<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.159> ball

left real slow here guys and if the ball
is<00:01:44.430> going<00:01:44.550> to<00:01:44.610> come<00:01:44.730> back<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:45.270> middle<00:01:45.450> all

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
is going to come back to the middle all

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.410 
is going to come back to the middle all
right<00:01:46.409> then<00:01:46.980> as<00:01:47.190> he<00:01:47.370> gets<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.820> they<00:01:47.970> have<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.210> be

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
right then as he gets it they have to be

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.390 
right then as he gets it they have to be
sprinting<00:01:49.200> when<00:01:49.320> they're<00:01:49.470> doing<00:01:49.620> this<00:01:49.920> okay

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
sprinting when they're doing this okay

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.130 
sprinting when they're doing this okay
if<00:01:50.520> they're<00:01:50.640> not<00:01:50.850> sprinting<00:01:51.450> it'll<00:01:52.050> be<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
if they're not sprinting it'll be a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.780 
if they're not sprinting it'll be a
travel<00:01:52.710> or<00:01:52.830> they<00:01:52.950> won't<00:01:53.070> be<00:01:53.190> able<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.460> get<00:01:53.610> what

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
travel or they won't be able to get what

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.280 
travel or they won't be able to get what
they<00:01:53.940> need<00:01:54.120> out<00:01:54.150> of<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:55.140> they're

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
they need out of this so they're

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.840

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
bounds it's a it's a little bit easier

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.080

when<00:04:38.080> you're<00:04:38.230> doing<00:04:38.590> layups<00:04:39.250> then<00:04:39.730> you<00:04:40.000> know

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
when you're doing layups then you know

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.210 
when you're doing layups then you know
jump<00:04:40.389> shots<00:04:40.660> but<00:04:40.960> you<00:04:41.200> know<00:04:41.710> we're<00:04:41.950> in<00:04:41.980> the

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
jump shots but you know we're in the

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
take it out of bounds

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.400 
take it out of bounds
so<00:04:46.389> you<00:04:46.480> might<00:04:46.630> as<00:04:46.720> well<00:04:46.780> teach<00:04:47.080> them<00:04:47.260> that

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
so you might as well teach them that

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.770 
so you might as well teach them that
skill<00:04:47.770> right<00:04:47.980> away<00:04:48.250> I'm<00:04:48.550> in<00:04:49.030> this<00:04:49.180> drill<00:04:49.510> but

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
you know I like this drill it's a

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.030 
you know I like this drill it's a
conditioning<00:04:52.570> drill<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:53.139> transition<00:04:53.770> drill

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
conditioning drill to transition drill

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.800 
conditioning drill to transition drill
it's<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.280> layup<00:04:54.610> drill<00:04:54.880> it's<00:04:55.030> a<00:04:55.060> communication

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
it's a layup drill it's a communication

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.480 
it's a layup drill it's a communication
drill<00:04:56.110> you<00:04:56.590> know<00:04:56.710> does<00:04:56.889> a<00:04:56.919> little<00:04:57.160> bit<00:04:57.400> of

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
drill you know does a little bit of

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.550 
drill you know does a little bit of
everything<00:04:57.850> so<00:04:58.090> so<00:04:58.870> I<00:04:58.900> really<00:04:59.229> kind<00:04:59.380> of<00:04:59.500> like

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
everything so so I really kind of like

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.120 
everything so so I really kind of like
that

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
that

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.650 
that
all<00:05:00.370> right<00:05:00.490> Augustin<00:05:00.970> you<00:05:01.060> can<00:05:01.180> jump<00:05:01.450> in<00:05:01.570> on

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
all right Augustin you can jump in on

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.780 
all right Augustin you can jump in on
this<00:05:01.840> one<00:05:02.229> so<00:05:02.440> that<00:05:02.590> what<00:05:03.130> we<00:05:03.220> call<00:05:03.430> that<00:05:03.639> is<00:05:03.760> a

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
this one so that what we call that is a

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.820 
this one so that what we call that is a
Laker<00:05:04.060> drill<00:05:04.450> and<00:05:04.660> like<00:05:05.080> I<00:05:05.200> said<00:05:05.260> before<00:05:05.470> I

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
Laker drill and like I said before I

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.550 
Laker drill and like I said before I
think<00:05:06.100> it's<00:05:06.220> important<00:05:06.639> to<00:05:06.729> name<00:05:06.880> the<00:05:07.030> drills

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
think it's important to name the drills

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.320 
think it's important to name the drills
the<00:05:08.560> kids<00:05:08.770> can<00:05:08.950> jump<00:05:09.190> up<00:05:09.400> and<00:05:09.580> real<00:05:09.729> quickly<00:05:10.150> do

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
the kids can jump up and real quickly do

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.300 
the kids can jump up and real quickly do
the<00:05:10.479> drills<00:05:10.780> they<00:05:11.020> know<00:05:11.169> what<00:05:11.350> what's<00:05:12.040> kind<00:05:12.220> of

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
the drills they know what what's kind of

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.950 
the drills they know what what's kind of
expected<00:05:12.880> and<00:05:13.000> what<00:05:13.090> they<00:05:13.210> need<00:05:13.360> to<00:05:13.450> do<00:05:13.600> all

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
expected and what they need to do all

00:05:13.960 --> 00:06:10.500 
expected and what they need to do all
right<00:05:14.110> the<00:05:14.200> next<00:05:14.350> one<00:05:14.530> we<00:05:14.860> call<00:05:15.070> is<00:05:15.250> one

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.570 

you
