00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.769
 hello to all and all 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.320
 today in this video I'm going 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.430
 you test a small loader 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.369
 for your smartphone phone or other 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.160
 device that works 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.200
 so here with usb finally who can 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.419
 to connect with who can recharge 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:34.309
 in usb so this load is called the 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.469
 crs rod so I do not know if I 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.210
 say the name of the loader 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.300
 it's a researcher who was sent to me 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.090
 by the tiny deal company which is a 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.180
 wholesaler company in china i believe 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.700
 and who's doing pretty good stuff and 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.530
 that costs really cheap so in fact 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.430
 this charger that is still good 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.810
 quality that I could test now that 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.989
 must do now a week or 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.940
 two I tested this little charger then 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.530
 the thing a little annoying if I find 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.000
 more the the box 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.250
 so I can not really show you 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.329
 the packaging but otherwise there is nothing 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.790
 special in the box 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:15.499
 apart from a small cable that is like those 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.179
 it is then one to load it then 

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:20.929
 how to proceed is very 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:22.880
 simple to charge a device you 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:26.359
 take the usb cable from the device 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.240
 so let's imagine I want to reload my 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:31.159
 little iphone 5 s so me right now 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.709
 I have a rechargeable shell so 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.240
 age and I will have two cocks but if 

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:39.350
 I did not have this rechargeable shell 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.789
 I could I take this little quads 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.130
 charge and normally with the cab 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.609
 lightning is here so I know that a 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:52.130
 cable and I connect the cab lightning 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:53.899
 hamon to my charger all sides so 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.380
 then I know that the cable to my 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:00.109
 loader so I do not know what's going on 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.209
 go wrong connect it you have to 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:03.619
 push a little so here here in addition to this 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.560
 which is well done is that I love and 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.920
 help is here then what can I 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.420
 to see is that my little charger up 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.470
 can 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:19.069
 there it comes from those to load so 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.020
 if I press the button on off the du 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.620
 little loader who is here then 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.480
 wait for video 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:29.080
 it is then 1 1 this is it was all 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.660
 little here in blue so I would have ap 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.850
 and that being so when I press activates 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.440
 so we have a button on off what is 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.239
 rather not bad there are chargers where he 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.620
 there is completely no button that in 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.420
 function of what is charging 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.400
 so after the battery it wears out 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.870
 a lot less here I have a mophie shell 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.790
 so the simplest for me is not 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.569
 remove every time cash is to 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.260
 connect this cable which is a mini cable 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.470
 usb 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.390
 if I'm wrong so the lot the cap 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.030
 we'll put it away the other coffee hiking 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:04.549
 so here's so I plug this cable here 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:07.489
 hop here and then the cable I the 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.769
 connect a word hammam also to load 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.959
 mam also my iphone so what 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.250
 is pretty cool 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.390
 good after at the same time I do not have I 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.859
 do not use all the time I use 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:21.019
 that when I do at home eh if not 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:25.790
 it's useless so we'll connect this 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:28.430
 small cable if he wants then well at the same 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.100
 science time but the wrong side it does not 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.140
 not work so we can see that 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.940
 the course on charges and in addition that 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.609
 the iphone overload at the same time so there 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.299
 we do 3 in 1 so this shell is 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.160
 rather not bad 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.560
 so then I want to show just 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.000
 how does one recharge the hull because 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.739
 the hull must be recharged Russia 1 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.170
 they do not recharge themselves alone so 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.959
 the agreement you can reload it on 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.340
 a usb socket 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.440
 if you have a smartphone then there 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.200
 let's imagine it's the apple taking nothing 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.170
 taken basic connect you there on the 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.090
 so take this catch is given with 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.859
 the charger so it's good you 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.600
 connect it here it is so here in 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:12.109
 done we will reload the way the 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.040
 charger to recharge this quote it 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.230
 must wait at least 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.269
 minimum half an hour an hour or 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.739
 an hour so what is fast the 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.169
 hull is still looking fast 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.600
 you have to count around a 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:27.350
 time and what's pretty cool that's 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.030
 that this hull is at 5200 amps 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.280
 close if I'm not wrong yeah 5200 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.850
 losses and so we can reload pretty 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.100
 almost one and a half times the iphone so 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.680
 once completely it is obligatory 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.150
 end that's it and again we can still 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.000
 push their load 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.130
 which is pretty cool so this hull 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.139
 it does not go to reload level 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.120
 it's not hulls said milan loses or 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.770
 we can search three or four times 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.110
 his iphone or two devices at the same 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.720
 time but still it's a battery 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.479
 that I would call 2 help if a day 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.759
 you have no battery left on your 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.039
 iphone she is rather small 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.930
 you can put it in a bag of 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.330
 school class or if you are 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.580
 professional put it in your bag 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.220
 or in your pocket she comes in one 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.440
 still make it easy and she is 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.199
 rather cool so how to buy it 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.599
 well it's very simple to buy it 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.940
 have to go to the site of tiny deal she 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:25.039
 is priced at 10 euros 94 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.599
 so anyway there will be an article 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.810
 that I did on the site if you want 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:32.389
 see this shell 7 cox this battery 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.699
 so 10 euros 94 it's really not bad 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.669
 and besides that yes I forgot to say 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:40.970
 no it's a little gadget sees the long 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.680
 it's not very important but it does 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.680
 torch too so torch how do you 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.880
 do you have to press long on 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.860
 and she makes torch 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.470
 so after mons had a nice shot the 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.590
 battery so it's a little annoying but 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.570
 it's a day more than two torches and 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.840
 your iphone and being it's rather not 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.070
 wrong 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:03.349
 So here is a little cock negative point is 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.210
 that light is often on so 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.560
 must wait anyway minus five 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.500
 minutes it goes off so it wears 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.599
 maybe a little bit of battery and she's 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.699
 a little plastic so that would be a 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:15.409
 little negative point but otherwise she has 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:17.120
 a lot of positives because 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:19.190
 that she is very robust she is damaged 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.360
 not too much after the shelf life I do not 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.810
 do not know where we'll see when she 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.760
 will stop 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.740
 but it's still a pretty good 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.660
 mark and I recommend it to you ray 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.599
 if you need a battery of 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.370
 emergency type and for 10 euros 94 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:32.630
 it's really cheap so I'll give it to you 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.370
 still recommend for the price 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.099
 value for money squeezes it remains 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.479
 still good and here I hope that 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:40.250
