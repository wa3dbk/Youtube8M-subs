00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.960
 indianapolis this proof so 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.060
 long awaited on the flip 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.190
 important part of the 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.619
 world motoring alright filipe

 better since Friday at the time 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.380
 we follow the classification of the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.600
 pilots and tony kanaan in the classification 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.880
 It was not as well as it was in the closet. 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.310
 friday on the exact otoni flip 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.340
 kingdom reasonably well throughout the whole 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.899
 month of preparation at the time that matters 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.910
 When it's really worth it, it was 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.679
 faster then we said that the 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.390
 two two pilots are very excited 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.369
 there with the situation of the car for the 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.470
 running and I'm sure we'll go 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.720
 have two Brazilian drivers fighting there 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.060
 by the victory is in the classification is of 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.399
 carpenter is not the pole position of the test 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.600
 helio castroneves broad on the fourth 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.490
 position in the second row and tony kanaan 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.920
 in 16th 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.950
 but look after the classification after 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.410
 the machine is the carburetion day of the sixth 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.690
 this has left a very cool climate 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.750
 very tasty of relaxation 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.530
 especially with Brazilians and the 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.390
 gustavo berton is on track and will 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.500
 to provide details and information for the 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.500
 people too 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.180
 good afternoon berton very fine black 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.769
 Good afternoon to you, good afternoon to all of you. 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.810
 I'm here right next to the 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.920
 tony kanaan who is the current winner here 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.079
 from indianapolis 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.620
 I was talking to people close to 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.420
 Tony again is very 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.299
 focused for this race remembering the mec 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.620
 last year and finished 12th and finished 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.080
 winning the race was not in a 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.250
 position as good on the starting grid but 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.720
 ended first 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.110
 How do you say the important thing is the arrival 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.879
 not only as when as wide as the pilots 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.709
 How did you tell Helio Castroneves? 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.659
 room is carpenter is the pole position 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.370
 for the second consecutive time 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.310
 Indianapolis and we 're waiting here. 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.200
 tony kanaan will chat with him 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.030
 then of course we will also talk 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.040
 the helmet black castroneves with you 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.500
 thanks button will follow everything 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.420
 gustavo berton has free transit there 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.760
 to talk to Brazilians about 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.340
 accompany the whole movement also in the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.819
 pit oo filipe explains something to 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.549
 Guys, what 's the difference from the car to? 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.739
 do the sorting the time take 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.840
 and the car that goes to the track on 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.310
 racing then black sometimes seems to 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.739
 people talk about the car but the pilot goes 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.260
 drop in front is the favorite yes he 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.720
 turned one good turn one turn is four 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.690
 strong laps but alone on the track then 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.910
 the big difference that has of the hit 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.510
 first is the amount of depression and 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.010
 dynamics that cars carry the nesv 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.880
 remember that in the classification and are 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.889
 alone 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.780
 so they can have the lane free and 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.519
 can take a lot of pressure 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.470
 car aerodynamics walks much faster 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.720
 It's just that it's time to study. 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.819
 You have 33 cars on the track. 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.650
 turn as turbulence as if it were 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.959
 a wheel mill on the lane and you feel 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.090
 this whole event then is very 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.280
 It is important for the pilot to know how the 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.260
 car 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.420
 that is when there are many people in front 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.459
 the car slides too much and then I'm 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.890
 with a good hope of the Brazilians 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.180
 training is training race is run 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.090
 exactly the other car changes a lot 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.010
 chance is and toni showed just that 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.519
 let's follow the starting grid now 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.519
 come on 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.270
 the starting grid of the 500-mile 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.190
 indianapolis will have to charge and have as 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.060
 pole position next to him in the first 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.280
 row 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.860
 james hinchcliffe the australian will 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.800
 power and helio castro neves is listed in 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.229
 room next to simon pagenaud and marco 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.630
 andré dinah 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.360
 Colombian carlos munhoz com josé 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.120
 slender in eighth 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:51.040
 jr hildebrand pilot tony kanaan for 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.040
 drop to 16th place 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.819
 the very good expectation tony kanaan 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.590
 helio castro neves are the pilots 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:08.069
 Brazilians in the 500 miles of 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:11.099
 indianapolis here in 2014 he the good 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:15.680
 football back already with much more 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.680
 Personal hit is on the band in the cup.
