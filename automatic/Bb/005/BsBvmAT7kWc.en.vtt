would have more rushing yards in the

certainly<00:01:02.879> not<00:01:03.090> me<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.680> really<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.799> mean<00:01:05.010> I

certainly not me and really I mean I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.800 
certainly not me and really I mean I
thought<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> thousands<00:01:06.540> who<00:01:06.570> get

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
thought that if the thousands who get

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.240 
thought that if the thousands who get
their<00:01:06.960> running<00:01:07.260> game<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:07.799> me<00:01:07.920> had<00:01:08.100> in

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
their running game going with me had in

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.370 
their running game going with me had in
years<00:01:08.369> past<00:01:08.520> they<00:01:09.150> had<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> pretty<00:01:09.990> good<00:01:10.080> chance

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
years past they had a pretty good chance

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.590 
years past they had a pretty good chance
of<00:01:10.560> beating<00:01:10.740> Seahawks<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.909> think<00:01:12.450> that

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
of beating Seahawks and I think that

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.120 
of beating Seahawks and I think that
that<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.900> pretty<00:01:13.080> much<00:01:13.200> what<00:01:13.409> saved<00:01:13.770> them<00:01:14.010> from

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
that is pretty much what saved them from

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.590 
that is pretty much what saved them from
losing<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> Seahawks<00:01:15.150> because<00:01:15.479> they're

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
losing to the Seahawks because they're

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.530 
losing to the Seahawks because they're
able<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.900> burn<00:01:16.380> up<00:01:16.560> or<00:01:16.770> clock<00:01:17.330> running<00:01:18.330> back
