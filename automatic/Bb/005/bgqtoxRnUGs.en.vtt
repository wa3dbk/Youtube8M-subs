can<00:01:56.909> quite<00:01:57.090> clearly<00:01:57.119> see<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.960> doesn't<00:01:58.079> really

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
can quite clearly see it doesn't really

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.190

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.400 
do it it's awesome a lot of fun but what
people<00:02:18.910> don't<00:02:19.090> usually<00:02:19.420> realize<00:02:19.959> is<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.290> you

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
people don't usually realize is that you

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.410 
people don't usually realize is that you
can<00:02:20.560> buy<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.740> Camaro<00:02:21.130> now<00:02:21.340> will<00:02:22.000> dedicate<00:02:22.270> a

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
and use them for a different squad so

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.270 
and use them for a different squad so
this<00:02:28.720> is<00:02:28.750> how<00:02:28.900> if<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.680> are<00:02:29.800> actually<00:02:30.130> having

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
this is how if you are actually having

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.830 
this is how if you are actually having
problems<00:02:30.670> getting<00:02:30.730> you're<00:02:31.120> making<00:02:31.660> your

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
problems getting you're making your

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.090 
problems getting you're making your
heavy<00:02:32.230> weapon<00:02:32.530> squads<00:02:33.660> survivable<00:02:34.660> then<00:02:35.560> you

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
heavy weapon squads survivable then you

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.650 
heavy weapon squads survivable then you
basically<00:02:36.280> just<00:02:36.580> part<00:02:37.150> these<00:02:37.360> in<00:02:37.540> some

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
basically just part these in some

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.050 
basically just part these in some
terrain<00:02:38.070> right<00:02:39.070> by<00:02:39.220> your<00:02:39.340> board<00:02:39.580> edge<00:02:39.760> and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
terrain right by your board edge and

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.559 
terrain right by your board edge and
guess<00:02:40.690> what<00:02:41.640> three<00:02:42.640> of<00:02:42.760> these<00:02:42.850> guys<00:02:43.150> can<00:02:43.390> fit

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
guess what three of these guys can fit

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.630 
guess what three of these guys can fit
in<00:02:43.690> there<00:02:43.810> no<00:02:43.989> problem<00:02:44.500> there's<00:02:45.130> no<00:02:45.370> rules

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
in there no problem there's no rules

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.040 
in there no problem there's no rules
against<00:02:45.970> putting<00:02:46.150> heavy<00:02:46.420> weapon<00:02:46.780> squads

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
against putting heavy weapon squads

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.040 
against putting heavy weapon squads
instead<00:02:47.530> Camaros<00:02:47.980> so<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:49.660> buy<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.840> heavy

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
instead Camaros so you buy a heavy

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.350 
instead Camaros so you buy a heavy
weapon<00:02:50.200> squad<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:51.700> put<00:02:51.910> three<00:02:52.090> heavy

heavy bolters inside that's 18 shots

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.390 
heavy bolters inside that's 18 shots
every<00:03:08.050> single<00:03:08.410> turn<00:03:08.560> coming<00:03:08.920> out<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.040> this<00:03:09.190> one

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
every single turn coming out of this one

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
is actually a really good tactic it's

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.789 
is actually a really good tactic it's
kind<00:03:20.230> of<00:03:20.320> sheet<00:03:20.530> but<00:03:20.829> it's<00:03:21.160> really<00:03:21.400> good<00:03:21.640> um<00:03:21.970> I

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
kind of sheet but it's really good um I

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.140 
kind of sheet but it's really good um I
can't<00:03:23.799> think<00:03:23.920> of<00:03:24.070> any<00:03:24.280> more<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.730> pain<00:03:24.940> and

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
can't think of any more of a pain and

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
someone as as a thorn in your opponent's

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.319 
someone as as a thorn in your opponent's
side<00:03:27.549> then<00:03:28.620> three<00:03:29.620> last<00:03:29.860> cannons<00:03:30.489> inside<00:03:31.299> a

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
think of too many vehicles that would

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.300 
think of too many vehicles that would
withstand<00:03:38.019> that<00:03:38.470> every<00:03:38.950> turn<00:03:40.980> not<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.130> mention

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
withstand that every turn not to mention

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.160 
withstand that every turn not to mention
the<00:03:42.519> fact<00:03:42.670> that<00:03:42.820> you<00:03:43.090> added<00:03:43.269> three<00:03:43.570> times<00:03:43.840> that

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
the fact that you added three times that

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.080 
the fact that you added three times that
they<00:03:44.350> shoot<00:03:44.650> at<00:03:44.709> you<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:45.220> managed<00:03:45.790> to
