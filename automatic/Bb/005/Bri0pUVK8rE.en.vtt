00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.150
 Here is this elevator 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.510
 I would like to extend the elevator 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.659
 Then you can just adjust 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.110

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.340
 Hmm 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:49.269
 It was decreasing 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:53.400
 I really want to finish the photo I took on ipad . 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.400
 This is the image I took earlier 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:01.390
 Even my mom is great 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:08.200
 It is very beautiful and the letters are very misty. 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:12.430
 It is easy to understand a child I'm very easy-to-understand be left now but what you, but come 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:15.050
 It is good that you become more beautiful and that there 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:20.360
 It is this application 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:22.430
 It's a app called Cam scanner I'll do it more beautiful With this app 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.700
 Near the bottom 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.650
 There are two 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.020
 Two there who do 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.750
 Right side 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:36.300
 It looks like the yama mountain 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.300
 Press like a mountain of 4 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.040
 Or say this kind of can a version 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:45.100
 Because it comes out 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:50.470
 With the last eye I took a while 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:53.010
 It says cold current comes out Fu say streaming a place that 's not to clinic 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.010
 Cut 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:04.670
 Then it becomes a little beautiful and it becomes white 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:06.009
 If it is more so than line Ne or body of me 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.650
 ni 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.880
 me 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.810
 It was there 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:16.230
 Very 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:22.770
 It's easier to see than before, I always think 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:26.120
 I think that it is more beautiful than the original than the real thing 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.120
 Make it a black and white mouth 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.980
 If the hand does not come in color, make it white in the corridor 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:37.020
 In the sight hall 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.979
 If this is done, the character is very 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.979
 It will be easier to see 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.550
 My name is referred to as the favorite to open in this It is well bird 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.000
 I thought to do so 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:52.110
 As you can choose with jpeg or pdf 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.110
 Select by pdf 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.740
 And this 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.200
 adobe reader 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.300
 It's a red guy 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.540
 Open with adobe reader 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.889
 Then 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.040
 It opens like this 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:10.689
 If you look at it actually 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:13.650
 So pdf so hit 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:18.630
 There is no edition that characters say properly 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:22.880
 If you get it by the method of it, it will be so beautiful even without a scanner 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:28.060
 The image will be taken, such as a high shot in the scanner 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.060
 I think this is I do not think Ya to want camera chopper 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:43.009
 How was it? If you use this method, it will be various documents 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:49.849
 Students who can organize with ipad do not look for heavy textbooks 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:50.480
 If you import it to ipad, you can have all textbooks with only ipad 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:56.940
 I can do it 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:07:01.380
 I think that really good to summarize what the important types such as those of salaried workers 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:05.790
 If you put it in ipad unless ipad is lost 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:10.200
 I think that it is very useful because the documents will not disappear 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:15.770
 All the apps we introduced are free 

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:23.150
 The first camera app is a camera app that contains from that of the ipad 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:25.340
 And that the camp scanner that uses the second is I if there is also paid dove free version app 

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:29.449
 It is a free version that you used 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:32.430
 The third adobe reader used in is also free 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:38.220
 You can do it all for free 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:41.730
 So if you are thinking of cooking yourself and want to buy a scanner, this is also the way 

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:47.340
 I want to add it to one of the reference 

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:52.420
 If those Tteyuu want to take each on more and more beautiful in the scanner after all of the scanner 

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:57.040
 Soon all because test print of the test together but better is nice 

00:07:52.420 --> 00:08:00.650
 At all anymore Once Toka kind of was there I think that it is sufficient in this 

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:03.770
 Summary way of this document at the very ipad is 

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:07.699
 Please try by all means because it is convenient 

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:10.330
 It was a way to flood control with ipad in the scanner talk 

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:10.330
 Come bet Did
