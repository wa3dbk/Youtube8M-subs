00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.949
 the 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:14.679
 PSV started the competition is Saturday night know away game against 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.280
 sc heerenveen 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.010
 Coach Fred Rutten turns around after a very busy training session 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.739
 ahead of the coming season 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.960
 everyone expected the world championship for players for two years 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.050
 with the ideas comes the vdd title candidates i was just like on it 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.980
 internet the weather had said her website was a title candidate like you as 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.499
 you recognize such a budget and you can purchase the guarantee of so many goals 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.680
 yes there he made it with the background in the last six months 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.840
 he did in new ajax has played yes then you are mine you are what 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.160
 delay with new purchases 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.150
 who is no further than last season 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.929
 we have searched and 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:56.299
 after players in the premier league but of course also a number of players 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:57.550
 handed in 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.540
 this is already the first year in a row 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.540
 only some players we have also left a number of players and 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.420
 and I think that completely 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.850
 Qatar stability that we say there but it would be there much longer 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.860
 could be 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.860
 next Saturday have an almost fit selection 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.090
 I think I think so 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.210
 the circumstances 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.910
 marciano 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.270
 and he wants a write-down 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.710
 In the world with an all company does not think he is very wrong 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.090
 Friday afternoon also became the opponent of PSV in the second 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.700
 preliminary round of the working groups is unknown 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.130
 the Russian sibir novosibirsk is out of the first opponent on August 19 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.650
 or the 26 August one follows the return in enthoven 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.650
 the last days people do not go to the training field every day 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.860
 hopefully we have just completed the completion 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.130
 of the 25 large ones on the right exaggerated to development 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.060
 Look for Fred Rutten's answer and so stand out 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.580
 later went to 3D TV
