00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.390
 the name fatima his real name 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.960
 of protection to the fatima grain in what 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.450
 consists this of the protective can 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.480
 inform on the coins because a lot 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.989
 people do not know how to use the coins 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.329
 and really trying to work with 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:33.760
 the coins to bring prosperity and 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.090
 many times us because you do not know and 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.360
 now my mother and bar are going to discover the 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:44.320
 coins but for the oriental coins 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.840
 it is very important that you look at this 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.090
 side that has the four elements 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.360
 we can see here that is a little 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.680
 greater than pretty is true and which are 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.160
 the four elements the four 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.329
 elements lands fire 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.280
 and where are they are drawn here in the 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.409
 Chinese currency I always want to find 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.960
 both in the large accounts in the 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.460
 Those girls are all the same where it's worth 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.680
 get out you can see that it's going to 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.870
 find the symbology 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.430
 already once we look at those 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.860
 four elements that others attacks 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.100
 permanent always take into account 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.960
 that these coins have to be 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.200
 wrapped with a red ribbon that 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.550
 represents energy and prosperity 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.920
 abundance already then when that 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.350
 let's leave a Chinese currency 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.090
 How important is the Chinese currency and 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.369
 but here we see accounts count here 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.950
 we have eight and there is a specific number 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.210
 has zero to zero and specific as per 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.820
 example the 4 in the oriental culture if 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.020
 we do not use because you should not use 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.300
 because the number 4 when you 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.770
 they pronounce in the oriental culture he 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:04.460
 it has a sound of death 4 on the 4th 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.250
 name has appeared a name death in 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.009
 the culture sing that sing this does not 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.310
 use the picture because I was like 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.890
 bringing and how funny because here the 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:21.250
 number 4 in numerology a number d 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.250
 yes but the name name 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.070
 die that finally the rest then 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.560
 let's say when you represent it 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.070
 symbolically the numerology in the house 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.570
 let's say 4 with the Chinese currency is 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.570
 like you're bringing
