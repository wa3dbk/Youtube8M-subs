00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
way to do it best I stand at an angle

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.899 
way to do it best I stand at an angle
step<00:01:10.049> right<00:01:10.200> up<00:01:10.460> here<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.970> comes<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.659> later<00:01:13.909> in

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
step right up here it comes in later in

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.700 
step right up here it comes in later in
in<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> same<00:01:19.110> things<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:19.590> when

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
in in and it's the same things for when

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.710 
in in and it's the same things for when
you're<00:01:19.860> going<00:01:20.009> backwards<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.270> step<00:01:21.509> back

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
you're going backwards so you step back

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.480 
you're going backwards so you step back
hip<00:01:22.380> pick<00:01:22.680> set<00:01:23.549> by<00:01:23.759> hit<00:01:24.479> pick<00:01:24.810> step<00:01:25.530> back<00:01:25.799> hit

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
hip pick set by hit pick step back hit

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.870 
hip pick set by hit pick step back hit
pick<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.770> it's<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.950> same<00:01:29.159> principle<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
pick and it's the same principle for the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.600 
pick and it's the same principle for the
doubles<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.560> when<00:01:31.860> you're<00:01:31.979> doing<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.280> double

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
doubles so when you're doing a double

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.090 
doubles so when you're doing a double
hit<00:01:32.790> hit<00:01:33.060> for<00:01:33.390> milkman<00:01:34.250> up<00:01:35.509> twice<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.100> same

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
hit hit for milkman up twice on the same

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.310 
hit hit for milkman up twice on the same
side<00:01:39.049> so<00:01:40.880> really<00:01:41.880> really<00:01:42.119> easy<00:01:42.450> once<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.020> come

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
side so really really easy once you come

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.789 
side so really really easy once you come
into<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:44.270> best<00:01:45.270> way<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.570> really<00:01:45.960> gain<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.590> hip

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
