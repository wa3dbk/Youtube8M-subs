barriers but there you are

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.930 
barriers but there you are
you've<00:03:35.210> got<00:03:35.390> your<00:03:35.480> framework<00:03:36.110> of<00:03:36.740> the<00:03:37.250> ivy<00:03:37.700> and

you've got your framework of the ivy and

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.440 
you've got your framework of the ivy and
then<00:03:38.450> they<00:03:38.840> will<00:03:39.020> support<00:03:39.550> perhaps<00:03:40.550> 10<00:03:40.970> stems

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
then they will support perhaps 10 stems

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.520 
then they will support perhaps 10 stems
of<00:03:41.690> an<00:03:41.810> enemy<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:42.260> make<00:03:43.010> them<00:03:43.190> look<00:03:43.280> gorgeous
