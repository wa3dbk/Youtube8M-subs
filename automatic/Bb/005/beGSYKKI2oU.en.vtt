what<00:01:06.859> we<00:01:06.979> get<00:01:07.159> here<00:01:07.490> is<00:01:07.549> an<00:01:07.700> almost<00:01:07.969> effortless

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
what we get here is an almost effortless

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.660 
what we get here is an almost effortless
paint<00:01:09.079> application<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:10.159> it<00:01:10.250> appears<00:01:10.549> that

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
paint application that it appears that

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.639 
paint application that it appears that
he's<00:01:10.939> gone<00:01:11.179> in<00:01:11.390> he's<00:01:11.570> understood<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.409> sitter

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
he's gone in he's understood the sitter

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:14.380 
he's gone in he's understood the sitter
he's<00:01:13.009> applied<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.549> paint<00:01:13.789> and<00:01:13.969> it's<00:01:14.119> just

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
he's applied the paint and it's just

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.480 
he's applied the paint and it's just
sort<00:01:14.600> of<00:01:14.630> happened<00:01:15.140> but<00:01:15.619> as<00:01:15.770> is<00:01:15.950> generally<00:01:16.189> the

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
sort of happened but as is generally the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.580 
sort of happened but as is generally the
case<00:01:16.729> with<00:01:17.119> works<00:01:17.569> by<00:01:17.719> Sargent<00:01:18.380> when<00:01:18.500> you

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
case with works by Sargent when you

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.050 
case with works by Sargent when you
start<00:01:18.860> looking<00:01:19.100> much<00:01:19.280> more<00:01:19.490> closely<00:01:19.819> you

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
start looking much more closely you

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.330 
start looking much more closely you
realize<00:01:20.689> that<00:01:21.350> there's<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.590> has<00:01:22.130> been<00:01:22.310> a

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
realize that there's a has been a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.550 
realize that there's a has been a
struggle<00:01:22.640> within<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.630> process<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:24.319> that

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
struggle within the process and that

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.139 
struggle within the process and that
there<00:01:24.860> is<00:01:24.979> a<00:01:25.009> myriad<00:01:25.429> of<00:01:25.549> small<00:01:25.969> adjustments

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
there is a myriad of small adjustments

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.139 
there is a myriad of small adjustments
small<00:01:26.990> changes<00:01:27.590> so<00:01:28.130> for<00:01:28.310> example<00:01:28.789> on<00:01:28.939> lady

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
small changes so for example on lady

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.330 
small changes so for example on lady
Agnew<00:01:29.659> when<00:01:30.469> you<00:01:30.560> start<00:01:30.799> looking<00:01:31.039> closely

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
Agnew when you start looking closely

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.449 
Agnew when you start looking closely
around<00:01:31.640> this<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.689> sash<00:01:33.350> area<00:01:33.829> you<00:01:34.009> start<00:01:34.310> to

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:34.459 
around this the sash area you start to

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:36.699 
around this the sash area you start to
see<00:01:34.640> where<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:35.090> artist<00:01:35.539> has<00:01:35.689> made<00:01:35.899> changes

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
see where the artist has made changes

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:39.069 
see where the artist has made changes
where<00:01:36.979> does<00:01:37.159> how<00:01:37.459> high<00:01:37.670> do<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:37.970> sash<00:01:38.209> go<00:01:38.899> up

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
where does how high do the sash go up

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.949 
where does how high do the sash go up
how<00:01:39.289> tight<00:01:39.709> has<00:01:40.039> small<00:01:40.520> as<00:01:40.789> the<00:01:40.939> waist<00:01:41.149> is<00:01:41.780> this

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
how tight has small as the waist is this

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.600 
how tight has small as the waist is this
an<00:01:42.079> exaggeration<00:01:42.829> we<00:01:42.950> don't<00:01:43.130> know<00:01:43.340> but<00:01:43.549> he

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
an exaggeration we don't know but he

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.089 
an exaggeration we don't know but he
certainly<00:01:43.970> has<00:01:44.209> spent<00:01:44.569> some<00:01:44.810> time<00:01:45.110> redefining

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:46.099 
certainly has spent some time redefining

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:48.910 
certainly has spent some time redefining
that<00:01:46.280> that<00:01:47.030> area<00:01:47.479> similarly<00:01:48.349> with<00:01:48.770> the

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
that that area similarly with the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.100 
that that area similarly with the
pendant<00:01:49.429> you<00:01:49.670> can<00:01:49.880> just<00:01:50.270> about<00:01:50.390> see<00:01:50.539> here<00:01:51.079> a

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
pendant you can just about see here a

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.469 
pendant you can just about see here a
slight<00:01:51.500> shadow<00:01:51.920> which<00:01:52.670> indicates<00:01:53.239> that<00:01:53.360> the

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
slight shadow which indicates that the

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.210 
slight shadow which indicates that the
pendant<00:01:53.869> at<00:01:53.989> some<00:01:54.229> point<00:01:54.530> was<00:01:55.069> actually

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
pendant at some point was actually

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.149 
pendant at some point was actually
hanging<00:01:55.819> lower<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:56.479> he<00:01:56.659> obviously<00:01:56.899> felt<00:01:57.500> from

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
hanging lower so he obviously felt from

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.160 
hanging lower so he obviously felt from
a<00:01:58.250> visual<00:01:58.520> perspective<00:01:58.729> it<00:01:59.209> made<00:01:59.450> more<00:01:59.840> sense

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
a visual perspective it made more sense

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.740 
a visual perspective it made more sense
it<00:02:00.500> balanced<00:02:01.189> better<00:02:01.489> by<00:02:01.789> having<00:02:02.149> the<00:02:02.239> pendant

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
it balanced better by having the pendant

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.319 
it balanced better by having the pendant
hanging<00:02:03.319> at<00:02:03.619> a<00:02:03.739> higher<00:02:03.950> height<00:02:04.280> we<00:02:04.759> also<00:02:04.969> see

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
hanging at a higher height we also see

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.620 
hanging at a higher height we also see
some<00:02:05.539> alterations<00:02:06.310> in<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:07.610> area<00:02:08.060> here<00:02:08.420> and

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
some alterations in this area here and

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.690 
some alterations in this area here and
also<00:02:08.989> some<00:02:09.319> repositioning<00:02:10.250> around<00:02:10.549> the

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
also some repositioning around the

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.819 
also some repositioning around the
neckline<00:02:10.910> where<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.840> artist<00:02:12.200> has<00:02:12.230> gone<00:02:12.530> back

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:12.829 
neckline where the artist has gone back
