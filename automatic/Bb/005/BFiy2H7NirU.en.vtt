00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
but for now it's basically just a

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
but for now it's basically just a
warehouse<00:00:45.390> space<00:00:50.690> by<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.750> way<00:00:51.960> we're<00:00:52.199> still

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
forever drives is going to be so yeah

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.839 
forever drives is going to be so yeah
it's<00:02:59.139> messy<00:02:59.650> but<00:03:02.459> just<00:03:03.459> gives<00:03:03.669> you<00:03:03.790> an<00:03:03.879> idea

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
it's messy but just gives you an idea

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.479 
it's messy but just gives you an idea
it's<00:03:06.849> a<00:03:06.969> pretty<00:03:07.150> large<00:03:07.419> place<00:03:08.129> it<00:03:09.129> doesn't

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
it's a pretty large place it doesn't

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.369 
it's a pretty large place it doesn't
look<00:03:09.609> very<00:03:09.639> big<00:03:09.879> from<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.359> outside<00:03:10.780> but<00:03:11.139> it's

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
look very big from the outside but it's

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.470 
look very big from the outside but it's
3,600<00:03:11.949> square<00:03:12.280> feet<00:03:12.459> not<00:03:12.879> including<00:03:13.090> the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
3,600 square feet not including the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.349 
3,600 square feet not including the
basement<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.139> it<00:03:15.129> should<00:03:15.370> give<00:03:15.849> us<00:03:15.879> plenty<00:03:16.120> of

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
basement so it should give us plenty of

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:22.199 
basement so it should give us plenty of
room<00:03:16.510> for<00:03:16.540> now<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:19.049> get<00:03:20.049> everything<00:03:20.349> in<00:03:21.209> one

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
room for now to get everything in one

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.610 
room for now to get everything in one
place<00:03:22.239> instead<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:22.959> split<00:03:23.260> between<00:03:23.409> two

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
place instead of split between two

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.580 
place instead of split between two
warehouses<00:03:23.980> like<00:03:24.489> we<00:03:24.639> were<00:03:24.760> before<00:03:27.269> and

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
warehouses like we were before and

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.679 
warehouses like we were before and
eventually<00:03:29.590> have<00:03:29.979> a<00:03:30.220> place<00:03:30.669> where<00:03:30.879> customers

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:31.689 
eventually have a place where customers

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.439 
eventually have a place where customers
