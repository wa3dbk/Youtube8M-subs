with<00:00:15.809> these<00:00:16.080> things<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.640> slicer

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
with these things this is the slicer

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.910 
with these things this is the slicer
part<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.020> just<00:00:19.199> where<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> chips<00:00:19.650> go

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
part this is just where the chips go

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.950 
part this is just where the chips go
after<00:00:20.250> they're<00:00:20.369> sliced<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.750> can

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
after they're sliced this is so you can

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.189 
after they're sliced this is so you can
stab<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.980> potato<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.699> holding<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.300> always<00:00:24.990> use

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
stab the potato and holding a always use

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.599 
stab the potato and holding a always use
this<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.920> just<00:00:26.070> where<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.250> put<00:00:26.519> the

this and this is just where you put the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.000 
this and this is just where you put the
chips<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:27.210> like<00:00:28.050> each<00:00:28.230> one<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.650> microwave

yes stick to the other chips and make
the<00:01:51.030> heat<00:01:51.380> giant<00:01:52.380> chip<00:01:52.649> when<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.100> submits<00:01:53.640> to

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
the heat giant chip when it submits to

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.850 
the heat giant chip when it submits to
but<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.210> big<00:01:54.390> problem<00:01:54.630> yeah<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.710> is
