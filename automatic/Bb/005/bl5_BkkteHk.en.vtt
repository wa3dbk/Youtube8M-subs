00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
ask you is what is the drive at 23 to go

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.950 
ask you is what is the drive at 23 to go
you<00:01:08.159> know<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.610> am<00:01:09.000> gonna<00:01:09.210> do<00:01:09.479> something<00:01:09.869> that

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
you know I am gonna do something that

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.920 
you know I am gonna do something that
may<00:01:10.200> kill<00:01:10.680> me<00:01:10.860> yeah<00:01:11.360> yeah<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.420> think<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> lot<00:01:12.900> of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
may kill me yeah yeah I think a lot of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.590 
may kill me yeah yeah I think a lot of
the<00:01:13.100> fakes<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.310> full-on<00:01:14.700> life-threatening

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
the fakes of full-on life-threatening

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.179 
the fakes of full-on life-threatening
expeditions<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.409> climbing<00:01:16.740> stuff<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.040> done

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
expeditions and climbing stuff have done

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.440 
expeditions and climbing stuff have done
I<00:01:17.220> think<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:17.549> much<00:01:17.700> harder<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.150> really

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
I think it's much harder to really

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.499 
I think it's much harder to really
pinpoint<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.830> drive<00:01:20.130> afterwards<00:01:20.939> because<00:01:21.270> so

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
pinpoint the drive afterwards because so

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.730 
pinpoint the drive afterwards because so
much<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.900> being<00:01:22.140> spent

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
much is being spent

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:32.690 
much is being spent
you<00:01:23.369> know<00:01:27.950> no<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:31.340> there's<00:01:32.340> got<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.610> be<00:01:32.640> a

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
you know no but there's got to be a

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.060 
you know no but there's got to be a
black<00:01:32.909> out<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.210> climate<00:01:35.600> we<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.630> one<00:01:37.070> one
