00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.840
 however, remains from hefti coaches again 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.210
 here and I make these comments 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.039
 more random than ever before because with me 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.480
 is it so I'm on it I do 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.800
 I think maybe one more topic 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.130
 out and that's it 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.660
 and I have to say the only thing 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.430
 me personally the most 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.849
 that's a video with 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.009
 the youtube community and yesterday my 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.300
 commander warrior and the response was 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.219
 big i mean i even have 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.260
 get news yes it was good and 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.530
 everyone in the comments thought it was good too 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.730
 and has definitely been fun and 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.370
 I really have a list 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.160
 made and thought and everything 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.320
 written down and posted on facebook 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.829
 asked that one of my one 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.149
 my colleagues and something yes falls 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.280
 you so spontaneously by a change of clothes 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.170
 and I almost said myself on the table and 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.469
 I put it together and then 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.460
 somehow 27 points could be ticked off though 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.199
 in the comment 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.619
 I only believe ten different things 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.490
 or so, so to speak 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.860
 spontaneously but that should have been it 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.840
 I have a recommendation from you 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.090
 you definitely no from me in the 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.770
 Recommendation correctly right above us 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.890
 something from machines completely without 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.020
 Silencer plays with me it was 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.939
 basically so in mw3 and now 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.530
 in black ops 2 in the first months i 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.090
 I always played with mufflers 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.439
 and thought yes they do not see me or 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.130
 Do not get me on the radar if I am 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.450
 shoot and yes I'm in the advantage if 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.950
 her really that was difficult 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.700
 down silencer and on it 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.670
 shat 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.909
 because I play this msn ten times so 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.880
 with cool is with front handle and 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.920
 magazine extension and, first, is the 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.630
 much stronger without shit it is 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.790
 maybe on the paper somehow 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.100
 not proven so there are somehow 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.649
 two strokes at no idea range 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.229
 way or so but she gets stronger 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.990
 will be absolutely stronger even on short 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.700
 distance and secondly see you 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.450
 people on the radar and run to you 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.459
 and therefore you can play better gameplay 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.899
 tear if he does a good 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.239
 aiming and a little bit better 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.739
 then play as the average 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.390
 I recommend every case and I have 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.370
 Even good gameplay gets done one day 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.650
 after I did that, I did 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.069
 get my first nuclear and here 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.250
 a change but have quite calm 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.840
 Stay that is not the point I have 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.269
 better gameplays ripped my first 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.310
 nuclear I think it a bit 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.690
 depending so an mp3 it was there so 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.130
 I also only after three four months 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.110
 managed to get a place and 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.269
 In the end, I had 200 then 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.799
 you can definitely get better nuclear 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.269
 expect gameplays from me 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.940
 I have the beginning a bit out 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.489
 but since then I cut the weapon 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.840
 it's gonna work out right 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.480
 bulletproof vest makes it pure and 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.090
 hardliner 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.069
 it's the strongest hardliner ever since 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.650
 call of duty with hardliner at all 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.470
 including an mp3 is available specifically 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.910
 okay a kill does not necessarily have to be here 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.069
 brought but in this game it comes 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.709
 Much better for me because you have 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.150
 Here are just scores tricks and there are 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.030
 not even those classic kills that 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.829
 one gets his killstreak first 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.959
 and it does not seem that strong and me 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.370
 get everything faster and maybe 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.690
 even before my death and thereby get 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.459
 you better gameplay in any case 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.940
 hardliner reinhard plunderer still in it 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.579
 he and the extreme conditions count 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.760
 blend or hand grenade is also still with 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.400
 in it 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.180
 and yes, and actually for a short time 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.690
 theme bigger youtuber so i have 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:45.370
 seen smos gets 15,000 subscribers 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:49.299
 on the day electric gets 2000 subscribers 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.950
 in the daytime and it just crass and I am 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.190
 proud of it as I have said before 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.750
 have in another comment is clear 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.359
 and yet not satisfied with mine 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.400
 70 subscribers in a few weeks and is 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.599
 Definitely something big for me and 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.160
 that's actually my real reason 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.560
 I have thanked for it 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.910
 people 150 I'm extremely excited about it 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.889
 I enjoy and I say goodbye today 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.940
 with a difference 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.940
 really nice fat
