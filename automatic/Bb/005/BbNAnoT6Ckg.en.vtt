00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.549
 and good today I bring you a video for me 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.680
 this channel and this deal 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.600
 it's going to be like the tranquillo that I did with 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.710
 Griezmann but with another player who 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.750
 it's also pretty good to do it that way 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.250
 that the people that got us very well from 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.590
 how it was done or will I return it 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.960
 to explain but with another player that 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.050
 I think with this one is more and more 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.520
 fast is what I believe what I've seen 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.310
 in 10 minutes but it's not the falling walker 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.340
 east 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.350
 is English and that right side I think yes 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.360
 the right truth and good its price 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.720
 purchase already is about three thousand 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.360
 three hundred 3,200 depends and we what 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.520
 what we have to look for is one more price 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.040
 low of the three thousand coins or the three 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.430
 thousand coins because if not when we 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.260
 They took 5 percent of us will 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.260
 pretty damn well let's start 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.600
 look and you know fourth the parts where 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.100
 I find the bargains the players 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.830
 cheap and then put back the ones that 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.180
 I put the ones that I bought, I put the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.580
 I put to sell and then I go back to 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.290
 show you how with how they have been sold in 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.479
 when they have sold how much time of 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.479
 all that, so I'm going to start cutting 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.950
 Well, we are here 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.660
 2700 coins that is not bad at all 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.050
 we can get a lot more process out of 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.080
 500 coins and well we will be able to 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.500
 assign now 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.860
 and have a transferable list and we're going to 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.860
 keep looking 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.390
 well here I found a 2800 that 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.860
 it's also pretty good we get 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.840
 about 400 to 450 profit coins that do not 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.370
 is not bad and we are going to do the same 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.700
 what we have done with the previous 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.580
 I'm going to buy about four eyes here 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.280
 two more but he will not buy you because 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.940
 they are at 3000 I buy them less than 3000 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.550
 but I'm going to buy three or four 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.130
 plus three I suppose if we buy five and 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.700
 we sell them at a time so 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.700
 arm 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.270
 we are 2500 kids and good 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.910
 we bought it pretty fast we 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.620
 let's finish this about 700 coins 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.020
 of profit that is not bad because 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.790
 we're just looking in a minute and already 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.700
 we have not taken enough from 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.870
 profit the lightest will not be bad let's go 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.930
 to put on the list of transferable 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.530
 we buy two more and we're going to put them 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.530
 sell kids 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.700
 we play here we buy the cheapest of 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.430
 those we have bought so far 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.170
 we bought about two thousand coins that we 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.700
 let's create about one thousand two hundred 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.159
 deprove and 1100 depends on 5% of a 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.460
 that is not we have to buy more and 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.310
 now let's put to give 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.280
 I swear that it did not take long to look for them 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.260
 since I make two or three changes of 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.080
 I love anyone and you are already 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.030
 pretty easy if you do not know how it's done 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.310
 it is changed at any time any 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.970
 hour or any time and bus go searching 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.580
 so it's really easy actually and I know not 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.160
 it's going to look for you 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.960
 fast this player for me is very 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.600
 easy to make this radio since I'm going 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.970
 pretty fast and I sell them pretty 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.210
 fast too and unsa with good ideas 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:36.730
 easy and fast 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.730
 well let's find the last one and we'll do 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.480
 Well, we bought the last one 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.580
 two thousand 809 so that is not bad either 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.280
 Now I'm almost going to put them to 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.500
 sell the five here you will see what not 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.750
 I'm cheating on you, you can not pass 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.690

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:59.700

 I will see the price again 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.500
 it was also about 3,300 although these two 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.500
 they are not sold they are going to sell easy already 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.940
 that are the only ones the two cheapest 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.180
 of the market so we 're going to put them 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.650
