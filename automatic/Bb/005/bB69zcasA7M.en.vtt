00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:06.939 
hi everyone Basilica from Lauren took a

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:08.280 
hi everyone Basilica from Lauren took a
row<00:00:07.120> today<00:00:07.510> I<00:00:07.540> want<00:00:07.720> to<00:00:07.779> share<00:00:07.990> with<00:00:08.080> you<00:00:08.260> a

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.290 
row today I want to share with you a

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.049 
row today I want to share with you a
neat<00:00:08.620> science<00:00:09.010> experiment<00:00:09.580> with<00:00:09.670> super

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059 
neat science experiment with super

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.350 
neat science experiment with super
polymer<00:00:10.740> super<00:00:11.740> absorbent<00:00:12.190> polymer<00:00:12.580> now<00:00:13.120> this

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
polymer super absorbent polymer now this

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.730 
polymer super absorbent polymer now this
is<00:00:13.509> a<00:00:13.540> little<00:00:13.780> different<00:00:13.959> than<00:00:14.230> the<00:00:14.349> super

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
is a little different than the super

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.430 
is a little different than the super
absorbent<00:00:15.669> polymer<00:00:15.999> gels<00:00:16.270> or<00:00:16.570> water<00:00:16.810> balls

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
absorbent polymer gels or water balls

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.060 
absorbent polymer gels or water balls
these<00:00:17.830> are<00:00:18.039> that<00:00:18.220> tiny<00:00:19.349> little<00:00:20.349> granules<00:00:20.980> that

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
these are that tiny little granules that

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.060 
these are that tiny little granules that
are<00:00:21.269> put<00:00:22.269> they<00:00:22.810> put<00:00:22.840> them<00:00:23.170> in<00:00:23.260> diapers<00:00:23.710> to

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
are put they put them in diapers to

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.710 
are put they put them in diapers to
absorb<00:00:24.449> liquid<00:00:25.449> so<00:00:26.259> I<00:00:27.009> want<00:00:27.490> to<00:00:27.550> show<00:00:27.759> you<00:00:27.820> here

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
absorb liquid so I want to show you here

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.590 
absorb liquid so I want to show you here
I<00:00:29.759> cut<00:00:30.759> this<00:00:30.939> diaper<00:00:32.220> lengthwise<00:00:33.220> and<00:00:33.640> and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
I cut this diaper lengthwise and and

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.100 
I cut this diaper lengthwise and and
shook<00:00:34.840> it<00:00:34.960> in<00:00:35.050> the<00:00:35.170> ziplock<00:00:35.530> bag<00:00:35.740> and<00:00:35.770> you<00:00:36.580> can

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
shook it in the ziplock bag and you can

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.290 
shook it in the ziplock bag and you can
hear<00:00:38.110> this<00:00:38.320> little<00:00:38.500> granules<00:00:39.100> coming<00:00:39.400> out<00:00:39.580> see

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
hear this little granules coming out see

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.750 
hear this little granules coming out see
if<00:00:40.360> you<00:00:40.450> can<00:00:40.600> see<00:00:40.810> that<00:00:41.400> so<00:00:42.400> those<00:00:42.580> are<00:00:42.700> the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
if you can see that so those are the

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.130 
if you can see that so those are the
super<00:00:43.030> absorbent<00:00:43.420> polymers<00:00:43.780> that<00:00:43.810> they<00:00:43.960> put

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
super absorbent polymers that they put

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.670 
super absorbent polymers that they put
in<00:00:44.230> diaper

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
in diaper

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.060 
in diaper
so<00:00:45.310> that<00:00:45.670> way<00:00:45.850> it<00:00:46.150> will<00:00:46.600> absorb<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.920> liquid

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
so that way it will absorb the liquid

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.480 
so that way it will absorb the liquid
and<00:00:48.970> this<00:00:49.900> is<00:00:50.050> gonna<00:00:50.200> this<00:00:50.440> would<00:00:50.650> be<00:00:50.770> a<00:00:50.800> neat

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.490 
and this is gonna this would be a neat

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.060 
and this is gonna this would be a neat
science<00:00:51.850> experiment<00:00:52.360> you<00:00:52.420> can<00:00:52.570> do<00:00:52.810> for<00:00:53.710> school

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
science experiment you can do for school

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.010 
science experiment you can do for school
what<00:00:54.880> you<00:00:54.970> can<00:00:55.120> do<00:00:55.210> is<00:00:55.360> I've<00:00:55.540> gathered<00:00:55.930> up

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
what you can do is I've gathered up

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.920 
what you can do is I've gathered up
different<00:00:56.470> brands<00:00:56.770> of<00:00:56.860> diapers<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:57.810> cut<00:00:58.810> them

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
different brands of diapers and cut them

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.110 
different brands of diapers and cut them
up<00:00:59.110> like<00:00:59.410> I<00:00:59.500> did<00:00:59.680> here<00:00:59.860> and<00:01:00.070> shake<00:01:00.400> it<00:01:00.430> shake<00:01:01.060> it

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
up like I did here and shake it shake it

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.200 
up like I did here and shake it shake it
shake<00:01:01.390> out<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:01.930> EM<00:01:02.140> polymers<00:01:02.650> and<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:04.030> time

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
shake out the EM polymers and the time

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.210 
shake out the EM polymers and the time
crossguard<00:01:04.689> is<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:04.989> most<00:01:05.229> polymer<00:01:05.740> inside

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
crossguard is the most polymer inside

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.090 
crossguard is the most polymer inside
them<00:01:06.490> would<00:01:07.330> be<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.630> most<00:01:07.810> absorbent<00:01:08.409> so<00:01:08.770> the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
them would be the most absorbent so the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.069 
them would be the most absorbent so the
more<00:01:09.310> polymer<00:01:10.149> super<00:01:10.390> absorbent<00:01:10.719> polymers

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
more polymer super absorbent polymers

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.349 
more polymer super absorbent polymers
are<00:01:11.170> in<00:01:11.350> them<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:12.369> more<00:01:12.549> liquid<00:01:12.700> they<00:01:12.939> absorb

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:13.359 
are in them the more liquid they absorb

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:15.480 
are in them the more liquid they absorb
so<00:01:13.719> this<00:01:13.929> would<00:01:14.170> make<00:01:14.469> a<00:01:14.500> great<00:01:14.740> science

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
so this would make a great science

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.539 
so this would make a great science
experiment<00:01:16.090> so<00:01:16.960> it's<00:01:17.740> gotta<00:01:18.100> be<00:01:18.250> more<00:01:18.399> in

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
experiment so it's gotta be more in

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.239 
experiment so it's gotta be more in
there<00:01:18.729> this<00:01:18.939> this<00:01:19.390> is<00:01:19.539> a<00:01:19.710> pull-up<00:01:20.710> diaper<00:01:20.950> that

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
there this this is a pull-up diaper that

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:24.179 
there this this is a pull-up diaper that
my<00:01:21.399> friend<00:01:21.640> gave<00:01:21.789> me<00:01:21.820> so<00:01:22.420> but<00:01:23.140> anyways<00:01:23.499> I<00:01:23.829> want

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
my friend gave me so but anyways I want

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.459 
my friend gave me so but anyways I want
to<00:01:24.340> show<00:01:24.789> you<00:01:24.850> how<00:01:25.270> this<00:01:25.420> works<00:01:25.689> so<00:01:25.929> I've<00:01:26.289> got

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
to show you how this works so I've got

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:30.660 
to show you how this works so I've got
about<00:01:26.679> half<00:01:27.609> a<00:01:27.640> cup<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:27.999> water<00:01:28.179> here<00:01:28.630> and<00:01:29.670> we're

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
about half a cup of water here and we're

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.309 
about half a cup of water here and we're
going<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:30.909> put<00:01:31.179> a<00:01:31.210> tablespoon<00:01:31.689> of<00:01:32.609> the<00:01:33.609> polymer

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
going to put a tablespoon of the polymer

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:44.420 
going to put a tablespoon of the polymer
and<00:01:35.319> we'll<00:01:35.469> see<00:01:35.619> what<00:01:35.740> happens

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.279 

see<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:48.009> will<00:01:48.130> fit<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.640> little<00:01:48.789> bit<00:01:48.969> with<00:01:49.149> a

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
see it will fit a little bit with a

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:58.679 
see it will fit a little bit with a
stick<00:01:50.289> here<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:55.090> see<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:58.299> water<00:01:58.509> will

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
stick here and see the water will

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.609 
stick here and see the water will
disappear<00:01:58.810> Oh<00:01:59.320> kind<00:01:59.679> of<00:02:00.990> okay<00:02:01.990> so<00:02:02.049> now<00:02:02.470> it's

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
disappear Oh kind of okay so now it's

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.830 
disappear Oh kind of okay so now it's
all<00:02:02.799> in<00:02:03.039> see<00:02:03.369> that<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:05.939> if<00:02:06.939> you<00:02:07.090> can<00:02:07.240> see<00:02:07.720> that

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
all in see that and if you can see that

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.540 
all in see that and if you can see that
there<00:02:08.050> nothing's<00:02:08.769> coming<00:02:09.069> out

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
there nothing's coming out

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.400 
there nothing's coming out
so<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.179> super<00:02:10.509> absorbent<00:02:10.959> absorbent

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
so that super absorbent absorbent

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.620 
so that super absorbent absorbent
polymer<00:02:11.880> absorbs<00:02:12.880> all<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.060> water

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
polymer absorbs all that water

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.400 
polymer absorbs all that water
and<00:02:13.989> it's<00:02:14.590> made<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.430> into<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.730> solid<00:02:16.209> matter<00:02:16.420> so

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
and it's made it into a solid matter so

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.320 
and it's made it into a solid matter so
it's<00:02:17.709> not<00:02:17.860> neat<00:02:18.010> how<00:02:18.130> that<00:02:18.280> works<00:02:18.489> so<00:02:18.849> that's

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
it's not neat how that works so that's

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.920 
it's not neat how that works so that's
what<00:02:19.480> we<00:02:19.599> put<00:02:19.750> in<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.930> diverse<00:02:20.680> in<00:02:21.250> other<00:02:21.930> some

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
what we put in a diverse in other some

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.870 
what we put in a diverse in other some
other<00:02:22.989> products<00:02:23.650> where<00:02:24.069> it<00:02:24.370> would<00:02:24.519> have<00:02:24.640> sort

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
other products where it would have sort

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.979 
other products where it would have sort
of<00:02:24.940> liquid<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:26.519> become<00:02:27.519> solid<00:02:27.849> and<00:02:28.299> you<00:02:28.900> know

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
of liquid and become solid and you know

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.539 
of liquid and become solid and you know
what<00:02:29.110> I've<00:02:29.290> read<00:02:29.620> about<00:02:29.830> is<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.160> oles<00:02:30.310> they're

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
what I've read about is the oles they're

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.759 
what I've read about is the oles they're
also<00:02:30.730> using<00:02:31.030> some<00:02:31.870> kind<00:02:32.019> of<00:02:32.140> super<00:02:32.380> absorbent

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
also using some kind of super absorbent

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.039 
also using some kind of super absorbent
polymer<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.670> absorb<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.360> oil<00:02:34.569> spill<00:02:34.930> in<00:02:34.989> the

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
polymer to absorb the oil spill in the

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.380 
polymer to absorb the oil spill in the
ocean<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:35.950> think<00:02:36.040> they<00:02:36.310> modified<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:36.910> to

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
ocean so I think they modified it to

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.650 
ocean so I think they modified it to
where<00:02:37.540> it'll<00:02:37.780> only<00:02:38.230> absorb<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.280> oil<00:02:39.660> because

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
where it'll only absorb the oil because

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.759 
where it'll only absorb the oil because
they<00:02:40.780> think<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.079> oil<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:41.380> lighter<00:02:41.530> than<00:02:41.709> water

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
they think the oil is lighter than water

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.819 
they think the oil is lighter than water
anyway<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:43.090> but<00:02:43.569> I<00:02:43.900> read<00:02:44.200> about<00:02:44.319> that<00:02:44.470> it's

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
anyway so but I read about that it's

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.400 
anyway so but I read about that it's
really<00:02:45.069> neat<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:45.489> that<00:02:45.670> way<00:02:45.819> you<00:02:46.720> know<00:02:46.780> lots<00:02:47.260> or

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
really neat so that way you know lots or

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.900 
really neat so that way you know lots or
all<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.680> oil<00:02:47.859> out<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.430> water<00:02:48.640> in<00:02:48.819> the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
all the oil out of the water in the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.780 
all the oil out of the water in the
ocean<00:02:49.799> instead<00:02:50.799> of<00:02:50.920> scooping<00:02:51.250> it<00:02:51.400> up<00:02:51.489> it's

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
ocean instead of scooping it up it's

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.490 
ocean instead of scooping it up it's
just<00:02:51.970> an<00:02:52.060> easier<00:02:52.420> way<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.870> clean<00:02:53.230> up<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.470> mess

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
just an easier way to clean up the mess

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.520
