00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
inspirations throughout early on when I

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:20.430 
inspirations throughout early on when I
was<00:01:18.280> in<00:01:18.700> my<00:01:18.820> early<00:01:18.850> compositions<00:01:19.479> I<00:01:19.990> realized

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
was in my early compositions I realized

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.639 
was in my early compositions I realized
I<00:01:20.649> was<00:01:20.920> creating<00:01:21.789> a<00:01:22.000> story<00:01:22.509> to<00:01:22.840> captivate<00:01:23.470> the

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
I was creating a story to captivate the

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.130 
I was creating a story to captivate the
listener<00:01:24.070> so<00:01:24.450> through<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:25.479> story<00:01:25.899> it's<00:01:26.080> an

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
listener so through that story it's an

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.350 
listener so through that story it's an
experience<00:01:26.679> of<00:01:27.039> whether<00:01:27.880> it's<00:01:28.119> for<00:01:28.300> a

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
experience of whether it's for a

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.480 
experience of whether it's for a
relationship<00:01:28.630> we've<00:01:29.259> all<00:01:29.409> experienced<00:01:30.220> love

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
relationship we've all experienced love

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.840 
relationship we've all experienced love
and<00:01:30.729> loss<00:01:30.940> and<00:01:30.970> pain<00:01:31.569> and<00:01:31.869> growth<00:01:32.440> so<00:01:33.280> I<00:01:33.310> try

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
and loss and pain and growth so I try

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.419 
and loss and pain and growth so I try
and<00:01:33.909> capture<00:01:34.240> that<00:01:34.539> in<00:01:34.780> most<00:01:34.960> of<00:01:35.200> my<00:01:35.399> music<00:01:36.399> and

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
and capture that in most of my music and

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.999 
and capture that in most of my music and
then<00:01:37.149> those<00:01:37.300> kind<00:01:37.600> of<00:01:37.770> experience<00:01:38.770> through

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
then those kind of experience through

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.529 
then those kind of experience through
the<00:01:39.100> whole<00:01:39.250> album<00:01:39.789> that<00:01:40.149> you<00:01:40.330> get<00:01:40.509> that

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
the whole album that you get that

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.469 
the whole album that you get that
evolution<00:01:41.319> in<00:01:41.440> that<00:01:41.590> growth<00:01:41.890> so<00:01:42.310> I<00:01:42.340> hope<00:01:43.270> it

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
evolution in that growth so I hope it

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.229 
evolution in that growth so I hope it
