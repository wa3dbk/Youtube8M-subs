00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:11.160
 power point ages will live the time 

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:15.450
 enough to see me shoot the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.450
 instrument of their gestures 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:22.740
 the electro orb charges it completely 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:27.430
 this cannon will amplify the power of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.230
 mane one million six throwing one 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.020
 burst of energy store that the mane 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.020
 from each pale petrópolis grow 6 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.850
 you will be the first victims of 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.390
 look no pony and the 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.390
 souls 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.250
 it is not my intention to interrupt 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.640
 but you're not forgetting someone 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:03.960
 more with me the little one without superpowers 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.960
 at all he is totally useless 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.720
 please all ponies is that 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.810
 they only have it because they feel the 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.149
 same for love 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.270
 maybe in your world but in ours 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:24.100
 I am here as always when I 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.100
 we always need 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.110
 I'm not like a home run when my friends 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.710
 they need there I am and they need me 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.710
 now 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.170
 I see that dementia must be an effect 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.530
 secondary due to exposure to 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.930
 fixative ray of perdition is low 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.560
 tonight and we're right on the edge of 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.130
 the inmortality 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.329
 because all together but above all 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.759
 you finally defeated our worst 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:02:02.270
 enemies that we have thrown the brush 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.270
 from evil to the now fearful face of 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.160
 we have given a blow of freedom in 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.860
 name of oppression and nothing 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.860
 to stop for nothing more 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.070
 well done 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.200
 it is intent 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.810
 these berries 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.110
 yes 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.490
 stop cars and friends 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.920
 and also 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.140
 it seems they have everything under control 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.980
 flórez there are we need you you have to 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:08.340
 activate it 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.340
 sorry it is what bothers me anything 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:22.070
 you are fine 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:25.450
 it's a joke I say I know you're mean and 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.450
 others but I'll be back 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.030
 and just keep 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.460
 that makes you believe that you are so special 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.150
 that the cortez villas that do not apply 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.990
 with you because you do not mess with someone 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.990
 of your campaign 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:09.550
 no no no no 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.370
 no way 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.740
 again that day saved 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.940
 yes yes 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:44.060
 I can not believe they saw how I let go 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.730
 storm of justice at the end and I 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.060
 they saw how I handled that tie with cakes 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:52.010
 but as we had half a second before 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.160
 Go back out of the comic and pastry 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.680
 of another policy was 65 apples to me 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.080
 I'm glad we came back we would not have 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.730
 achieved without you spike and I hope you know 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.560
 that just because we do not need you 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.290
 it does not always mean that you do not 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:10.510
 consider useful and that you do not have to have 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.510
 superpowers to be a super friend
