00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.690
 potatoes thousand recipes come to mind to 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.969
 see the potatoes and today we make the 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.679
 fast food style fried potatoes is a 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.090
 recipe that we found in 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.860
 we probably looked at ha 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.619
 modified we looked at what 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.750
 we liked it better and today we make you 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.040
 see how it's done then 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.320
 meanwhile we talk about potatoes 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:32.160
 however true that we are going to hasten 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.900
 the lines to make a thickness like that 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.210
 so now let's go and make all the slices 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.210
 trying to respect these 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.420
 dimensions 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.309
 once we did it so 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.640
 thickness you see the thickness is always the same 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.379
 same we go to cut them to make 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.000
 just the chip here I would say that 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.660
 This 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.220
 here I would say this this 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.020
 this format is just a nice one 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.840
 nice pussy and we put them 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.840
 immediately in frozen water 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.810
 this could already be one 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.430
 a portion then the faith we are 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.650
 going to make a portion to see 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.660
 as like how potatoes come then 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.470
 we stop here and continue the recipe 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.840
 we have to leave for about 5 minutes 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.870
 our potatoes inside this one 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.450
 very cold water and then pass it in 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.000
 when there is hot where we will then put 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.410
 a mixture that is here we have water 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.330
 hot hot so not hot hot e 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.210
 we melt in this in this water 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.430
 of sugar a couple of teaspoons of 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.160
 we put sugar and golden siro 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.730
 a generous teaspoon 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.770
 that's when we choose that once 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.300
 you see that there is not in the background 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.620
 practically now more crystals than 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.470
 sugar 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.680
 we are ready about 5 minutes have passed 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.780
 we take the potatoes without doing anything either 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.820
 potatoes and put them in boiling water 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.200
 boiling water that great water 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.330
 it's getting a kind of shower 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.790
 Scottish this you see the water as it is 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.890
 become turbid it has become so turbid 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.570
 not so much because the potatoes are dirty 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.690
 and why they started losing 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.820
 all part of the scope now these 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.180
 potatoes here must be around ten 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:34.790
 campaign minutes and here they are passed 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:38.530
 more than ten minutes and let's go to school 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.180
 potatoes 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:51.650
 the water we try to widen it 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:53.329
 such that it can dry well now 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.659
 will have to go 20 minutes in 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.810
 freezer so less water have less 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:02.209
 and of course crystals will be created 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:08.269
 over a small size and let's go to 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:10.250
 put our potatoes from the coma 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.989
 now we are going to put in 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.900
 freezer that we keep in the 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.790
 freezer for at least 20 minutes 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.669
 20 minutes but don't go beyond the 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.340
 half an hour and here are our potatoes and 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:23.959
 take out of the freezer 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.489
 as you can see it is as if it had been created 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.340
 a kind of a small patina of 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.950
 ice above but are not mounted for 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.549
 check the oil to be warm one 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.680
 toothpick 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.760
 if you create bubbles around you want to 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.099
 say it 's ready let's say the temperature 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.970
 we are therefore we begin to emerge the 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:46.230
 chips you see this is the effect 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.230
 correct to do 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:04:00.440
 that's how much potatoes must cook 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.410
 true because then in reality they are true but 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.330
 in reality it may be possible 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.280
 we also did 15 minutes here 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.390
 we have peeled three steps 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.730
 allowed in the water 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.740
 we put in frozen water for 5 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.290
 minutes we put 10 minutes 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.120
 in the boiling water and more then it has 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.820
 had a 20 minute ride 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.500
 in the freezer these chips in ten 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.500
 minutes are absolutely ready 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.000
 ok it's been almost six minutes have 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:40.280
 a wonderful color so let's go to 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:42.520
 drain it a little bit the excess of 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.520
 oil 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:59.009
 salt to rain but courage pleasing 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.009
 to taste them that burn 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.630
 I feel good appetite
