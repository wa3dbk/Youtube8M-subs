 first before doing it in the 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.950
 video I have a lot of things to talk about 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.510
 with you first of all I have to 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.520
 explain why he had not been able to upload 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.410
 Video about four weeks ago of 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.759
 done almost the month we wanted from you 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.140
 that we were saying on the networks 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.480
 socially yes because I had not gone up 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.399
 video that yes that happened things like that is not 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.720
 worry, I'm fine, what happens is 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.550
 I had not been able to upload video because 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.809
 the previous weeks were not my 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.130
 best weeks 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.960
 in fact the worst weeks I've 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.120
 passed in my whole life because of problems 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.010
 family and that's why he did not 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.989
 platform when you see me in front of the 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.609
 camera that is because I really like that 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.230
 I feel at that moment I do not know if you 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.420
 they see me is excited if you see me 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.850
 screaming with joy is because I really 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.350
 that's how I am, because I'm happy that 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.019
 I am emotional and the previous weeks 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.460
 I really did not feel good at all and 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.589
 that's why I had not been able to upload 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.540
 video I hope you understand me as I already 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.820
 come in the number of subscribers if 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.950

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.610
 of subscribers up here we are already a thousand 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.610

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.300
 well let's make the mark 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.099
 and if I'm not wrong, it's like that 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:16.069
 I'm going to be appearing the name of 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.890
 this challenge this challenge is that here 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.560
 I have two containers 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.600
 recipient was a part of my face or 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.180
 be it either eyes of that cheek of 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.920
 wages the blah blah and in the other 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.870
 container is a product of 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.870
 makeup that has been correct 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.880
 shadow eyeliner and things like that now I'm going 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.980
 to go taking out a decade paper 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.560
 next and the joke is that it's a 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.360
 makeup too messy but 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.820
 Well, I hope it's my luck and let's go 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.580
 to watch this week's video 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.160
 to start in the first container I 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.980
 he touched concealer 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.200
 and in the second part good time with 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:58.260
 the badness the corrector that I use is 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.270
 this and we're going to today we're going to start 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.110
 apply it 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:06.270
 I do not play to win more know by the way 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.640
 you hear a lot of car noise and things 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.620
 so I bring the open mind or air 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.170
 conditioning does not work open the window 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.070
 for the same reason so that he does not hit me directly 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.370
 it's hot and well there's the truth 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.690
 we quite different eyeliner 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.820
 contour ok to declare that I the 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.310
 outlines I put them in this part of 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.410
 here they just do not put anyone 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.860
 things like that because I do not know how to outline 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.860
 face 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.800
 blush eyelashes good lashes the truth 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.800
 I do not know 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.080
 God, how fast is this bronze in the 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:58.300
 lips 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.300
 with the lips 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.950
 lipstick hate 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.770
 Dark circles or imperfections is seriously 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.180
 this one that is here is a rose my 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.180
 like pink lipsticks 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.770
 I saw once 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.689
 I once saw a video in which a lot 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.400
 people used a red line in the 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:32.129
 part of the dark circles that according to because 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.750
 it serves more at the time of them to 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:38.100
 remove this part more 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.100
 and you can not see 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.480
 good 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.169
 so the last one I do not know which expulsion 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.520
 and I know which ones were left to bernabÃ© 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.520
 on the cheeks 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:01.010
 the cheeks are removing 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.940
 with the pink so I will not use 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.980
 pretty colorful 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.410

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:20.029

 they had god of my life 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:31.330
 it may be I thought to live better 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.099
 because I put easy products I use 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.680
 as many processed products 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.389
 say that control should never make you 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.169
 analysis but you must face it
