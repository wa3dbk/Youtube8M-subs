clay and just

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.210 
clay and just
dome<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:06.560> make<00:01:07.560> sure<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> lid

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
fits nicely on the barrel part and then

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.679 
fits nicely on the barrel part and then
you<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.250> put<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.460> eye<00:01:11.520> pins<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
you can put the eye pins in so with the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.120 
you can put the eye pins in so with the
eye<00:01:12.720> pins<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.229> want<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.470> put<00:01:13.619> them<00:01:13.770> quite

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
eye pins you want to put them quite

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.560 
eye pins you want to put them quite
close<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.520> each<00:01:14.580> other<00:01:14.790> otherwise<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.360> jump

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
close to each other otherwise the jump

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.910 
close to each other otherwise the jump
ring<00:01:15.750> isn't<00:01:16.020> going<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> connect<00:01:16.500> very<00:01:16.710> well

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
ring isn't going to connect very well

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.249 
ring isn't going to connect very well
and<00:01:17.040> they<00:01:17.130> won't<00:01:17.310> open<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.640> close<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.600> here<00:01:19.020> is

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
and they won't open and close so here is

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.640 
and they won't open and close so here is
just<00:01:19.680> how<00:01:19.799> I've<00:01:20.009> placed<00:01:20.310> them<00:01:21.200> now<00:01:22.200> taking<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
this can get quite tricky and you could

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.540 
this can get quite tricky and you could
get<00:02:07.659> your<00:02:07.780> white<00:02:07.990> clay<00:02:08.200> dirty<00:02:08.440> but<00:02:08.770> as<00:02:09.009> you've

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
get your white clay dirty but as you've

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.309 
get your white clay dirty but as you've
seen<00:02:09.700> through<00:02:09.910> throughout<00:02:10.509> this<00:02:10.690> tutorial<00:02:11.200> I

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
seen through throughout this tutorial I

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.630 
seen through throughout this tutorial I
haven't<00:02:11.530> really<00:02:11.709> bothered<00:02:11.950> with<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.340> dust

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
haven't really bothered with the dust

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.030 
haven't really bothered with the dust
because<00:02:12.850> they'll<00:02:12.970> get<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.209> off<00:02:13.300> later<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:14.040> but

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
because they'll get it off later and but

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.910 
because they'll get it off later and but
if<00:02:15.250> you're<00:02:15.730> really<00:02:16.060> OCD<00:02:16.510> about<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.230> try<00:02:17.530> not<00:02:17.770> to

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
if you're really OCD about it try not to

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.770 
if you're really OCD about it try not to
get<00:02:18.040> too<00:02:18.100> dusty<00:02:18.550> but<00:02:18.819> like<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.060> said<00:02:19.270> we<00:02:19.569> can<00:02:19.720> get

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
get too dusty but like I said we can get

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.020 
get too dusty but like I said we can get
it<00:02:19.900> off<00:02:19.959> it<00:02:20.080> later

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
it off it later

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.490 
it off it later
now<00:02:22.030> just<00:02:22.330> flatten<00:02:22.630> out<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.840> piece<00:02:23.050> of<00:02:23.200> gray

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
now just flatten out a piece of gray

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.590 
now just flatten out a piece of gray
clay<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.069> you<00:02:24.640> can<00:02:24.850> design<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:25.300> how<00:02:25.390> if<00:02:25.450> you

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
clay and you can design it how if you

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.820 
clay and you can design it how if you
want<00:02:25.780> but<00:02:25.959> I'm<00:02:26.050> just<00:02:26.080> putting<00:02:26.230> three<00:02:26.530> buttons

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
want but I'm just putting three buttons

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.759 
want but I'm just putting three buttons
on<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.520> bottom<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:28.060> then<00:02:28.360> like<00:02:29.140> one<00:02:29.410> big<00:02:29.620> one

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
on the bottom and then like one big one

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.110 
on the bottom and then like one big one
at<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.010> top<00:02:30.220> pour<00:02:30.489> that<00:02:30.640> it's<00:02:30.790> going<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.030> be

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
at the top pour that it's going to be

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.880 
at the top pour that it's going to be
where<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.019> tells<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.410> how<00:02:32.560> long<00:02:32.739> you've

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.350 
where it tells you how long you've
cooked<00:02:33.070> it<00:02:33.220> for<00:02:33.459> or<00:02:33.610> how<00:02:33.700> long<00:02:33.880> you<00:02:33.970> need<00:02:34.120> to

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360
