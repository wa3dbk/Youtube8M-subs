again we're using carbon fiber slide the
cover<00:02:00.750> over<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:03.210> tighten<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.630> down<00:02:03.719> to

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
cover over it and tighten it down to

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.670 
cover over it and tighten it down to
torque<00:02:04.860> settings<00:02:05.189> which<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.549> think<00:02:06.060> are<00:02:06.240> again

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
torque settings which I think are again

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.830 
torque settings which I think are again
7.2<00:02:07.680> pounds<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:09.060> that'll<00:02:09.420> do<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.629> for<00:02:09.720> this

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
7.2 pounds and that'll do it for this

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.080 
7.2 pounds and that'll do it for this
little<00:02:09.989> mini<00:02:10.229> series<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.860> then<00:02:10.950> we'll<00:02:11.940> move

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
little mini series and then we'll move

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.980 
little mini series and then we'll move
on<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.480> couple<00:02:12.780> of

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
on to a couple of

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.510 
on to a couple of
things<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.470> we're<00:02:13.590> almost<00:02:13.830> done<00:02:14.190> with<00:02:14.400> the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
things and we're almost done with the

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.880 
things and we're almost done with the
