00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
what I'm trying to do I like 15 years

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.429 
what I'm trying to do I like 15 years
old<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.950> my<00:01:32.100> voice<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.430> actually<00:01:32.909> pretty<00:01:33.060> deep

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
old and my voice is actually pretty deep

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.620 
old and my voice is actually pretty deep
so<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.740> try<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.070> make<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.310> sound<00:01:35.610> higher<00:01:36.150> than<00:01:36.479> it

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.550 
so I try to make it sound higher than it
actually<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.310> because<00:01:39.229> somebody<00:01:40.229> gave<00:01:40.439> me

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
actually is because somebody gave me

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.730 
actually is because somebody gave me
some<00:01:40.799> advice<00:01:40.880> I<00:01:42.079> sounded<00:01:43.079> like<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.259> stone<00:01:43.560> or

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
some advice I sounded like a stone or

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.010 
some advice I sounded like a stone or
when<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.890> was<00:01:44.009> doing<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.280> commentary<00:01:44.700> once<00:01:45.060> so

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
when I was doing a commentary once so

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.170 
when I was doing a commentary once so
they<00:01:46.320> told<00:01:46.530> me<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.710> try<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> make<00:01:47.520> my<00:01:47.670> voice

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
they told me to try to make my voice

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.929 
they told me to try to make my voice
sound<00:01:48.619> not<00:01:49.619> as<00:01:49.770> deep<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.250> stuff<00:01:50.430> like<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.610> so
