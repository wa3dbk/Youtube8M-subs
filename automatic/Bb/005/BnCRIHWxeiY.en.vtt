00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.059
 and youtube greet these bamboos and 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.830
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.080
 new video on minecraft so this 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.559
 this time on the new channel the night 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.470
 work 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.210
 so it will be a trolling video so 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.660
 to troll your friends in servers 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.460
 multiplayer and so here on this 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.670
 new chain so that will be the chain 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.180
 of two months of dacca 32 and snow 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.379
 trail bester it's gone so first I 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.579
 will show you how to find your 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.659
 friends and then I'll talk about the chain 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.949
 so it's for those who discover 

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:42.670
 my videos I basically do 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.620
 diomine kraft when you have our 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.780
 gloucester and tenard he will differ 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.730
 finally they will do minecraft but also 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.170
 many other days is a little 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.179
 blocked for the power of my pc I 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.149
 can only do that for the moment 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:56.949
 so then you'll see the troll 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.280
 in celebration is to make disappear the 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.559
 roads 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.960
 that is, while you have to go 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.210
 to cook objects they go all 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.799
 just vanish do not go 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.159
 So here seem to many it is not a 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.730
 bug 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.080
 they really disappear but we 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.720
 since it's not funny and that ben 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.570
 can not be that they would 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.390
 really do not really say the source of the 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.720
 trap a stupid block and sealed ya not 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.480
 long time 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.190
 who is it or afraid and if not we do not 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.920
 would make a fear that will recover everything 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.540
 what is in the ovens 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.430
 it's really practical it can put 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.450
 Latin is train that could excuse me 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.580
 even be a system for optimizing 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.700
 cooking but there it is more for 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.740
 troll your friends there really really 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.970
 pique their almost their distant 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.729
 here I think you understood 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.909
 how to do how you want to play 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.439
 I you when you show the hop cap 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.189
 so in fact the system is that we are going 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.299
 to say that here and the oven are there and in 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.979
 that sense just do I just 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.789
 put to the heart what makes wolves 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.619
 of a time in 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.320
 you can even do after 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.880
 gave systems here are systems 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.520
 like this one that 's going to fall off the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.539
 valley here goes the wounded six and even 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.860
 do when it's a system that's 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.970
 to your house like that comment 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.280
 remy makes something escape in his 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.580
 oven and bah it comes directly from your 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.150
 coffers 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.580
 it's completely sadistic so that's it 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.380
 so that was for the point the little 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.720
 troll that it's always fun to 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.870
 do and now so for those who 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.269
 had come just for the troll hand 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.620
 you can finish here but for those 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.099
 that would have its shape is a bit on 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.590
 this string which is the net worth these 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.090
 night work is actually a chain that 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.450
 is going to be essentially devoted so 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.500
 your gaming tutorials or gameplay where 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.290
 anytime actually offered some 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.000
 all and all that so I'm not the 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.640

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.500

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.190

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.530

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.129

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.629

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.220

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.790
