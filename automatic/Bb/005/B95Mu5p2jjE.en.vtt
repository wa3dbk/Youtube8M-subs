00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.060
 four years ago some 16 year old schoolboy from haacht started with a 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.969
 home-made website how cool the ecb points 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.829
 if you register on the website you will get recession 4 2 in the pigeon below 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.359
 your guard must educate yourself to train and have the competition celebrated 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.800
 today a point b has also become a 4 2 nd pigeon sport south that the 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.619
 reality is approached very strongly that is at least the opinion of the 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.619
 most pigeon fanciers 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.170
 make the experienced pigeon fancier stef and get nutrition 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.190
 this is more than a few decades to get along they have three boys 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.190
 get these daily worries 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.040
 the motorsport setup between the fairs grows 365 days in the water 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.970
 guus we are obliged to come every day on that also to the animals 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.120
 give food 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.940
 To get that baker out of the eye cheese there is such a fair 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.640
 gent after that the day before back in helmond constant and a hundred wounded as 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.610
 you can do all of that maybe it is not possible 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.300
 also competitor of the NS 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.140
 because device is an interesting one 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.780
 Apeldoorn and Jonas answering the questions of visitors to the competition 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.340
 the two in their twenties have been busy for 4 years with a 4 star in the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.860
 own sports competition and in total they have already received 142,000 irons in that time 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.580
 In the end, we have a year to develop it 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.640
 Then have the site temporarily put online in a stream immediately a success 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.550
 wishes have never really advertised people that especially stated 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.730
 Land Registry 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.430
 in this way the battle is a very turning point up to the rankings 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.460
 the intention of the fight to do jaap young people mainly school students and 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.799
 students to immediately manage those ordinary shares 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.040
 but the most important thing 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.560
 the different parts 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.250
 we are all in the voices 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.430
 Click on it today conditions after the publication of a still not getting 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.680
 dynamic at the end you think you are not happening 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.300
 may be by people who will play with in the future 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.500
 the couple was closed since the first pigeon land and emerges 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:18.929
 it was actually a mistake to clean up droppings and the roc 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:22.719
 and perhaps of course with us the tension of the used 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.719
 wait until then they got through 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.409
 this allows the students to play back 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.969
 see you in the world and there was atomic weapon-free zone so just can 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.969
 nice not 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:47.559
 ruud people should be sacrificed it is rather the detailed out 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:51.659
 with which that is worked out I see it rather as a complementarity 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:57.029
 on the other hand i also think patting dempsey signed point sharing 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:59.059
 delinquent game 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:03.939
 that the opta through the air to the public is another audience to it 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.609
 audience that we also have 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.170
 at least stay the race but compete with your virtual 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.519
 colleagues like to go into therapy 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.209
 what a couple have to do 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.039
 although to which register and then once to some people on it 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:22.219
 minutes of play makes sense although there is a lot there can therefore just be a controller 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:25.589
 those men who can play with the rules although play we cannot 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:26.119
 place 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:27.029
 ridiculous
