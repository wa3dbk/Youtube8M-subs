00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
I felt the whole purpose of crash test

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.220 
I felt the whole purpose of crash test
dummies<00:01:01.650> was<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.280> they're<00:01:03.080> they're<00:01:04.080> not

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.230 
dummies was that they're they're not

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.990 
dummies was that they're they're not
alive<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.190> we<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.520> just<00:01:05.700> smash<00:01:05.940> them<00:01:06.240> up<00:01:06.390> so

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000
