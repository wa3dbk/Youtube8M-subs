 introduction and 360 degree view 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.279
 the sony alpha 7 is about 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.010
 the little sister model of the sony 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.210
 alpha 7 he visually let both 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.039
 models only the name too 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.630
 differing inside comes however 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.200
 partly different technology to 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.180
 commitment 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.320
 there is a bigger difference 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.570
 used image sensor 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.940
 he owns this at the alpha 7 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.440
 also small image size resolves with 24 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.230
 megapixel, however, significantly lower 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.019
 as the alpha 7 he's on it 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.910
 has sony on the 10 chip of the alpha 7 117 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.309
 Live directional pixel housed 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.539
 which the 25 contrast points at 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.610
 Sharpen focus 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.379
 the iso area drops both 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.719
 mirrorless system cameras the same 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.750
 iso 50 are at the bottom of the 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.820
 a maximum of iso 25.600 is available 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.809
 the regular image recording possible who 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.850
 the multi frame noise reduction 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.710
 uses the multiple images to one 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.140
 Recording can also be an iso 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.450
 Setting the value of 51,200 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.640
 during the series image recording saves the 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.770
 sony alpha 75 pictures per second 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.440
 there are up to 58 images in a row 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.770

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.549
 video recordings are created by sony alpha

 7 in full HD resolution up to 50

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.520
 for the sound recordings is a

 integrated stereomicrophone responsible 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.340
 An external microphone can also 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.470
 be connected 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.850
 with the integrated wlan can be 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.009
 transfer images wirelessly 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.090
 mobile device can the system camera but 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.299
 also be remotely controlled 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:50.350
 together with the sony R &amp; D 28 to 70 mm

 clock 7 167 grams on the scales pictures and 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.120

 place next to this introductory video 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.040
 we give you the camera in other videos 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.440
 detailed before 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.720
 in it, for example, you will learn more about it 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.080
 to equip the image stabilizer and
