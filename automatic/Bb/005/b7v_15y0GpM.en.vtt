an<00:00:28.140> even<00:00:28.320> affair<00:00:29.449> well<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.480> think<00:00:30.689> they<00:00:30.960> gotta

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
an even affair well I think they gotta

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.810 
an even affair well I think they gotta
be<00:00:32.300> it<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.540> not<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.079> easy<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.670> end

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
be it can be not so easy but in the end

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.729 
be it can be not so easy but in the end
of<00:00:36.000> 90<00:00:36.300> minutes<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.719> think<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.079> shuttle<00:00:37.500> will

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
of 90 minutes I think that shuttle will

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.400 
of 90 minutes I think that shuttle will
hand<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.160> top<00:00:38.600> it<00:00:39.600> was<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.840> tough<00:00:40.110> week<00:00:40.350> for

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
hand on top it was a tough week for

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.200 
hand on top it was a tough week for
Marina<00:00:40.890> because<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.489> lot<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.850> international

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
Marina because a lot of international

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.229 
Marina because a lot of international
players<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.350> team<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.100> he<00:00:44.489> gonna<00:00:45.059> have

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
players on that team so he gonna have

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.240 
players on that team so he gonna have
less<00:00:45.809> time<00:00:46.050> with<00:00:46.289> them<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.680> train<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.070> this

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
less time with them to train for this

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.049 
less time with them to train for this
game<00:00:47.719> and<00:00:48.719> also<00:00:49.079> he<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.980> think<00:00:50.309> he<00:00:50.430> gonna<00:00:50.789> be

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
game and also he I think he gonna be

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.330 
game and also he I think he gonna be
alright<00:00:51.270> thinking<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.289> Champions<00:00:53.160> League

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
alright thinking on the Champions League

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.240 
alright thinking on the Champions League
game<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.239> think<00:00:54.809> they<00:00:54.930> gonna<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.770> cautious

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
game so I think they gonna be cautious

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.410 
game so I think they gonna be cautious
an<00:00:56.430> unplanned<00:00:57.180> transition<00:00:58.879> yeah<00:00:59.879> do<00:01:00.329> you

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
an unplanned transition yeah do you

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
an unplanned transition yeah do you
think<00:01:00.510> though<00:01:00.840> then<00:01:01.079> Chelsea<00:01:01.350> Chelsea<00:01:01.590> price

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
think though then Chelsea Chelsea price

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.410 
think though then Chelsea Chelsea price
one<00:01:02.340> point<00:01:02.550> for<00:01:02.850> there<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.239> think<00:01:03.270> that's

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
one point for there do you think that's

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.399 
one point for there do you think that's
too<00:01:03.780> low<00:01:05.150> well<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.450> think<00:01:06.750> he's<00:01:07.080> firm

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
too low well I think he's firm

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.280 
too low well I think he's firm
unfortunately<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.939> would<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.110> more

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
unfortunately I would like to have more

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.649 
unfortunately I would like to have more
valid<00:01:10.770> at<00:01:10.920> one<00:01:11.729> point<00:01:11.909> seats<00:01:12.240> would<00:01:12.540> be

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
valid at one point seats would be

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.920 
valid at one point seats would be
perfect<00:01:13.110> but<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.650> think<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.640> bookies<00:01:15.030> they

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
perfect but I think that bookies they

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.810 
perfect but I think that bookies they
find<00:01:16.170> themselves<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:17.159> Chelsea's<00:01:17.610> on

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
find themselves because Chelsea's on

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.060 
find themselves because Chelsea's on
amazing<00:01:18.659> shape<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.310> one<00:01:20.310> point<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:22.070> yeah

time full time is priced 2.05 what do

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.440 
time full time is priced 2.05 what do
you<00:01:30.420> think<00:01:30.540> about<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:34.130> because<00:01:35.130> Chelsea<00:01:36.060> is

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
you think about that because Chelsea is

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.840 
you think about that because Chelsea is
much<00:01:37.110> stronger<00:01:37.439> than<00:01:37.560> been<00:01:38.159> Crystal<00:01:38.520> Palace

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
much stronger than been Crystal Palace

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.899 
much stronger than been Crystal Palace
but<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:41.070> always<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.840> bit<00:01:42.840> risky<00:01:43.049> especially

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
but it is always a bit risky especially

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.429 
but it is always a bit risky especially
on<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.970> week<00:01:45.270> where<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:45.899> had<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> lot<00:01:46.409> of

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
on a week where we had a lot of

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.700 
on a week where we had a lot of
international<00:01:46.920> nights<00:01:47.390> and<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.720> team<00:01:48.930> didn't

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
international nights and the team didn't

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.520 
international nights and the team didn't
have<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.070> same<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:51.180> same<00:01:51.420> training<00:01:51.689> as<00:01:52.290> in

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.950 
have the same the same training as in
other<00:01:52.680> weeks<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.189> prefer<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.729> pass<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.240> okay

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
